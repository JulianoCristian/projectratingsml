Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development and Global objectives (See Project Design Summary for key performance indicators):
The overall objective of the Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project (BPAP) is to contribute to the integrity of the Honduran
section of the Mesoarnerican Biological Corridor (MBC) through better conservation of biodiversity in core areas and more
sustainable use of biodiversity in the corridor buffer zones. This will be achieved by: (a) improved institutional capacity for
parks management niationally; (b) better and more participatory protection of selected protected areas (PAs); (c) support for
more benign natural resource management activities in the buffer areas; and (d) strengthening of natioal biological
monitoring capacity.



2
The project area (see IBRD Map 2885 1) includes eleven protected areas in four geographic groupings: Cordillera de
Nombre de Dios (Pico Bonito and Texiguat); Patuca-Tawahka (Patuca and Tawahka); Atlantida Wetlands (Cuero y
Salado, Punta Izopo, Punta Sal); and Mosquitia (Laguna de Caratasca, Rus-Rus, Wannta, and Mocor6n).
2. Project components (see Detailed Project Description and Estimated Project Costs for more information):

3. Benefits and target population:
An important benefit is conservation of biodiversity of global importance. Local communities in MBC will also directly
benefit fromn investments in buffer zones and in the PAs. National benefits will derive from overall strengthening of
institutional capacity to manage PAs. In addition, the project will foster development of the National System of Protected
Areas (SINAPH) as a destination for ecotourists which is expected to generate significant benefits for the Honduran
economy over the medium to long term.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Five years            Executing agency: AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS
Project coordination: The project will be carried out by AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS. In addition to a center of
operations in Tegucigalpa, regional operational centers will be located in Mocoron for the Mosquitia region, La Ceiba for
the Atlantic region, and Catacamas for the region of Olancho. Other than direct interventions in the PAs, most investments
under the project will be implemented by decentralized entities such as municipalities, NGOs, indigenous organizations, and
local communities, coordinated by AFE-COHDEFOR. Implementation will be closely coordinated with the Rural Land
Management Project (PAAR).
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): Project oversight will be responsibility of AFE-COHDEFOR, the Secretariat of
Natural Resources and the Environment (SERNA) and the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG). As joint
implementing agencies of this project, both UNDP and the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank)
will provide technical and financial supervision during implementation of the project.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements: AFE-COHDEFOR will be responsible for project financial
management, reporting, and auditing following procedures acceptable both to the Bank and to UNDP. UNDP will
administer the GEF grant funds through its Resident Mission in Honduras, and will be responsible for disbursements. The
financial management system to be maintained in AFE-COHDEFOR for the project will be consistent with that established
for the associated PAAR, which has been deemed to be satisfactory. The Project Coordination Unit for the BPAP will have
access to financial and audit reports to ensure complementarity of expenditures on activities included in both projects.
Project accounts will be audited annually, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to UNDP. The annual audit
report will be submitted to the Bank and to UNDP within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The project administration unit will establish project monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) procedures acceptable to both the Bank and to UNDP. These will build on procedures already in place under the
PAAR. Procedures and M&E reports will be guided by: (a) the Project Design Summary; and (b) the Monitoring Plan as
detailed in the Operational Manual. M&E is to be conducted through: (a) activities of the project administration unit; (b)
Bank/UNDP supervision missions; (c) supervision of the UNDP Resident Mission in Honduras; (d) annual progress review
during Bank/UNDP supervision missions not later than July 31 of each year starting in 1998; (d) Mid-term Review of
project implementation to be carried out jointly by GOH, the Bank, and UNDP; (e) periodic beneficiary assessments and
other special studies; and (f) analysis of the results of the Biological Monitoring Component and of monitoring data
available through the regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project. Quarterly, the project administration unit will



3
transmit to the Bank and UNDP progress reports on project implementation and outcomes, using the format agreed at
negotiations. An Implementation Completion Report will be prepared within six months after the closing of the grant.
The seven key indicators as listed in the Project Design Summary are:
* No discernible decline in core area forest cover from the baseline;
*  Management plans reflect consensus built at national, regional, and local levels around the concept of core and buffer
zones;
* DAPVS is more capable and willing to implement management plans;
* Increased knowledge and adoption of biodiversity-friendly land use alternatives by communities in the buffer zones;
* Increase in the number of beneficiaries in buffer zones that take an active role in protected areas management;
*  Establishment of the biodiversity monitoring database by 1998 and installation on computers of four regional offices
and central office;
* Demarcation of 350 kilometers of the core areas.

Specific areas in the CAS which this project addresses are: improving  August 1993 in cricuntion with Board discussion
natural resource management, including forestry; conserving biodiversity;  ofthe Agricual Sector Adstmat Credit
and gaining a consensus on priority areas.                      (AGSAC) (Credit 2450-HO)
GEF Operational Strategy/Program Objective addressed by the project:
Conservation of biodiversity of global imnportance within the Honduran parts of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
(MBC) with sustainable use of its components and fair and equitable sharing of its benefits.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector issues:
1. More than half of Honduras' forests have already been converted to other uses, with more than three quarters of the
loss occurring only in the last thirty years. Policy and legislation prior to the 1990s in the area of land and forest
management encouraged deforestation and poor soil and water management (more recently, the govermnent has begun to
pursue policies to implement a more balanced natural resource management strategy, by adopting a more decentralized and
participatory approach and strengthening the concerned sector institutions).
2. Inconsistently applied land reforn programs, combined with poor land registration systems, have led to tenure
insecurity and discouraged investment. This also contributes to uncontrolled occupation of national and municipal forest
lands for pasture and cultivation.
3. Honduras' protected areas system (SINAPH) is also fundamental to protection of biodiversity resources and consists
of 107 protected areas, representing 24 percent of the Honduran territory. However, as much as half of this area has
already been converted from natural forest to agricultural uses and very few areas receive adequate attention to foster
managernent or real protection against external pressures. The geographic distribution of the protected areas and the
patterns of management resource allocation are also not consistent with an overall goal of maximizing biodiversity
conservation within the protected area system.
4. The Protected Areas Departmnent in AFE-COHDEFOR was only created in 1991 and has only recently received
significant financing from the forestry agency. Staff are still too few, devolution of managemnent responsibilities to NGOs
and local govenmnent is still nascent, and most staff are poorly trained.



4
Government's strategy to address these sectoral concerns is focused at various levels:
Government is implementing a Rural Land Management Project (PAAR) with IDA-financing (Credit 2940-HO) which
will tackle the first two categories of sector issues mentioned above. PAAR builds on policy changes initiated through a
1992 Agricultural Modernization Law, which eliminated distorted agricultural policies, rationalized land and forest tenure,
and restructured land and forest agencies, taking government out of timber marketing, and elimina timber concessions,
and instituting a timber auction system in public lands. It also endorsed the SINAPH and AFE-COHDEFOR's
responsibility to put areas under active management. PAAR finances modernization of land registration, priority forest
managernent with local participation, strengthening of AFE-COHDEFOR, technical assistance to upland farmers and
forest producers, and strengthening selected protected area infrastructure to generate revenues to help sustain the SINAPH
over time.
. In regard to the third issue, internationally, Govermment is a signatory to the Central American Biodiversity
Convention and the International Convention on Biological Diversity. Regionally, Honduras is an active member of the
Central American Com mission on Environment and Development (CCAD) and is a signatory of the Alliance for
Sustainable Development (Alianza para el Desarrollo Sostenible), signed in 1994 by aU Central American heads of state.
Honduras is part of a regional , umbrella project for the protection of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) being
prepared by CCAD for GEF financing.
* Nationally, a draft Biodiversity Conservation Strategy has been prepared and will be finalized under a forthcoming
UNDP-implemented GEF enabling activities grant. The Natural Resources and Environment Secretariat (Secretaria de
Recursos Naturales y del Ambiente, SERNA) has formned a consultative body for biodiversity strategy decisions under the
National Environment Commission and which includes SERNA, the protected areas agency (DAPVS) in AFE-
COHDEFOR, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia, SAG), the Tourism
Institute, NGOs, and the private sector. GOH also has prepared PLANFOR, a national forestry action plan.
* Complementing these institutional initiatives, the Government of Honduras, with assistance from donors and
international development organizations, is financing many important conservation programs.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The BPAP complements the PAAR and the regional umbrella MBC project to address the third and fourth sector issues.
To address limited protected areas management, the project will finance participatory management and demarcation of
priority areas within the SINAPH, and buffer zone sustained use and development, cooperating with environmental NGOs,
local government, and indigenous and local communities. To address weak institutions, the project finances DAPVS staff
upgrading and in-service training and a training program for private and community organizations and NGOs involved in
sustainable use and biodiversity conservation in the project area. Complementary actions by PAAR will provide a means
to sustain the increased investment in the Honduran section of the MBC over time by creating a fund for protected areas
that can be replenished directly from revenues from the protected areas as well as through payments for environmental
services rendered in other sectors. In support of the large indigenous population in the project area, PAAR will help to
define land tenure and land rights and support culturally-sensitive development in the buffer zones.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The main objective of the project is to put in place measures to assure the conservation of the MBC in core areas over the
long-term. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection include: (a) covering more of the 22 priority protected areas,
rejected so as not to diffuse institutional capacity and because of complementary projects financed by bilateral donors; (b)
financing buffer zone activities throughout the project area, rejected in favor of concentrating efforts on the Mosquitia and
Tawakha where less NGO and donor financing was available; (c) depending on the regional project for biological
monitoring, rejected given the limited funds available and the need to develop the capacity for information management at
the local level; and (d) adjudicating indigenous land and forest rights in the protected areas, rejected since it would be best
addressed through Government's on-going titling program and by demarcating traditional use areas during core and buffer
zone demarcation.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
A reviewer from the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) roster of experts recommended consideration of the:
(a) Value of corridors to protect otherwise isolated islands of biodiversity; (b) Importance of incorporating local
communities and local governments into biodiversity conservation planning; (c) Need for financial mechanisms to fully
cover operational costs; and (d) Importance of institutional strengthening of agencies responsible for conservation. These
comments were incorporated into the project design.
11. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
Honduras is signatory to many regional and international biodiversity conventions which provide conceptual framework for
this project; the country is committed to key sector reforms. Willingness to borrow for these reforms through the PAAR is
an indication of commitment.



6
12. Value added of Bank and GEF support:
GEF support is warranted because of the global significance of the MBC and the need for incremental financing for its
long-term protection. The project is being jointly supported by both the Bank and UNDP, thereby drawing on the
comparative advantage of each institution and ensuring cooperation between regional and national programs. Value added
of Bank support lies in technical support for preparation, supervision capacity, and development of linkages with the
PAAR.

Analysis]
14. Financial Assessment (see Financial Summary):
Financial sustainability of SINAPH (generation of revenues and financial management) is key element of project concept.
Studies were carried out under BPAP and PAAR project preparation to evaluate feasibility of a Protected Areas Fund,
being established under the PAAR, to be partially endowed through revenues from protected areas investments. The studies
estimated potential revenue streams, anticipated tourism growth based on nature tourism, and analyzed alternative financial
funds structured. The Financial Summnary shows the anticipated financial stream based on the findings of the feasibility
studies.
15. Technical Assessment:
Notable technical issues dealt with during project preparation include the nature of appropriate investments in buffer zones
that balance both promotion of local community development and defense of biodiversity in core areas and buffer zones of
protected areas. Other issues include indigenous land tenure concerns, the balance of gender in project activities, and the
appropriateness of buffer zone activities. Appropriate type and levels of investments in protected areas were also
considered in depth in a number of background studies.
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: Weakness of AFE-COHDEFOR and DAPVS is of major concem. Project includes institutional
strengthening and intends to decentralize administration of some components to regional and local organizations. It will
complement activities of conservation NGOs in the Atlantic coast that are being financed by Fundaci6n VIDA, a Honduran
conservation foundation.
GEF implementing agencies. UNDP and the Bank will both serve as GEF implementing agencies, the first experience of
this kind in Latin America, using unified criteria for implementation to simplify the reporting and administrative procedures
of AFE-COHDEFOR and GOH.
Project management: The project will be managed by AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS. Three regional DAPVS field
offices will be strengthened in the project area, which will provide staff greater presence and outreach. Activities financed
under this project will be coordinated with activities being financed through the PAAR within AFE-COHDEFOR and
through the PAAR's Coordination Unit at the Miristerial level.
The project will support the creation of regional committees for protected areas management (Consejos Regionales de
Areas Protegidas, CORAPs) and local committees for protected areas management (Consejos Locales de Areas
Protegidas, COLAPs) which will coordinate training inputs at the regional and protected areas level, and the local
committees will also prioritize requests for buffer zone activities. Regional DAPVS offices and the CORAP/COLAP will
coordinate comnplementary activities funded by Fundaci6n VIDA. SERNA will take the lead on strategic issues related to
the SINAPH and will preside over the Council for Protected Areas, which is the institution with responsibility for priority
setting and financing strategies.
17. Social Assessment:
The social assessment included: (a) a natural resource analysis, with field data; (b) a gender analysis with field survey data
and a literature review; (c) an indigenous land tenure study; and (d) an analysis of indigenous issues. A Social Assessment,
Participation Plan, and an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan have been prepared (see Annex 2). The total indigenous



7
population affected by the project is approximately 78,000, including the Miskito, Pech, Tawahka, and Garifuna. The
social assessment analyzed the different patterns of land use and productive systems among the indigenous and non-
indigenous people living in the buffer zones and identified and assessed the capacity of conmmunity-based organizations and
NGOs. The role of women in biodiversity conservation was specifically addressed by a gender specialist during
preparation.
Land Tenure. For the indigenous peoples in the buffer zones, there are constraints to recognition of indigenous land and
forest rights. The legal study evaluated three options for indigenous land tenure titling: individual, communal, and usufruct
contract all of which are options in the Honduran legal framework. Based on the findings of the draft study, GOH has
decided to further evaluate these options and may opt to apply a blend of usufruct and communal title. In addition, an
ongoing Institutional Development Fund grant will strengthen the capacity of indigenous communities and organizations to
formulate proposals and document their land tenure claims. Regardless of the option selected, GOH is committed to
protecting traditional use rights.
Implementation Capacity. The existing capacity of the PAAR Project Coordination Unit to implement the participation plan
is limited. To address this, SAG will contract a specialist in social and participation issues who would coordinate with the
BPAP to incorporate these issues into project components, ensure implementation of the participation plan, and supervise
consultants contracted for specific studies or activities. Additional social science staff will be recruited into DAPVS who
will work with the promotional staff of AFE-COHDEFOR and NGO personnel.
Local Capacity. Existing community-based organizations and farmers groups lack the capacity to actively participate in the
local and regional committees for protected areas management. Training and capacity-building resources will be made
available to strengthen the capacity of members of the COLAPs, CORAPs, NGOs, and other organizations. Through the
process of participatory planning, management plans for the core and buffer zone areas will be developed and the
subprojects to be supported by the buffer zone fund will be developed and prioritized, and then endorsed by the committees.
Environmental education materials will be designed to promote broad participation in protected areas management.
Gender. Men and women have unequal access to land and agricultural and forestry production services, and different needs
for information and technologies. To address gender needs and opportunities, a program of gender training would be
designed and implemented for the agencies and NGOs involved in the project, and buffer zone activities will be targeted to
female producers and entrepreneurs.
18. Environmental Assessment: Environmental Category    []   A         [X1   B          [I  C
Minor impacts are possible from some infrastructure investments in protected areas and in buffer zones. The basic
screening and evaluation procedures of DAPVS, previously developed and analyzed in the context of PA investments to be
done under the PAAR, have been evaluated during preparation missions and are considered appropriate.

Note: Information Sharing (IS), Consultation (CON), and Collaboration (COL)
Project preparation included an analysis of the stakeholders in the land administration and natural resource sectors and
regional consultation workshops, carried out by a multi-disciplinary team, with representatives of stakeholders living in the
buffer zones of the protected areas of the project. A meeting was held with NGOs working with farmers and forest
producers in the buffer zone areas and there were consultations with the national indigenous confederation (CONPAH) and
representatives of indigenous and non-indigenous communities in the project areas. During project implementation, the
COLAPs and CORAPs will be the focus point for participatory involvement in decision-making and carrying out of
activities.

20. Sustainability:
Project sustainability will be promoted through: (a) improvement of the ability of local and national institutions to provide
technical assistance on sustainable land use and to address land tenure issues (primarily through the PAAR); (b) support for
a self-financing mechanism for the SINAPH, also to be supported primarily under PAAR, (c) increasing public support for
the protected areas and participation in their management, by working closely with many stakeholders; (d) institutional
strengthening; and (e) investments and conceptual support from the regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project
(UNDP-administered).

Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Strengthening of DAPVS and Local Capacity for PA Management - US$ 2.6 million
This component will: (a) strengthen DAPVS at national level but primarily at the field office and protected area
levels; (b) build local capacity for PA management through training and workshops for NGOs, local government, members
of the regional protected areas management committees (CORAPs), and members of the local protected areas management
committees (COLAPs); and (c) provide coordination support for project implementation. Financing will be provided for:
(a) development of in-service training courses and periodic in-depth courses for DAPVS staff; (b) curricula and courses for
regional committee members, NGOs involved in protected areas and buffer zone activities, and for staff of complementary
biodiversity projects in the project area; (c) demand-driven training and study tours or interactions among members of the
COLAPs, including comnunity-based organizations, productive organizations, indigenous organizations and federations,
and private sector stakeholders; and (d) a project coordinator, operational expenditures, monitoring and evaluation, and
special studies. In addition, funds will be provided for studies and consensus-building activities to complement the national
biodiversity strategy and improve the capacity for the development of management plans for core and buffer areas of the
SINAPH. The consensus-building will draw upon the information available from the ecosystems map that has been
prepared under the PAAR, which will assist in agreeing on priorities for protection and sustainable use.
Project Component 2 - Management of Globally Important Protected Areas - US$ 4.6 million
This component will finance: (a) management plans for the protected areas which are globally important and which
do not have complementary financing from other donors for elaboration of participatory management and operational plans;
(b) demarcation of core and buffer zones, with complementary delimitation of lands with indigenous property claims; (c)
construction of one visitor's center in the Atlantic zone to expand the potential to attract and manage tourists in one
protected area; (d) recruit personnel for protection of the protected areas; and (e) construction of park guard facilities in
each protected areas, including the acquisition and utilization of goods required to the operation of such facilities.
Project Component 3 - Improving Natural Resource Management in Buffer Zones - US$ 1.9 million
Tlhis component will finance buffer zone investments that are identified during the elaboration of the protected areas
management plans in the Mosquitia region (including Patuca-Tawahka, Caratasca, Warunta, Rus-Rus) that will be carried
out by groups of individuals within the communities in the buffer zones of the protected areas. Financing will be channeled
to groups selected by the COLAPs. Funds transferred will be approved by DAPVS. Subproject proposals that are not
identified through the management plan process, which are submitted by the COLAPs, can also be considered by DAPVS,
based on the no-objection of UNDP and the Bank. In parallel, residents of the buffer zones of all protected areas included
in the project will be eligible to submit proposals for technical assistance to the Upland Producers Fund through the PAAR.
Project Component 4 - Biological Monitoring - US$ 0.3 million
This component will establish a monitoring system to determine major changes in the status of biodiversity in the
corridor. Specifically, the project will finance: (a) installation of computer and software in four regional offices and at
headquarters; (b) purchase and interpretation of satellite images to generate a baseline and comparative analyses of the
project area; (c) 2 overflights and four field visits to project area; (c) collection and analysis of data derived from on-the-
ground surveillance by park guards and others; and (d) two annual workshops on monitoring.

Procurement and Disbursement Ariangements
Procurement
Procurement of works and goods financed by the Bank and UNDP under the project would be carried out in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised in
January and August 1996). Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training would be procured in
accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowe'rs and the World Bank as Executing
Agency (January 1997), consistent with the UNDP-Bank cost sharing agreement (February 1994). As applicable,
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would use the Bank-issued Standard Bidding Documents for the procurement of
goods and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be based on standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement would be undertaken by the Project Coordination Unit together with UNDP, as well as by
beneficiaries implementing subprojects.
Special Provisions. Additional special provisions have been specified in Schedule 3, Section III of the GEF Trust
Fund Grant Agreement regarding contracts, bids, and consultants.
Subgrants (Upland Fund) consist of packages of smnall civil works, goods, and technical assistance with an
expected average cost of approximately US$ 25,000. In order to encourage community participation in project execution,
and given the remote location of many rural communities, direct contracting may be permitted to implement subprojects up
to a maximum amount by subproject of US$ 10,000.
Consultant Services are expected to cost approximately US$ 1.3 million and would be procured in accordance
with the Bank's procedures for hiring of consultants (see Table A).
Bank prior review thresholds are shown in Table B. Annual procurement audits would be carried out to ensure
that the procurement procedures specified in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement and the operational manual for the
project are being followed. The annual procurement audits would be carried out by an external auditor contracted under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and UNDP.
Disbursements
Allocation of grant proceeds: Disbursements would be made against the categories of expenditures indicated in
Table C. The proceeds of the proposed Grant are expected to be disbursed over a period of five years. The project is
expected to be completed by July 31, 2002 and the Grant Closing Date would be January 31, 2003.
Use of Statements of Expenditures: UNDP will administer the GEF grant funds through its Resident Mission in
Honduras and will be responsible for disbursements. Disbursements would be made directly to UNDP and would function
similarly to a special account. An initial advance sufficient for expenditures of up to six months would be made and
subsequently replenished based on acceptable reporting of eligible expenditures made from the advance. Withdrawal
applications would be fully documents, except for expenditures under contracts for goods (other than vehicles) costing less
than US$ 150,000 equivalent, contracts for works costing less than US$ 500,000 equivalent, contracts for consulting firms
costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent, contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$ 25,000 equivalent,
training, salaries and operating costs, and subgrants. Supporting documentation for such expenditures would be retained by
the implementing agency and made available for auditors and Bank staff as requested.
Retroactive Financing: At negotiations, retroactive financing of up to US$ 700,000 equivalent (10 percent of the
Grant amount SDR 510,000) was reviewed and agreed for any eligible expenditures incurred after August 1, 1997 (but not
earlier than 12 months before Grant signing).

CONTEXT
Description of Sector
1.    Biological Diversity. Honduras is located in the middle of Central America between 13
and 16 degrees of north latitude. It has a territory of approximately 112,492 square kilometers
limited to the north by the Caribbean Sea, to the south by the Pacific Ocean, and bordering
Nicaragua in the east, and Guatemala and El Salvador in the west.
2.    Honduras is primarily mountainous with narrow coastal plains and several interior valleys.
Much of the land is above 30 percent slope with low soil fertility and erratic rain fall. More than
90 percent of the country is officially categorized as unsuitable for agriculture (forest vocation).
The subtropical climate of the country in combination with a wide range of variations in humidity
provide favorable habitat conditions for a high diversity of flora and fauna.
3.    The area of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) is irregular and characterized
by three wide classifications: the coastal plains (less than 150 meters above sea level), upland
areas (150-600 meters above sea level), and the mountainous highlands (greater than 600 meters
above sea level). The topography of the coastal plains is flat or slightly rolling with soft slopes.
The area contains mangroves, brackish and fresh water lagoons, coastal vegetation, and marshy
forests (periodically or permanently flooded with fresh water). Most of these areas are covered
with pine (Pinus car:baea), savanna palms and humid tropical forests with species like Bravaisia
integerrima, Salix humboldtiana, Andira inermis, etc. In addition, there are permanent wetlands
and mangroves along numerous creeks and lagoons that characterize the Caribbean coast.
4.    The temperatures vary by elevation. The coastal lands less than 500 meters above sea
level have an average annual temperature of 24 degrees centigrade while the mountains between
500 to 2000 meters above sea level vary from 16 to 24 degrees centigrade. The zones above
2000 meters above sea level have an average annual temperature of 15 degrees centigrade. The
sea influence, the abrupt topography, and the different types of soils have resulted in the joining of
a wide variety of ecosystems.
5.    As a result, Honduras has a rich biological diversity that, except for some pine savannas,
originally was almost entirely covered by several types of dense forests, varying from the dry
forests of the Pacific slopes to the rainy forests in the low lands of the Atlantic slopes. The
country contains the greater portions of five terrestrial ecoregions, as defined in a recent study by
the World Bank/World Wildlife Fund on the terrestrial ecoregions of Latin America and the
Caribbean. The ecoregions include: the dry forests of the Pacific in Central America; the forests
of pine-oak of Central America; mountain forests of Central America in high altitudes; humid
forests of the Atlantic region of Central America, and the pine forests in Mosquitia in the east.
The pine-oak forests and the mountain forests have a complex and discontinuous distribution,
which suggests highly rich endemic patterns, until today little studied. Both coasts of Honduras
are also characterized by diverse mangroves and ecosystems of humid areas and the coral reefs
are second in size and importance in Central America after those of Belize.



23
6.    These complex ecosystems support a wide variety of plants and animals. Animals in these
areas include, among others, the jaguar, white-tailed deer, ocelot, white-face monkeys,
jaguarundis, spider monkey, and howler monkey, etc. In addition, more than 375 species of birds
and nearly 200 species of amphibians and reptiles exist in these areas. Many of these species are
considered rare, threatened, or in danger of extinction, such as the harpy eagle, jaguar, and tapir,
etc. However, very little is known about the ecology and the resources of the zone. In a rapid
study in 1980, six percent of the inventoried plants were new for the flora of Honduras. Detailed
studies on fauna are scarce, but the information available indicates that the region is extremely
interesting faunistically.
7.    Of equal importance for habitat diversity is the fact that Honduras represents an important
link in the transition among plants and animals of the neoarctic and neotropical domains. The
humid tropical forest of the lowlands of southern Central America is restricted and discontinuous
in the north and east of Honduras and forms the first natural filter for the northern expansion of
the biota of the pluvial forest to the north of Panama.
8.    Socio-Economic Context. The economy of Honduras is relatively small and highly
influenced by the conditions of the international markets as a result of its dependence on a few
products for export, mainly coffee and bananas. There is a large foreign debt, estimated to be
US$ 4.3 billion in 1996. With a GNP of approximately US$ 3.5 billion and per capita income of
US$ 580/year, Honduras is one of the less developed and poorest countries in Latin America.
9.    Honduras has a highly skewed land distribution and a rapidly growing, primarily poor
population. Historically, the lack of other economic opportunities and the existence of a relatively
large frontier in the central and eastern part of the country have led to two types of frontier
expansion and land clearing. The first by elites in search of economic opportunities for cattle
raising and plantation crop establishment and the second by the poor in search of land for
subsistence agriculture. he impact on the forest was and continues to be devastating. The total
forested area has declined by 5.7 million hectares since colonization, with most of the losses in the
past 50 years. Pine forests have also become degraded. Increasingly, forest areas being cleared
are not suitable for agriculture or pasture production and water shortages are beginning to be a
problem.
10.   Poverty has a significant effect on households in rural areas headed by females and nearly
30 percent of the households in rural areas are headed by women (Woman and Employment
Module of the Household Survey, March 1993). It is estimated that nearly 15 percent of rural
households under the poverty line are headed by females and of the total number of female-headed
households, 66.7 percent are under the poverty line (SECPLAN/ILO/ FNUAP, 1990).
11.   The population of Honduras is young with a high economic dependence since many
households have a large nuclear family with parents, young children and unmarried adults. Under
these conditions, a biodiversity conservation project must work to harmonize the technical needs
of conservation with those of the population.
12.   Cultural and Demographic Context. The total indigenous population in the project area is
about 78,000 people. Four indigenous groups are found in the project area: the Pech, Garifunas,



24
Tawahkas and Miskitos. The Pechs are located in the eastern part of Honduras, between the
Garifunas and the Miskitos in the departments of Col6n and Norte de Olancho. Their population
is about 2,600 inhabitants. They are organized in the Federation of Pech Indigenous Tribes of
Honduras (Federaci6n de Tribus Indigenas Pech de Honduras, FETRIPH).
13.   The Tawahkas are the most isolated indigenous group in the country with about 900
inhabitants located in the communities of Krausirpe, Krautara, Yapuwas and Parawas on the
banks of the Patuca River in the department of Gracias a Dios. This area is in the center of the
biological corridor that runs from the Honduran Atlantic coast to the border with Nicaragua. The
Tawahkas speak their own language in addition to Miskito and Spanish. Since 1988, they have
been organized in the Tawahka Indigenous Federation of Honduras (Federaci6n Indigena
Tawahka de Honduras, FITH). They are also part of the RAICES Foundation, a private
development organization that supports the Tawahkas.
14.   The Miskitos are descendants of the native Indians, blacks and pirates and are all located
in the large department of Gracias a Dios in eastern Honduras. The population numbers around
49,000 with women making up 52 percent. They speak the Miskito language and, currently, they
are organized in a well-known indigenous confederation known as MASTA, made up of seven
different Miskito federations.
15.   The Garifunas are the most numerous indigenous community inside the project area and
the majority are located practically inside the Honduran biological corridor along the part of the
Atlantic coast from the Cabo Camar6n in the Plaplaya community in the department of Col6n
extending to the Gulf of Honduras on the border with Guatemala. The main communities are
located in the departments of Atlantida and Col6n. The Garifunas, of mixed African and
indigenous heritage, arrived in Honduras between the 18th and 19th centuries as refugees from
the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. They originally settled on the islands of Roatan and Bahia de
Trujillo. The total Garifuna population is estimated to be approximately 95,000 and 56 percent
are women. They possess a clear cultural identity and linguistic pattern. The most important
communities have an average of 5,000 inhabitants each and include: Tornabe, San Juan and
Truinfo de la Cruz in areas surrounding Punta Sal and Punta Izopo, near to the port city of Tela.
There are also communities in the municipalities of Iriona, Santa Fe and Trujillo in the
surrounding areas of the Capiro-Calentura-Guaimoreto Protected Area. Also in the Mosquitia
region, there is a community with a strong Garifuna presence known as Plaplaya.
16.   All the groups practice agriculture, dedicating themselves to the cultivation of yucca, rice,
corn, and plantain. Fruit trees, palms and medicinal and nutritive plants grow in family gardens
and in small agroforestry parcels. In all cases, parcel rotation is practiced and the fallow time (to
let the soil rest) is three to eight years (Miskitos), depending on the zone, the availability of lands
and the soils. This practice means that women must make arrangements to move often, each time
further away from their place of residence. Hunting and fishing are very important (above all for
the Garifunas, Tawahkas, and Miskitos). They clearly identify the importance of natural
resources for their own survival.
17.  In these indigenous groups, female participation in productive activities, gathering and
commercialization is very important. Men generally have responsibility for soil preparation,



25
slashing and burning, while the sowing, harvesting and storage of the agricultural products is for
the most part the responsibility of the women (for Miskitos). The women also participate in
gathering coconuts and they are in charge of collecting seeds from the forest and at times
participate in fishing together with the men (Tawahkas and Garifunas). Women also handle the
commercialization of most of the available agricultural surpluses and the sale of fish.
18.   Besides the practices mentioned above, the indigenous groups have been involved in
commercial activities to obtain other manufactured products. These groups extract wood, resins,
medicinal and edible plants, animals and animal skins to sell. They also sell lobsters, shrimp,
turtles, and fish.
19.   The indigenous groups of the zone are peaceful and tolerate the incursion of external users
of the resources of the zone (cattlemen, fishermen, hunters, lumbermen), generally reacting by
requesting authorities to apply the law to those that violate the legal regulations on the use of
natural resources, but not entering into confrontations.
20.   The traditional culture of non-indigenous people in the project area is shaped primarily by
a subsistence economy, a lack of basic social services, and few opportunities within the local rural
context for changing this situation. Politics are characterized by the continued dominance of
traditional regional leaders with caciquista or a paternalist style of domination. Most of the
ladino population have customs tied to mystic-supernatural superstitions or beliefs. There are
some recent changes in the local economy with more political action by producers organizations,
small but increasing numbers of export farmers with more sophisticated productive systems, and
the emergence of community organizations with a diversified clientele, cooperative groups, and
clubs. The majority of individual holdings are still less than 5 hectares. The expansion of electric
power, highways, and television have modified peasant culture, previously marked by isolation,
but it is now more similar to that of urban social groups.
21.   Overall, smallholder ladino farms in the project area are not significantly better off than
those of indigenous peoples. Due to their lack of access to or lack of knowledge about the use of
wild foods, they have less food security in general and, particularly in times of crisis. Sources of
ladino income include: products from their harvests, sale of animals and their byproducts, sale of
family property, income from seasonal work, and occasionally income from selling handicrafts or
small industries. The comparative advantage of non-indigenous over indigenous peoples is their
relatively better access to public services such as health, education, communications and other
services. At the same time, this means that they are more immersed in the market economy and in
a financial society which necessitates the availability of money which they are usually lacking.
Most ladinos live in permanent illiquidity, which some solve by felling trees and selling the
valuable wood and the cleared land to lumbermen and cattlemen. Few ladinos live in Mosquitia.
Those that do generally work in other activities, such as lending services and more recently in
commercial cattle raising. In the Tawahka area, a number of farmers are clearing forest for
pasture with the intention of selling it to newcomers. In the zone of Trujullo along the Atlantic
coast, the wetlands of the Atlantida and the Cordillera de Nombre de Dios, there is rapid
movement of the agricultural frontier. In many cases, producers fell the forest and convert the
areas to grasslands to sell to cattlemen or land buyers, and then they move to new forest areas and
repeat the process. Through this process, ladinos are advancing rapidly.

22.   The Project Area. The project area covers a surface area of approximately 1.5 million
hectares. It is a region that includes the largest areas of tropical forests and the greatest
biodiversity in the country according to studies carried out by the World Conservation Monitoring
Center. The region is in relatively intact condition and as a consequence, it is the area where the
Honduran section of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor extends, including the massive forests
of the Patuca, the Tawahka, the Rio Platano Biosphere, Mosquitia, the wetlands of Atlantida and
Cordillera de Nombre de Dios. Except for the Rio Platano Biosphere, all the other areas are
included in this project. The eleven protected areas include Pico Bonito, Texiguat, Patuca,
Tawahka, Cuero y Salado, Punta Izopo, Punta Sal, Laguna de Caratasca, Rus-Rus, Warunta, and
Mocor6n.
23.   The project area is made up of four ecoregions: extensive areas of mangroves; important
coastal-marine areas containing wetlands, lagoons, reefs and keys; pine savannas of the Mosquitia;
and extensive areas of humid tropical forest. The Mosquitia wetlands and the mangroves are
critical for the maintenance of the habitat of important threatened species or those in danger of
extinction such as, the manatee, crocodiles, caymen, turtles, and several species of migratory
birds. The pine savannas in the Mosquitia are considered unique. The humid tropical forests are
the most extensive and intact in all of Central America and they are under strong pressure from
agriculture and cattle raising, particularly in the western area of Mosquitia and in the southern
part of the department of Atlantida.
24.   The project area includes a total of sixteen municipalities, of which eight are located in the
department of Atlantida, one in the department of Colon, two in the department of Olancho and
five in the department of Gracias a Dios. In its entirety, the region contains approximately
350,000 inhabitants of which approximately 60 percent live in rural areas. The population is
concentrated in the department of Atlantida, particularly in the cities of Ceiba and Tela.
25.   The variety of ecosystems that the country possesses are reflected in the 8 zones of life
recognized by the Holdridge system, four of these are included in the project area: (a) the Dry
Subtropical Forests in the main valleys; (b) an important remnant of Humid Tropical Forests; (c)
Humid Subtropical Forests characterized by coniferous trees; and (d) Cloud Forests with quetzals
(Pharomacrus mocinno) and tapirs (Tapirus bairdii). At the moment, a classification and
ecosystem mapping is nearly finished that recognizes more than 30 terrestrial ecosystems and
more than 15 aquatic ecosystems.
26.   The project area includes all the main wetland areas of the country with mangroves, grassy
swamps, inundated forests, natural channels and coastal lagoons with high fishing productivity,
where crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), manatees (Trichechus manatus), aquatic migratory birds,
and other animals live. The rivers are important aquatic ecosystems due to the different levels of
flooding, limestone caves, etc. The project area includes 80 percent of the terrestrial ecosystems
of the country (see Table 1).

27.   Although the biodiversity in Honduras is among the least inventoried in Central America,
the few figures that are known illustrate that there is no doubt about its importance nor about the
degree of threats it is facing. The number of species of vascular plants has been estimated to be
5,000 of which 244 are endemic or their extension is restricted to the northern part of Central
America. The state of conservation of some of these species is considered to be "threatened."
The list of birds in the country includes 720 species, 59 of which are threatened at the national
level and 5 are in danger of extinction. The list of mammnals is 200 species including 19
threatened species and 8 in danger of extinction. Of the 187 species of reptiles registered in the
country, 15 of them are threatened and 4 are in danger of extinction. The list of amphibians
includes 89 species, 12 of which are threatened. The coral reefs that surround Las Islas de la
Bahia (The Bay Islands) and numerous keys in the Atlantic coast are of great global importance.
The wealth of terrestrial biodiversity in Honduras is comparable with that of Costa Rica, which is
recognized worldwide for its biological wealth. The marine biodiversity of Honduras is
comparable with that of Belize, which is well known at a global level.
28.   In the project area, the fauna is abundant. These areas support populations of threatened
species, those in danger of extinction, and species that require large areas to reproduce and feed.
These species are numerous: howler monkeys (Alouattapalliata), white-face monkeys (Cebus
capucinus), and red monkeys; (Ateles geoffroyi); the pumas (Felis concolor), jaguars (Panthera
onca), deer (Odocoileus virginianus), tapirs (Tapirus bairdii), peccaries (Tayassu peccary and TJ
tajacu), sloths (Bradypus variegatus) and agoutis (Agoutipaca). In the project area about 377
species of birds exist, among them, harpy eagles (Harpia harpyja), very close to extirpation;
guans (Penelope purpurascens), curassows (Crax rubra), the jabiru stork (Jabiru mycteria) and
the macaws (Ara macao and A. ambiguous). Animals in the rivers are abundant, with otters



28
(Lutra longicaudus), green iguanas (iguana iguana), river turtles (Rhinoclemmysfunerea), the
sabalos fish (Tarpon atlanticus) and bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas). In the coastal lagoons,
like Cuero y Salado, Caratasca, and Punta Sal, manatees (Trichechus manatus), caimans (Caiman
crocodilus), and crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) are abundant and there are diverse native and
migratory aquatic birds. Along the beaches, particularly in Mosquitia, three species of marine
turtles nest, the baula turtle (Coriaceous dermochelys), the caguama turtle (Caretta caretta) and
the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) as well as the tortoise (Eretmochelys imbricata).

HOST COUNTRY STRATEGY
National Environmental Policy Framework
29.   The GOH has developed a national environmental policy embodied in its National
Environmental Action Plan (PAAD) of 1992. In general, the policy seeks to protect the
environment and support management and sustainable development of the country's natural
resources. To address the main environmental problems identified--the loss of biodiversity from
deforestation, inadequate management of the protected areas and wildlife, erosion, degradation of
marine and coastal resources, and contamination of rivers and deposits of water--the PAAD
outlines five strategic programs:
(a) The creation of a mechanism for political and participatory consent: This mechanism should
allow for the incorporation of concepts of sustainable development in all productive activities.
(b) Legal and Institutional Strengthening: This strengthening should allow for the definition of
consistent and coordinated actions for the formulation, implementation and evaluation of
environmental policies and sustainable development.



29
(c) Implementation of an Environmental Education Program: This program should be
implemented at the formal and informal level, considering sustainable development in a wide
context so that it also contributes to a greater consciousness of society about their commitment to
the environment.
(d) Promotion and Adoption of Sustainable Agriculture: To prevent the degradation of soils and
provide services to drive the economy of the rural population, this strategy, like the following
one, suggests the necessity of a program to order to attack and overcome poverty. This program
will focus on those areas with the most environmental degradation, in light of the fact that
populations with the worst poverty indicators are also located in these areas..
(e) Improve the Urban Area in Relation to Poverty: The purpose of this program is stop the
deterioration of the urban areas and improve the conditions of the inhabitants in the cities,
especially the poorest. At the same time it will strengthen the productive capacity of the residents
of the cities.
At a sectoral level, the priorities and measures considered are:
(a) Soil Degradation: Establish policies and alternatives to discourage the expansion of agriculture
in inappropriate areas, provide technical assistance to limit soil erosion and regulate the use of
pesticides and fertilizers.
(b) Shortage of Water and Flooding: Develop price policies to support more efficient use of this
resource and at the same time, implement a master plan for the development of water resources.
(c) Contamination of Soil and Water: Develop effective control mechanisms, develop economic
incentives and at the same time disincentives to control contamination and support investments in
the treatment of drinking water.
(d) Biodiversitv: Improve the management of wild protected areas and consolidate a National
System of Protected Areas.
(e) Marine and Coastal Resources: Strict fulfillment of the environmental impact evaluations for
economic activities.
National Forest Policy Framework
30.   With the issuance of the Ley Forestal Decreto 85-72 (Forest Law) in 1972, the Honduran
State defined policy guidelines to manage forests under the concepts of sustained output and
multiple use, respecting private property, municipal and communal rights of indigenous groups
and local communities. In 1974, with the creation of the Honduran Corporation of Forest
development (Corporacidn Hondurena de Desarrollo Forestal, COHDEFOR) through the
Decreto Ley 103, the policy was modified substantially to nationalize the administration and
management of all the forests of the country under the responsibility of COHDEFOR, with
maintaining in force the principle of sustained output and multiple use and introducing the concept
of the Social Forestry System--forming groups of peasants dedicated to forest work.



30
31.  In 1992 with the issuance of the Ley de Modernizaci6n y Desarrollo del Sector Agricola
(Law for Modernization and Development of the Agricultural Sector) (LMDSA) Decreto 31-92
substantial changes were introduced in forest policy to devolve responsibility for management and
administration of the forest areas to their legitimate owners, be they private, ejido, or national. In
1991, with Decree 74-91, the Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) was
established within AFE-COHDEFOR and AFE-COHDEFOR was assigned the responsibility for
management and administration of the wild protected areas and the fauna, confirmed in the 1992
LMDSA law. Based on the LMDSA, the Government was able to structure an agricultural sector
policy, based on the concepts of opening markets and enhancing participation, integrating, for the
first time, a Public Agricultural Sector under the leadership of the Ministry of Natural Resources.
AFE-COHDEFOR was integrated into this concept with responsibility for the forest sub-sector.
32.   Prior to the 1990s, the policy and legislation in the area of land and forest management
supported deforestation and the poor management of soils and water. Agrarian Reform Programs
which were applied inconsistently, combined with unreliable land registration led to the insecurity
of land tenure and contributed to the uncontrolled occupation of forests. The LMDSA abolished
agriculture and livestock subsides, rationalized the responsible agencies in the sector, created
positive incentives for forest management in private, municipal, and public lands and changed the
regulating framework for management plans. The principles of the law are essential to support
socially and environmentally sound growth in rural areas and raise consciousness on the potential
benefits of the forest sector.
33.  In 1987 with the issuance of the Ley de Bosques Nublados Decreto 87-87 (Cloud Forests
Law), a new aspect of conservation was added that recognized the watershed value of these
forests. Since the concomitant declaration of 107 protected areas was not within an overall policy
context, this did not lead to a clear strategy for biodiversity conservation.
34.   The Ley General del Ambiente Decreto 104-93 (General Law of the Environment), issued
in 1993, creates the Secretariat of the Environment (SEDA) with normative and coordination
functions for the environment. This same law created the National System of Protected Areas
Honduras (SINAPH), comprising different categories of existing protected areas in the country.
At the same time, and with the purpose of operationalizing SINAPH, the National Council of
Protected Areas of Honduras (CONAPH) was formed, consisting of several government
institutions, NGOs and municipalities as representatives of civil society.
35.   The current management of AFE-COHDEFOR has recently elaborated a Long-Term
Forest Action Plan (PLANFOR) with the following guidelines:
(a) The forest should benefit both the national economy and local populations by effectively
incorporating local people in production and conservation of public forests, improving private
forest development, and paying attention to indigenous peoples, women, and youth.
(b) The dialogue between communities, local governments, and the industrial sector should
support participatory action guaranteeing that benefits from forestry contribute to living standard
improvements around the forested areas.



31
(c) Balanced forest development will meet industrial and commercial needs while maximizing
economic, ecological, and social functions of the forest.
(d) Forest plans should integrate private, national, and municipal forest areas within one master
plan strategy.
(e) Social forestry cooperatives should be encouraged to form and grow from the management of
municipal and public forest blocks to maximize local employment and protect the resource base.
(f) All sizes of forest processing and product manufacturing enterprises should be encouraged to
add value to forest utilization and expand employment opportunities.
(g) The full range of environmental goods and services generated by forests should be recognized,
including biological values and the economics of nature and ecotourism.
(h) A protected areas system should be supported to preserve representative ecosystems, and be
incorporated with sustainable use of adjacent areas.
(i) AFE-COHDEFOR should be strengthened at a local level, with complementary improvement
of the effectiveness and transparency of forest regulation and enforcement.
Although this group of laws and policies has advanced the integration of production and
conservation policies, these have not yet led to the desired institutional development.
PRIOR AND ONGOING ASSISTANCE
36.   Most international cooperation has been channeled through the Secretariat of Agriculture
and Livestock (SAG), the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA) and AFE-
COHDEFOR. Organizations such as IJNDP, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN
(FAO), Finnish Cooperation (FINNIDA), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),
the European Union (EU), German Cooperation (GTZ), the World Food Program (WFP),
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), British Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), and the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE), etc.,
have been assisting government institutions to improve their administrative capacity, to carry out
policy studies, and to test pilot approaches, often with strong NGO inputs on a local scale. A
summary of the organizations and the projects they are supporting are listed in Table 3.

37.    It is important to note that the projects mentioned in Table 3 are focused on sustainable
use of natural resources. Despite the extensive international assistance, until now, only a limited
amount of the total financing available has been targeted to conservation activities directly.
Recently, a number of projects have been approved that attempt to place more emphasis on
conservation, although these projects still include a majority of financing for rural development
related initiatives. These include: the regional USAID-financed PROARCA project that supports
protected areas in Honduras and through Central America, executed through NGO consortiums
and local NGOs, the Fundaci6n VIDA-financed activities by NGOs in the protected areas, the
Conservation and Forest Development Project of the Rio Platano financed by German
Cooperation (GTZ), and the Bay Islands Environmental Management Project, financed by IDB,
which includes protected areas management as well as municipal environmental development.
The new phase of the Broadleaf Project (PBDL) increasingly focuses on financing buffer zone
activities in the protected areas in its area of influence along the Atlantic coast. Japanese
financing is being finalized for fisheries management in the wetlands of the Mosquitia, with a
component on integrated wetlands management. Small amounts of financing are also available
through European donors for the Atlantic Coast, cloud forests, and mangrove areas of the Gulf of
Fonseca.
38.    One of the objectives of the social assessment of the project, carried out during project
preparation, was to learn about the different non-governmental and private development
organizations working in the protected areas of the project. In the four groups of project protected
areas, a number of NGOs are present that work with indigenous organizations, communities and
ladinos to provide community development assistance and capacity building. Some of the NGOs with



35
more national coverage have begun to work with first and second-tier producer and community-based
organizations to develop their capacity to deliver development assistance. The unique feature of the
more successful NGOs is the use of a farmer-to-farmer extension methodology, whereby interested
farmers are trained in the basic principles of a new practice and encouraged to experiment in adapting
the practice to their own farm and to transfer the knowledge of basic principles to other interested
farmers.
39.   Additionally, a number of NGOs are implementing programs that promote upland
technologies for sustainable use, based on extension methodologies developed originally by World
Neighbors, an international NGO with a local base in Honduras. Perhaps thirty NGOs in
Honduras are involved in upland rural development and technology transfer programs, some of
which rely heavily on international cooperation and farmer subsidies, and others, like World
Neighbors, on technical assistance designed to build farmer self-reliance from the start. A
summary of the organizations and the projects they are supporting are listed in Table 4

Relationship with the Rural Land Management Project
40.   The integrated program of the Rural Land Management Project/Biodiversity in Priority
Areas Project (BPAP) has as an overall objective, the conservation and sustainable use of
Honduras' natural resources and biodiversity. In addition to benefits for local communities and
the national economy, the resource management investments are intended to protect biodiversity
by slowing the advance of the agricultural frontier by stabilizing communities in buffer areas and
creating incentives for protection of the resource base. To achieve these objectives, the integrated
program has six components: Land Administration Modernization, Natural Resources
Management (Biodiversity Conservation Component), Institutional Strengthening, Strengthening
Protected Areas, Biological Monitoring, and Project Coordination. The integrated program is
complemented by an IDF grant of approximately US$ 183,000 for capacity building of indigenous
organizations for land and resource management.
41.   The two main components of the Rural Land Management Project are as follows. The
Land Administration Modernization Component would test and install a land administration
modernization system based on folio real (a parcel-based system in which physical cadastral
information is overlaid with a consistent legal register of that parcel), focusing on the
Departments of Comayagua, Cort6s, Yoro, Olancho and Francisco de Morazan. These
departments have the greatest potential for agricultural and forest sector development, and also
experience a high incidence of land conflict. The Natural Resources Management Component
would be implemented in priority public forest blocks and protected areas with ecosystems
important to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Activities include: (a) forest management
with local participation; (b) improved upland agriculture and forestry through building capacity in
producers organizations and NGOs; and (c) management of key protected areas and the design of
strategies for self-financing in the protected areas system.
42.   It is expected that the investments in the Rural Land Management Project biodiversity
component will begin in the fourth semester of 1997. The payments under the BPAP are
programmed to begin tentatively in the first trimester of 1998. It is hoped that this adjustment of
investments will support the success of the BPAP since a number of key activities are within the
Rural Land Management Project. This includes: institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock and AFE-COHDEFOR, execution of a self-financing mechanism for
SINAPH, and contracting additional personnel. The bilateral donors with complementary
projects in protected areas will be coordinating their activities with the National Biodiversity
Strategy. Therefore, the BPAP would play the role in particular of helping GOH to coordinate
such activities and strategies in the protected areas.
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
Main Implementing Agencies
43.   There are four main government actors that are pertinent to the implementation of the
BPAP: SERNA, SAG, AFE-COHDEFOR (DAPVS), and the Honduran Institute of Tourism
(IHT). The relevant functions of these entities have recently changed with the passage in 1996 of



37
the public administrative reform law (Decree 218-96) which created the Secretariat of Natural
Resources and the Environment (SERNA, formerly SEDA y SRN) and revised the functions of
the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG, formerly SRN).
44.   To provide adequate coordination of the BPAP among the Government and non-
governmental agencies involved, a steering committee will be designated to support project
implementation. The committee will be made up of representatives from AFE-COHDEFOR,
SERNA, SAG, NGOs working in the project areas, local governments, and community-based
organizations including indigenous organizations, and the World Bank and UNDP as observers.
45.   SERNA. SERNA was created in 1993 (then called SEDA) under the Environmental
Law, to function as a small regulatory and policy making secretariat. In 1996 it was transformed
to a larger ministry which incorporates coordination of water resources and non-renewable energy
in addition to the original regulatory functions. Under this new institutional framework and
through Decree 008-97, the General Biodiversity Department in the regulatory Subsecretariat of
SERNA will coordinate and promote activities at the national and local levels to conserve
biodiversity in coordination with DAPVS and according to decisions taken by CONAPH.
46.   SAG. The SAG remains the lead government institution for agriculture and forest sector
policy and action. The SAG is comprised of. (a) the Economic Policy Unit (UPEG), a planning
and policy cell; (b) the State Forestry Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR), a semi autonomous forestry
agency; (c) the National Agrarian Institute (INA) which adjudicates rights according to the law in
rural lands; (d) the Directorate for Agricultural Science and Technology (DICTA) that finances
privatized extension and research through the Upland Fund; (e) a phyto-sanitary directorate and
(f) the Department of Rural Development (DDR), a small directorate which has yet to be given a
clear mandate or work programme.
47.   AFE-COHDEFOR. This agency continues to have executive responsibility for the
SINAPH through DAPVS. The administrative change has created a situation in which SAG
coordinates agricultural sector policies and SERNA coordinates environmental sector policies,
with AFE-COHDEFOR guided by both and its own executive norms.
48.   There are five units within AFE-COHDEFOR that provide information about natural
resources: a statistics department, an information unit, a GIS-based forest information unit in the
town of Siguatepeque (financed through a German Cooperation Agency (GTZ) project called
SIFOR), a GIS information unit in the La Ceiba office, and a small GIS unit with little capacity in
AFE-COHDEFOR's main office. SIFOR has developed a change detection methodology and has
a laboratory for remote sensing analysis and computer digitalization. There are also several
investigation projects in the country. These include: the Forest Conservation Project
(CONSEFORH) financed by the British Government, which is currently carrying out research on
the dry forest (it had previously carried out research on cloudy and coniferous forests); the
Broadleaf Project mentioned earlier (PDBL), which has developed valuable experiences in the
management of the broadleaf forest, establishment of a germplasm bank and agroforestry
activities in buffer zones; and the Department of Biology of the National Autonomous University
of Honduras (UNAH) that, although it does not have a specific research program in protected



38
areas, carries out several efforts in this area with students and professors in several protected
areas in the country.
49.  In marine ecosystems, the Smithsonian Institution assists GOH with research and
monitoring of natural resources in the Cayos Cochinos island and is in the process of building and
establishing a biological station for research in the area.
50. The Protected Areas and Wildlife Department (DAPVS). By law AFE-COHDEFOR
through DAPVS is responsible for administering the protected areas and flora and fauna of the
country, in collaboration with other public agencies and environmental and development NGOs
and community-based organizations. AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS is also responsible for
norms and controls to regulate management of these areas within the policies and strategies
defined by the Secretariat of Natural Resources and the Environment (SERNA) through General
Directorate of Biodiversity (DIIBIO) and CONAPH. At a central level, DAPVS focuses on
carrying out normative functions through two administrative units: (a) Protected Areas Section--
whose functions include the protected areas management, the legal status, delimitation,
protection, coordination and consolidation of SINAPH; and (b) Wildlife Section--whose main
functions include the norms on the use and management of fauna and wild flora, scientific
investigation and the implementation of the International Convention on Threatened Flora and
Fauna Species (CITES). DAPVS, within AFE-COHDEFOR has only barely begun to receive the
needed budgetary allocation to fulfill its assigned function of operating the SINAPH.
51.   Regionally, DAPVS is located within the regional offices of AFE-COHDEFOR which
have a protected areas unit to coordinate work at local and regional levels with the geographical
management units. DAPVS currently only has a staff of 60, of which only 15 are posted outside
Tegucigalpa. Prior to the transfer of DAPVS to AFE-COHDEFOR in 1991, little attention was
paid to the SINAPH administration. Some progress has been made, but without considerable
capacity-building of AFE-COHDEFOR, including adding staff to DAPVS with other
qualifications besides forestry and providing regional offices with more independence and more
support, the agency cannot deliver its mandated services. SERNA has the responsibility for broad
policies related to biodiversity development, including international conventions and the national
biodiversity strategy.
52.   The National Protected Areas System of Honduras (SINAPH). There are 107 protected
areas identified in Honduras representing 24 percent of the national territory and covering nearly
2.5 million hectares. They are organized into the National System of Protected Areas of
Honduras (SINAPH). However, due to diverse pressures, it is estimated that more than half of
the protected area has been converted to agriculture or pasture land.
53.   There are nine management or administrative categories in the SINAPH. Many of the
high-value protected areas in SINAPH are located in zones sparsely inhabited compared to the
rest of the country (for example, the departments of Col6n, Gracias a Dios and Olancho). They
are also home to a significant percentage of the indigenous population of the country, such as
Garifunas, Miskitos, Tawahkas and Pech. These areas are under increasing pressure from
invasion of poor migrants and opportunists. Very few protected areas benefit from appropriate
management or true protection. There are also gaps in the coverage of representative



39
ecosystems, with overrepresentation of some ecosystems, lack of inclusion of others, and
management categories that are not consistent with the biological values of the particular area or
the system as a whole. Currently, only 25 protected areas receive, through AFE-COHDEFOR
(DAPVS) and NGOs, some management and support for conservation of their values and
attractions.
54.   Honduran Institute of Tourism (IHT). An important agency outside the sector which
will be an actor in project implementation is the Honduran Institute of Tourism (IHT), a
decentralized entity in the Secretariat of Governance created in 1993. The funndamental laws that
govern the operations of this institution are the Ley del Instituto Hondureno de Turismo Decreto
103-93 (Honduran Institute of Tourism Law) and Ley de Zonificacion Turistica Decreto 986-80
(the Tourist Zoning Law).
55.   The main functions and attributions that the law confers on IHT are related to the
implementation of the tourist policy for the country and creating and controlling the conditions
that permit the development of this activity. Their relationship with the protected areas
management concerns the potential that these natural spaces have for the development of tourism.
HIT has established priority tourism zones where the important protected areas are located.
These have high tourism potential but they have not yet been developed.
56.   Local NGOs and Community-Based Organizations in the Project Area. A rapid
increase in the number of NGOs in Honduras began approximately 20 years ago, with the largest
increase occurring over the period of economic structural adjustment policies, starting in the
1980s. Currently, about 300 NGOs exist, both with and without legal status. The Federation of
Private Development Organizations of Honduras (FOPRIDEH) includes 89 Honduran NGOs. In
the area of influence of the project, several NGOs have a considerable presence and capacity in
the protected areas, and will be key players in the implementation of the project in their selected
area of operation.
57.  In addition to the NGOs, there are a number of community based organizations that are
important. The Garifuna have two indigenous federations, each representing individual
communities and their chosen leaders: ODECO and OFRANEIT. Both are relatively recent
political entities and have been strong in implementing specific programs financed by the
Government or NGOs in the social services sector and micro enterprise. The individual
communities are also beginning to organize to develop their own identity separate from the
federations.
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Problems to be Addressed by the Project
58.   More than half of Honduras' forests have already been converted to other uses. Policy
and legislation prior to the 1990s in the area of land and forest management encouraged
deforestation and poor soil and water management. More recently, the government has begun to
pursue policies to implement a more balanced natural resource management strategy, by adopting



40
a more decentralized and participatory approach and strengthening the concerned sector
institutions. The main problems causing biodiversity loss in the project area are: (a) encroachment
into pristine areas of ecosystems by the agricultural frontier; (b) degradation of pine forests from
poor management; (c) pollution and urban development in the watersheds and marine areas of
important ecosystems; and (d) the lack of an agreed national strategy or civil society consensus on
the values of the corridor. The root causes of this situation are: (a) insufficient social and
economic valuation of biodiversity; (b) lack of defined tenure rights and reliable systems to
register those rights; (c) poverty in the western and central areas of the country which encourages
migration to the agricultural frontier; (d) weak institutions at the national level and in civil society
at the level of the protected areas; (e) lack of information about the environmental values of the
corridor areas that need to be preserved; and (f) lack of legal protection of core and buffer areas
due to lack of demarcation efforts and the non-existence of local staff for vigilance and
management activities. Inconsistently applied land reform programs, combined with poor land
registration systems, have led to tenure insecurity and discouraged investment.
59.   Honduras' protected areas system (SINAPH) consists of 107 protected areas, representing
24 percent of the Honduran territory, however, as much as half of this area has already been
converted from natural forest to agricultural uses and very few areas receive adequate attention to
foster management or real protection against external pressures. The Protected Areas
Department in AFE-COHDEFOR was only created in 1991 and has only recently received
significant financing from the forestry agency. Staff are still too few, devolution of management
responsibilities to NGOs and local government is still nascent, and most staff are poorly trained.
Expected End of Project Situation
60.   Upon concluding the project the following results will have been achieved:
(a) AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS will have the legal capacity and technical and operational
expertise to coordinate SINAPH in a coherent and participatory manner.
(b) There will be a tourism development program in the Cordillera Nombre de Dios, specifically in
Pico Bonito. This program will have cultural tourism and scientific and adventure components.
This program will benefit the surrounding communities with alternative sources of income, that in
turn, will generate resources for the trust fund that will finance the key protected areas of
SINAPH.
(c) There will be institutional strengthening at different levels including the central and local
governments and the local or regional environmental NGOs working in the protected areas and
buffer zones of the project. These organizations will be strengthened in the areas of organization
and self-management so that they are able to participate actively in the process of protected areas
management, including preparation of the local committees for protected areas management
(COLAPs) and regional committees for protected areas management (CORAPs).
(d) The protected areas in BPAP will be physically demarcated in the most critical sections.
(e) Each protected area of the project will have their respective operational plan.



41
(f) All the protected areas of the project will have their respective park guard huts and multiple-
use centers. In addition, Pico Bonito will have a visitors center.
(g) Three regional DAPVS field offices (La Ceiba in Atlantic region, Mocoron in Mosquitia, and
Catacamas in Olancho) for SINAPH execution will be strengthened and working efficiently.
(h) Park guards and field personal will be hired and they will be working in the protected areas of
the project, assuring an appropriate presence of DAPVS with respect to the management of each
area.
(i) The communities in the buffer zones of the protected areas of the project will be trained in
appropriate technologies and greater income-generating productivity, including transfer of
successful experiences.
(j) Financial assistance will be transferred to the communities so that they will have the investment
capital necessary to put in practice the appropriate technologies supported by the project.
(k) Environmental education will be incorporated in the curriculum of the primary schools in the
buffer zones, and the communities will have participated in practical and theoretical educational
activities, resulting in a better understanding of the value of natural resources.
(1) The local committees for protected areas management (COLAPs) will be formed and in
operation to coordinate the management efforts and actions in protected areas. These
committees, made up by the mayor's office, NGOs, public and private institutions and
organizations, will be participating directly in the management decisions of the areas they are
responsible for.
(m) In addition, these committees will work in coordination with the park guards and technical
personnel of the corresponding protected area and be involved in the maintenance of borders,
demarcation, surveillance and protection of the area, as well as other activities in the operational
plan.
(n) A system of biological monitoring inside the key protected areas and Honduran part of the
biological corridor will be installed and working. This monitoring system will be coordinated with
the Center of Forestry Evaluation and Information (CIEF) of AFE-COHDEFOR, information
systems in SERNA, and with the monitoring system of the Regional MBC Project.
61.   It was originally anticipated that this project would finance consultation, information
dissemination and special studies to support the draft National Biodiversity Strategy. However,
the Government of Honduras decided that it would be more effective to carry out these activities
under a separate but coordinated strategy financed as an Enabling Activity and implemented
through UNDP. It is important to note that the project sites selected have already been identified
as priority areas and have received broad endorsement regarding their national, sub-regional and
global significance.



42
Target Beneficiaries
62.   The Incremental Cost Analysis presented in Annex 9 of the Technical Annexes provides a
break down of the national and global benefits of the project
63.   Direct Beneficiaries. The population that will benefit directly from the project is located
inside the buffer zones of the project protected areas and it is estimated to be approximately
150,000 inhabitants. There are different indigenous groups, the majority pertaining to the Pech,
Tawahkas, Miskitos and Garifunas and the ladinos which are a minority group inside the project
area.
64.   The direct beneficiaries will be involved in the implementation of the project activities.
They will benefit from biodiversity conservation with respect for their traditional customs, the
development of sustainable practices, the training activities that are developed, the establishment
of special funds for financing, the development of small and medium rural enterprises, support to
community organizations, the development of tourism activities, and the conservation of their
living environment.
65.   Indirect Beneficiaries. The inhabitants of the cities and urban centers located in the area
of influence of the project will benefit through the conservation of water. They will also benefit
from environmental education and improved access to the protected areas of the project.
66.   The government agencies and the local and national environmental and development
NGOs that are linked to the project will receive benefits through the support they will receive to
improve their management capacity and through participation in policy dialogues.
67.   The entire Honduran society will benefit from the cultural and spiritual opportunities that
the well managed, conserved and accessible protected areas will provide at a relatively low cost.
In addition, through the improved conditions for tourism, opportunities for employment will be
created, increasing the supply of foreign currencies.
68.   At a global level, the project will contribute to biodiversity conservation and important
genetic banks. It will support the regulation of climate change through the appropriate
conservation of extensive protected areas that conserve important genetic resources and retain
large amounts of carbon and other components that reduce the greenhouse effect.
PROJECT STRATEGY
International Strategy
69.   As part of its strategies to increase national development, Honduras has decided to
participate actively in the initiatives and actions related to the environment and sustainable
development that are being carried out at the global and at the Central American region level.
Honduras is a signatory of the Montreal Protocol, the International Convention on Threatened

Flora and Fauna Species (CITES), the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the ILO
Convention on Indigenous Peoples Rights, among others.
70.   At the Central American level, Honduras is part of the Central American Commission of
Environment and Development (CCAD), which aims to assist and guide the institutions and
national authorities in the formulation and planning of policies, strategies and mechanisms that
support sustainable development and the conservation of natural resources of the Central
American region. CCAD is made up of representatives of the highest authorities from the
environment and natural resources sectors of each country. Honduras is represented by the
Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA).
71.  In 1992, CCAD in coordination with the Central American Council of Forests and
Protected Areas (CCAB-AP) and with support from several organizations and regional projects,
elaborated the Central American Agenda on Environment and Development and they have defined
a series of priority actions for the sustainable management of natural resources, which are being
pursued through the national institutions.
72.   On October 12, 1994 the Presidents of the region subscribed to the Sustainable
Development Alliance (ALIDES). The Government of Honduras, following the commitments of
this Alliance in 1995, constituted the National Council of Sustainable Development (CONADES)
to provide follow-up for the commitments of the country in this area and at the same time,
support the national institutions in the implementation of the commitments.
National Strategy
73.   The country is in the process of developing a national biodiversity strategy. Many of the
key elements of a strategy have been agreed upon, but work is still needed on collecting the
wealth of information about biodiversity status and trends and determining the relative
responsibility and actions of national, municipal, and local actors. The national strategy is the
responsibility of the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA) which
coordinates the administration of the SINAPH. SERNA is guided by a national advisory group,
Comisi6n de la Conservaci6n Nacional del Ambiente (COCONA) which includes a subgroup on
biodiversity. Subgroup members are SERNA, SAG, AFE-COHDEFOR (DAPVS), other
concerned agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. SERNA has requested an Enabling Activity
grant from the GEF to finalize their national biodiversity strategy and collect needed information
for reporting requirements for the Convention on Biodiversity Conservation. This grant would
complement information from the ecosystems map financed under the preparation of the Rural
Land Management Project.
74.   The present strategy for the SINAPH includes the prioritization of key areas of biological
diversity, most of which fall within the MBC and the concentration of fiscal resources on priority
areas. Non-priority areas and corridors would be protected through decentralized entities--
municipal authorities, community groups, protected areas committees at regional and protected
area level, and conservation NGOs. Also included in the strategy is the creation of a mechanism
to capture fee revenues from protected areas with economic potential to help self-finance the
SINAPH as a whole. In the future, other taxes and fees or private sector contributions could



44
augment the funds available. DAPVS has formed regional and local committees for biodiversity
conservation which will increasingly participate with regional DAPVS personnel in the planning
and implementation of biodiversity activities, and in the establishment of local regulations for
conservation and sustainable use. The committees provide a window for dialogue among diverse
stakeholders, including commercial developers, commercial fishing enterprises, and commnercial
livestock owners who put the greatest pressure on the MBC.
75.   A complementary initiative to the National Biodiversity Strategy is the bi-annual
Environment and Development Plan which is prepared by SERNA for input into the National
Development Plans prepared annually by the Government. The next version of the bi-annual plan
is scheduled for 1998, coinciding with the beginning of the next four-year political cycle.
Project Strategy
76.   The project aims to protect the integrity of the natural systems in the priority protected
areas within the Honduran section of the MBC within a participatory approach for sustainable
development. The project aims to strengthen the capacity of the government protected areas
agency (AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS) and of the regional and local organizations which
represent environmental interests andlor the local populations living in and around or benefiting
from the protected areas. Biological management of the protected areas is combined with
complementary management of the buffer zones and biological corridors to enhance the viability
of the protected areas and garner support for their long-term management (see Annexes 3, 4, 5, 6
for a full description of the components).
77.   An institutional analysis was carried out as part of project preparation to determine
whether the planned institutional arrangements would lead to an effective project implementation.
While DAPVS is weak at present, the aim of the BPAP is to provide some minimum
strengthening of the regional offices, diversify the range of disciplines represented by the national
and regional staff, and provide training on participation and partnerships, so that DAPVS
personnel are able to work with and support the NGOs and community groups in and around the
protected areas in the project. Local park staff, in addition to the parks administrator would be
drawn from the local community or concessionary staff of NGOs working in protected areas
management.
78.   AFE-COHDEFOR is committed to strengthening this department and the recent
restructuring of SERNA and SAG has elevated the dialogue about the need for strengthening the
SINAPH. Regardless of the degree of participation of NGOs and communities in protected areas
management, there is a minimum regulatory and normative role that Government must be
prepared to fulfill. This project will build on the existing AFE-COHDEFOR infrastructure while
creating additional decentralized offices of DAPVS that are focused on local-level needs with
budgets decentralized to the regional AFE-COHDEFOR office.
79.   Four groups of protected areas have been selected for prioritization by the project:
Atlantida wetlands, Cordillera de Nombre de Dios, Mosquitia, and Patuca-Tawahka. Along the
Atlantic coast and adjacent mountain ranges, the project would support management activities
including demarcation and capacity-building of regional and local organizations involved in



45
protected areas management and protection. In this region, the project would complement
actions of NGOs working with specific protected areas and municipal and local governments and
community organizations. In the Mosquitia, the project would also experiment with buffer zone
activities for which there is not significant alternative financing by supporting demand-driven
proposals by members of local committees for protected areas management (COLAPs) for
productive investments that are identified in the management plans as contributing to sound buffer
zone management and participation objectives. Resources for technical assistance on forestry and
upland agriculture will be channeled to all project areas through the Upland Fund financed by the
Rural Land Management Project.
80.   AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS will administer the project through three regional
operational centers: Mocor6n for the Mosquitia region; La Ceiba for the Atlantic region, and
Catacamas for the area of Olancho, with the main office in Tegucigalpa providing coordination
and overall project administration. NGOs will play a key role as providers of technical assistance
and/or co-implementers of management and buffer zone activities with local communities. A
significant part of the project budget is for training and capacity-building: (a) at national level for
DAPVS and other donor financed project staff, (b) at regional level for NGOs and regional
committees for protected areas management; and (c) at local levels for community organizations
and local protected areas management committees. Environmental education will be developed
and carried out by local educational institutions and teachers.
81.   The strategy elaborated in the regulations for SINAPH, which has been approved as a
Presidential Decree, is to work through regional biodiversity committees called CORAPs for
regional management initiatives and through protected areas level committees, or local
committees, called COLAPs. DAPVS will work to strengthen CORAPs and COLAPs in the
project area and these committees will be made up of representatives of NGOs, indigenous
federations and confederations, community-based organizations, producer organizations, and local
municipal govermnents. The project will finance buffer zone activities identified by COLAP
members as part of the process of elaborating the management plans for individual protected
areas.
82.   This strategy aims to foster participation in planning and implementation of management
and protection by a wide range of social actors and social institutions. Since a large percentage of
the population in the Mosquitia and the Atlantic coast is indigenous, the project includes
indigenous peoples development as an integral part of its design. Recognizing that the wider the
range of participation, the more sustainable the management and buffer zone initiatives, gender is
a key element of design, encouraging both women and men to participate in management and
productive activities.
83.   The NOTOs that the project will work with are diverse environmental or development
NGOs which liave been engaged in biodiversity conservation activities in and around protected
areas in the project area, and which receive support from a variety of other sources, most
recently, from Fundaci6n VIDA. They are involved in environmental education, community
organization for protected areas management, conflict resolution, and buffer zone activities.
Some NGOs partially finance management costs from tourist entry fees or ecotourism enterprises.
The project aims to strengthen the capacity of these organizations by complementing financing for



46
protected areas management and demarcation which is available through on-going programs or
new financing, through the relationship with NGOs and the dialogue created for management plan
preparation and implementation, and strengthening the participation of local populations in the
CORAPs and COLAPs--the regional and local protected areas committees.
84.   Under the Rural Land Management Project, a Protected Areas Fund will be created that
will capture entry fees from the protected areas with a clear economic potential. Infrastructure
will be financed in part by the Rural Land Management Project to attract a larger number of
tourists to the selected protected areas. In cases where NGOs have been collecting entry fees as
part of their financing of environmental activities, agreements will be made with them regarding
capture of funds on a case by case basis. Efforts will be made to ensure that non-entry fee
earnings from increased numbers of tourists are captured by the NGOs and the local communities.
85.   Tenure rights has been identified to be a key issue for which the project needs to have a
clear strategy. The first draft of a study has been completed evaluating the alternatives for
addressing issues of indigenous and non-indigenous property rights in and around the protected
areas. Three options currently being applied in Honduras include: (a) titling public lands to the
forest department to stabilize occupation and prevent newcomers from establishing rights to the
detriment of indigenous peoples and the biological resource; (b) providing communal land rights
to indigenous populations which recognize the legal status of the protected areas as well as the
communal ownership of the indigenous populations; and (c) individual title. The project will seek
to clarify tenure rights to the extent possible, setting the conditions for effective protected areas
management. In some cases, this will lead to an overlap of indigenous tenure rights and core
protected areas delimitation. In other cases, tenure will be confined to buffer zones. For this
reason, demarcation activities may include delimitation of individual or communal tenure as well
as buffer and core zones, in cases where this serves to protect indigenous tenure rights and/or gain
acceptance for buffer and core zone boundaries.
86.   The Project Area. In order to determine the areas of greatest interest for investment
under the project, a three-step prioritization process was adopted. The general approach and
preliminary results that emerged during preparation of the project, were discussed and revised in
national fora and workshops and with national and international experts. The prioritization
methodology is discussed in greater detail in Annex 1. In brief, the three-step approach included:
(a) defining areas of global biodiversity importance;
(b) eliminating the subset of areas receiving or about to receive significant investments from other
donors or financiers; and
(c) selecting areas which represent feasible investments taking into account the resources
available, the lifetime of the project, local and national capacity, commitment, and sustainability.
87.   A summary of the prioritization was also presented in the background paper for the
regional MBC project (Archaga and Marineros, 1996: Honduras: Dentro del Contexto del
Corredor Biologico Mesoamericano, CCAD/AFE-COHDEFOR/PNUD/GEF). Criteria included:
size, degree of intervention, potential connectivity, representativeness of ecosystems, and



47
presence of species of global importance. Degree of integrity was determined by a series of three
overflights of the entire country carried out in 1996 by DAPVS experts and international
consultants.
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Implementing Agencies and Arrangements
88.   The project implementing arrangements are described in Annex 7. The project will be
coordinated and administered by AFE-COHDEFOR through the Protected Areas and Wildlife
Department (DAPVS). These agencies will work within the strategy and policy guidelines
approved by SERNA for protected areas and SINAPH administration. Much of the
implementation of the project will be decentralized to the protected areas themselves. Although
overall project coordination will be in DAPVS under a project coordinator based in Tegucigalpa.
Each regional field office will work in the headquarters of the respective forest office of the
corresponding region.
89.   The Upland Fund which was established to channel financial resources to upland forestry
and agricultural producers for technical assistance and technology generation under the Rural
Land Management Project, will extend its coverage to include the buffer zone areas of the BPAP.
The same criteria for eligibility of proposals will be considered for the BPAP project area. In
addition, financial resources will be channeled to beneficiaries in the buffer zones of the Mosquitia
project area for investment activities that are identified as part of the management plan for the
particular protected area. The local protected areas committees, COLAPs, will be responsible for
identifying these investments as part of the participatory management plan, and for supervising
(with DAPVS and NGOs) the success of these investments. The buffer zone investment
arrangements are described in more detail in Annex 5.
90.   At a regional level, the regional coordinators of the protected areas will be responsible for
the coordination and supervision of activities to be carried out by the administrators of the
respective areas. The administrators of the protected areas will be responsible for the
implementation of management plans in coordination with the local committees for protected
areas management.
91.   UNDP and the World Bank will jointly serve as GEF implementing agencies. The two
agencies will be jointly responsible for technical supervision of the project and UNDP will
administer the financial resources through its Honduras office. The Government of Honduras also
plans to contract UNDP-Honduras as a procurement agent for part of the activities in the Rural
Land Management Project, including procurement for the Biodiversity Conservation Component.
This will provide greater coordination of the activities in the integrated program within Honduras.



48
JUSTIFICATION FOR GEF FINANCING
92.   On July 31, 1995, Honduras ratified the Biological Diversity Agreement. The BPAP is
consistent with the operational programs of the Operational Strategy of the GEF since it focuses
on the Mesoamerican region and a strip of habitats from mountains and forests to wetlands and
marine ecosystems--all identified as priority types of habitats. The project is consistent with the
guidelines since it includes in situ conservation and it will include strengthening of the
conservation, management, and sustainable use of the humid ecosystems and the mountainous
regions, and strengthening the involvement of the indigenous population and integration of the
social dimensions, including those related to poverty.
93.   GEF financing will assist the Government in coordinating the activities of several donors
and agencies involved in biodiversity conservation. With the combined initiative of the World
Bank and UNDP in the preparation of the BPAP, the Government has developed a wide forum of
consultations to generate ideas and guidelines for the National Biodiversity Strategy. This has
captured the attention of the President of the Republic who has requested that the self-financing
mechanism for the management and administration of protected areas also incorporate a tourism
strategy for the country. The BPAP is also part of a larger strategy supported by the GEF for a
regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The regional MBC Project, managed by UNDP is
quite advanced in preparation and is providing a framework under which to develop the MBC.
This project is being developed in close coordination with the BPAP. An important justification
for GEF funds is the influence of the fund for biodiversity conservation on bilateral and
multilateral donors that are expected to join in the next year (discussions are currently being
carried out with donors).
PARTICIPATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
Social Participation
94.   A social assessment was carried out as part of preparation of the project with the
following objectives: (a) analyze the existing patterns of natural resource and land ownership,
management, access, and use among different groups and institutions in the protected areas
system; (b) identify the actors that should be involved in preparation, implementation, and
evaluation, and obtain their contributions with respect to design and areas of action of the project;
(c) identify potential negative impacts of the proposed activities for the vulnerable groups of the
population, including indigenous groups and women and design measures to avoid or mitigate
these impacts; (d) identify opportunities to construct capacities in the local governments,
indigenous organizations, producers, and NGOs; and (e) prepare a development plan for the
indigenous population (Miskitos, Garifunas, Tawahkas, and Pech) based on the consideration of
the development needs of the indigenous groups potentially involved in the project. See Annex 2
for a full description of the results of the social assessment.
95.   The social assessment included: (a) an analysis of the land owners in the BPAP project
area; (b) participatory consultation workshops in three regions with representative actors from the
BPAP project area and a national consultation workshop; (c) extensive analysis of secondary



49
information on the social impacts of natural resource management projects; and (d) field visits and
interviews with local authorities, women, representatives of the indigenous population, producers,
and NGOs.
96.   NGO and Community Based Organizations' Involvement. There are emerging
federations in the Mosquitia: FETRIPH, FITH, and MASTA representing Pech, Tawahka, and
Miskitos respectively. MASTA has tried to represent all Mosquitia-based communities of
indigenous origin, but like the Garifuna federations, still does not have a clear identity vis a vis
individual community leadership. The project's strategy is to include these organizations as much
as possible in the protected areas dialogue while working as well with individual community
leaders. Part of the training funds will be available to members of these federations.
97.   Recognizing the relative weakness of these organizations in terms of vertical integration,
the Rural Land Management Project has supported a proposal for institutional strengthening with
IDF funds which will provide results before the BPAP project activities start in the project area.
98.  In 1992, a conservation foundation, Fundaci6n VIDA, was created as an NGO to channel
resources to NGOs and community-based organizations for conservation and sustainable
development. This foundation has approved a number of grants to NGOs working in the
protected areas included in the BPAP project to support capacity-building and finance a range of
activities.
99.   Participation of the different community organizations in environmental management is
varied. In some protected areas such as Punta Sal, the communities are represented in the office
of the Park Authority and participate directly in decision-making. In Trujillo, an inter-institutional
committee has been created under the coordination of FUCAGUA, with a strong governmental
focus, to try and bring together a wide range of stakeholders. All of the NGOs working in
protected areas have different levels of involvement with stakeholders in the area. Few have
reached the breadth of involvement of FUCAGUA. There are several conflict situations in the
protected area of Cuero y Salado, for example, which the Fundaci6n VIDA and BPAP support
would seek to solve.
100.  A capacity analysis was carried out of these organizations. The analysis looked at the
range of staff of each organization, the range of projects which were being managed by the
organizations, the relationships with community organizations and beneficiaries, and the capacity
to scale up. Without the support of Fundaci6n VIDA in the BPAP, most of these NGOs would
not be able to extend themselves to undertake the planned collaboration. With this assistance and
the planned training activities under the BPAP, combined with the involvement of local
governments and local indigenous federations, that will also receive training support, there should
be capacity for these groups to carry out the needed activities. In the area of the Mosquitia, the
only organization with a strong base is MOPAWI, an NGO formed to advance the development
of the Miskito peoples. MOPAWI currently has little capacity for expansion of its activities,
given its limited staff and administrative base. The project would draw upon MOPAWI's
expertise for some of the technical assistance and community organization activities, but would
work directly with the local committees for protected areas management (COLAPs) supported by
the BPAP project, for protected areas management decisions, and would channel the buffer zone



50
financing through the DAPVS office contracting a private bank in the Mosquitia for the financial
accounting and preparation of checks for disbursement of the funds to beneficiaries.
Sustainability
101.  The sustainability of the project would be increased through a combination of measures.
First, the Rural Land Management Project would improve the ability and capacity of local and
national institutions to provide technical assistance in the sustainable use of the land and to
confront issues related to land tenure. In particular, the Upland Producers Fund will be an
important tool to support more sustainable land use and rational benefits with biodiversity in the
buffer zones (as well as the buffer zone component of the BPAP). Second, a self-financing
mechanism to be created in the Rural Land Management Project gradually will generate revenue
for maintenance of the infrastructure, equipment and personnel of the protected areas of national
and international importance. Third, through working very closely with several land owners and
opening a number of protected areas to the Honduran public, the project will benefit from public
support for the protected areas.
102.  The financial sustainability of the National System of Protected Areas of Honduras
(SINAPH) depends in part on the generation of a competitive ecotourism industry in the country.
This goal is the focus of several components of the integrated program. As it is described in the
BPAP, the Government has agreed to assume the recurrent costs of the additional personnel of
DAPVS in case the mechanism is less successful than expected.
DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
Strengthen the National System of Protected Areas of Honduras (SINAPH) and contribute to the
integrity and environmental values of the Honduran section of the Mesoamerican Biological
Corridor through better conservation of biodiversity in core areas with the participation of the
communities in the buffer zones and improved local capacity to make wise choices regarding
management of biodiversity and natural resources.
Immediate Objectives Outputs and Activities
Immediate Objective 1: Strengthening of DAPVS and Local Capacity for Protected Areas
Management
Strengthen the institutional capacity of the institutions and organizations that participate in the
National System of Protected Areas (SINAPH).
Output 1.1: Institutional Strengthening at the National Level
Built-in institutional capacity and consensus among the institutions and organizations that make
up SINAPH in support of a cohesive and participatory management strategy of key Protected
Areas in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.



51
Success Criteria
* DAPVS and national stakeholders of the SINAPH are more capable and willing to implement
management plans
* National consensus is built around the concepts of core and buffer zone management
Activities
1.1.1 Design an in-service training program with a series of short courses (one or two weeks) at
the national, regional, and local levels for the personnel of DAPVS on issues related to planning,
decentralized management, GIS, biodiversity, protected areas management, and methodologies
for community participation with a focus on gender. Includes training of approximately 60 park
guards and 36 DAPVS employees throughout the five years, a total of approximately 288 weeks
of training.
1.1.2 Implement technical and administrative training of personnel in the implementation of new
activities or on issues where they may have limited experience such as participatory planning.
This support will be provided in local areas or offices and will be available for DAPVS personnel
and the NGOs that are involved in protected areas management. A total of 12 months (3 months
per region) will be available during the project.
1.1.3 Facilitate the participation of ten employees of DAPVS in international events on policies,
strategies, financing and marketing of the use and management of natural resources, especially in
protected areas.
1. 1.4 Revise and update the technical and administrative operational procedures of DAPVS.
Produce a procedural manual on protected areas management and administration which will
describe how the covenants between DAPVS and the regional and local committees for protected
areas management and possibly other groups in the protected areas will be implemented (currently
there is no manual).
1.1.5 In coordination with IHT, contract services to design and implement a program of
marketing of the protected areas for ecotourism at the international level.
1.1.6 In coordination with national NGOs and international institutions, design and implement a
strategy for capturing financial resources for protected areas management to support recurrent
costs of DAPVS and other institutions involved in protected areas.
1.2 Output: Institutional Strengthening at the Regional Level
Institutional strengthening to support the coordination of participating organizations involved in
providing direct services in protected areas management (mainly NGOs, local government
technicians, and COLAPs) according to the coordination mechanisms established for SINAPH in
the National Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation. Development of an environmental education
program for primary school children in the project area.



52
Success Criteria
* Four regional committees (CORAPs) for protected areas management are established and in
operation in coordination with the established COLAPs.
* An integrated educational program is implemented. Conservation values have been imparted
to teachers and community leaders. Long-term attitudinal shifts toward sustainable use of
natural resources in the project's areas of influence are demonstrable.
Activities
1.2.1 In close coordination with the groups that will manage the protected areas and other
beneficiaries, design a training course to train individuals from cooperating organizations,
members of the local and regional committees for protected areas management (COLAPs and
CORAPs) and volunteers that will support protected areas management. The program will focus
on the transfer of the skills necessary for each group to assume a role in the decentralized and
participatory management of the protected areas and buffer zones. Social, technical,
administrative and legal issues will be covered. Necessary equipment to be purchased includes
training materials, printing, slides, VCR, camera, and a generator.
1.2.2 Establish eleven COLAPs for protected areas management to support the coordination of
work at the local level. In addition to the support given to these committees, they will also have
access to DAPVS facilities which will be established under the project. After the COLAPs have
been established, four CORAPs will be formed based on the forestry regions of the country.
1.2.3 Train an average of 30 people through a series of short courses from cooperating agencies
(NGOs with donor-financed projects and base organizations) in administration of financial
resources, ecotourism, and environmental legislation. An average of 8 weeks of training will be
offered during implementation and approximately 30 functionaries will be trained (three from each
protected area), a total of approximately 240 weeks of training in the five years.
1.2.4 Provide five weeks of training through a series of short courses (2 to 3 days) for 36
representatives of the COLAPs and CORAPs. The training will address issues of procedures and
laws of SINAPH, organization, participation and conflict resolution, and procedures of the
project. Each year, the project will hold a week-long course for all the members of the committees
to ensure that they are organized. Approximately 180 weeks of training for the five years.
1.2.5 Promote and finance three study exchange trips of five days to neighboring countries with
biodiversity conservation projects associated with the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor to allow
the members of the committees to learn about other experiences and reinforce their active
involvement in the committees.
1.2.6 In coordination with the Ministry of Education, train approximately 100 teachers from the
schools located in the communities near the protected areas in two-day courses. The courses will
introduce teachers to educational material on biodiversity and the role of the protected areas and
buffer zones developed for use in the schools. The courses will provide support for the teachers
to integrate these materials into the normal curriculum of the schools.



53
1.2.7 Carry out a program of environmental education targeted to primary school students with
support from the trained teachers. The environmental education should be offered in Spanish and
in the native languages where appropriate. Educational and informational materials will be
developed for use in the schools. Distribution of approximately 1,000 environmental education
texts, 1,000 posters, 1000 bulletins, and 500 study guides of specific cases of the communities of
the project area.
1.2.8 Distribute and implement the Manual of Environmental Education in fifty schools in the
project area.
1.2.9 Promote in coordination with the teachers, the formation of fifty juvenile groups for
conservation with participatory actions such as field trips, cleaning green areas, and reforestation.
1.2.a Develop an environmental education program to be broadcast over local radio stations
directed to rural communities and schools.
I .2.b Establish a program of educational trips to several protected areas of the country to
supplement academic learning about the value of natural resources and the need to protect
biodiversity. Approximately 40 students a year from the local communities will participate.
1.3 Output: Strengthening at the Local Level
Communities will be organized (CORAP, COLAP) to effectively participate in management
decisions and activities related to the SINAPH.
Success criteria
C COLAPs will be organized, have a greater understanding of linkages between development
and conservation and protected areas management issues.
Activities
1.3.1 Establish a minimum of 11 local committees for protected areas management activities.
1.3.2 Design a training program for the COLAPs on topics related to the value of biodiversity
and the transfer of skills they need in order to maintain a strong role as the interlocutors of the
communities for participatory planning, identification of activities eligible for GEF financing, and
supervision of the implementation of local activities. Specific themes may include protected areas
management, protection, surveillance and maintenance of paths. The training program will
consist of four weeks of training in courses, two weeks of short courses (2 to 3 days) and 30
workshops for participatory planning. Approximately 75 individuals will be training with a total of
450 weeks of training over the five years.
1.3.3 Establish in coordination with the COLAPs, a program to provide training to volunteers
supporting DAPVS and the cooperating organizations in protected areas management.
Approximately 130 volunteers will receive two days of orientation regarding the role of SINAPH,



54
the role of the volunteers, procedures, biological values, and natural history of the area for a total
of 52 weeks of training in five years. The majority of training for the volunteers will be in-service.
1.40utput: ProjectManagement
Establishment of a project management unit for project implementation and monitoring and
evaluation.
Success Criteria
* Efficient and timely execution of the project with high levels of accountability for financial and
operational administration, strong coordination of project components, and on-going
beneficiary evaluations guiding the implementation process.
Activities
1.4.1 Appoint national project staff, establish the project coordinating unit's office within
DAPVS, and sub-offices at the project sites, and set up a Project Steering Committee.
1.4.2 Execute sub-contracts, purchase equipment, and provide general administrative support,
including supervision of project staff and management of project vehicles and equipment.
1.4.3 Provide high standard of financial accounting and activity reporting, and prepare progress
reports for UNDP, World Bank, GEF, DAPVS and other relevant government agencies.
1.4.4 Evaluate through an annual workshop, the participation of the institutions with direct
responsibility for the administration of the protected areas with respect to the consolidation of the
institutional framework of SINAPH.
1.4.5 Appraise information reported from project monitoring activities and take necessary action
to improve project delivery.
1.4.6 Elaborate and execute a program of dissemination of information on the advances and
experiences of the project. Establish information, reporting, storage, management, retrieval and
analysis system with proper procedures.
Immediate Objective 2: Management of Globally Important Protected Areas
To reduce external threats to biodiversity through management of the key protected areas inside

INPUTS
103.  Government Inputs. Total Government counterpart funding is US$ 2.2 million. This
includes staff costs of regional and central AFE-COHDEFOR staff who will be working in the
project, GOH's'assumption of an increasing percentage of staff and equipment costs over the life
of the project, and Government contribution to the costs of infrastructure and operating expenses.
In addition, it is expected that communities will contribute US$ 300,000 for activities in the buffer
zone.
PROJECT REVIEW, REPORTING AND EVALUATION
104. Annual Review. The project will be subject to Tripartite Reviews (TPR) conformed by
the following: (a) Government Representatives, (b) Representatives of the World Bank, and (c)
Representatives of UNDP. A Tripartite Review will be held at least once every 12 months, as of
the effective start date of project execution. The National Project Coordinator will prepare one
month before each Tripartite Review, a Project Performance Evaluation Review (PPER). The
National Project Coordinator will present the PPER during the Tripartite Review. During project
execution other reports may also be requested by the Tripartite Review parts.
105.  A Terminal Report will be prepared and presented for consideration by the parts during
the final Tripartite Review. The draft of the said report will be prepared at least four months
ahead of the scheduled final Tripartite Review to allow the executing agency to review and revise,
where appropriate, any technical aspects of the document.
Annex 12 details the scheduled supervision plan.
106. Financial Audit. The GOH, represented by AFE-COHDEFOR, will submit the financial
registries of the project for an annual audit. The audit must be conducted by external auditors
acceptable to the World Bank and UNDP, satisfying Terms of Reference that cover the financial
reporting needs of both institutions. The costs of the audit will be covered by the project budget.
LEGAL CONTEXT
107.  This Project Document is referred to in article 1 of the Basic Model of Assistance
Agreement of Honduras and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This
Agreement was signed by the parts on 17 January, 1995 and published in the official bulletin "La
Gaceta" on 27 April, 1995.
108.  The following project revisions will be approved with the sole signature of the Resident
Representative of UNDP providing that the said Representative is assured that the other
signatories of the project document do not have any objections to the proposed changes:
(a) Revisions to any of the annexes of the project document;



62                                  Annex 1
(b) Revisions that do not involve significant changes in the immediate Objectives, Outputs, or
Activities of the project, but are caused by the rearrangement of inputs already agreed to or by
cost increases due to inflation; and
(c) Mandatory annual revisions to rephase the delivery of agreed project inputs, reflect increased
expert or other costs due to inflation, or take into account agency expenditure flexibility.

Annex 1
Selection of Priority Areas
1.   In order to determine the areas of greatest interest for investment under the Biodiversity in
Priority Areas Project (BPAP), a three step prioritization process was adopted. The general
approach, and preliminary results that emerged during preparation of the project, were discussed
and revised in national fora and workshops and with national and international experts.
2.    The prioritization of sites for a GEF project is a complicated exercise due to the inherent
complexity of any prioritization exercise and the lack of clear guidance from the GEF Council on
the appropriate methodological approach. The GEF Operational Procedures stress that national
priorities are important in addition to global priorities but national benefits are excluded from
consideration because they are not considered incremental costs. The GEF stresses that GEF
funds are to target not only conservation of biodiversity but also its sustainable use but the latter
automatically implies a clear national benefit which is not able to be financed. No clear definition
has emerged as to what constitutes "globally important biodiversity" nor is there a consensus on
the relative importance which should be ascribed to threat (should GEF funds be used to protect
areas under low threat, which offer the best possibility in the long term of protecting large intact
ecosystems, or should they be used to save areas under critical threat?). Small changes in
underlying assumptions in a prioritization exercise can have dramatic changes on the resulting
priorities.
3.    Given this context, the three step approach employed here was developed as an effort to
balance global and national priorities, conservation and sustainable use priorities, and to help
guide the preparation of a project that ultimately must represent a series of feasible investments in
terms of sustainability and national and local capacity. The three steps used in the prioritization
exercise, which can be thought of as successive filters, were the following:
(a) define areas of global biodiversity importance;
(b) eliminate that subset of areas which are receiving or about to receive significant and adequate
investments from other donors or financiers; and
(c) select areas which represent feasible investments taking into account the resources available,
the lifetime of the project, local and national capacity, commitment, and sustainability.
Determination of Global Biodiversity Importance
4.    The definition of global biodiversity importance was an exercise carried out over more
than a year as part of the preparation of the UNDP-coordinated Regional Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor Project (MBC). The full methodology and results are presented in the
background paper for Honduras that was used as the national input to preparing the Regional
MBC Project (Archaga and Marineros, 1996: Honduras: Dentro del Contexto del Corredor
Biol6gicoMesoamericano, CCAD/AFE-COHDEFOR/PNUD/GEF).



Annex 1                                  65
5.    The methodology used in that study was developed by biodiversity experts within AFE-
CODEHFOR and both the approach and preliminary results were discussed in a series of twelve
national workshops and consultations in which more than 280 people participated. The overall
process benefited in addition from the input of the GEF and various international experts as part
of the preparation of both the Regional MBC Project and the BPAP.
6.    The focus of the MBC approach was to identify four categories of corridors/PAs: (a)
Category I, corridors of importance at a global level, large mostly intact areas of at least 10 000
ha; (b) Category II, small corridors important for connecting globally important areas, of 10,000
to 20,000 ha; (c) Category IEm, large protected areas of national importance, areas of 10,000 to
20,000 ha with fragmented nuclei; and (d) Category IV, small protected area of local importance,
with highly fragmented nuclei and offering little connectivity with other areas.
7.    To determine areas of global importance to be included under the BPAP, the Category I
and II areas were chosen as a starting point. Briefly resuming information available in the national
report for the MBC, the following criteria were critical in delineating the Category I and II areas:
size, degree of intervention, potential connectivity, representativity of ecosystems, and presence
of species of global importance.
S.    The size of an area and its degree of intervention (or inversely, the degree of intactness)
are important attributes of an area when determining its conservation importance. Large areas of
natural habitat not significantly degraded by human activities are essential to ensure functional
ecological processes characteristic of the ecosystem in its natural state. Large areas are also
necessary to maintain viable populations of species of both plants and animals. This is particularly
so for "umbrella species", such as Harpy Eagles, which require extremely large areas to maintain
viable populations; satisfying their habitat requirements satisfies area and ecological requirements
for most other species occurring in that ecosystem.
9.    The degree of intactness was determined in a series of three overflights of the entire
country carried out in 1996 by experts of DAPVS and international consultants. All large areas of
at least 10,000 ha of contiguous undisturbed natural habitat (areas where it was judged that 90
percent of the natural vegetation was in an undisturbed state and where there were no significant
human populations) were initially retained for consideration as Category I or II areas.
10.   Blocks of habitat which were clearly important links in maintaining connectivity within a
given ecoregion or ecosystem type of Honduras were rated more highly in the MBC exercise.
Connectivity of natural habitats underlies the very principle of the Mesoamerican Biological
Corridor which is based on the concept of strips of natural habitat stretching from Mexico to
Colombia. Corridors of natural habitat are important in allowing a flow of genetic material
between adjacent populations and maintaining ecosystem dynamics which operate over very large
geographical scales.
11.   The representativity of different ecosystem types was also considered as an important
criterion. A revised and detailed habitat map for Honduras is still in preparation but some
guidance was available at a fairly broad ecoregional level: five ecoregions were identified in
Honduras in a World Bank/WWF study (Dinerstein et al., 1995: A Conservation Assessment of



66                                 Annex 1
the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean) and the traditional Holdridge
classification identifies eight life zones in the country. It was considered important to ensure
representativity (and connectivity) between broad classes of habitat such as the Atlantic -lowland
humid forests, the pine savannas of Mosquitia, and mid-altitude forests of highlands on the
Atlantic slope. Most other ecoregions in Honduras, such as the pine-oak forests and cloud forests
of the highlands and the dry forests of the Pacific slope, are already so degraded and fragmented
that few areas of sufficient size were classed as potential Category I areas.
12.   Finally, the last criterion which was considered to be useful in prioritizing areas of global
importance was the presence of species of global importance. Two hundred and ten species were
identified as being of global or national concern in Honduras. The full list of species and details
on how they were identified can be found in a report prepared during preparation of this project
(Cerrato, 1996: Informe del Componente de Biodiversidad). Species of global biodiversity
importance would be those that are endangered or threatened on a global basis (as defined in
IUCN Red List volumes, CITES appendices, SPAW annexes, or similar publications), endemic
species of restricted range, and migratory species which are declining on a world-wide basis.
Because of the lack of good data on the occurrence and distribution of species in Honduras this
criterion could not be accorded much importance but every area classed as a Category I or II
corridor was believed to be frequented by at least five species from the list of globally important
species.
Consideration of Other Sources of Financing
13.   A considerable volume of bilateral and multilateral aid is currently being channeled to
Honduras specifically for the protection of biodiversity or for investments in buffer zones around
key protected areas. In order to help determine which of the nine Category I and II corridors
would be prioritized in the BPAP, aid flows for biodiversity conservation in each of the areas was
determined (see detailed tables in Archaga and Marineros, 1996).
14.   Half of the six Category I areas were eliminated from consideration because they are
receiving substantial aid from other sources. The Bay Islands marine ecosystems corridor will be
receiving considerable support from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) under the Bay
Islands Development Project which is expected to shortly begin disbursements. The Gulf of
Fonseca corridor area will be receiving funding through the Rural Land Management Project and
is also receiving support from a wide variety of other donors for buffer zone activities. Finally,
the Agalta-Rio Tinto Corridor will receive biodiversity conservation funding from the Dutch
Government and the Frontera Agricola Project of the European Community. Within the
Plapawans corridor, a decision was made to not further consider the northern part, the Rio
Platano Biosphere Reserve, because of a large project with German support which will be starting
in mid-1997.
15.   Of the three Category II areas, two were eliminated from consideration. These were the
Capiro-Guaymoreto area which will be supported by the Dutch project mentioned above and will
also be receiving support from the USAID-financed Fundaci6n VIDA. The Cusuco-Merend6n-
Omoa area of highlands near the border with Guatemala will receive funding for conservation
activities from USAID and from local municipal governments.



Annex 1                                67
Determination of Investment Feasibility
16.   As a result of the first two steps above, the four general corridors or areas to be
prioritized under the GEF project were chosen: the southern half of the Plapawans Corridor (the
PatucalTawahka area), the Mosquitia, the Cordillera Nombre de Dios, and the Atlantida wetlands.
17.   As a final "filter" in the process of fine-tuning the selection of areas within these areas to
be prioritized for investments under the project, a subjective assessment was carried out by
DAPVS staff. This assessment took into account the limited financial resources which could be
assigned to any given area, the threats that the area was under, spatial distribution of biological
resources of global importance, and an analysis of how reasonable it would be to expect that the
BPAP could achieve significant and sustainable results. Factors which were important were the
likely level of support from local communities, particularly in the case of indigenous populations.
Consideration was also given to logistical difficulties and the question of local and national
capacity in implementing investments in the area under consideration.
18.   As a result of this exercise, the final geographic foci of the BPAP were determined. The
areas of greatest priority for the project were determined to be the Patuca/Tawahka area and the
Mosquitia area. These areas, along with the Rio Platano Biosphere, are probably the most
important remaining areas of biodiversity in Honduras. They are not however receiving any
support from other donors and AFE-COHDEFOR has almost no presence in the area. At the
same time, the Patuca-Tawahka area is being eroded by one of the most aggressive agricultural
frontiers in the region. It was felt that the BPAP can make a significant contribution in this area
by working closely with the indigenous and non-indigenous communities of the area.
19.   Within the Mosquitia, it is proposed to prioritize investments in the Caratasca Laguna area
near Puerto Lempira and in the humid forests of Warunta, Rus-Rus, and Mocor6n. The pine
savannas of the southern Mosquitia are under relatively less threat and is currently benefiting from
the presence of AFE-COHDEFOR and WWF investments in sustainable management of the
native pine forests. The laguna area is however currently receiving no external financial
assistance and the rich and relatively unknown aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity of the area is
under significant threat from the Mosquitia's largest concentration of people.
20.  In northwestern Honduras, the entire corridors of the Cordillera de Nombre de Dios and
the Humedales de Atlantida were retained. However, both of these areas will benefit from
investments from other donors and from assistance of local NGOs and of AFE-COHDEFOR. As
a whole they will receive less funding than the other two areas of the project.

Annex 2
Social Assessment, Participation Plan, Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
Introduction
1.    A social assessment (SA) was carried out as part of project preparation with the following
objectives: (a) to evaluate existing patterns of natural resource and land ownership, management,
access, and use among different groups and institutions in the protected areas system; (b) to
identify stakeholders, using a gender perspective, who should be involved in preparation,
implementation, and evaluation and to obtain their inputs on project scope and design; (c) to
identify potentially negative impacts of proposed activities on vulnerable groups in the population,
including indigenous peoples, low-income producers, and women, and design measures to prevent
or mitigate these impacts; and (d) to identify opportunities to build the capacity of local
governments, indigenous organizations, producers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
2.    This document summarizes the main findings and recommendations of the SA. The
outputs of the SA include a Participation Plan overlapping with an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan, developed to support the involvement of indigenous communities in the
project area (Miskitos, Garifunas, Tawahkas, and Pech), and target activities for low-income
producers and women. The Participation Plan includes a matrix extracting costs of activities
related to participation and the incorporation of special interest groups from the overall cost
tables (see Table 1).
Methodology
3.    The social assessment consisted of: (a) an analysis of the stakeholders in the land
administration and natural resources sectors; (b) regional consultation workshops with
representative stakeholders in the buffer zones surrounding the protected areas carried out by a
multi-disciplinary team; (c) an extensive analysis of secondary literature on the social impacts of
the land titling program; (d) a meeting with NGOs that are working with farmers and producers in
buffer zone areas; (e) meetings with members of the National Confederation of Autochtonous
Communities of Honduras (Confederaci6n Nacional de Pueblos Aut6ctonos de Honduras,
CONPAH) and with representatives of indigenous and non-indigenous communities, including
traditional indigenous leaders, in the project areas; and (f) specific research on gender issues. An
international gender specialist and two international indigenous/social specialists participated in
preparation to oversee in-country work on these aspects of project design.
Results of the Social Assessment
Honduran Indigenous Peoples
4.    The indigenous population in Honduras (including black Caribbean communities) consists
of eight ethnic groups, numbering about 293,000 inhabitants and comprising 12.8 percent of the
total population (1988 Census). The eight groups are: Xicaques or Tulupanes, Lencas, Garifuna,
Miskitos, Pech or Paya, Tawahka or Sumos, Chorti, and Islefios or the Creole-speaking black



Annex 2                                69
population. Membership in an ethnic group is generally determined by language affiliation and/or
socio-cultural organization.
5.   Indigenous Peoples in the Protected Areas. The eleven protected areas selected for the
Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project (BPAP) comprise one of the last great wilderness regions of
Central America. The project area contains both terrestrial and marine ecosystems that are of
national, regional and global importance. The two main geographic areas are the coastal lands
along the northern Atlantic coast with a high concentration of Garifuna, and the Mosquitia. The
Mosquitia encompasses a tropical forest corridor and coastal wetlands, both of which extend
south into Nicaragua, forming the largest contiguous tract of tropical forest remaining in Central
America. This area contains at least a third of the remaining indigenous population, including all
of the Tawahka, one half of the 2,600 Pech, a majority of the Miskitos, and a large Garifuna
population.
6.   It is difficult to estimate the exact indigenous population in the project area. The total
Miskito population in the Mosquitia region is approximately 49,000 in 100 communities and it is
estimated that the Garifuna population in the Atlantic region is approximately 95,000 in 38
communities, including the northern coast of the Mosquitia. Based on these calculations, it is
likely that the indigenous population living in the areas affected by the BPAP is approximately
78,000, including:
- Approximately 20,000 of the Miskito population in about 60 communities;
-  About 250 Pech or Paya, in Nombre de Culmi and San Esteban municipalities in the Olancho
Department;
-  The total population of the Tawahka or Sumus with 900 inhabitants in 7 communities along
the Rio Patuca River
-  Sixty percent of the total Garifuna in Cortez, Atlantida, Col6n, Gracias a Dios and Islas de la
Bahia.
7.    Parallel biodiversity projects in the Atlantic coast and the Mosquitia financed by German
Technical Cooperation, the European Union, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, US
Agency for International Development, and Fundaci6n VIDA are affecting another 71,000
indigenous people.
8.   Indigenous Organizations. In general, the indigenous organizations in Honduras combine
elements of their traditional culture with those of the non-indigenous society, such as economic
strategies, politico-administrative aspects, and religious affiliation. The lowest level of
organization is the community (village, township) which participates both as a community and as
individual members, in ethnic federations with either regional or national affiliation. Recently, the
lower level organizations have formed federations at the ethnic level. The indigenous community
based-organizations are stronger in comparison with the federations because they have a large
membership and a collective decision-making system, however their capacity to mobilize as part
of the federations is still weak. Since there is no historical supra organization of individual
communities in any of the four groups of indigenous peoples in the project area, the federations
that have recently formed have had to develop a new mode of organization, since they are unable



70                                 Annex 2
to build on traditional ties. The Miskitos have the longest history of organizations, followed by
Garifuna, Pech, and Tawahka. The Pech and Tawahka organizations were modeled on the
Miskito federation, while the Garifuna have responded much more to models of the non-
indigenous political movements.
9.    The indigenous peoples in the forested areas of the Mosquitia (Pech, Miskito, and
Tawahka) have relatively fluid relationships at the community level and there is a fair amount of
movement by individuals from one resource-rich area to another, resulting in changes over time in
the membership or identity of any particular community. This is not to say that there are not
strong and functional relationships do not exist at the community level, but in the case of shifting
residence, these relationships are transferred to newly-formed communities and new organizations
are created with similar patterns as the older communities.
10.   The community representation at the federation level of organization is less stable. In the
Garifuna coastal communities, there is considerable migration to the Caribbean and to the United
States, which has created a large juvenile population with parents who are overseas, and a mixed
allegiance to community members in Honduras and to those overseas. The existing indigenous
federations are as follows:
* The Pech have organized at the national level in the Federation of Pech Tribes of Honduras
(Federaci6n de Tribus Pech de Honduras, FETRIPH).
* The Miskitos are represented by the Mosquitia-Asla Takanka - Unidad de la Mosquitia
(MASTA). This is made up of seven different federations located in seven different sub-
ecological regions. The Miskito organization of the Miskitos is very fluid and alliances are
often not permanent, usually based on geographic or commercial interests under the leadership
of a Zuqia or Tribal Chief.
* The Garifunas are represented by the Fraternal Organization of Black Hondurans
(Organizaci6n Fraternal Negra Hondure,ia, OFRANEH) although the degree of
representation is much weaker than in the Miskito case, since the communities are highly
dispersed, the population is very large, and the federations have tended to concentrate
decisions in a small percentage of the true leaders of the Garifuna communities. The Garifuna
federations were initially mobilized around specific development funds for social service and
microenterprise support and are only now beginning to develop an agenda that is more
community-organization based.
* The Tawahka have organized the Indigenous Federation of Tawahka (Federaci6n Indigena
Tawahka of Honduras, FITH), but it is also in the process of consolidation.
*  Since 1992, these and all other indigenous organizations and peoples, except for the Chorti
and Islefios, have been members of CONPAH.



Annex 2                                 71
The Indigenous Economy and Land Use
II.   The indigenous peoples in the Atlantic coast and Mosquitia have many ways of using
natural resources. Local knowledge about biota, vegetation, soil, topographical and
meteorological variation forms the basis from which the indigenous communities derive criteria to
make productive decisions. From this knowledge, individuals determine agricultural and
agroforestry sites and activities, the productive calendar, and the selection of species to be
cultivated (corn, rice and beans) or protected (many medicinal plants).
12.   Like many other indigenous groups in Honduras, the indigenous peoples in the project
area are immersed in a double economy: they produce goods for the market and they buy goods
with cash while at the same time, they are heavily involved in a subsistence economy and a
consumption market. Given the nature of their access to land, cash, and subsistence needs, most
adopt a multi-use strategy of appropriation of nature (in buffer and core zones).
Mosquitia
13.   Land and PropertyRights. In the Mosquitia (Miskito, Tawahka, and Pech), there are no
regulations about the assignment and distribution of lands. Historically each indigenous family
has had equal access to land within the community's geographic area. The territory used by
individuals and families includes traditional fishing and hunting areas and sites with concentrations
of medicinal plants and wild foodstuffs. Although, there are some examples of matrilineal
inheritance of land, most communities have a system of patrilineal inheritance. Land was
traditionally transferred to the oldest son, but recently there has been a tendency to transfer land
to the youngest son. Community members also create new parcels of land as needed by clearing
secondary or primary forest, usually plots ranging in size from 5-12 manzanas (1 manzana-O.7
hectares). The action of clearing land legitimates the farmer as owner of the cleared parcel.
14.  In the Mosquitia, there are large areas of unclaimed territory, but not all of it has
agricultural potential. For the most part, the local population has cultivated fields along the fertile
edges of rivers, creeks and lakes. In some cases, they have settled in the area surrounding
wetlands, but they live mostly in the dry, grassy plains, and in the hillsides.
15.   Generally, land parcels are grouped closely together by community members and there is a
shared residence area established away from the cultivated lands. This grouping of parcels is not
just related to the availability of fertile sites, although this is a factor. It is also a means of
promoting cooperation in productive tasks between families. While some parcels are managed
continuously in a rotational swidden cropping cycle, there is also migratory agriculture to distant
fertile areas for limited periods of time. Also, it is common to find that indigenous families have
as many parcels under cultivation as in guamiles.
16.   Fallow-Fields (Guamiles). The selection, clearing, burning, sowing, and harvesting of
fields is culturally regulated through traditional community mechanisms. Fallow lands are called
"guamiles." They may be abandoned for anywhere between two to six years, depending on when
they were cultivated and the distance from the community settlement. The ratio of guamiles to



72                                 Annex 2
cultivated land in an individual family holding is about 3:1. Like other agricultural lands, the
guamiles are the considered the property of the person or family that worked the land and are
inheritable.
17.   Grazing Areas. The subsistence economy of the small towns in the Mosquitia also
includes livestock production, such as the domestic breeding of pigs, chickens, and cows. The
possession of cattle is an sign of wealth and is an important means of social differentiation among
community members. The majority of indigenous families possessing cattle allow them to roam
freely in areas of natural pasture cover. Some families do keep their cattle in pasture areas and in
barnyards, but in general there is a high tolerance of free ranging cattle, even by families that do
not own livestock. Most of the inhabitants of the area who pen their cattle are ladino (non-
indigenous) families. It is therefore likely that the adoption of this practice among some
indigenous families has come from assimilation of ladino livestock practices.
18.   The majority of households use 7-10 ha of land. Even with the rules of open access to
available land for cultivation, most households are not financially viable. Agricultural production
of corn, beans and rice provides the main products for local consumption, but this production only
covers three or four months of family consumption needs. In contrast, production from livestock
and guamiles, together with harvesting of products from the mature forest, generate both
consumption products and those for the market or local trade.
19.   The Miskito Economy. The Miskito are swidden (slash-and burn) horticulturists who
practice agriculture and agroforestry. They also participate to a great extent in fishing and diving
activities, including lobster diving. They grow yucca, bananas, plantains, rice, and more recently,
beans and corn. They practice a rotational system of farming, in which guamiles are returned to
production after resting a number of years, or are managed in the medium term as horticultural or
agroforestry plots with collection of wood and fruits. Small house gardens supplement what is
grown in the fields and hunting and fishing provide much of the fresh meat. Women are more
involved than men in some agricultural activities, particularly the sowing of cashew and cacao, the
harvesting of rice, yucca, and traditional horticultural crops, and the marketing of local foodstuffs.
Very little information is available on the carrying capacity of these systems. Little research has
been done in Honduras on the impact of these practices on the biodiversity and ecological systems
in the project area, making it difficult to anticipate what management decisions should be made in
the core and buffer areas to serve the objective of maintaining biodiversity in the Honduran
portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.
20.   Historically, the economy of the Mosquitia region has been characterized by cycles of
boom and bust, for the most part due to smuggling activities which were concentrated here in the
1800s. This area has a colorful history which is apparent to this day with cyclical economic
activity and high levels of movement of people depending on the location of the current income-
earning activity. As a result, there is little emphasis given to saving income or planning for the
future--the economy of this area is very much driven by day-to-day necessities and attraction of
the newest commercial activity.



Annex 2                                 73
21.   Tawahka and Pech Economies. The Tawahka and Pech practice economic strategies
similar to the Miskitos. They are also swidden farmers, growing root and grain crops for
consumption and sale. Fruit trees, palms and other useful plants are grown in house gardens and
agroforestry plots. They hunt, fish, and raise livestock. Edible and medicinal plants and materials
are harvested from the primary forest and guamiles.
22.   The Tawahka have been involved in commercial activities since the 17th Century. They
traditionally traded dugout canoes, bark-cloth, hammocks, woven bags, pottery, dyes, feathers,
roots, resins, gums and timber with both Miskito and European traders. They harvested
mahogany and collected sarsaparilla during the 18th Century, tapped rubber in the 19th and early
20th Centuries, and more recently have tapped latex from the chicle trees. Very few engaged in
coastal fishing activities. Today, cash cropping and gold panning are also important income
earning activities. Women still make bags, decorative tree gourds, and bark cloth tapestries for an
expanding crafts market.
23.   The Pech living along the Platano River are swidden horticulturalists who primarily
cultivate yucca and corn in fields on high riverbanks near their settlements. They raise some
livestock, but acquire most fresh meat from hunting and fishing. Some Pech sell surplus produce
and game meat to coastal Miskitos. Gold panning is carried out during the dry season in the river
headwaters. Around the town of Culmi, the Pech are more involved in the cash economy,
working as wage laborers.
Atlantic Coast
24.   Garifuna Economy. The Garifuna live primarily along the Atlantic coast in villages with
stores, churches and schools. They fish from dugouts in coastal waters close to the shore with
nets, hooks, and traps. Some Garifuna men work on the commercial fishing boats from the Bay
Islands or on foreign boats. The Garifuna also practice agriculture and tend coconut and yucca
plantations near the coast. They clear fields along the interior waterways to grow rice, beans and
corn for consumption and sale. They hunt and fish in the same forests used by their Miskito
neighbors. The productive role of women and men is strongly divided. Men are responsible for
preparing the land and for fishing, while women are the main cultivators, harvesters, and post-
harvest storers. Women are very involved in marketing and in small crafts and businesses--they
are the main sellers of fish, coconuts, and cassava in the nearby markets.
25.   Garifuna women and men have begun to migrate in large numbers outside of Honduras in
search of better livelihoods. There are many Garifuna living elsewhere in the Caribbean or in the
United States, who have left their children with other family members or neighbors while they
accrue enough financial resources to support a family. These children grow up with relatively
loose supervision, and there is a growing problem of how to integrate these children into
productive activities in the communities when their main interest is to move away to live with
their parents.



74                                 Annex 2
Non-Indigenous People
26.   In the Mosquitia, the early ladinos who settled in the area largely adopted the traditional
subsistence and commercial activities practiced by the local indigenous people. In the 1950s,
however, as loggers opened up the western flank of the Mosquitia, more ladinos flooded into the
region. Most them currently depend almost entirely on farming for consumption and sale. Due to
this dependency, the amount of land cleared for agriculture tends to be greater than that utilized
by the indigenous people. Average farm sizes range from 20 to 60 manzanas (1 manzana = 0.7
hectare), although some farmers have as many as 200 manzanas under production.
27.   Some ladinos practice traditional swidden agriculture and may plant coffee and cacao as a
primary cash crop. The overwhelming majority of ladinos are landless farmers who clear the
forest for subsistence farming for two or three years and then they sell their plots to cattle
ranchers and land speculators, pushing on into the forest to clear new lands and repeat the cycle.
There are a growing number of larger ladino landowners, either newcomers or entrepreneurs who
have amassed lands sold to them by these subsistence farmers.
28.   Along the Atlantic coast and the Cordillera Nombre de Dios, there is an older pattern of
ladino settlement and migration, although this pattern mentioned above continues at a fairly
aggressive pace. Larger landowners concentrate their holdings in the lower elevation
characterized by more fertile lands or extensive pasture areas, thereby encouraging long-term
residents to sell out and clear on the nearby hillsides. New landless ladinos are also arriving,
clearing parcels for a short time and then selling out and moving on to new frontiers. While the
Mosquitia area is still relatively remote and the majority of the ladinos have little access to
infrastructure, social services, or technological information, this population is rapidly assimilating
a culture similar to the urban Hondurans, along with aspirations for a more material lifestyle. In
this area, many families live in a continual state of indebtedness, with few economic opportunities
to reverse this situation. Clearing new land is therefore an ever attractive option.
Gender
29.   There are a number of aspects of gender which require a specific project design focus to
achieve the stated objectives and reach the range of beneficiaries in the project area. One aspect,
for which there is little micro-level information is the gender aspects of poverty. In Honduras
overall, close to 30 percent of households are female-headed (M6dulo Mujer y Empleo de
Encuesta de Hogares de Marzo 1993), 15 percent of all poor households are female-headed, 66.7
percent of all female-headed households are below the poverty line (SECPLAN/ OIT/FNUAP.
1990). Female-headed households below the poverty line have specific problems of access to land
tenure, as do women in households of common law marriages. Many of the female-headed
households in the upland areas are on lands of forest vocation, which is not appropriate for title.
Limited access to family labor makes it difficult for women in these households to cultivate larger
areas of land and limnited capital makes it difficult for them to purchase land. Women in common
law marriages also face differential access because, under Honduran law, common law spouses do
not have access to formal documentation of the union. It is therefore difficult for male spouses to



Annex 2                                75
include their common law wives on titling documents for joint title, even when the couple has
children and can demonstrate joint occupancy over a long period of time.
30.  In the indigenous communities, women have a much more equal participation in the
productive activities than in the non-indigenous communities. While men undertake heavy labor
tasks of land preparation, women are key in sowing, weeding, harvesting, and collection of wild
foodstuffs. Women are not as involved in fishing and diving as men, but are involved in
marketing of fish. Wives and mothers of lobster divers are very concerned about the health
problems related to diving with inadequate equipment and they can be strong lobbyists to
encourage men to move to the swidden areas and abandon diving as a livelihood. Women's
political involvement in formal federations and community organizations is more limited than men,
both for indigenous and non-indigenous families. Part of the strategy of the buffer zone activities
will be to encourage women and women's organizations to participate in the dialogue on
protected areas planning and management. Women can have a strong stake in protection, given
their relatively greater dependence on the traditional territories and limited migration for labor
outside. This opportunity should be tapped in the promotion of community involvement in
protected areas activities. Along the Atlantic coast, women are also likely to be key actors in
ecotourism activities (preparation of food for tourists, sale of handicrafts and local products,
managing and working in hotels and hostels, etc.).
Key Social Issues for Project Design
Land Tenure
31.   Demarcation of ProtectedAreas. For indigenous populations, there are constraints to
registration of indigenous land and forest rights under the modern system of land registration
proposed in the Rural Land Management Project. These constraints are due to the lack of legal
identity of most of the first-tier indigenous community organizations that comprise ethnic
federations and to the overlapping rights of Spanish descendants with indigenous land rights,
dating back to the colonial period. As in other countries of Latin America, Honduran indigenous
groups are increasingly electing the communal title option to help preserve tenure to traditional
territories. Communal title also has implications for forest tenure as indigenous populations are
more likely to legitimate title to forest areas within their territories when entire domain is titled
communally. Otherwise such areas are considered national forests owned by the state in this case,
the State Forestry Administration/Corporation for Forestry Development (AFE-COHDEFOR).
Local Capacity
32.   ProtectedAreas Management and Use. Except for a few, small scale pilot initiatives in
community forest management, such as those implemented with the Organization for the
Development of the Mosquitia (MOPAWI), Canadians and other agencies in recent donor and
NGO programs, there has not been a systematic process of determining the relative rights and
interests of communities residing in and around protected areas or for allocating traditional and
other forest-based products. There is likely to be heavy pressure on the core and buffer zones by
populations that are forced to expand to meet their consumption needs. This is especially the case



76                                 Annex 2
among the poorer families, which do not have access to technologies for better soil and water
management, more intensive production, or alternative economic activities at the household or
cooperative level. At present, most of the indigenous communities are highly dependent on the
core and buffer zones as sources of wild animals and plants for home use and local markets. Even
with the planned technical assistance and buffer zone investments, there is no guarantee that local
people will agreed to stop using resources in restricted areas. This warrants a strategy that
monitors the impact of use and experiments with alternatives to complete closure of areas that are
important for hunting or other extractive activities.
33. Role of Community Based-Organizations and Small Farmers' Groups. The role of
indigenous traditional organizations and productive organizations is very significant in the buffer
zones in terms of political representation (MASTA, FITH, FETRICH and OFRANEH) but not
for initiatives related to productive activities or marketing. It is unlikely that indigenous
organizations will initially have the organizational and technical capacity for active representation
in the local committees for protected areas management (Consejos Locales de Areas Protegidas,
COLAP) which will be the mechanism for participation in protected areas management planning
and implementation. Careful monitoring of participation in the COLAP is needed in order to
make adjustments made to the training component to build the needed local capacity. Another
serious concern is the lack of agricultural self-sufficiency in the indigenous communities; during
the non-agricultural season, at least one family member needs to migrate to seek temporary
employment. This can make consistent participation and decision-making in protected areas
management difficult.
34. Participation in Decision-Making and Implementation. The series of workshops and
research carried out during preparation identified a number of constraints to participation in both
the design of government programs and their implementation. Constraints include: the lack of
knowledge of government activities by more remote communities; the lack of formal property
rights of buffer zone inhabitants which thereby excludes them from specific programs, and the
lack of institutional and financial capacity of municipal governments to design and implement
long-term development programs.
Implementation Capacity
35.   Project Management Capacity to ImplementParticipation Plan. There is little social
science or participatory planning and implementation expertise in the various departments within
AFE-COHDEFOR that would ensure a comprehensive vision for implementing the Participation
Plan or provide guidance to implementing staff and NGOs. The NGOs present in the area have an
interest in social issues, but little community-capacity building expertise or experience. While the
National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agraria, NA), which works with AFE-
COHDEFOR on land rights issues, has considerable experience with field adjudication of land
tenure rights, there is no INA department or other government agency responsible for indigenous
policy. INA's only capacity in this area of expertise is the presence of a few staff lawyers
interested in the issue. Nor is there a clear responsibility for gender or indigenous issues within
the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) to generate a longer-term sustainability of
activities in these agencies.



Annex 2                                 77
36.   Gender. Men and women have differential access to land and agricultural and forestry
production support services, as well as different needs for information and technologies. The lack
of attention to gender differences limited identification and pursuit of some rural development
opportunities. One problem area is land titling access of women farmers. Though women
represent an important group among rural producers, they traditionally received minimum benefits
from the land titling program or from agriculture or forestry services. While more women are
receiving land titles since the Agricultural Modernization Law recognized the rights to title of
female landholders, many women farm land classified as areas of forest vocation that cannot be
legally titled. In addition, common law marriages are not documented in Honduran law and
couples of such unions are not eligible for joint titling, with the result that male spouses are the
only household members to receive title.
37.   Another issue is how to ensure that women as well as men are recipients of training,
technical assistance, and buffer zone investments directed to their needs and interests. Family
labor impacts of changed farming technologies and impact of forestry enterprises on gender
division of labor are neither well understood or taken into account by all private or NGO technical
assistance service providers. There is a tendency in Honduras to provide more information to
men than women on agricultural practices related to planting, weeding, and management of pests
and fungi, although in the case of indigenous communities are those responsible for these stages
of the cropping cycle. There is also a tendency to give training to adult men rather than
incorporating women and children who may be more likely to undertake an activity. Both women
and men were found in the surveys to be concerned with storage of grains, access to improved
farm tools, and access to timely capital for new processes and inputs. It is important that the
project incorporate both men and women in the discussion of solutions and in the identification of
training and investments.
Participation Plan and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
38.   The Participation Plan and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan were developed to
address the issues raised above and the objectives of the Operational Directive on Indigenous
People.2 The target group includes not only indigenous groups but marginal producers and
women. In particular, the participation strategy aims to: (a) mitigate against the potential sector
and project-related conflicts described above; and (b) promote the involvement of indigenous
peoples, women, and other low-income producers in protected areas management and protection.
39.   To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Participation Plan and Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan include following actions in the areas of implementation capacity, gender,
protected areas management, participation in project activities, and community development. A
breakdown by project component and budget is listed in Table 1.
2  World Bank Operational Manual, Operational Directive on Indigenous People, 1991 (OD 4.20).



78                                 Annex 2
Implementation Capacity
40.   SAG would contract a specialist in social and participation issues for the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Rural Land Management Project who would coordinate a series
of specific actions with PCU of the biodiversity project and oversee incorporation of these issues
into the project components, implementation of the elements of the participation plan, and
supervision of consultants contracted to undertake special studies or specific participation or
consultation activities. This specialist would also work with AFE-COHDEFOR, advising the unit
on how best to coordinate attention to these issues within SAG and suggesting staffing needs.
This specialist should be supplemented by an additional consultant specialist that can provide
inputs to the Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) and the Promotion and
Extension Department of AFE-COHDEFOR. One source of participation support is the newly
created Center for Training and Research on Environment and Sustainable Forestry Development
in Lepaterique that is holding courses for communities interested in local forest management.
Gender
41.   To address the overall lack of a. gender orientation in the activities of the SAG agencies
involved in the project, a program of gender training would be designed and implemented. This
training program would be targeted to all professional and technical personnel of the public
institutions responsible for the coordination and implementation of the components, to private
development organizations and NGOs providing services in the rural areas, especially through the
Upland Producers' Fund. Both private development organizations and NGOs would need to
receive training as a condition to be eligible to provide services, the cost of training would be their
responsibility. The program would be under the PCU and would be implemented by the Pan-
American Agricultural School -- El Zamorano -- where a permanent information network would
be set up for service training providers at national and Central American levels. Training would be
aimed to address specific detected needs of each component.
42.   The criteria for selection of proposals for the Upland Fund would also include preference
for technical assistance targeted explicitly to women farmer and forest managers. INA and CSJ
have agreed to evaluate the restrictions on joint titling of common law couples and to present an
action plan for increasing women's access to land. Project performance indicators have also
included to measure progress on the incorporation of gender concerns.
Protected Areas Management, Land Tenure and Management
43.   As part of the protected areas management component, the option of delimiting
indigenous lands for agricultural and residential use may be considered, as well as zones for
traditional use for collection of forest products and for community forestry. The legal study
evaluated three options for indigenous land tenure titling within the Honduran legal framework:
individual, communal, and usufruct contract. Based on the findings of the draft study, GOH has
decided to further evaluate these options and may opt to apply a blend of communal title for use
areas and usufruct contacts for lands with no clear evidence of ancestral domain. This model has
been piloted in the Punta Sal Protected Area buffer zone in coastal Garifuna communities.



Annex 2                                79
* Within the Rural Land Management Project component for land administration, initiate
possible models for adjudication of indigenous lands and incorporate these into the expansion
phase of the land administration component outside of Comayagua department.
44.   Include coordination with an ongoing Institutional Development Fund Grant (IDF) for
Strengthening of Indigenous Institutions in Honduras which is targeting all the indigenous
organizations which are members of CONPAH. The grant provides resources for capacity-
building in a number of areas related to natural resources management and land tenure.
Indigenous groups seek training in local planning and design of development initiatives, technical
and business management tools to evaluate their capacity to undertake forestry-based enterprises,
tools for community forestry management, including sites in and around protected areas, and
training in legal aspects of individual and communal land tenure systems to enable members to
make more educated decisions about the type of land tenure which would most benefit themselves
and their families. The outputs of the IDF include building capacity of indigenous groups to make
proposals to the Upland Fund and to participate more pro-actively in forest management and
protected areas activities.
Participation in Protected Areas Management
45.   The project will support the creation of regional committees for protected areas
management (Consejos Regionales de Areas Protegidas, CORAPs) and local committees for
protected areas management (Consejos Locales de Areas Protegidas, COLAPs) which will
coordinate training inputs at the regional and protected areas level, and the local committees will
also prioritize requests for buffer zone activities. During project implementation, the COLAPs
and CORAPs will be the focus point for participatory involvement in decision-making and
carrying out of activities. Regional DAPVS offices and the CORAP/COLAP will coordinate
complementary activities funded by Fundaci6n VIDA.
* To ensure that all the stakeholders will be incorporated into the protected areas planning and
management process, training resources will be made available at the regional level for NGO
staff, members of regional councils (CORAP), and other organizations.
* Training and capacity building resources will be made available at the local-level to strengthen
the capacity of the members of the COLAP and the COLAP itself as an entity.
* COLAP will be encouraged to recruit a variety of community members to serve as local
protected areas guards, including women, poor producers and indigenous people.
*  Environmental education materials will be designed to promote broad participation in
protected areas management and to increase the awareness of the value of greater community
participation in management activities.



80                                 Annex 2
Community Development and Use of Resources
46.   Prioritize addressing subsistence and small-farm production problems before introducing
recommendations related to cash-generating farming systems through the Upland Producers Fund
Subprojects. Build on the development experience of NGOs and indigenous communities in the
buffer zones, starting with actions designed to provide food security and advancing to broader
actions of sustainable buffer zones management and development of community-based
organizations such as the general assembly of each local community (first-tier organizations).
47.   Support conservation-enhancing economic activities in an integrated way in the buffer
zone investment activities, considering not only the need to improve production, but also
processing and marketing issues. Since the selection of subprojects for the buffer zones will be
demand-driven (emerging from the management plans prepared with COLAP, See Annex 5), it is
important that the project beneficiaries reflect the range of indigenous and non-indigenous
populations in the project area and the range of types of projects of interest to different
stakeholders (different ethnicities, different production systems, gender-related criteria,
opportunities created by ecotourism, etc.).
Consensus Building on Buffer Zone Concept
48.   As part of the building of a national biodiversity strategy, the BPAP will support a process
of workshops at the regional and local levels to discuss the core and buffer zone concepts and
develop local solutions in order to adapt these management concepts to the needs of the local
population. This process should lead to a more participatory strategy for wildlife and biota
management in buffer and core areas where there is traditional use or resources. It should also
identify areas requiring biological monitoring to measure the potential impact of social activities
on biodiversity within the protected areas.
49.   Develop a strategy for community sanctions that will be applied to producers clearing new
areas and/or selling existing plots to newcomers and moving further into the frontier in violation
of management plan agreements as well as sanctions that will be applied to producers violating
agreements on fishing rights as outlined in the management plans. This strategy should draw
upon sanctions being applied in the pilot programs being implemented by NGOs and AFE-
COHDEFOR in the Broadleaf Forest project area of the Atlantic coast.
Biological Monitoring
*  Design and establish an information system with local computer connections for each
protected area, allowing communities access to information with the capacity to add to the
biological information base.
*  Participatory installation of the biological appraisal for community monitoring and the social
studies of human managed forest systems.

Strengthening of DAPVS and Local
Capacity for Protected Areas Management Component
Objective. Strengthen the institutional capacity of the institutions and organizations that make up
SINAPH in the management and administration of the key protected areas in the MBC.
Specific Objectives:
(a) Strengthen the technical, logistical, operational, administrative and management capacity of
the Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) in protected areas management.
(b) Build local capacity and support the participation of local governments, rural communities,
and NGOs in protected areas management and protection with consensus-building on SINAPH .
Geographical and Institutional Context
1.    The institutional strengthening will focus on the communities and organizations located in
the regions with the key protected areas. Specific actions will be carried out at the local and
regional levels and it is expected that this component will have an impact at the national level with
overall strengthening of SINAPH.
2.    The main beneficiaries of this component are all the public or private institutions involved
directly or indirectly in the management of protected areas, including:
* Community-based organizations, cooperatives, clubs, and associations;
o Ethnic organizations representing Garifuna, Pech, Tawahka, Miskito;
o Private industry;
* Local, national, and international NGOs;
* Government institutions: AFE-COHDEFOR, SERNA, INA, SAG, Ministry of Education; and
* Municipal governments.
3.    This component will be implemented through the coordination mechanism agreed with
DAPVS in the document entitled "Institutional Model of the System of Protected Areas of
Honduras (SINAPH)." SINAPH is a multi-sectoral system and its sustainability will depend on
the active and direct participation of all the different sectors involved. This involvement needs to
go beyond consultation to allow for participation in decision-making. Based on this idea,
organizations for participation have been created at different levels: the National Council of
Protected Areas; the regional committees for protected areas management (CORAPs) and the
local committees for protected areas management (COLAPs) .



Annex 3                                83
Background and Justification
4.    In the process of consolidation of SINAPH several problems were identified that may
affect its ability to balance the needs of development and biodiversity conservation. This
component was designed to address the issues that may limit the establishment and later
strengthening of the system. These problems include:
* The weak institutional presence of AFE-COHDEFOR and limited resources available to
increase their leadership capacity on the environment which seriously limits the effectiveness
of the management of SINAPH.
* A lack of shared understanding about the actual situation of the components of SINAPH
which makes the orientation, establishment of technical and legal norms, and prioritization of
management difficult.
* The weak management capacity of DAPVS is strongly affected by a high demand for scarce
resources (human, technical, logistical, etc.).
* The low priority given to strategic planning which results in most of the protected areas
lacking legal documentation or plans for their organization and management.
Due to these institutional weaknesses, the following actions have been incorporated in this
component:
* Identification and application of appropriate coordination mechanisms and participation of
public institutions and the private sector with creation of conditions that allow for this
interaction.
*  Activities including, integration of priority actions, gathering information, analysis of data,
evaluation of existing management conditions, and diffusion of information and promotion of
the participation of civil society.
* Institutional strengthening of all the organizations that make up the organizational structure of
the system (DAPVS, NGOs, municipalities, community-based organizations, etc.) with
information on administrative procedures, and training human resources for the consolidation
of the system.
* Follow-up on the organization of the conceptual framework that provides direction for
DAPVS in the process of consolidation of S1NAPH.
Institutional Framework of SINAPH
5.    According to the current legal framework of AFE-COHDEFOR, protected areas
administration and management is the responsibility of DAPVS and SINAPH will be consolidated
under the national conservation objectives. With the new institutional framework proposed,
SINAPH includes AFE-COHDEFOR and other government institutions such as, the Secretariat
of Natural Resources and the Environment (SERNA), the Secretariat of Agriculture and



84                                 Annex 3
Livestock (SAG); National Agrarian Institute (INA); Honduran Institute of Tourism (IHT),
Honduran Institute of Coffee (IHCAFE); Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History
(IHAH), the Association of Municipalities of Honduras (AMHON), and representatives of NGOs
and ethnic groups.
6.    The institutional capacity of SINAPH with respect to protected areas management and
administration is limited by operational, technical, and budgetary restrictions and the lack of a
political and legal framework for conservation and community participation. Currently, DAPVS
has 74 employees including technical, service, and administrative personnel. To execute their
functions, they share the equipment of the other departments of AFE-COHDEFOR, illustrating
that the physical resources assigned to them are less than those required.
7.    Local organizations, NGOs, and municipalities lack the institutional capacity that would
allow them to become involved in the process of protected areas management and participate in
the decision-making process. This weakness has an impact on the behavior and attitudes of the
communities living in the buffer zones since local community members have not been trained or
involved in any decisions and DAPVS is restricting their presence in these areas. Currently, the
communities do not have any participation channels available to involve them in the process of
protected areas management.
8.    The weak institutional capacity of SINAPH has resulted in: (a) a lack of information
about norms and procedures for protected areas management; (b) with the lack of resources, the
results and products are few; (c) there is no information regarding the value of the protected areas
and therefore, Honduran society does not internalize their importance; and (d) appropriate
coordination mechanisms do not exist.
Social Participation
9.    At present, the participation of civil society in protected areas management is weak due to
a lack of policies and clear mechanisms for participation and a weak institutional capacity in the
public and private sector and in the community-based organizations. The Biodiversity in Priority
Areas Project has as its fundamental objective, to support the integrity and sustainability of the
Honduran section of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, parts of which support human
productive activity.
10.   Experiences in natural resource management at the national and international levels
illustrate that the adequate consideration of social issues allows for greater sustainability of
actions and conservation of natural resources. If the local communities do not have a stake in the
necessity of conservation of their enviromnent, there will be pressure on these areas from external
actors seeking access to resources, resulting in damage that may be irreversible.
11.   This project will incorporate all the stakeholders in the management and conservation of
natural resources, including public and private organizations, community-based organizations,
ethnic organizations, and municipalities. In the institutional strengthening component, the
participation activities will be organized, so that each actor is aware of their role and of the shared
global objective that they are working towards.



Annex 3                                 85
12.   The participation of local communities will be facilitated through the establishment of
COLAPs for coordination, support, follow-up, and consultation regarding the strategies, plans,
conservation programs, and sustainable development activities. Each of the four groupings of
protected areas will form a COLAP with representatives from the public and private institutions
and organizations that have a direct relationship with the protection and management of the
protected areas. The integration of the local committees will also facilitate inter-institutional and
inter-community coordination and allow for fulfillment of the objectives for each protected area.
Main Activities
13.   The main beneficiary of these activities is SINAPH and the institutions that make up the
System at the operational, managerial, and strategic levels. To achieve the objectives proposed in
this component, project resources will be used to strengthen the different organizations that will
make up the institutional model of SINAPH . Emphasis is given to the operational level since
problems need to be addressed from the local perspective, with attention paid to the necessities
and demands of the population living in the buffer zones of the protected areas. At the national
level, DAPVS, a key institution for the adequate functioning of SINAPH will be strengthened.
The main activities of this component include:
14.   Training. Implementation of a training program on topics related to protected area
management, including planning, social participation, administration of resources, and monitoring
and implementation of work programs. This program would provide training to the principal
actors for project implementation. The objective is to ensure their capacity and knowledge to
participate in biodiversity planning and conservation and to fulfill their roles and responsibilities.
The program will also enhance the sustainability of project activities and support the institutions
involved as they develop internal and external training programs.
15.   Three levels of training would be provided: (a) Management of the SINAPH. Training
both the personnel of DAPVS who are responsible for the functioning of SINAPH and for the
organizations responsible for day-to-day management of the project's protected areas. (b)
Trainingfor participating organizations, including: (i) the newly established regional committees
for protected areas management (CORAPs), (ii) the park administrators of the project's protected
areas (primarily, NGO personnel), and (iii) the implementation of an environmental education
program in primary schools in the project area buffer zones. (c) Trainingfor local management.
Training for the newly established local committees for protected areas management (COLAPs)
in their leadership and conflict resolution roles for local participation in planning and management
of protected areas and buffer zones. In addition, this latter activity would finance orientation
seminars for volunteers in the park's volunteer program. Details of the training program are
provided in Annex 3A.
16.   Technical Assistance. Technical assistance will address the following areas: design of
evaluation and control mechanisms for protected areas management activities; design and
implementation of mechanisms for the capture of financial resources; programs to market
ecotourism and the protected areas; social participation and management of buffer zones; strategic
planning; monitoring and evaluation; and development and application of technical norms and



86                                 Annex 3
regulations which will provide adequate protection without creating disincentives for the
management and conservation of the protected areas
17.   Logistical and Operational Support. The minimum requirements of vehicles and
equipment for the adequate management of the four groupings of protected areas will be
provided. The three DAPVS regional offices and the central office which will be responsible for
project implementation will also be equipped with the necessary items such as computers, printers,
desks, photocopiers, other office materials and equipment for the field including vehicles, radios,
and implements for the protection and maintenance of the limits of the protected areas. These
items will be made available for use by members of the COLAPs.
18.   Promotion, Participation, Public Consultation, and Institutional and Community
Organization. This activity will support the proposed institutional framework for SINAPH with
the participation of civil society in protected areas management with the organization and proper
functioning of CORAPs, COLAPs, and the National Council of Protected Areas. Greater
emphasis will be given to the establishment of the COLAPs that will make up the operational level
of SINAPH . It is expected that gradually and when the social and institutional conditions allow,
the regional committees will be established which will have, as their social base, the consolidation
of the COLAPs.

Annex 3A
Training Program
1.    The objective of the training program is to ensure that the principal actors involved in the
implementation of the Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project have the capacity to: (a) participate
effectively in the planning and conservation of biodiversity activities; (b) fulfill their roles and
responsibilities in the execution of the project; and (c) sustain the achievements of the project
after it closes. The training program will also develop a continuous training program for DAPVS
on biodiversity conservation.
2.    The Training Program consists of three components at three levels of action. They
include:
(a) Training the Functionaries of the SINAPH. Train DAPVS staff and the staff of the
protected areas of the project who are responsible for the management of the system of protected
areas.
(b) Training the Participating Organizations and NGOs. Train the regional committees
for protected areas management (CORAPs) and the administrators of the protected areas (the
majority are NGOs) that will provide direct services in the management of the protected areas of
the project and carry out a program of environmental education in the schools near the protected
areas of the project.
(c) Local Training. Train the local committees for protected areas management
(COLAPs) that will be responsible for effective local participation in the planning and protection
of the protected areas and buffer zones. There will also be training for the local volunteers that
will participate in management of the areas.
3.    These training activities do not include all of the local training that will be financed by the
project. The subprojects financed by the Buffer Zone Component and by the Upland Producers
Fund (financed by the Rural Land Management Project) will also include significant investments
in training (see Annex 5).
The Training Program
4.    Training the Functionaries of the SINAPH. This subcomponent will finance technical
assistance, workshops, courses, materials, and operational costs (expenses, travel, supplies,
printing, etc.). The main activities to be supported include the following.
5.    The design of a training program to support DAPVS to define a continuous internal
training program and training activities for the other key actors involved in the management of the
SINAPH. The internal training program will focus on improving and maintaining the professional
abilities of DAPVS staff and other functionaries at the level of the protected areas. The design of
the program will also include the training of the administrators and technicians of the participating
organizations (mainly NGOs) that manage the protected area under agreements with AFE-



88                                   Annex 3A
COHDEFOR (under the subcomponent Training Participating Organizations and NGOs). The
four principal themes of the training will be social, technical, administrative, and legal aspects.
The program will include a series of courses of one or two weeks that will be based on the terms
of reference of the personnel working at each of the different levels (central and regional offices
and protected areas). The program will finance workshops and information seminars lasting one
to three days on current issues and develop training courses on local participation in the protected
areas.
6.    There will be training for the administrators and technicians of DAPVS and the NGOs
involved in protected areas management. The training will include: (a) an average of two weeks
of training courses per year per person for four years; (b) 10 grants for functionaries to attend
short courses (3 to 4 months), regionally or internationally; (c) initial training of six weeks for
new park guards and an average of two weeks of training per year per park guard for the next
three years; and (d) training on current issues of interest for the personnel of DAPVS, NGOs,
local governments, and other relevant actors--1O workshops or national seminars, 20 workshops
or regional seminars, and 40 workshops or seminars at the level of the protected areas. The
quantity of functionaries trained during the five years of the project will be 36 (6 at the central
level, 2 for each region--8 total, and 2 for each protected areas--total of 223) for a total of 288
weeks of training. The number of park guards that will be trained during the five years will be 60
for a total of 720 weeks of training. The training topics for the functionaries will be distributed
into the following categories: 45 percent administration; 50 percent technical (including social);
and 5 percent legal. For the park guards, it will be distributed into 80 percent technical and 20
percent administrative/legal. At least 1,350 persons (an average of 25 in each national workshop,
20 in each regional workshop, and 15 in the local workshops) will attend the informational
seminars and workshops.
7.    Ten DAPVS staff will be able to participate in international training events in order to
meet with and exchange information with professionals from other countries. This will also
finance the costs of reproducing and distributing the reports from the event that each participant
will develop to disseminate the results of the event.
8.    A program of in-service training will be developed to offer support and training to the
technical and administrative personnel in the implementation of new activities that they have little
experience with, for example, the participatory planning activities. This support will be provided
in specific locations or local offices and will be available for the personnel of DAPVS and the
NGOs that manage the protected areas. Twenty months (three months in each region) will be
financed.
9.    Development of a simple manual with procedures and guidelines for each member of the
CORAPs and COLAPs. These manuals will help the members to understand their roles and
3The majority of the 22 functionanes trained at the level of protected areas will be from NGOs. In many cases, NGOs
are responsible for management of the protected areas including admstration and management of the areas under
comenios with AFE-COHDEFOR They should receive the same training (material and intensity) as the staff of
DAPVS receives at the level of a protected area, and in a continuous training program to maintain their professional
abilities.

responsibilities and will provide current information on legal and political changes and other
important information. It can also be used to orient new members to the COLAPs and CORAPs.
10.   Training the Participating Organizations and NGOs. This subcomponent will finance
technical assistance, workshops, courses, equipment, materials, operational costs (expenses,
travel, supplies, printing) and recurrent costs (maintenance of equipment) and costs for
dissemination through mass communication. The principal activities will include the following.
11.   Training NGOs involved in protected areas management by offering an intensive 3 week
training course during the second year of the project. This training is in addition to the training
they will receive as staff of the SINAPH. The training will be designed to respond to the issues
they themselves have identified. The administrators and technicians will also attend workshops
and seminars on current issues carried out by the subcomponent.
12.   Training the Functionaries of the SINAPH. Twelve administrators will be trained (one
for each protected area) with a total of 36 weeks of training. An estimate of the time spent on
topics in the training is 55 percent administration, 30 percent technical (including social), and 15
percent legal.
13.   Training the CORAPs. Training courses of two or three days will be offered to the
leaders of the four CORAPs. On average, nine people per year will receive a week of training for
each CORAP. The courses will focus on the internal regulations of the CORAPs, the legal
framework of the protected areas, values of the protected areas, and conflict resolution. The
CORAPs will receive on-site training by promoters that will accompany them during their
meetings for the first several years of the project. The members of the CORAPs will attend
workshops and seminars on current issues carried out by the subcomponent Training the
Functionaries of the SINAPH. Finally, three exchange trips with neighboring countries in Central
America will be planned during implementation to allow 15 members of each CORAP to learn
about other experiences. Each land-based trip will last five days.
14.   A Environmental Education Program will support a variety of activities focused on civil
society and the role of the protected areas and buffer zones in preserving biodiversity. The
majority of these efforts will be with primary school students. A radio program with
environmental education programming for all the project areas will complement these programs.
Educational materials will be developed to be used in the schools and approximately 40 teachers
will be trained in five-day courses. The training courses will introduce the materials to the
teachers and provide guidance as they integrate these materials in the normal curriculum of the
schools. One thousand environmental education texts will be distributed; 200 students will visit
the protected areas (25 trips) and at least 16 educational programs will be transmitted by radio.
15.   Local Training. This subcomponent will finance technical assistance, courses,
workshops, materials, and operational costs (expenses, travel, supplies, printing, etc.) The
principal activities will include the following.
16.   Training the COLAPs. There will be training courses of two to three days for the leaders
of the 11 COLAPs. An average of 6 persons per year will receive approximately one week of



90                              Annex 3A
training. The courses will focus on the internal regulations of the COLAPs, the legal framework
of the protected areas, values of the protected areas, and conflict resolution. The COLAPs will
also receive on site training by promoters that wili accompany them in their meetings during years
one and two of the project. There will be six workshops and local seminars on current topics
suggested by the COLAP members, in addition to the local workshops carried out under the
subcomponent Training the Functionaries of the SINAPH.
17.   The volunteers who will be providing support to DAPVS and the participating
organizations will be given an orientation to the program. A total of 150 volunteers will receive
two days of orientation about the SINAPH (the role of the volunteer, procedures, biological
values, and natural history of the area) for a total of 300 days of training.
Institutional Arrangements
18.   DAPVS will have responsibility for the implementation of the Training Program. They
will be supported by the Department of Promotion and Extension for program design and at the
regional level, by the social promoters in organizing and carrying out the activities with the local
and regional management committees. They will also work with the coordinator of the DAPVS
project in the development of terms of reference and the contracting of consultants, trainers, and
other service providers. DAPVS will ensure the programrning of the activities in the annual
operational plans of the protected areas. Funds will be channeled to DAPVS through AFE-
COHDEFOR from the budget for the implementation of the annual operating plan.
19.   The subcomponent Training the Functionaries of the SINAPH will be administered
directly by DAPVS through a series of subcontracts and all activities will be programmed through
the annual operating plan. The implementation will occur through direct contracts with
institutions (for example, ESNACIFOR, CURLA, CATIE), companies, NGOs, and individual
consultants. DAPVS will have responsibility for supervising implementation.
20.   The subcomponent Training of the Participating Organizations and the NGOs will be
administered directly by DAPVS will all the activities programmed through the annual operating
plan. The implementation will be through subcontracts. The subcontracts will be with
institutions, companies, NGOs, or individual consultants. DAPVS will be responsible for
supervising the implementation, with the regional offices of DAPVS providing local supervision,
supported by those groups receiving the training.
21.   The subcomponent Local Training will be administered directly by the regional offices of
DAPVS will all the activities programmed through the annual operating plan. The
implementation will be through direct subcontracts with NGOs or institutions with a presence in
the project areas. In total four subcontracts will be distributed depending on accessibility and the
presence of organizations. DAPVS will have responsibility for supervising implementation and
the regional offices will provide local supervision with support from the COLAPs.

Annex 4
Management of Globally Important Protected Areas Component
Objective. Improved participatory management.of the key protected areas that make up the
Honduran section of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, development of management plans,
and demarcation and delimitation of areas with support and coordination from the local
committees for protected areas management (COLAPs) to be established.
Specific Objectives
(a) Place the key protected areas of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor under management
plans with the necessary studies for their legal demarcation, delimitation in the most critical parts,
and the construction of the infrastructure necessary for management.
(b) Through the local committees, support the participation of the local governments, NGOs, and
community-based organizations in protected areas management and protection.
(c) Establish an adequate institutional presence of DAPVS in the key protected areas with the
capacity for management and administration.
Geographic Context
1.    The project and specifically this component will carry out actions in the four groupings of
protected areas, which have been prioritized, through participatory.processes as part of the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. These areas are listed below:
a  Cordillera de Nombre de Dios: the protected areas of Pico Bonito and Texiguat;
*  Patuca/Tawahka: the protected areas of Tawahka and Patuca;
*  Atlantida Wetlands: the protected areas of Punta Sal, Punta Izopo, and Cuero y Salado; and
*  Mosquitia: the protected areas of Laguna de Caratasca, Rus-Rus, Warunta, and Mocoron.
2.    These protected areas are located in the northern and eastern part of the country in the
departments of Atlantida, Gracias de Dios, and Olancho. In total, the area covers approximately
1.5 million hectares. According to studies carried out by the World Conservation Monitoring
Center, this region contains areas which are relatively intact and are. the largest areas of tropical
forest and greatest biodiversity in the country
Background and Justification
3.    Legal Framework. The National System of the Protected Areas of Honduras (SINAPH)
was established in 1993 with the General Environment Law (Decreto No. 104-93). The System
consists of 107 protected areas, approximately 2.5 million hectares and nearly 24 percent of the
national territory. These areas are grouped into ten management categories. Only 42 out of 107
have a solid legal definition (see Table 1).

4.    According to the current law, DAPVS, part of AFE-COHDEFOR, is responsible for the
management and administration of the protected areas of Honduras.
5.    The areas with more protection are located in the sparsely populated areas in the
northeastern part of the country. These protected areas have been identified to be priority areas
for Central America and are part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The Central
American Presidents have prioritized these areas to carry out conservation efforts at the regional
level. These areas are geographically connected to the protected areas of Nicaragua and form the
largest block of tropical forests in Central America.
6.    Protected Areas and Deforestation. The loss of biodiversity due to the continual
degradation of the natural resources has forced Honduras to quickly increase, in an unorganized
fashion, the surface area of forests and other areas under the protected areas denomination.
Currently, it is estimated that the forested surface in Honduras is between 48 to 58 percent of the
total surface of the country and Honduras is the second largest country in Central America after
Nicaragua in terms of forested area and forest cover. Nearly 25 percent of the forests of Central
America are found in Honduras.
7.    The protected areas represent nearly 24 percent of the national territory, but it is estimated
that approximately 30 to 50 percent have already been converted into lands for agriculture or
cattle use. More than 75 percent of this loss has occurred in the last 30 years. Although accurate
facts on deforestation do not exist, it is estimated that approximately 100,000 hectares are
deforested annually.
8.    The principal causes of deforestation are the expansion of subsistence agriculture and
cattle raising, mainly in the lowland areas of the tropical forests. In the pine forests, there is
degradation not deforestation due to over-exploitation of wood, forest fires, conversion to
pasture land, and firewood coliection,



Annex 4                                 93
9.    The principal difficulty related to conservation in Honduras is the accelerated loss of
biodiversity. This problem is extremely complex since there are many biological and social
variables involved in the different regions. Generally, the direct causes of the problem have been
identified as: (a) insufficient social value given to biodiversity; (b) unsustainable use of natural
resources; (c) inefficient functioning of SINAPH; (d) unsustainable practices which destroy
biodiversity in the protected areas; (e) institutional weakness and lack of political and legal
support for conservation of biodiversity; and (f) invasions of the people living in the buffer zones
towards the protected areas and a lack of definition of land tenure.
Management Plans in the Protected Areas
10.   In the technical norms for protected areas management, management plans are established
as the mechanism to direct development in each protected area in the short, medium, and long
term and conservation activities should be based on these plans. Currently, DAPVS is developing
norms for the formulation of management plans according to the corresponding management
category established in Article 2 of the Technical Norms. This document also defines a strategic
plan, management plan, and operational plan.
11.   Currently, formats or guidelines to direct the design of management plans to meet the
objectives of the protected areas do not exist. Previously, the development of plans occurred in a
traditional format which includes, an analysis of the national and regional context of the area,
biophysical characteristics, cultural traits, socio-economic characteristics of the area, the area for
management and development including the objectives, the limitations of management, zoning, the
proposed limits, and the management programs with its subprograms.
12.   None of the protected areas are managed effectively. To improve management, a number
of serious obstacles must be overcome including: (a) land tenure conflicts due to the lack of clear
definition and demarcation of the legal limits of the protected areas and the lack of a strategy to
regularize the land of the communities living in these areas; (b) there is no benefit for the local
communities from the protected areas and therefore the participation of the people living in the
buffer zones in management or conservation of resources is limited; and (c) technical and
institutional weaknesses do not allow for effective promotion of conservation and management
such as, the lack of vigilance and control of illegal activities (hunting, logging, capturing animals,
and clearing land).
13.   Personnel Requirements. Currently DAPVS has approximately 70 employees, too few
to allow for effective completion of the work and functions they have been given. The needs of
the personnel required for protected areas management and administration depends on factors
such as properties, visitor management, fire risks, and the complexity of the social problems near
the area. A tentative calculation of the priority areas selected with the software MICOSYS
generated the need for nearly 450 employees. This number may actually be slightly less for
Honduras since currently, there are not a large number of visitors and it is hoped that through the
work of the local committees, fire fighting decrease. It is estimated that the priority areas will
need an absolute minimum of 400 employees (75 percent doing field work, 15 percent for
management and administration at the local level (decentralization); and 10 percent for
management and administration at the national level). In total, it is estimated that the system



94                                 Annex 4
would require approximately 15 percent professional employees, 10 percent for the decentralized
offices and 5 percent for the central office.
14.   Requirements for Infrastructure and Equipment. A constant presence in the field will
be crucial for the success of protected areas management. The field stations must be located in
isolated remote areas where the living conditions are extremely difficult. The field personnel will
have to work in turns, perhaps rotating by weeks. Under these conditions, it is essential to have
reliable communication and transport and adequate basic living conditions to satisfy needs, and
maintain a high morale and loyalty among the employees. On average, and in ideal conditions, a
radio is required for every 3 or 4 park guards and a vehicle for every 10 employees. The
employees should have a motorcycle for every 2 employees, a motorized canoe for every 3
employees, and a horse for each park guard depending on the living conditions in each place. The
infrastructure required for protected areas management in the project areas includes the
construction of 31 small houses for the park guards, 5 multiple-use stations, improvement in the 3
regional offices, and a visitors center in Pico Bonito in the Cordillera de Nombre de Dios.
Main Activities
15.   In order to achieve these objectives, this component is targeting resources to create a
model of protected areas management based on the wide participation of the local communities,
municipal goverrnents, and NGOs located in the areas. The component will be executed in
stages, taking advantage of the experiences generated by this project and other donor-supported
projects. It is expected that the management activities in the protected areas implemented under
this component will generate valuable lessons which may be extended to other areas with similar
characteristics in the SINAPH system. The main activities include:
(a) Revision and definition of the limits of the protected areas, at the government and field levels.
This activity will be executed through consultation workshops lasting two or three days,
combined with field trips to any areas that may be in conflict. Thematic maps of the project areas
using GIS will also be created.
(b) Once the limits have been defined, legal declaration of the protected areas will take place and
they will be inscribed in the Catalogue of Inalienable Public Forest Patrimony.
(c) Following the definition of limits and legal declaration, the core areas of the protected areas
will be demarcated. This activity will be carried out with a consulting firm and contracting of
local workers. Given that this activity is fairly costly and difficult, demarcation will be done in the
most critical spots (especially in those sections where the advance of the agricultural frontier is
strongest). Demarcation consists of placing markers at established distances that signals the limits
of the protected area. When possible, the limits will follow natural boundaries such as rivers,
mountains, or valleys.
(d) To ensure conservation of the protected areas and the appropriate utilization of available
resources, management plans for the protected areas will be designed and implemented. These
plans will be developed through consultation with local communities so that they will internalize



Annex 4                                 95
the importance of maintaining the protected areas with proper management. Community
participation and the involvement of other stakeholders will be coordinated through the COLAPs.
(e) There will be construction of the infrastructure necessary to carry out protected areas
management. Studies for infrastructure construction include the design of environmental impact
studies according to the guidelines of the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment.
Infrastructure to be constructed includes small houses for the guards, multiple use centers, visitors
centers, interpretive paths, and improvement of the regional offices. These studies and the
construction will be implemented through contracting private consulting firms.
(f) Contract the necessary personnel for efficient management the protected areas of the project.
Personnel will be contracted through a trust fund for the protected areas to be implemented
through the Rural Land Management Project.

Annex 4A
Legal Process for Declaring Protected Areas
1.    The declaration of the protected areas will be made through an executive agreement
provided by the Secretary of Natural Resources and the Environment (SERNA), proposed by
AFE-COHDEFOR, and approved by the Congress.
2.    A natural or legal entity (institutions, communities, municipalities) can present a proposal
to DAPVS of AFE-COHDEFOR to decree an area as protected. DAPVS will provide a technical
opinion of the proposal to support the request to SERNA. The request should contain, at a
minimum:
* Justification for the request to declare an area as protected;
* Proposed objectives of the protected area;
- Spatial and physical location in a cartographic map from the National Geographic Institute in
1:50,000 scale;
- Studies completed on land tenure; biophysical and socio-economic characteristics;
- Proposed management category, with justification;
- Existing resources, species, cultural links, and ecosystems of relevance;
* Opinion of the municipality(s) located in areas that are proposed as protected areas; and
* Financing proposal for the area, and for acquisition of lands if necessary.
3.    Based on the analysis of this information, before the Technical Commission of DAPVS
and DiBio determines that the proposal is appropriate, the municipalities and communities located
in the proposed area will be informed of the proposal. Information will be disseminated through
the publication of the location, boundaries, and management category of the proposed protected
area, noting that this is the opportunity for parties to lodge a complaint. This information will be
published in three daily newspapers at intervals of ten days for one month.
4.    The management of AFE-COHDEFOR, following appropriate technical and legal
requirements will be informed of and resolve any complaints, following the Administrative
Procedures Law. The complaints against the proposal should be accompanied by land titles or
other arguments of a technical nature and should be provided within 90 days after the date of the
final publication in the newspaper.
5.   If the technical opinion of AFE-COHDEFOR regarding the proposed area is favorable,
and any conflicts are resolved, DAPVS sends the proposal to the Ministry of Natural Resources
and the Environment (SERNA) which will review the proposal. If the proposal is accepted, it
then proceeds to the President and the Congress with a request for decreeing this particular area
as a protected area. This same procedure is used for the reclassification or re-delimitation of a
protected area. The activities of a scientific, technical, or environmental nature to determine the
creation, classification, or re-classification of protected areas must be executed by qualified staff.

Annex 5
Buffer Zone Component
Objective
1.    The objective of this component (US$ 1.8 million including US$ 0.2 million of beneficiary
counterpart funding) is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the
buffer zones of the key protected areas (PAs) through financing of demand-driven activities and
other investments to support the formulation and execution of such projects.
Description of Component
2.    The component involves three distinct types of financing in order to attain its objectives:
(a) Development of Local Plans. US$ 0.2 million will be used for supporting the development of
participatory plans at the local level. Such plans will serve to help prioritize community
investments and will be an important input to the protected area management plans to be financed
under the Protected Areas Component of this project.
(b) Support to COLAPs and CORAPs. US$ 0.08 million will be used to meet operational
expenses incurred for the meetings of COLAPs and CORAPs, which are expected to play a key
role in this component. The COLAPs in particular will facilitate the participation of the
communities, take the lead in conflict resolution, as well as participate in the planning process.
This financing will be additional to the costs of establishing these committees, to be covered under
the Institutional Strengthening Component.
(c) Financing of Subprojects. US$ 1.52 million (including US$ 0.2 million of beneficiary
counterpart funding) will be spent on demand-driven subprojects in the buffer zones of the key
protected areas of the project.
Geographical Priorities
3.    Investment funds would be distributed among the four project protected area groupings
based on a consideration of their relative biodiversity importance, degree of threats facing each
area, likelihood of project investments in subprojects having an impact on natural resource use
patterns in the region, the buffer zone population, and the number of COLAPs in the region. A
preliminary exercise of this nature suggested that of the $1.3 million available from GEF financing
for subprojects, the following would be an appropriate division of resources: Patuca-Tawahka -
$0.5 million; Mosquitia - $0.4 million; Cordillera Nombre de Dios - $0.3 million; and Atlantida
Wetlands - $0.1 million. This preliminary distribution of subproject financing would be modified
as needed in the annual operating plan of each year based on data on financing needs versus
existing financing in the regions. Within each area, communities eligible for financing will be those
identified in the protected area management plans as being located within the buffer zones (or
until management plans are finished, falling within such zones on draft provisional maps available
in AFE-COHDEFOR).
4.    Beneficiaries will be required to provide a counterpart contribution through cash or in kind
contributions (labor, land, or other inputs).The beneficiary contribution of each subproject will be



Annex 5                                99
determined based on the type of investments. The project will fund up to 100% of training and
technical assistance costs, up to 90 percent of inputs to integrated community subprojects
(presented by and benefiting the community as a whole) and up to 75 percent of inputs for
subprojects benefiting a smaller number of beneficiaries.
Subproject Approval
5.    Subproject Cycle. Based on priorities developed in the management planning process,
communities or organized groups would submit project concepts to the COLAP. The COLAP
would prioritize and pre-select those subprojects which meet eligibility criteria and, based on
rough estimates of subproject costs, would approve for further processing the number of
subprojects which could be financed within that year's financing ceiling. Following approval for
further processing, the COLAP, from a list of pre-approved service providers, would facilitate
contact between the community or group and service providers. The community or group would
select and sign an agreement with the service provider to assist them to develop and implement
the subproject proposal.
6.    The developed subproject proposal would be resubmitted to the COLAP for approval.
The COLAP would once again prioritize proposals and approve those meeting eligibility criteria
and which could be financed within the year's budgetary ceiling. The service providers' costs for
preparation assistance would be included in the total subproject cost in the case of subprojects
which subsequently receive approval. In the case of subproject preparations not resulting in an
approved project, the service providers' direct costs would be paid by the COLAP out of that
year's subproject budget. Approved subprojects would be aggregated by the COLAP and
submitted to the CORAP for a no-objection. The CORAP's no-objection would be based on a
review of the subproject's consistency with eligibility criteria and verification of available
financing. The CORAP would aggregate the approved subprojects and submit them to the AFE-
COHDEFOR Regional Director. This package would be submitted to the PCU on a non-
objection basis according to the project legal agreement and eligibility criteria.
7.    Subprojects Selection. Subprojects would be approved according to the following
general criteria (specific and detailed criteria will be included in the Operational Manual):
(a) Be environmentally friendly and sustainable. Investments with a direct or indirect positive
environmental impact will be eligible for financing.
(b) Respond to priorities identified in the protected area management plans (or in locally
developed plans if the former have not yet been completed).
(c) Complement, and not substitute, other available sources of financing. Only those subproject
activities for which there are no alternative sources of financing available (i.e., other donor or
private financing) will be eligible.
(d) Be technically, institutionally and socially feasible: Investments need to be technically sound,
feasible under local conditions, and institutionally and socially sustainable. Eligible subprojects



100                                Annex 5
must include capacity development as necessary to ensure their successful implementation and
sustainability.
(e) Be directed to beneficiaries which are communities or organized groups, although benefits can
reach individual households or group members within the group.
8.   In addition, the COLAP would prioritize investments based on criteria at the level of a
package of subprojects directed to a single area. Specifically, they would ensure that a package of
investments over time and in one area would satisfy the requirement of maximizing benefits to the
greatest number of people possible and ensure a balance among beneficiaries such that women
and disadvantaged groups (e.g., ethnic minorities, rural poor in more remote areas) are adequately
represented.
9.    Financing Ceilings. A ceiling would be placed on individual subprojects so as to limit
per family benefits to a maximum of $600 overall totals to a maximum of $10,000 per subproject.
These ceilings could be revised based on experience and need after year two of implementation of
the buffer zone fund.
Component Costs
10.   The total cost of this component is estimated at $1.9 million (including contingencies), of
which the GEF will finance $1.6 million, and beneficiaries the remaining $0.3 million. $0.2 million
will be utilized for developing participatory plans at the local level within the buffer zones and
$0.08 million will be utilized to meet the operational expenses incurred for the meetings of the
COLAPs and CORAPs. Of the remaining amount for subprojects, total costs cannot be broken
down according to type of investment since the portfolio of investments will be essentially
demand-driven. However, within subprojects, it is expected that about $0.4 million will be spent
on training, $0.2 million in technical assistance, and $ 1.0 million ($0.7 million, GEF and $0.3
million, beneficiaries) in subproject investment costs.
Administrative Arrangements and Flow of Funds
11.   AFE-COHDEFOR, through DAPVS and the Regional AFE-COHDEFOR offices, will
manage this component. The Regional Office Director will maintain records and accounts, set up
an account at a local bank, and make payments against approved subprojects from this account.
Project funds will be advanced to cover three months of projected expenditures for the
subcomponent.
Relationship with Upland Producers Fund of the Rural Land Management Project
12.   The coverage of the Upland Producers Fund, a component of the Rural Land Management
Project, will be extended to provide assistance to all four of the groups of protected areas
included in the Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project. The Upland Producers Fund's objectives
are: (a) to reduce the environmental degradation of forest and soil resources in upland areas, (b)
improve the incomes and well-being of poor, upland farming households, and (c) establish a long
term financing mechanism through which the GOH can channel resources for extension and
training assistance to such households. It will finance: (a) technical assistance and training for



Annex 5                                101
upland farmers in sustainable forestry, agriculture and livestock practices; (b) applied research to
generate improved technologies in agriculture, livestock and natural forest management for
upland areas; (c) training for NGO and private sector technical specialists in priority themes for
sustainable natural resource management; and (d) the establishment and implementation of a fund
mechanism for directing resources under GOH policy direction and its associated supervision and
monitoring processes.
13.   Clients of the fund are: (a) for agriculture and livestock activities, groups of male and
female farmers that demonstrate a need for technical assistance in forestry, and agriculture and
livestock production, with a priority for groups that can not meet nutritional security; (b) for
forest management activities, municipalities (ejido forest), communities (indigenous peoples in
communal forests), and organizations carrying out social forestry activities in national forests
(cooperatives and indigenous federations); and (c) for micro-watershed management,
municipalities and communities responsible for managing designated micro-watersheds for potable
or irrigation water. Members of SNITTA and private research institutions and NGOs would be
the direct recipients of research funds.
14.   The Upland Producers Fund would constitute the source for technical assistance,
extension and training services in the buffer zones. Therefore, activities involving technical
assistance, extension and training services for agriculture, livestock, and forestry would not be
eligible for GEF subproject financing under the established criteria. Such subprojects would be
passed by the COLAPs to the Upland Producers Fund.
Monitoring
15.   AFE-COHDEFOR, CORAPs and COLAPs will share contractual responsibility for
monitoring the actual implementation of subprojects and the use of project funds. The COLAPs
would supervise the individual subprojects. However, in this case, "supervise" would not imply
direct supervision. Rather, it would only be expected that the COLAPs would be informed as to
how well the subprojects were functioning based on the perceptions of the subproject participants
and the service providers, who would submit quarterly implementation reports. Other consultants
contracted to provide technical assistance to the subproject would have within their terms-of-
reference the additional responsibility to provide a technical supervision report based on their
visits to the subprojects. All implementation and supervision reports would be copied to the
CORAP and the AFE-COHDEFOR Regional Office. Non-performing subprojects could be
canceled based on a joint decision of the CORAP and the Regional AFE-COHDEFOR Director
or by request of the COLAP. Each year an independent financial, technical, and social audit of the
region's subprojects would be canied out.

Annex 6
Biological Monitoring Component
Introduction
1.   In a protected areas system, park rangers are field staff that are continuously present in the
field. They travel throughout the park and communicate with the local population while
performing their tasks of protected area administration and management. The volunteer rangers
from local communities will perform similar duties in cooperation of the park rangers.
2.    The monitoring system to be implemented under this component is based on the concept
of developing this human resources base as the foundation of an efficient and cost-effective
program. With the right guidance and appropriate training, field staff can inexpensively collect
invaluable field information.
Design and Operation Subcomponent
3.    Design of the Monitoring System. Considerable background work was carried out
during project preparation in the design of the monitoring system, with substantial involvement of
the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) (Forsythe, Adrian: Proposalfor a
Monitoring System for the Honduras GEFBiodiversity Conservation Project. 1997). To
complete the design of the monitoring system, two internationally recruited consultants will be
contracted under this component. One expert will complete the design of the system regarding
choice of indicator species, field methodologies for collecting data, and analytical methodologies.
A second expert will be responsible for designing and creating the databases and other software
required for entering and analyzing data and producing reports.
4.    The design expert will identify which data can be collected by the rangers and which
would be the most valuable indicators. Such data would include a relatively short list of key
animal species, information on human activities (like poaching, spontaneous settlements, clearing
of forests, etc.). The rangers would register specific locations with the help of GPS systems. As
field sheets would come in on a daily basis from all the protected areas, they will gradually start to
form an invaluable source of statistical information on key indicator species and on human
activities.
5.    Training. Training on what data to collect and how to register them is crucial to the
effectiveness of the system. Training for park rangers would not only involve training for how to
register data but also training in species recognition, and as such it would be integrated into the
overall training package for the rangers.
6.    In each region a person (most likely a secretary) will be trained to feed the data into the
databases, which would not only serve the purpose of data registration but also generic office
tasks. Within the FIS, a person will be trained to collect the information from the regions into the
national system.



Annex 6                                 105
7.    Finally, the internationally-recruited experts would also provide training to the nationally
recruited Monitoring Coordinator.
8.    In cooperation with the regional coordinators of DAPVS and within the context of other
training modules or management workshops or meetings, the monitoring coordinator will spend at
least half a day per year with the rangers of each region to evaluate the system and discuss the
need for adaptations.
9.    Operation of the Monitoring System. Once the basic monitoring system has been
designed and an information management infrastructure is in place, the operation of the system
will rely on the input of the Monitoring Coordinator, participation of the regional offices of
DAPVS, and collection of field data at the local park level.
10.   The Monitoring Coordinator will be a consultant hired under the project for a period of six
months per year for the five years of the project. His or her responsibility will be the entry of data
received from the regional offices, ensuring coordination of the monitoring system with the SIF of
AFE-COHDEFOR, conducting training programs for the regional and field level staff, verification
of field data by regular visits to the field and through overflights (20 hours per year), analysis of
the collected data (including where possible data available from other sources), coordination with
other relevant monitoring programs in Honduras or in Central America, and preparation of
detailed annual monitoring reports.
11.   The regional DAPVS offices will receive initial training in the operation and maintenance
of the regional level monitoring databases. A designated technical specialist will then be
responsible for monitoring of field level staff, regular collection of field data, entry of data into the
database, training of park guards, and regular transmission of data to the Monitoring Coordinator
in Tegucigalpa.
12.   Finally, the actual collection of data will be undertaken, as will be defined in the design
phase of the monitoring system, by park guards or other designated individuals. It is expected
that data collection will involve both data collection during other field tasks (such as vigilance
patrols) and dedicated data collection field efforts.
Subcomponent for Equipment Acquisition
13.   This subcomponent covers the costs of acquiring the minimal amount of equipment
necessary for the functioning of the monitoring system. Equipment is required at three distinct
operational levels: the central offices of AFE-COHDEFOR (DAPVS), the regional offices of
DAPVS, and at the field level.
14.   In the central offices of DAPVS, where the main monitoring databases will be established
and maintained, a Pentium 200 computer, printer, and software will be purchased for the use of
the Monitoring Coordinator. The data itself will be stored and manipulated on the computer
system of the SIF but this equipment will provide a means for the independent entry, preparation,
and manipulation of data and for the preparation of annual monitoring reports.



106                                 Annex 6
15.   In four regional offices of DAPVS, which will serve as collection and transmission points
for monitoring data, the project will also provide computers, printers, and software.
16.   Finally, at the field level, it will be critical to provide additional equipment to park guards
in order for them to become fully functional participants in the biological monitoring system being
put into place under this project. In addition to a range of minor field equipment, the project will
purchase 25 Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) field units for exact localization of field data
points, 50 pairs of binoculars, and 50 ornithological field guides. The monitoring equipment
would also be used by park guards after they had received monitoring training.
Subcomponent for Monitoring of Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
17.   The biological monitoring program described in the two previous components focuses on
the monitoring of the population dynarnics of key indicator species in the four project areas of the
project. In addition, the data collection system will provide data on invasions, and forest clearings
which will provide information useful to a monitoring of forest cover and the movement of the
agricultural frontier.
18.   This information must however be considered in a larger framework, that of the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) in Honduras, which is to say essentially the status of
all remaining natural habitat in the Atlantic half of Honduras. With the resources and capacity
available in Honduras, the ambitious goal of monitoring the entire Honduran section of the MBC
can best be realized by remote sensing monitoring of the status of forest cover.
19.  It is expected that the regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project (implementation
through the CCAD) will include financing for regular remote image monitoring of the MBC. At
the time of preparation of this document, final details were however not yet available on the exact
activities to be financed under the regional project.
20.   The funds available under this subcomponent (US$ 100,000) will be definitively
programmed during the first year of the project. The objective of the investments will be to
obtain a portrait of the changes in forest cover in the Honduran section of the MBC, with
particular emphasis on the four groupings of protected areas of the project. The investments will
however be decided in close collaboration with CCAD to ensure complementarity with the
objectives, activities, and investments of the regional project. Any investments under this project
would also be closely coordinated with other ongoing remote image analysis programs in
Honduras (such as that which is being financed by GTZ in the Rio Plitano area).
21.   It is expected that investments would cover costs of remote satellite image acquisition,
specialized analysis of remote images, field verification of data, production of maps, and
dissemination of information.
22.   One additional activity to be financed under this project will be support for research on
innovative cost-efficient methodologies for monitoring the biological integrity of the MBC as a
biologically effective corridor for dispersal of plant and animal species. An amount of US$
15,000 will be provided as a scholarship (eligibility criteria, including cofunding from other



Annex 6                                107
sources, will be defined in the Operational Manual of the Project) to a Honduran student to
pursue research at the graduate level.
23.   The research should be directed at determining methodologies for measuring the
effectiveness of the MBC in Honduras as an effective corridor for genetic flow. Dispersal and
gene flow of any given animal or plant species can only be measured in the field with great
difficulty and at great cost. The research should therefore be directed at producing a model for
measuring gene flow of a hypothetical animal or plant species based on parameters such as
dispersal rates of populations, habitat and minimal area requirements for resident populations, and
habitat requirements for dispersal (width of corridors and degree of conversion of corridor
habitat). Data to run the models could be inexpensively obtained from remote image
interpretation and collection of habitat quality data in the field. The resulting data would provide
a means of objectively monitoring the habitat quality of the MBC as well as a means of influencing
land use and policy decisions by measuring the effect of different corridor configurations and land
use patterns.

Annex 9
Incremental Cost Analysis Summary
Context and Broad Development Goals
1.    The rapidly fragmenting natural habitats of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC)
within Honduras is of great concern for the country and for the international community. The
erosion of the country's biodiversity riches is taking place within a context of natural resource
mismanagement in poverty-stricken rural areas and of little institutional capacity for managing the
protected area network (SINAPH).
2.    The broad development goals of the country focus on poverty alleviation strategies, land
reform, and improvements in natural resource management in the MBC and other rural areas of
Honduras. Many of the reforms are being supported under a series of World Bank loans
including the Agricultural Sector Credit and PAAR. A SINAPH of 107 protected areas is a
testimony to the interest of the country in conserving its rich biodiversity but the existing
protected areas are being rapidly swamped by the advancing agricultural frontier and resources
are insufficient to adequately protect even a core group of protected areas.
Baseline Scenario
3.    A multi-pronged approach to the problem is being adopted by the Government of
Honduras (GOH), assisted by an array of bilateral and multilateral donors. In the absence of GEF
assistance for addressing global biodiversity objectives, this approach can be considered the
"Baseline Scenario. It involves tackling root causes, such as natural resource mismanagement and
land tenure problems, as well as limited direct support to biodiversity conservation in the
protected area system.
4.    Given that Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, the priorities of the
GOH are concentrated on interventions that have an immediate impact on rural poverty. In the
baseline scenario, the GOH would be expected to use its scarce development resources for
pursuing three broad lines of development: (a) reform of land tenure problems representing
important impediments to local development (US$ 15.0 million); (b) improving the management
of natural resources, particularly public forest management, so as to have an immediate impact in
terms of poverty alleviation and food security in the poorest rural areas of the country (US$ 19.0
million); and (c) support for protected areas with potential for generating revenues (US$ 7.0
million). The estimated cost of these activities is US$ 41.0 million, and the principal vehicle
adopted by the GOH to carry out these development goals is the PAAR.
5.   In addition to this initiative, complementary investments of the bilateral and multilateral
donor community are an important part of the Baseline Scenario in the Honduran section of the
MBC. These donor initiatives also focus on land tenure, natural resource management, and
protection efforts, but they tend to be geographically focused on relatively small areas and do not
address sectoral root causes. The most important donor initiatives are the following: (a) a
proposed Japanese investment of about US$ 11.0 million in fisheries and coastal zone
management in the Mosquitia area; (b) German investment of US$ 9.0 million in the sustainable



Annex 9                                115
development of the Rio Plitano watershed; (c) Canadian investment of US$ 3.0 million in
sustainable forest management of tropical broad leaf forests of north-central Honduras; (d)
European Union funding of about US$ 2.0 million in sustainable development of rural areas of
northern Honduras (not in protected areas); (e) Finnish investment of about US$ 1.0 million in
social forestry investments and research in pine forests; (f) USAID funding of about US$ 300,000
in the Gulf of Fonseca area (PROARCA Program), and (g) Fundaci6n VIDA financing of about
US$ 1.2 million of NGO initiatives for protected areas management in selected areas of the
country. The total cost of these donor programs is estimated at approximately US$ 29.0 million.
6.    The total cost of Baseline Scenario investments of the GOH and donor community, as
described here, is estimated at US$ 70.0 million; implementation of this investment program will
be important to the development of Honduras. At least in some areas of the country, much
improved natural resource management practices should be adopted as a result, leading to rural
poverty alleviation and enhanced protection of the resources themselves. This will be particularly
true for fisheries use in Mosquitia and the Gulf of Fonseca and for isolated areas under forestry
exploitation. A strengthened institutional capacity in the sector can be expected, and this will
generate benefits directly or indirectly in the entire country and in the MBC. Significant progress
should be made in resolving land administration conflicts in some less conflictive regions of the
country. Finally, through investments in protected areas under the PAAR, basic infrastructure and
capacity should be in place to protect a few key areas and to help generate nature-based tourism
revenues.
7.   In terms of protecting biodiversity, these results are positive in that they should help slow
the advance of the agricultural frontier by promoting more intensive agriculture and forestry. In
areas that are under exploitation, particularly forestry, better natural resource management
practices may have direct benefits for biodiversity by preserving better quality habitat patches.
Finally, the direct investments in a handful of PAs will be important in safeguarding those
particular areas. Increasing revenues generated by the PA system should benefit protected areas
throughout the country, but in the short term, revenue generation will be modest.
8.    Despite these positive elements, the Baseline Scenario would not result in effective
protection of biodiversity conservation in the MBC of Honduras. Investments and land use
planning decisions would be not aimed at protecting the corridor and no effective mechanisms
would be in place to monitor the integrity of such corridors (although regionally oriented
monitoring programs are expected under the UNDP-administered Regional Mesoamerican
Corridor Project). Under the Baseline Scenario, fragmentation and conversion of natural habitats
would continue, resulting within one or two generations in the reduction of the Honduran section
of the MBC to nothing more than a few isolated protected areas and indigenous reserves.
Global Environmental Objective
9.    The global environmental biodiversity objective in Central America, as strongly promoted
by the Global Environment Facility and conservation experts throughout the world, is to protect
and conserve a relatively intact corridor of natural habitat stretching from southern Mexico to
Colombia, bridging the North and South American continents. Within Honduras, this translates
into defining and protecting a number of key habitat corridors which collectively define the



116                                Annex 9
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in that country. The Honduran section of the MBC contains
major portions of five terrestrial ecoregions: Central American Pacific dry forests; Central
American pine-oak forests; Central American montane forests at higher altitudes; Central
American Atlantic moist forests; and the Miskito pine forests of eastem Honduras. Each of these
ecoregions contains high levels of endemic species of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and vascular
plants as well as endangered mammal species.
GEF Alternative
10.   Under the GEF Alternative, an expanded program would be undertaken which would
comprise activities focused on national development/poverty alleviation goals as well as activities
focused on protecting the Honduran portion of the MBC. The GEF Alternative would consist of
the following Baseline Activities: (a) reform of land tenure problems (US$ 15.0 million); (b)
improving management of natural resources, particularly forest management (US$ 20.0 million);
(c) support for protected areas with revenue earning potential (US$ 8.0 million); (d)
complementary donor programs in the MBC (US$ 28.0 million), including investments by
Fundaci6n VIDA in NGO activities along the Atlantic coast, plus the following MBC
Biodiversity Conservation Activities: (e) institutional strengthening for protected area and natural
resource management, including local capacity building (US$ 0.65 million); (f) protected areas
strengthening in globally significant sites within the Honduran segment of the MBC (US$ 4.05
million); (g) improving resource management in the buffer zones, including promotion of
appropriate technologies, integrating biodiversity conservation/use with sustainable forestry, and
gender-sensitive biodiversity initiatives at the local level (US$ 1.6 million); (h) biological
monitoring (US$ 0.4 million); and (i) project coordination costs (US$ 0.3 million). The total cost
of the GEF Alternative is estimated at US$ 77.0 million.
11.  Implementation of the GEF Altemative is expected to generate both national benefits
(those outlined under the Baseline Scenario) as well as global benefits related to the establishment
of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor within Honduras. Implementation of the GEF
Alternative would make possible critical activities that would not otherwise take place in the
absence of GEF funding. These additional activities, which would generate global benefits, would
include:
(a) On-the-ground investments in protected area creation and management in four areas
considered of the highest global biodiversity importance: Cordillera de Nombre de Dios, Patuca-
Tawahka, Atlantida Wetlands, and Mosquitia;
(b) The protected areas agency (DAPVS) of the GOH will be institutionally strengthened within
the Corridor, allowing it to manage more effectively the globally significant PAs as well as other
portions of the Corridor;
(c) The incipient national dialogue on the country's draft Biodiversity Strategy will be supported
and strengthened, contributing to a national consensus on priorities for action and providing a
framework for national investments and donor assistance;



Annex 9                                117
(d) Communities living in and around globally significant protected areas will benefit from a series
of investments in natural resource use and management which will demonstrate and support
alternative resource use options, thereby slowing movement into these protected areas;
(e) A variety of participatory and consultative mechanisms will be utilized (including
environmental education and gender-based programs) in order to bring communities into the
process of protected area management and to ensure more effective local management of globally
important PAs; and
(f) Closely coordinated with GEF-supported efforts under the Regional project, a biological
monitoring program will be supported in Honduras to help better manage the Corridor as well as
to facilitate and orient future investments.
Incremental Costs
12.   The total cost of the Baseline Scenario is estimated at US$ 70.0 million, while the total
cost of the GEF Alternative is estimated at US$ 77.0 million. The incremental costs of the GEF
Alternative, for which GEF funding is requested, are US$ 7.0 million. It is expected that with the
definition of a biological corridor and an associated framework of priorities, additional bilateral
funds will be mobilized to complement and reinforce GEF-supported efforts.

120                               Annex 11
Annex 11
Land Tenure
1.    The protected areas included in the Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project, include large
blocks of land claimed by the Garifuna, Miskito, Pech, and Tawahka indigenous groups. As part
of project preparation, several studies were carried out to study the land tenure system in
Honduras and to investigate the legal options for adjudication of communal land to these
indigenous groups. This annex provides a short summary of the results of the studies, which are
available in the project files, and the recommendations provided to GOH.
2.    Land tenure security is one of the principal axes of the national policy in the agricultural
sector and the forestry sector. In Honduras, Government policies regarding rural land are based
on improving legal land tenure, a starting point for a number of actions in the agricultural and
forestry sectors. Over the past two decades, the Government of Honduras has made this policy
effective through the titling of agricultural land which is managed by the National Agrarian
Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario, INA). INA is the only institution able to title rural land,
individually, collectively, or communally. The actions of INA with regard to titling communal
lands are stated in the constitution, article 346, and the Modernization and Development of the
Agricultural Sector Law.
3.   In the forestry sector, the Government has attempted to adapt the legal framework with
policies of conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The Forest Agency of the State-
-Honduran Corporation of Forestry Development (Agencia Forestal del Estado-Corporaci6n
Hondureua de Desarrollo Forestal, AFE-COHDEFOR) is responsible for regulation of the
forestry sector. In the case of agricultural lands transferred to lands in the public sector domain
from private farmers, and in the case of public lands used for forestry, there are attempts to verify
public domain with different methods of cadaster, demarcation, and legal inscription in the name
of the state. The actions of AFE-COHDEFOR are stated in the Modernization and Development
of the Agricultural Sector Law, Regulation to Title VI of the same and a series of laws that
govern the forestry sector.
4.    The Rural Land Management Project has a land administration component which should
make the policy of legal security operational, with legal cadaster and registry reform in four
departments. The natural resources component of this project will give greater emphasis to forest
policy and attempt to develop activities in full coordination with the populations living in the
project areas. There will not be attempts to resettle the population, without creating the
appropriate legal instruments to support the rights and obligations of the communities and the
Government.
5.    There are a series of legal norms that are applicable to titling indigenous lands, but in
general the issues are dispersed in special or sectoral laws. The only sole norm for the indigenous
topics is Decree 26-94, through which GOH ratified Agreement 169 of the International Labor
Organization on Indigenous Peoples and Tribes in Independent Countries.



Annex 11                               121
6.    As part of the study, different proposals and concepts regarding land tenure were studied
with extensive document review and interviews with the government agencies and private
organizations involved in land tenure and titling. The three options for indigenous land tenure
titling that exist in the Honduran legal framework are individual, communal, and usufruct
contract. In addition, three different proposals to address indigenous land tenure were also
explored. The first is a proposal which originated from the Unit of the Mosquitia (Unidad de la
Mosquitia, MASTA) to title all of the territory of the Mosquitia for the Miskito and Tawahka.
This proposal was not accepted by the Government since it was considered unconstitutional.
7.    A proposal from INA consists of titling land in communal or individual form, following
the parameters established in the Agrarian Reform Law and the modifications introduced by the
Agricultural Sector Modernization Law. This type of title can only be given to agricultural or
ranch land.
8.    AFE-COHDEFOR proposes to include the Mosquitia in the Catalogue of Inalienable
Public Forest Patrimony (Catalogo del Patrimonio Publico Forestal Inalienable) which is a
registry where all the public protected forest areas or areas of social interest, would be included.
Inside these areas, AFE-COHDEFOR would be able to sign long-term usufruct contracts, through
which the indigenous people would be able to carry out any activity included in the management
plan for the area, but they would not have full dominion.
9.   It appears that the proposal of AFE-COHDEFOR is accepted by ali the actors as a
reasonable immediate strategy. It would not preclude acknowledgment of prior rights of
indigenous peoples should there be evidence of these rights. INA also proposes a mix with its
own proposal through which the indigenous people would have the right to title a small portion of
the areas. This would allow them to benefit from the agrarian reform. The areas catalogued by
AFE-COHDEFOR would be signed under usufruct agreements.
10.   To conserve the forestry resources, AFE-COHDEFOR will make the Catalogue of Forest
Patrimony (Catalogo de Patrimonio Forestal) effective. The inscription of these lands will make
their status inalienable for perpetuity, except in the case that there are prior rights. This legal
mechanism leaves the option of granting usufruct rights to the communities living in the
traditional lands that overlap with the areas inscripted into the Catalogue. In the case of the
Miskito, the indigenous organization FINZMOS of the indigenous community of Mocor6n was
conceded approximately 40,000 hectares by AFE-COHDEFOR, of which half is under a forestry
management plan and the remaining is under conservation. Until now, there are no other
examples of this type of agreement in the country, but AFE-COHDEFOR considers it a model
which could be reproduced.
11.  INA has emitted various full dominion communal titles for indigenous communities. In
1993, INA granted a title to the Tornabe community (Garifuna community) that is located in the
buffer zone of the Punta Sal Park. The title was granted on condition that the community will
manage the property according to the regulations of the Park. Thus, the dominion is not absolute,
but can be in perpetuity.



122                               Annex 11
12.   There was an agreement reached in the month of October 1996 between a Presidential
Commission and the National Coordinator of the Black Organizations of Honduras (CNONH)
that deals with the titling of the Garifuna communities of the departments of Cortes, Atlantida,
Col6n, and Gracias a Dios. Also, INA has developed an Action Plan for the implementation of
the project of land titling in the Lenca communities (November 1996). MASTA has developed a
proposal in the case of the Miskitos and FITH has developed one in the case of the Tawahka.
13.   As a result of the evaluation of the three options for indigenous land tenure titling:
individual, communal, and usufruct contract, all of which are options in the Honduran legal
framework, GOH has decided to further evaluate these options and may opt to apply a blend of
usufruct and communal title. To facilitate the organizational processes needed for communal
titling, the Institutional Development Fund grant to the indigenous organizations in Honduras will
provide training in issues related to land tenure and organizing to seek adjudication.



Annex 12                                  123
Annex 12
Supervision Plan (UNDP and World Bank)
1.    The supervision of the project by the GEF implementing agencies (World Bank and the
UNDP) will be carried out with a major role being played by the regional office of UNDP in
Honduras for daily monitoring and supervision. The supervision plan included in this annex
describes the planned supervision missions that will be carried out by headquarters staff and
consultants of the two agencies.
2.    There will be a cost savings (in both time and financial resources) by combining
supervision by the World Bank and UNDP, and by taking advantage of the planned supervision of
the associated Rural Land Management Project (PAAR). The estimates of inputs required for
supervision (the table below) account for the co-supervision anticipated.
3.    The dates outlined in the table are based on the assumption that the Project will be
negotiated in July 1997 and approved by the World Bank Executive Board in September or
October 1997. These dates will be adjusted accordingly should these dates change.
4.    The total number of supervision weeks required are 109, of which 85 will be contributed
by the World Bank (78%) and 24 by UNDP (22%). This total does not include the regional office
of IJNDP's contribution, that is estimated to be 5 weeks more per year. The allocation of the 109
weeks is as follows:
Agency       98        99         00        01         02        03       Total
