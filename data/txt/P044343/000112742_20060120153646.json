satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability,\n            modest institutional development impact and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and the Borrower.  The closing\n            date of the Project was extended by 2.5 years due to two\n            main factors: natural disasters and a condition of\n            effectiveness related to the submission of draft legislation\n            to Congress related to the establishment of Patuca, Tawahka,\n            and Punta Izopo protected areas.  On the basis of the\n            project assessment above, the following lessons can be drawn\n            for similar biodiversity conservation projects: A) Promote\n            full community involvement at all stages of project design,\n            implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. B) Combine\n            conservation efforts with activities aimed at meeting\n            socioeconomic needs. C) Coordinate conservation activities\n            with those involving land management. D) Ensure flexible,\n            long-term approaches. E) Promote collaboration with NGOs,\n            local governments, and other public institutions. F) Ensure\n            that local committees are representative and flexible. G)\n            Coordinate efforts effectively at the national level. H) Pay\n            attention to socioeconomic and political conditions. I)\n            Build flexibility into project design. And J) Clarify\n            institutional responsibilities for project execution."}, "docdt": "2005-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
