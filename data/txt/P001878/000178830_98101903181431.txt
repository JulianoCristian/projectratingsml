REPORT AND RECOk1L'EENDATION OF THE PRESIDEN'ST
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVER&NENT OF AvIAURITIUS
FOR A ThA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5.2 million to
the Government of Mauritius for a smallholder tea development project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        iIauritius began exporting tea in 1954.  1y 1969 exports were
valued at $2.6 million equivalent, 4 percent of total export earnings.    The
Government considers further development of tea as an important component
of its long-term policy to diversify an economy that continues to be ex-
cessively dependent on sugar. It is, moreover, a valuable contribution to
employment.  The present project is the second phase of the Government's
program to encourage the growing of tea by smallholders.   The project was
prepared with assistance from the Bank's Permanent A,ission in Easterm
Africa.  It was appraised in May/June 1970.   Megotiations were held in
Washington from February 19 to 25, 1971 with reDresentatives oI the
Government and the A,Iauritius Tea Development Authority (MTDA). The
Government was represented by M4essrs. R. Pyndiah, Financial Secretary;
A. ilulder, Chief Agricultural Officer; and R. Lallah, Assistant Solicitor-
General, and the viTDA by Ar. H. T. Lloyd, General Htanager.
3.        The proposed credit would mark the beginning of Bank Group opera-
tions in independent lvlauritius. In 1963 the 3bank made a loan of $7.0
million for electric power to ilauritius with the guarantee of the United
Kingdom. The project has been successfullly completed and the loan fully
disbursed. The amount now held by the Sank is $2.0 million.
4.        Ivlauritius is about to complete a development plan for the five
years 1971 - 1975 which will define the sector and project priorities. How-
ever, the basic economic imperatives are already clear, namely to reduce
the dependence on sugar and to create employment by diversifying the
agricultural sector and by expanding industry and tourism. Prospective
Bank Group operations will be in support of these objectives. They in-
coude a possible IDA credit for the Development Bank of lauritius, which
I hope to present to the Executive Directors in the course of the next
fiscal year.
5.        The IFC is currently considering an hotel and tourist development
proposal.

Estimated Economic Rate of
Return:                         15.0 percent.
PART III - THE ECONONIY
7.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Mauritius" (AE-l4a dated February 10, 1971) was recently distributed to the
Executive Directors. A basic data sheet is attached.
8.        The fundamental economic problems of Aauritius are the consequence
of rapid population growth and overwhelming dependence on sugar. These
problems have been compounded by the low rate of growth of the economy: in
the 1950's population rose faster than GDP, and in the last decade the
improvement in per capita income was barely perceptible.
9.        The population growth rate has already been reduced to about
1.7 percent and the Government is giving increasing support to family
planning and emigration, but the high rate of 3.2 percent which prevailed
in the 1950's has left to this generation a legacy of unemployment and
dependency problems. These problems would be alleviated by a higher GDP



growth rate, especially if it could be attained mainly through labor-intensive
investments. Increasing the growth rate is difficult because sugar has very
limited market prospects and sugar exports are, moreover, vulnerable to
changes in preferential marketing arrangements. There is no easy or early
solution, but the Government has adopted the only practicable policy of
increasing sugar yields without increasing total output, in order to free
land for other crops that would diversify the agricultural sector. The
proposed project directly supports this diversification policy. Outside
agriculture, the main prospects are tourism, which is promising, and manu-
facturing, for which 'Aauritius can provide ample good quality labor. To
encourage manufacturing, the Govermment has established a tax-free zone
with generous investment incentives.
10.     In the last few years i4auritius has carried out a public investment
program averaging about $10 million a year, of which some three quarters has
been financed externaliy. Because of the slow growth of GDP and the difficult
unemployment problem, it will be a number of years before Aauritius will be
able to finance a larger proportion of public investment than it has in the
past. Foreign assistance should therefore continue to cover at least three
quarters of total project costs and this will necessitate financing local
expenditure for high priority projects in which, as in the present case, the
foreign exchange component is low.
11.     Service payments on external public debt contracted up to December
1969 are expected to reach about 6 percent of export earnings in 1975, bout
then fall in subsequent years below 3 percent. Although the debt service
ratio taken by itself is not high, poverty, limited growth prospects and the
uncertain nature of future export earnings combine to justify support on
IDA terms.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
12.     A report entitled "Mauritius Tea Development Authority Project -
ilauritius" (PA-70a) of March 18, 1971 is attached.
13.     The project would add 5,840 acres of smallholder tea to the 4,000
acres planted during the first phase of Mauritius' smallholder tea development
program, 1963-1970. The project would cover 3 years of planting and 3 years
of maintenance, beginning in 1971.
14.     The first phase of the program has been initiated by a division
of the Ministry of Agriculture. These arrangements would not be satisfactory
to manage an expanded program on the scale envisaged and the Mauritius Tea
Development Authority (MTDA) has been established to manage the project and
to purchase, own and operate the facilities and equipment required for
planting the 5, 840 acres of tea and processing its output.  MTDA would
engage consultants for the design of the two project tea factories and
engage managing agents to supervise the construction of the factories and
to operate them.  The Mauritius Cooperative Central Bank (MCCB) would
provide seasonal agricultural credit to smalllolders leasing tea holdings
established by MTDA under the project.



15.      Project costs are estimated at US$7 million, of which Us$..4
million would be for the construction of two tea factories; about US$1.6
million for creating, staffing and equipping NTDA; and about US$4I million
for farm development, including tea plantings. Direct investments in the
tea factories, MTDA offices, stores, equipment, and tea plantings account for
nearly 90 percent of the project costs. The remaining costs would be ex-
patriate salaries and other administrative expenses of NTDA. The proposed
IDA credit would finance US$5.2 million (three-fourths of total project
costs) representing the estimated foreign exchange component of US$2.4
million (34 percent of total costs) and US$2.8 million of local costs.
Government would finance the remaining US$1.7 million of local costs (one
fourth of total costs).
16.      To ensure that the financial benefits of the project should so
far as possible accrue to the smallholders and that smallholders receive a
price for their tea that would be an adequate incentive, the proceeds of
the proposed IDA credit and the Government's own contribution to the project
would be passed to MTDA in the form of a loan to bo repaid in 20 equal
annual installments, without interest. MTDA would set its buying price each
year at a level that would enable it to cover all operating costs, repay
the Government loan and build up reserves against cyclone damage and other
contingencies.
17.      Unemployment in Mauritius is estimated at more than 20 percent of
the labor force. The project would create 4,100 new jobs, reducing present
Government unemployment relief expenditure, and would generate gross foreign
exchange earnings of US$3 million a year at maturity. The capital cost per
job created, $1,700, is low in relation to alternative projects in
Mauritius. Given the heavy unenployment in Mauritius it is appropriate to
treat the opportunity cost of labor provided by tenants and their families
as zero for purposes of calculating the economic return from the project
(see paragraph 8.04 and annex 18 of the appraisal report). On this basis
the economic rate of return is estimated at about 15 percent, considerably
higher than any present alternative investment possibility in agriculture.
The annual net cash income of a tenant tea grower during the first four
years of his tenancy would average a fully employed laborerts income of
Rs 1,500 ($273) a year, and would increase thereafter to more than
Rs 2,000 ($364) per annum at maturity, after taking account of an expected
reduction in producer prices in face of the downward trend in world tea
prices.
18.      Procurement of all major plant and equipment would be carried out on
the basis of international competition. Contracts for the construction of
buildings and staff housing would be let after local tendering, since the
value of any one contract would not exceed $10,000, which would not attract
international bidding.
19.      Retroactive financing is proposed as from January 1, 1971 up to a
total of US$130,000 to cover down payments on vital land clearing equipment,
salaries of expatriate management staff, initial costs of MITDA buildings
and the purchase of essential materials and supplies for nursery development.



20.      All Crown Land required for the project has been transferred by the
Government to MTDA on a 99 year lease. The vesting in the MTDA of the
Government's rights under existing leases to cooperatives and IDA approval
of the form of lease of new blocks of land to cooperatives, of their sub-
lease by cooperatives to smallholders and of a new agreement governing the
operation and finance of the existing tea factory would be conditions of
effectiveness. The recently enacted MTDA Act provides a satisfactory legal
basis for effective organization and management of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS ANiD AUTHORITY
21.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between Mauritius and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the MIauritius Tea
Development Authority (MTDA) and the Association, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and the text of Resolution approving the
proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.      The draft Development Credit and Project Agreements follow the
general pattern of other agreements for smallholder tea development
projects. The relending to MTDA under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement approved
by the Association is provided for in Section 3.01 (b) of the Development
Credit Agreement.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
23.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOKENDATION
24.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
