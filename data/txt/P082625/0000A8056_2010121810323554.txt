                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Borrower will consider submitting, by early December 2010, a request for a one-year extension of the Project's closing date. Such an extension is expected to be necessary to
                         allow the completion of the ongoing activities financed by the Project, including several studies that will be the backbone of the proposed Vilcanota II Project, which is currently in
                         preparation.
