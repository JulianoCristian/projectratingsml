This will involve\n            the preparation and execution of minor infrastructure works,\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening actions at\n            various levels of government, and the undertaking of careful\n            studies on key social and environmental issues, with a\n            particular emphasis on disaster management and risk\n            reduction. This project has been resubmitted to the Board\n            for restructuring. Bank safeguard policy OP 4.10, on\n            Indigenous Peoples, has been triggered as part of the\n            restructuring. As indigenous communities are determined to\n            constitute the majority of project beneficiaries, the\n            policy's more rigorous standards of stakeholder\n            engagement and respect for local cultures will apply to the\n            project as a whole. This Summary of the project's\n            approach for ensuring compliance with the policy, including\n            a detailed overview of the consultation process undertaken\n            to date, and arrangements regarding future planned\n            consultations, has been disclosed in-country by the Client\n            and in InfoShop, according to Bank disclosure requirements."}, "docdt": "2008-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
