This will require\n            infrastructure works, namely access roads, water supply and\n            sanitation, and construction of tourist areas requiring\n            visitor centers, rehabilitation of archaeological sites, and\n            telecommunications centers. This project has been\n            resubmitted to the Board for restructuring. This document\n            discusses environmental and social management of the\n            Restructured Project. The environmental assessment (EA)\n            comprises 4 volumes that contain environmental management\n            guidelines (V. 1) summarizing the project background;\n            guidelines for minor infrastructure works (V. 2) outlining\n            the environmental policy framework and legislation, and, the\n            proposed mitigation for infrastructure works under\n            environmental categories A, B, or C, including basic\n            procedural manuals; and, guidelines for the environmental\n            assessment on the construction of sanitary landfills (V. 3).\n            This document is V. 4 and replaces V. 1. Under the\n            Restructured Project, the EA of the Project will be updated\n            to reflect changes such as the fact that sanitary landfills\n            will not be constructed. Instead there will be a study on\n            solid waste options for the Valley. Training programs shall\n            be conducted taking into account the socioeconomic\n            conditions of local communities. Work safety guidelines are\n            included in V. 2."}, "docdt": "2008-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
