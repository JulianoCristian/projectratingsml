outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project attempted to address a broad\n            range of multi-sectoral issues ranging from cultural\n            heritage preservation to regional development and provision\n            of basic infrastructure services. Addressing this complex\n            range of themes required multiple institutions and large\n            teams on both the Bank and the Government side.\n            Participatory processes only contributed to the excessive\n            scope and complexity of the original design. Some activities\n            required coordination among several institutions at\n            different government level, such as the revisions and\n            approvals of the feasibility studies. Poor\n            inter-institutional coordination and communication created\n            delays and often contradicting messages to the consultant.\n            The Bank team supported intensive training in procurement\n            and financial management but this was not done early enough\n            in the project cycle and resulted in large delays in\n            disbursements. The decision to prior review all contracts\n            adopted during the restructuring reduced procurement risk\n            but also created substantial delays for the Borrower while\n            waiting for Bank no objections."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
