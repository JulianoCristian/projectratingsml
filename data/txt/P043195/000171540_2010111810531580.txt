Re:  
Rijeka Gateway Project (Loan No. 4715 HR) 
Amendment to the Loan Agreement and waiver of covenant
Dear Dr. Hlaca: 
 
We refer to:  (i) the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced Project, dated July 12, 
2003, between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Port of 
Rijeka Authority (the Borrower), as amended by a letter of amendment dated September 19, 2008 
(the Loan Agreement), under a Guarantee Agreement of even date therewith between the 
Republic of Croatia (the Guarantor) and the Bank; (ii) your written communication dated 
September 17, 2010  on behalf of the Borrower, requesting an amendment to the Loan Agreement 
to allow the Borrower more time to fulfill certain covenant. 
After due consideration, the Bank concurs with your request and agrees to amend 
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement to read as follows: 
“6. 
Unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, not later than December 15, 2011, the 
Borrower shall award a contract to a company selected through a public 
competitive bidding process
 
conducted in accordance with procedures
 
satisfactory to the Bank, to redevelop part of the maritime domain of the Port of 
Rijeka for urban purposes.” 
Moreover, in view of the exceptional global economic conditions in 2009 and their effect 
on the Borrower, we agree to waive the requirement that, for the year 2009, PRA maintain the 
ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenues not higher than 150%, as set forth in 
Section 4.05 (a) of the Loan Agreement.   
 
Except as specifically amended in accordance with the provisions of this letter of 
amendment, all provisions, terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement otherwise remain in full 
force and effect.
