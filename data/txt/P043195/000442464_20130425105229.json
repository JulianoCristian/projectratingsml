satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: unexpected events should be\n            expected in a large-scale project. Whether a project is\n            successful depends on how these events are addressed.\n            Project complexity increases implementation risk. The\n            technical challenges, the disparate elements and the reform\n            agenda made this project nearly impossible to successfully\n            implement. The results framework matters, and is how a\n            project is evaluated. Legal changes might not be appropriate\n            for specific investment loans. Institutional reform requires\n            commitment from the government and built-in incentives from\n            the project design.
