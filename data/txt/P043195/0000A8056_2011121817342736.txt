                         The construction of the additional quay wall for the Brajdica Container Terminal is ongoing according to schedule. The operations of the Brajdica terminal by Adriatic Gate majority
                         shareholder ICTSI have already led to increased productivity and to the development of container activities.
                         The Zagreb Container Terminal (ZCT) bids opening process took place on October 7, 2011 and the bid evaluation procedure is currently ongoing. The signing of the corresponding
