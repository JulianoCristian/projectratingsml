                         Overall, the project continues to progress well, despite delays compared to the original schedule. While traffic contracted in 2009, container traffic volumes in the port of Rijeka

                         approach to public private partnership in the port is proceeding with the selection of an international private partner for the Adriatic Gate company expected to be completed in 2011.
