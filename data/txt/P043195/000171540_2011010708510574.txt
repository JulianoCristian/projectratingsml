Dear Dr. Hlaca: 
 
Re:  
Loan for Rijeka Gateway Project (Loan No. 4715 HR) 
Extension of Closing Date and Reallocation of Loan Proceeds
We refer to: (i) the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced Loan for Rijeka 
Gateway Project, dated July 12, 2003 (Loan 4715-HR), as amended, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Port of 
Rijeka Authority (the Borrower) (the Loan Agreement), under a Guarantee Agreement of 
the same date between the Republic of Croatia (the Guarantor) and the Bank; and (ii) 
your written communication dated November 5, 2010 on behalf of the Borrower, 
requesting an extension of the closing date to the Loan Agreement to enable the Project 
to reach its development objectives more effectively, within the existing period of project 
implementation. 
After due consideration, the Bank concurs with your request and agrees to extend 
the Closing Date set forth in Section 2.03 to the Loan Agreement, as amended, to August 
31, 2011. The Bank notes that such extension is provided on an exceptional basis, and 
requests PRA to work actively with all its contractors to accelerate project 
implementation. 
 
Moreover, we also refer to the above referred letter requesting the Bank to 
combine disbursement categories under the same Loan and your further exchanges on 
this matter with the project Team Leader concluding that it would be more appropriate to 
reallocate funds among categories. We are pleased to inform you that the Bank concurs 
with your request. Therefore, the Bank agrees to adjust the proceeds of the Loan as set 
out in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement as follows:  
 
a.  USD 1.3 million from Category (2) Goods for Parts A, B.1 and B.2 to Category 
(1) Works.

Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by countersigning both copies of 
this letter of amendment and returning one of the countersigned copies to us.  This letter 
of amendment will become effective as of the date hereof upon receipt by the Bank of the 
copy of this letter of amendment countersigned by you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
