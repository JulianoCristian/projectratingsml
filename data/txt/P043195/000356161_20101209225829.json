The\n            reallocation will ensure the full disbursement of the loan\n            and reflects the need for additional funds for civil works\n            and fewer funds for goods over the period. The extension is\n            necessary due to initial delays in the mobilization of the\n            contractor for the Brajdica container terminal. The precise\n            status of all ongoing contracts was reviewed during a recent\n            implementation support mission in October 2010. This review\n            confirmed that all funds under this loan are expected to be\n            disbursed by the new closing date for this loan. This will\n            be the second extension of closing date for this loan."}, "docdt": "2010-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
