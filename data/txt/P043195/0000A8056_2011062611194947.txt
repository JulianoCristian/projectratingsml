                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project continues to progress well, despite delays compared to the original schedule.
                         In terms of outcomes, while total traffic volumes contracted in 2009 and 2010, container traffic in the port of Rijeka showed signs of recovery in 2010, with continued growth in the
                         first months of 2011. The road component has been mostly completed with the exception of road D404, which administrative process for road opening was delayed and is expected
                         to be operational for the summer 2011. Regarding port activities, the construction of the Brajdica Container Terminal is progressing well, while the bidding procedure for the Zagreb

                         Container Terminal is ongoing. The approach to private sector participation made solid progress with the selection of an international container terminal operator, ICTSI, to become
                         the majority private partner in the company Adriatic Gate Container Terminal (AGCT).

                         The bidding documents for the Delta area redevelopment are under preparation, and consultations with interested developers are expected to take place in fall 2011.
                         The Environmental management of the project remains satisfactory and the port community is building its capacity in these aspects.
