                        Extension of Closing Date
                   CROATIA -- RIJEKA GATEWAY PROJECT
                                  P043195
                              Loan No. 4715 HR

1.     The closing date for the Croatia, Rijeka Gateway Project, Loan No. 4715 HR,
P043195, to the Port of Rijeka Authority would be extended from December 31, 2010
until August 31, 2011.

2.     The project closing date has already been extended until September 30, 2012,
through a previous restructuring of the Loan No. 4715-1 HR. Accordingly, the new
Closing Date for this loan would not extend the closing date for the project. All other
loans under the project would keep their current closing date of December 31, 2010.

3.       The Rijeka Gateway Project includes the following three main components: (i)
Road Connection; (ii) Port Development; and (ii) Port-City Interface. About 71 percent
of the loans (US$150 million) have been disbursed, and US$330 million of contracts
have been awarded. The Road Connection component will be completed by the end of
2010, with the opening of road D404. The sections of the Rijeka bypass financed by the
project (Orehovica- Sveti Kuzam) are in operation. The quality systems of Croatian
Motorways have been upgraded. The first part of the Port City Interface component has
been completed with the construction of a new passenger terminal and the reopening of
the port breakwater to the public. With the exception of the new terminal construction,
activities under the Port Development component have also been mostly completed,
including the launch of a new Vessel Traffic Management system to improve
environmental protection.

4.       Five main activities remain to be completed: the construction of the Zagreb
Container Terminal, the completion of the Brajdica Container Terminal extension,
implementation of electronic data interchange within the port community, increased
private sector participation in port stevedoring activities and preparation for the
redevelopment of a port area into an urban area (so called Delta-Port of Baros area). The
first stage bids for the construction of the Zagreb Container terminal have been received.
The construction of the Brajdica Terminal extension started in March 2010. The contract
for the electronic port community system is ongoing. Transactions to seek private
partners for specific terminals are ongoing. After complex interactions among concerned
parties, the final preparation of tender documents to redevelop the Delta area is expected
to be completed in early 2011. The Project objectives continue to be achievable within
the closing date for the project.

5.     The proposed extension is necessary due to initial delays in the mobilization of
the contractor for the Brajdica Container Terminal. The precise status of all ongoing
contracts was reviewed during a recent implementation support mission in October 2010.

                                            3
This review confirmed that all funds under this loan are expected to be disbursed by the
new Closing Date for this loan.

6.     This will be the second extension of closing date for this loan.
