The project will have\n            the following main construction components:  (a) a new\n            intake in the Chatra Gorge about 1,300 meters upstream of\n            the present intake; (b) a culvert to carry the supply from\n            the new intake to a new pre-settling basin; (c) a new\n            pre-settling basin immediately upstream of the existing\n            intake; (d) modification to the existing intake to make it\n            hydraulically more efficient, together with a lead channel\n            to the enlarged desilting basin; (e) an enlarged desilting\n            basin about 990 meters long and 70 meters wide; (f) dredge\n            facilities for removing silt from the basin; (g) a\n            microhydro plant to provide energy for the dredge equipment;\n            (h) technical assistance including training and consultancy\n            services; and (i) hydrological equipment.
