{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Implementation\n            Completion and Result Report on the Economic Governance and\n            Recovery Grant (EGRG) Project for Cote d'Ivoire were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was satisfactory, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: given the capacity bottlenecks in the\n            country and the fragile and politically complex\n            post-conflict situation, it is necessary to ensure that a\n            development policy operation is accompanied by appropriately\n            targeted technical assistance to ensure that the commitment\n            and willingness lead to reform results. In this case, the\n            EGRG was supported by Governance and Institutional\n            Development Technical Assistance (TA) Project and a\n            Low-Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund. In such\n            post-conflict situations, it is particularly important to\n            select a focused number of prior actions that are deemed\n            essential to supporting the government's broader reform\n            program. Such selectivity and coordination not only reduces\n            the transaction costs for the government that is burdened by\n            multiple management demands while the capacity is weak, but\n            it also increases the likelihood that such focused actions\n            are implemented and the reform program is moved forward.\n            Given the risks and complexity of this operation in the\n            country's context, close coordination with other\n            development partners has been indispensable to mitigate\n            risks, realize synergies, and improve the leverage in the\n            policy dialogue. Collaboration with the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) was particularly important."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
