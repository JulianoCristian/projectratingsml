Management Project for Samoa were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            long-term projects, particularly those that make use of\n            restructuring and more than one source of finance, should\n            use the restructuring to close out completed components, or\n            to update legal covenants, monitoring indicators, and other\n            design elements. \u0091building resilience\u0092 is time consuming and\n            should seek to empower communities to identify and implement\n            local solutions to manage their specific risk levels. As a\n            corollary, communities do not always have the means to build\n            resilience with only their own resources. In small countries\n            where the Bank has few operations and local implementing\n            agencies have to contend with many different external\n            support partners with differing procedures, clearly\n            establishing the roles and responsibilities of different\n            stakeholders, including the Bank, and doing this early on\n            can help to ensure that projects are implemented efficiently\n            and effectively."}, "docdt": "2014-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
