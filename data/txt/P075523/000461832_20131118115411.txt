A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks the approval of the Country Director to update the
performance indicators to SIAM-2 (P075523), associated with the Pacific Region Infrastructure
Facility (PRIF) TF10785, and to carry out any necessary accompanying amendments to the
project’s legal documents. This RP reflects changes discussed with the Ministry of Finance and
the Land Transport Authority (LTA) during the January 28 to February 7, 2013 mission to
supervise the Second Infrastructure Asset Management Project (SIAM-2) and recorded in the
Aide Mémoire dated February 11, 2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.       Background: The project development objectives (PDO) of the Second Infrastructure
Asset Management Project (SIAM-2) are to: (i) enhance the economic, environmental and social
sustainability of transport and coastal infrastructure assets; and (ii) manage those assets and
natural resources and respond to national emergencies, through an effective partnership with
private sector stakeholders.

3.      Under the Project Code for SIAM-2 (P075523), there have been four sources of
financing:

          IDA 38480-WSO (IDA Credit of $12.80 mil.), approved on December 29, 2003 and
           closed on June 30, 2010;
          IDA 38481-WSO (Additional Financing IDA Credit of $4.135 mil.), approved on
           June 19, 2007 and closed on June 30, 2013;
          IDA H3110-WSO (Additional Financing IDA Grant of $4.135 mil.), approved on
           June 19, 2007 and closed on June 30, 2013; and
          TF10785 (PRIF Grant of $3.83 mil.), approved on February 1, 2012 with
           effectiveness on August 23, 2012, and a current closing date of December 31, 2014.

4.      The original project was approved by the Board on December 29, 2003 and became
effective on June 18, 2004. Both a Credit and Grant were provided to the GoS under the Credit
Agreement (IDA 38480-WSO) dated January 20, 2004, as well as under the Financing
Agreement for the additional financing (Credit Number 38481-WSO and Grant Number H3110-
WSO), dated August 13, 2007.

5.      The closing date of the original project (P075523) was June 30, 2010. When the
Additional Financing was approved in 2007, the closing date matched that of the original project
(see page 10 of the Financing Agreement). Shortly after the additional financing was approved,
the closing date was extended by 18 months to December 31, 2011. When the PRIF trust fund
was added to the project, the project was restructured and the closing date of SIAM-2 (P075523)
was extended once more to June 30, 2013. Most recently, the closing date of the PRIF trust fund
has been extended by 18 months to December 31, 2014.



                                               4
6.       Project Description:        Principal activities under SIAM-2 include: (i) Airport
Infrastructure - implementing a computerized asset management system for the Samoa Airport
Authority; (ii) Road and Other Infrastructure - upgrading and widening of key road assets in
Apia Town; (iii) Sustainable Management of Infrastructure, Natural Resources and Risks -
furthering institutional and technological improvements to the Disaster Management and Land
Registration Systems; (iv) Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure - sustaining
institutional reforms in the road sector through the use of specialists; and (v) Project Management
- supporting project implementation.

7.      Summary of Implementation Progress: The following provides an overview of progress
in implementing SIAM-2’s components.

           Component 1: Airport Infrastructure. All activities under Component 1 have been
            completed.
           Component 2: Road and Other Infrastructure. Under this component, improvements
            to key road sector assets in Apia Town were carried out, including widening of
            Vaitele Street, a key corridor, and replacement of the Togafuafua and Viamoso
            Bridges. The improvements to Viatele Street have been completed, while the works
            on the Togafuafua Bridge are nearing completion. The replacement of the Vaimoso
            Bridge is well advanced and is expected to be completed in early-2014. Although
            works are largely on track, progress was hindered by Tropical Cyclone Evan, which
            struck Samoa on December 13 and 14, 2012. At the time, all contractors, including
            those working on Vaitele Street and the two bridges, were diverted to respond to
            emergency efforts to clear roads and clean-up flooded areas.
           Component 3: Sustainable Management of Infrastructure, Natural Resources and
            Risks. Activities under Component 3 have been satisfactorily completed.
           Component 4: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure. This
            component continues to progress satisfactorily. Rather than construct a permanent
            weigh bridge on LTA property, it was agreed that weigh pads would be more
            appropriate and that legislation to enable LTA to enforce axle load restrictions
            generally should be amended.
           Component 5: Project Management. It was strongly recommended during the June
            2013 mission that the consulting firm supporting LTA to implement the project (IPA)
            take a more proactive role in providing technical guidance to the LTA in gathering
            the required indicators, which is part of their duties.

8.       Project Ratings: Both key project ratings, progress towards achieving the PDO and
overall implementation progress, have been rated as satisfactory (PDO) or moderately satisfactory
(implementation progress) for the past year. The current rating for progress toward achieving the
PDO is satisfactory, while the rating for overall implementation progress continues to be
moderately satisfactory, largely because the Vaimoso and Togafuafua Bridge replacements could
not be completed by the project’s previous closing date of June 2013. The project team believes
that the PDO remains relevant and that generally satisfactory progress towards the PDO will
continue. There are no overdue audit reports, no key actions pending from prior-year audits, and
no outstanding IFRs.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9.   The modifications proposed under this restructuring will not change the PDO, and the
PDO will still be achieved with the activities being carried out under the remaining project

                                                5
components. No new activities are being proposed. There is no escalation of the safeguard
rating, and no additional safeguards triggered. As such, a Level 2 restructuring will be carried
out.

10.     Updated Performance Indicators. The finance agreement for the original project (IDA
38480-WSO, now closed) identifies 11 key performance indicators. During implementation,
seven additional indicators were introduced in an effort to gather more meaningful data on project
performance. In all, 18 indicators were being measured during implementation. However, the
implementing agencies found many of these indicators difficult to measure in a consistent and
meaningful manner and the Task Team has worked with counterparts to identify more meaningful
ones. The Task Team believes that even at this late stage it makes sense to revise the indicators
because: (i) it would relieve the Client from collecting difficult indicators, many of which are no
longer appropriate; and (ii) some previous data likely exists for some of the proposed revised
indicators, so changing them now would likely enable the Client and Task Team to better
measure the project's impact. Therefore, the project team now proposes to rationalize the
indicators by reducing the PDO indicators to four, which includes the revision of one indicator to
be a core sector indicator, and the intermediate results indicators to three. Annex 1 summarizes
the proposed modifications to the current indicators.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

11.      Safeguards. Since there is no change in the scope of activities to be funded under the
restructured project, there is no change in the project’s safeguards category, which is Category B
(Partial Assessment). No new safeguards policies will be triggered and the safeguards
instruments that were developed during project preparation remain appropriate.

2.      There will be no changes to the procurement and financial management arrangements.
