1     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.       Samoa comprises nine islands located in the South Pacific just south of the equator.
Ninety nine percent of the population of some 190,000 people lives on the main islands of
Upolu and Savai’i. As a small island economy, Samoa's development is constrained by a
very small internal market, distant external markets, a narrow production base, high unit
costs of infrastructure from low utilization rates, and vulnerability to external economic
shocks and natural disasters. Following a number of economic shocks in the early 1990s,
the Government of Samoa’s structural reform program and associated first Statement of
Economic Strategy (1995) laid the foundations for recovery including reconstruction of
infrastructure following two cyclones, improved fiscal discipline, and partnerships between
the government and the private sector that hitherto had been undeveloped. The subsequent
Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2002-2004 focused on maintaining a stable macro-
economic environment and, among other things, continuing to nurture an enabling
environment for the private sector, improving infrastructure services and continuing a
program of significant civil service restructuring.

2.       At the time of appraisal, the core of the Bank’s strategy for the Pacific region was to
reduce poverty through support for “the human capital, policies, institutions, and physical
infrastructure” needed for equitable and sustainable growth (Pacific Regional Strategy,
2000).      The Strategy emphasized a sector focus on education, health, transport and
telecommunications, and had an added emphasis on strengthening private sector capacity.
Support for transport infrastructure and telecommunications were expected to assist in
addressing the well-documented remoteness and isolation of the Pacific countries,
including Samoa. Samoa’s existing transport system at the time was fairly well developed.
The land, marine and aviation infrastructure, while basic, was considered generally
appropriate and in good condition as a result of moderate investment programs over the
past decade, including those made under the first phase of the Samoa Infrastructure Asset
Management Program (SIAM-1).

3.      SIAM-1 was a long-term, two-phase Adaptable Program Lending (APL) operation
that was designed to contribute to the Bank’s Regional Strategy objective for equitable and
sustainable growth, to enhance the economic, environmental and social sustainability of
transport and coastal infrastructure assets, and to manage those assets, natural resources and
disaster risks through an effective partnership with private sector stakeholders. Phase 1
(SIAM-1, 1999-2003) focused on meeting vital infrastructure investment priorities and
strengthening government management systems.

4.          Specific sub-sector issues to be addressed were:

      (i)      Aviation Infrastructure: Under SIAM-1, major rehabilitation of the international
               airport at Faleolo was undertaken to elevate the airport to meet its ICAO
               (International Civil Aviation Organization) safety standards, and the business
               practices of the operator Samoa Airport Authority (SAA) were strengthened.
               SAA needed to implement further strategic actions to ensure its financial



                                                  7
        viability, including closures of loss-making Fagali’i and Asau Airports, raising
        revenues, maintaining safety (including installation of a replacement Instrument
        Landing System), and monitoring and reducing maintenance costs based on an
        asset management system.

(ii)    Road Infrastructure and Transport: Road infrastructure was not adequate to
        respond to and meet the rapid economic growth that was taking place, especially
        in the urban areas. The primary challenge was how to plan and finance an
        investment backlog and preserve existing assets. By design, this should be
        financially sustainable without dependence on external assistance. According to
        a survey of road infrastructure assets carried out under SIAM-1, about 10
        percent of the road network was inadequate to meet traffic needs and up to 13
        bridges required replacement or improvement.         There was also need for
        upgrading and road safety measures in heavily trafficked Apia, the country’s
        capital. The national budget was only sufficient to meet about 60 percent of
        asset maintenance needs and was insufficient to meet any expansion to the
        network.

        The national civil service reforms of the mid-1990s led to a restructuring of the
        Department of Works and the establishment of a more encompassing Ministry
        of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure (MWTI) with responsibility for asset
        management and sector policy. All service delivery, previously undertaken in-
        house by the now defunct Department of Works, was to be contracted out to the
        private sector which was in keeping with the Government’s structural reform
        program and was echoed by the Bank’s Regional Strategy. Further investments
        also were needed in road asset management and land transport administration,
        mooted through the proposed creation of a statutory Land Transport Authority
        (LTA), and similar to the reasonably successful regulatory and enforcement
        arrangements in the aviation and maritime sub-sectors. Sustainable financing,
        by cost recovery through road user charges, would be necessary to underlie the
        Authority’s operations and its ability to attract and retain suitably skilled staff.

(iii)   Sustainable Management of the Environment and Natural Resources and Risk:
        Coastal infrastructure was seen as a priority as over 80 percent of the country’s
        economic activities and population were (and continue to be) concentrated in
        coastal zones that are vulnerable to natural hazards and exposed to the impacts
        of climate change. A four-part program to reduce natural hazard risks had been
        initiated under SIAM-1, namely: (i) strengthening the requirements for
        environmental management in all infrastructure activities; (ii) preparing a
        national strategy and district-level management plans for improving the
        resilience of coastal assets to natural hazards; (iii) improving the quality and
        accessibility of land and resource-related information through the creation of
        computerized data, images and maps available to the public; and (iv)
        implementing sustainable approaches to coastal protection through the
        preparation of      district-level coastal infrastructure management plans (CIM
        Plans) that were based on participatory planning methods. Additional capital
        investment was needed to construct coastal protection measures at high risk sites


                                           8
                 and further institutional reforms were needed, for example, to upgrade land
                 administration procedures to enable economic development, and to focus risk
                 management beyond preparedness and response to address ex ante risk
                 reduction.

5.      Thus, the overall purpose of the second phase of the APL (SIAM-2) was to provide
investments and support to underwrite sustainable economic growth and protection of the
assets, all with an emphasis on effective partnerships between the public sector
implementing agencies and the private sector and communities.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as
        approved)

6.    The project development objectives as cited in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) for SIAM-2 were:

          (i)     Key infrastructure assets perform satisfactorily with sustainable resilience to
                  natural risks; and
          (ii)    Oversight and management of infrastructure, natural resources, and national
                  emergency (sic) are effective and efficient, with participation of private sector
                  and stakeholders.

7.     However, the objectives as set out in the original Credit Agreement and subsequent
Additional Financing Agreements, were aligned to the overall Program objective to:

          (i)     Enhance the economic, environmental and social sustainability of transport
                  and coastal infrastructure assets; and
          (ii)    To manage those assets and natural resources and [response to] disaster risks
                  through an effective partnership with private sector stakeholders.

8.      The more specific PDOs as per the Financing Agreements also were used for
monitoring and reporting in the latter half of the Project. 7 As such, they are used for the
final assessment of the Project.

9.     The Project Indicators as appraised for both the overall Program and for SIAM-2
made use of a logical framework approach (preceding the Results Framework format). The
eight end-of-project performance indicators of Project outcomes/impacts 8 as set out in
Annex 1 of the PAD were as follows:

          •      MWTI and MNRE are established, fully staffed and functioning;
          •      All primary road, aviation and public coastal infrastructure assets are under
                 quantitative asset management procedures;

7   The PDO was conflated in the first six years of the Project’s Implementation Status Results Reports (ISRs,
     Nos. 1 through 11) to read “Key infrastructure assets are sustainable and managed effectively by a
     partnership of stakeholders”, which was the same of the overall (both phases) SIAM Program Purpose (see
     PAD Annex 1 log frame).
8   Equivalent to Results Framework PDO-level indicators.



                                                       9
          •   Air transport, roads, and coastal infrastructure investments conform with
              appraisal and sectoral plan requirements, for at least 80% of national
              investments;
          •   Protection of coastal communities is provided through a Coastal Infrastructure
              Management Strategy (CIMS) and adopted by at least 80% of Districts;
          •   Cost recovery for public infrastructure assets reaches agreed targets, i.e.: 80% of
              full costs for aviation; and 80% of road preservation costs;
          •   Improved service quality rating by road users and other affected groups;
          •   Percent reduction in unit costs for maintenance and development, and road user
              costs; and
          •   The share of infrastructure works and services provided through the private
              sector is at least 80 percent.

10.     A further thirteen performance indicators for project outputs 9 were set out in Annex
1 of the PAD as follows:

          •   ICAO operational standards maintained;
          •   Percentage increase in passengers serviced, in line with economic growth;
          •   Length arterial roads with adequate capacity;
          •   Number of bridges rehabilitated;
          •   Number of accidents per year;
          •   MNRE fully staffed and functional;
          •   Coastal Asset Management database fully populated and functionally integrated
              with Samoa Asset Management System outputs;
          •   Computerized land registration and titling system established;
          •   CIM Plans endorsed by coastal communities in at least 80% percent of Districts
              (34 of 43);
          •   LTA established by 2005;
          •   Road user charges begun July 2004;
          •   Percent progress and slippage against implementation schedule of Project; and
          •   Actual cost/estimated cost of Project.

11.     As in the case of the PDOs, the indicators were more specific and measurable in the
Financing Agreement than in the PAD.           Consequently, by agreement between the
implementing agencies (IAs) and the Bank’s project team, in March 2006, data collection
efforts and Project monitoring by the IAs and Project Management Unit (PMU) (through
the Project Quarterly Progress Reports) focused on a subset of eleven Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) drawn from both the outcomes and outputs indicators in the PAD, as set
out in the Development Credit Agreement Cr. 3848-WSO, Schedule 5. The DCA
indicators are as follows (summarized with end-of-project targets only):

          •   Samoa Airport Authority percent cost recovery for air transport infrastructure
              assets (80%);
          •   Asset management system operational for airport infrastructure assets

9   Equivalent to Results Framework Intermediate Results Indicators.



                                                     10
               (Operational);
           •   Staffing and effective functional capacity of MWTI (85% technical and
               management positions filled);
           •   Annual portion of road network under preservation treatment (10% primary road
               km);
           •   Service quality ratings by road users and affected groups (80% “good”);
           •   Cost recovery of road maintenance (User charges/road needs = 80%);
           •   Competitive price savings for works and services (20% below 2001 average
               maintenance cost/km);
           •   Staffing and effective functional capacity of MNRE (90% technical and
               management positions filled);
           •   Coastal communities protected/ covered by CIM Plans (100% of Districts)
           •   Compliance with EIA provisions (80%); and
           •   Available cadastral land plans digitized and validated (100% titles).

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
         and Reasons/Justification10

12.        The Project development objectives were not changed during implementation.

13.      The original Credit Agreement KPIs (above) were carried through to the Additional
Financing Agreement (August 2007) with minor modifications made to dates and some
targets, as follows:

           •   The end-of-project (EOP) date for all indicators was amended from December
               2008 to the newly extended project closing date of June 30, 2010;
           •   The baseline year for measuring “Competitive price savings for works and
               services” was updated from the PAD’s original baseline of “2001” to a “2003”
               baseline (start of SIAM-2);
           •   The “Compliance with EIA provisions” target was raised from 80 percent to 100
               percent as the original EOP target of 80 percent had already been met by August
               2006; and
           •   The “Available cadastral land plans digitized and validated” was originally
               targeted as 100 percent of all titles but this was reduced to 30 percent. The
               reasons for this are not documented. It may have been due to a possible
               interpretation that “100% of lands to be titled” as part of the reform to the land
               administration system to a Torrens system and the strong political consensus
               that customary lands should not be alienated.

14.     In addition to the KPIs, the Additional Finance Project Paper (May 23, 2007) set out
seven Project Outcome Indicators consisting of two Project Development Objective
Indicators and five Intermediate Outcome Indicators (one for each of the five Project
Components) (see Annex 5).


10   Annex 5 provides additional explanatory information on the indicators and revisions made to them through
     the course of Project implementation.



                                                      11
15.      In all, the 18 indicators (11 KPIs and seven outcome indicators) were variously
measured during implementation, but the implementing agencies found some of them
difficult to measure in a consistent manner. Although undertaken at a late stage of the
Program (in November 2013), the Project was restructured to rationalize and update the
Project monitoring indicators. As a result, the PDO indicators were reduced to four
(including the revision of one indicator to be a core indicator) and the intermediate results
indicators were reduced to three.

16.      The changes made to the indicators through the 2013 formal restructuring are shown
in detail in Annex 5, Table 5.A. In summary, the changes were that:

       (i)   those indicators that related to Component A (Samoa Airports Authority
             implemented) which was no longer active under the Project were dropped;
       (ii) those indicators for which data collection had been problematic for some time
             were dropped (reliant on a sophisticated asset management system that was
             not finally used by LTA; requiring dedicated and costly road user surveys by
             LTA; and unclear measurement of either cadastral land plans or titled lands);
             and
       (iii) output indicators measuring progress on completion of certain activities that
             had already been completed were dropped.

17.     The revised indicators (after restructuring) have had clearer measurement (including
values for past years), and are used in the final assessment of the Project’s achievements
(this ICR). They are as follows:

        PDO Level Results Indicators:
           Roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads
           Reformed management structures in place for Land Transport
           Annual portion of national road network receiving periodic maintenance
           Coastal communities covered by CIM Plans

       Intermediate Results Indicators:
             Percentage of key technical and managerial positions filled at LTA
             Competitive price savings for maintenance works
             Compliance with EIA provisions.
1.4   Main Beneficiaries
18.      SIAM-2 implemented priority physical investments that removed bottlenecks and
improved connectivity by widening of 36 km of roads and rehabilitating associated
drainage systems in Apia, around the country’s premier industrial area, and through built-
up peri-urban settlements between Apia and Faleolo International Airport,. The Project
also upgraded eleven urban road junctions, nine bridges and footpaths for visibility and
safety, and improved all weather access along 9 km of remote access roads, serving isolated
villages. As such, the primary beneficiary group comprised the roadside communities and
road users on the most heavily populated island of Upolu (three quarters of the country’s
total population) who benefitted from improved safety, reduced travel times and reduced
vehicle operating costs, as well as other adverse impacts associated with growing traffic



                                             12
volumes and hitherto inadequate road maintenance. Intermediate service suppliers (mainly
urban public bus operators, taxis, freight and haulers) benefitted from user savings and the
reduced travel time on the improved route between the main port, industrial area and the
airport, which in turn would have been passed on to final users including passengers,
shippers, businesses, government agencies, and tourists.           The lower income rural
communities of Lemafa, Taelefaga and Samamea benefitted from improved access to
health and education services and to livelihoods through easier transport of people, goods
and services to markets as a result of improvements to the rural feeder roads.

19.      The Project supported investments to control drainage and flooding along the West
Coast Road (WCR), and coastal protection works at Mulinu’u (Apia harbor seawall),
Fasito’o-uta and Manono-uta (domestic port), protecting vulnerable sections of the coastal
road and preserved wetlands. Community-generated Coastal Infrastructure Management
Plans (CIM Plans) were prepared and endorsed by all Districts across the country on both
of the main islands of Upolu and Savai’i, and a program of adaptation measures with non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), community groups and village committees was
implemented to minimize and mitigate natural risks through the provision of small grants
that supported 25 community-generated priority projects drawn from the CIM Plans. The
participatory planning process involved over 190 village and district meetings and
workshops on both Upolu and Savai’i and had the direct involvement in plan preparation by
over 5,000 people (2,100 matai/elders, 1,200 women and 1,500 untitled youth),
representing approximately 8 percent of Samoa's total population. Thus, communities
across the country and in particular village communities located in coastal hazard zones
benefitted as a result of identifying risks and improving the resilience of assets to natural
disasters, through improved control of drainage and flooding, physical coastline protection,
protection of water springs and the return to sustainable levels of fish populations and sand
materials with appropriate infrastructure design and village-based management.

20.     As a prescient prelude to the September 29, 2009 earthquake and subsequent
tsunami that resulted in 183 fatalities and 5, 500 internally displaced people in Samoa, a
National Tsunami Awareness Workshop (including early warning systems) was held for
trainers in August 2009 to identify weaknesses and strengths in village understanding of
tsunamis and associated hazards, and to inform villages of disaster management
arrangements and evacuation plans.         Although the information was not yet fully
disseminated when the tsunami struck in late-September 2009, some Government officials
expressed the view that the preliminary awareness and training activities may have
contributed in part to improved public safety and disaster preparedness and to more rapid
and effective post-recovery responses by the agencies. Similarly, although anecdotal, the
process of preparing the CIM Plans helped to educate villagers about the importance of
keeping roadside drains cleared and possible hidden dangers when flooding occurs, all of
which helped to lessen the impact of Tropical Cyclone Evan in December 2012.

21.     Finally, there have been general socio-economic benefits and fiscal savings for the
broader public derived from more streamlined public enterprises. For example, the Samoa
Airports Authority experienced some years of improved financial performance as a result of
among other reforms, the phased closure of a loss-making airport, and the LTA has been
able to fund annual road maintenance operations and meet a minimum return on the



                                             13
Government’s equity in the Authority. There is evidence of a strengthened and expanded
private sector as seen, for example, in the emergence and growth of a large number of road
and bridges construction companies. For example, national competitive bids for routine
maintenance works increased from four bidders at the start of the Project to up to 17
companies by the end of the Project. There is now ready access to high-quality land
information, including strengthened and transparent land registration and transfer
procedures.

1.5   Original Components (as approved)

22.     Using the same structure as SIAM-1 for consistency in the overall Infrastructure
Asset Management Program, the Project comprised five components, as summarized below
(total costs include contingencies).

Component A: Airport Infrastructure (US$1.06 million)

23.      Under the component, SAA would fund further development of the international
and minor airports form its own resources, including an instrumented landing system.
Advisory support to the Authority and establishment of asset management procedures
would be provided under Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and
Infrastructure.

Component B: Road and Other Infrastructure (US$16.06 million)

24.     Under the component, priority physical investments would be made to remove
bottlenecks and improve road network capacity, rehabilitate a key corridor, and improve
safety and pedestrian facilities, access to remote villages, and resilience to natural hazards,
including:

       •   B.1 Bridge upgrading (US$1.10 mil.): Improving traffic capacity and safety,
           and providing access to remote areas through replacement of four bridges.

           road network and improved capacity in Apia through road and bridge widening
           to four lanes on sections of Vaitele Street and Fugalei Street, with design and
           supervision services and including resettlement compensation for land
           acquisition and compensation for structures and amenities relating to the road
           works.
       •   B.5 Remote access roads (US$0.97 mil.): Upgrading (sealing) road access on a
           section of Fagaloa Bay Road over 3.9 km and design and supervision services.
       •   B.6 Infrastructure risk mitigation measures (US$0.96 mil.): Construction of
           coastal protection along about 4,000 linear meters at selected sites in accordance


                                              14
           with agreed criteria, with supervision services.

Component C: Sustainable Management Infrastructure, Natural Resources and Risks
(US$2.23 million)

25.     The component would provide technical and advisory assistance to develop
sustainable management of natural resources and the environment, to improve management
of emergencies, and to empower communities and organizations to reduce their risk from
natural disasters, including:

       •   C.4 Environment, Risk and Resource Management (ERRM) (US$1.50 mil.):
           Technical assistance to: (a) strengthen environmental management and
           regulations; (b) adapt the coastal risk management strategy, incorporate climate
           change risks, and prepare management plans for 28 Districts; (c) establish
           systems for monitoring and managing use of natural resources; and (d)
           strengthen natural emergency and disaster management, training and equipment
           for readiness and response, and financing options.
       •   C.5 Land Administration and survey (US$0.63 mil.): Technical assistance for:
           (a) improving the reliability of survey and geographic information, including

       •   C.6 Risk Adaptation Measures (US$0.10 mil.): Non-structural measures to
           improve resilience of communities by mitigating natural risks through small
           grants.



Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure (US$1.42
million)

26.     The component would strengthen institutional capacity, consolidate and extend
reforms of air and land transport with the delivery of services through the private sector,
including:

       •   D.6 Transport and Infrastructure Sector reform (US$1.31 mil.): Enhance
           capacity to manage and regulate transport systems and assets through continuing
           land transport reforms, including advisory support for establishing a Land
           Transport Authority, creating sustainable financing and affordable cost recovery
           through user charges, addressing policy and regulatory issues, advisory support
           for the SAA to implement its business and management plans, and transport
           engineering support to overcome understaffing.
       •   D.7 Training (US$0.11 mil.):            Capacity building and development of
           competencies for selected stakeholders under the Project.

Component E: Project Management (US$1.83 million)



                                             15
27.     The Project would provide support for the efficient administration of the Project,
including:

       •   Project Management: Support of a central project management unit under
           contract to Ministry of Finance, and two Project Component Managers, to assist
           management of the Project; and
       •   Project Auditing by an independent auditor of the Project financial accounts.

1.6   Revised Components

28.      An Additional Finance (AF) Grant of SDR 2.712 million and Credit of SDR 2.712
million, or approximately US$8.27 million combined, was approved June 19, 2007 (please
see the Financing Tables in Annex 1).

29.     It was one of the first Additional Finance instruments to be made available in the
region. The purpose of the AF was twofold. About 80 percent of the AF was to meet a
financing gap for: (a) widening of Vaitele Street (works, limited re-design and supervision
and professional fees to support the land acquisition processes); (b) improving drainage on
the West Coast Road; (c) implementing a computerized asset management system for the
SAA after reviewing available options and equipment for MNRE; and (d) ongoing project
management and engineering support to the implementing agencies (as the closing date for
the original Credit was extended by 18 months to June 30, 2010, the same closing date as
for the new Additional Finance Credit and Grant). The remainder (20 percent) was to scale
up a number of successful activities.       The main revisions to the components (and
Additional Finance amount) are summarized below.



Component A: Airport Infrastructure (AF US$0.00 million)

30.     At appraisal of the original Credit, Government of Samoa (GoS) was to have
provided direct counterpart funding of US$1.06 million to assist the SAA to acquire an
instrument landing system. The equipment was obtained by SAA by GoS but using a GoS
guaranteed loan from the Samoa Provident Fund, thus altering the funding method for the
component. As no more investments were planned under Component A, no additional
funding was required.

Component B: Road and Other Infrastructure (AF US$5.68 million)

       •   The number of bridges was scaled-up from four to six (plus the three along
           Vaitele Street), namely to construct bridges at Togafuafua culvert and Vaimoso-
           uta ford to further improve traffic flow and safety.
       •   Fugalei Street civil works were dropped due to budget constraints and
           scheduling priorities for the South Pacific Games.

Component C: Sustainable Management Infrastructure, Natural Resources and Risks
(AF US$0.14 million)



                                            16
31.       Scale-up for:

          •   Additional equipment for implementing, monitoring and enforcing EIA
              Regulations
          •   Tsunami awareness training for villagers on Upolu and Savai’i
          •   Establishing vertical controls the geodetic survey that had been completed
          •   Review of the national hazard early warning system;
          •   Assessing national earthquake risk; and
          •   Continued support for the use of the CIM Plans.

Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure (AF
US$0.53 million)

32.    Advisory support for SAA asset management was amended to provide support “to
review options for assessing and implementing computerized asset management systems.”

Component F: Project Management (AF US$0.62 million)

33.    Ongoing project management and engineering support was provided to the
implementing agencies to implement the ongoing and additional activities through to the
extended Project closing date of June 30, 2010.

34.      On February 1, 2012, a further restructuring was approved to provide co-financing
in an amount of US$3.83 million from the Government of Australia through the Pacific
Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) TF10785 (please see the Financing Tables in Annex
1). SIAM-2 was one of the first two projects to receive the highly concessional PRIF
funding. The Project was selected due to what was seen as its robust project design, on-
going satisfactory implementation, and close working partnership between the Bank and the
Samoan implementing agencies.           The restructuring would scale up successful Project
activities and finance activities that had been part of the Project but were deferred by the
Government (which was responsible for up to 40 percent counterpart funding) as a
consequence of the global financial crisis that had negatively affected national receipts.

35.    The main revisions to the components (and additional TF amount) are summarized
below.

Component B: Road and Other Infrastructure (TF US$2.24 million)

          •   Gap-finance for Togafuafua Bridge and approaches (including a design review
              and construction supervision services);
          •   Scale up to improve and widen a further length (300m) of Vaitele Street
              between Lepea Bridge and Vailoa industrial area; and
          •   West Coast Road drainage works were dropped for uptake by a separate
              project. 11

11   Shortly before the 2012 restructuring, Samoa had been approved a US$25 million Grant by the Pilot



                                                  17
Component C: Sustainable Management Infrastructure, Natural Resources and Risks
(TF US$0.3 million)

36.     Scale up of specialist equipment and follow-up training for MNRE and LTA staff to
consolidate their procedures for implementation of the recently approved Strata Titles Act,
GPS units for data collection and off-site back-ups for the GIS database, enforcement
training of environmental legislation, technical assistance for improved road maintenance
and construction supervision.

Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure (TF
US$0.32 million)

37.    Advisory support for SAA asset management was amended to provide support to
review options for assessing and implementing computerized asset management systems.

Component E: Project Management (TF US$0.22 million)

38.     Ongoing project management and engineering support to the implementing agencies
to implement the ongoing and additional activities through to the extended Project closing
date of June 30, 2013.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

39.     At the time of the first Additional Finance in 2007, the closing date for the original
Credit (38480) was extended by 18 months to June 30, 2010 to match that of the Additional
Finance Credit and Grant (3848-1 and H3110). The original project scope remained the
same except for some procedural changes (e.g., updated procurement Guidelines and
amending the date on which interim financial management reports were to be lodged) and
the scale up of some components (see Section 1.6 above).

40.     On June 30, 2010, following a request from GoS explaining why some activities
had been lagging - in large part due to the devastating impacts of the September 29, 2009
earthquake and tsunami, the Project was extended by a further 18 months to a new closing
date of December 31, 2011. 12 There was also a minor reallocation of funds (SDR380,000
equivalent to seven percent of the Additional Finance), specifically to ensure the successful
completion of the Environmental Risk Reduction and Management component.                The
Unallocated Grant (Category 7) would be utilized under Consultant Services (Category 3B,
Parts C and D) to ensure on-going project support through the extended closing date and to
ensure continuation of the environmental risk reduction and management sub-component.

    Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the global Climate Investment Funds. Amongst other
    activities, the PPCR funds would support works for strengthening the climate resilience of the West Coast
    Road (WCR) and adjacent communities from Apia to the Faleolo Airport. The works would include
    improved drainage that had been designed under SIAM-2 but, once fully designed, were found to be
    beyond the Project funds. PPCR funding would enable all the required drainage works to be completed,
    and also would scale up the SIAM-2 designs to fund more extensive rehabilitation of the road surface and
    improved road safety.
12 IDA Cr 38481 and IDA Gr H3110 only. IDA Cr 38480 had fully disbursed and closed June 30, 2010.




                                                    18
41.     On February 1, 2012, when the Project was restructured for the additional co-
financing Grant (TF10785), the Project closing date (IDA Cr 38481, IDA Gr H3110 and
new TF) was extended to June 30, 2013 in order for the new funding to be fully
implemented. Importantly, the new PRIF-TF Financing Agreement allowed the use of the
Grant funds to finance 100 percent of eligible expenditures, whereas the previous IDA
Credits and Grant had required an effective 38 percent in GoS counterpart funding. The
Government chose to take out (and cancelled) the remaining undisbursed IDA Credit funds
(US$0.83m) with the more concessional Grant funding. The restructuring also unified the
eight disbursement categories into a single category for works, good, non-consulting
services, consulting services, training and incremental operating costs.

42.     On March 6, 2012, the Additional Financing Agreement (IDA CR 38481 and IDA
Gr H3110) was amended to reflect that LTA had taken over the transport licensing and
regulatory functions of the Transport Control Board, as well as the road asset management
functions of the Ministry of Works Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI). The legal
agreement was amended to reflect LTA as the implementing agency responsible for Parts B
and D of the Project, and a separate Project Agreement was entered into between IDA and
the LTA confirming the institutional change.

43.     On November 20, 2013, the project indicators were rationalized through a Level 2
restructuring. The number of PDO indicators was reduced to four (including the revision of
one indicator to be a core sector indicator) and the intermediate results indicators to three
(see Section 1.3 above).

44.    Figure 1 provides an overview of the changes made.

2     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

45.     The Project preparation, design and quality at entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

46.     The Bank’s longstanding engagement in the transport and environmental
management sectors in Samoa coupled with a one-year, recipient executed project
preparation grant (PHRD TF50506) helped ensure that the background and preparation
analyses were thorough and that the Government was well engaged in the preparation
process and design decisions. Analyses included: (i) a strategic study on the transport
sector (policies, pricing, regulation, institutional structures, growth, competitiveness, cost
recovery); (ii) social impacts and scoping of land administration approaches and
preparation of environmental and social safeguards plans; (iii) a review of national risk
management and disaster preparedness; (iv) feasibility studies and EIAs for five roads sub-
projects; and (v) an analysis of road and traffic management in Apia.

47.      Project design drew on the preparatory analyses and relevant lessons learned from
the earlier Transport Sector Review 2000, the preceding SIAM-1 (where the planned
criteria for triggering SIAM-2 were met), and the Bank’s experience in disaster and natural
resource management and ongoing infrastructure projects in Samoa. Among the relevant
lessons learned were the:




                                             20
       •   importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to natural hazard risk
           management, including ex-ante risk resilience strengthening measures and a
           highly participatory planning approach that engages and empowers local
           communities to manage their own level of risk;
       •   inclusion of small grants that provide strong incentives to make communities
           aware of, and willing to implement “soft” protection measures as an alternative
           to more traditional hard structures (that disrupt the natural equilibrium and can
           lead to the loss of beaches), and to undertake voluntary self-enforcement of
           sustainable practices aimed at nurturing recovery of ecosystems which
           otherwise can take many years to recover;
       •   need to carry out on-going and progressive user group evaluations of project
           activities through the project cycle as SIAM-1 monitoring of social issues had
           been weak; and
       •   selection of priority infrastructure assets (roads and bridges) on the basis of
           quantitative and objective selection criteria to support economic growth whilst
           being financially sustainable (capable of a positive economic rate of return).

48.     As a result of the comprehensive preparatory work, the project development
objectives were closely aligned with the Government’s priorities for enabling the private
sector and improving infrastructure as articulated in its Strategy for the Development of
Samoa 2002-2004. This helped to ensure strong and sustained leadership and oversight by
the Ministry of Finance as chair of the Project Steering Committee through the course of
implementation.

49.      The design also was consistent with the Bank’s priorities for poverty reduction
through support for human capital, policies, institutions, and physical infrastructure (Pacific
Regional Strategy 2000) at the time of appraisal and subsequent country assistance
priorities (see Section 3.1). The ongoing Government commitment and the relevance of the
PDOs were among the enabling factors for the Project to successfully access one of the first
IDA additional finances in the Region, and subsequently to be identified as a ‘model”
project for one of the first highly concessional PRIF TF co-financing grant facilities. The
additional finances were used to scale up successful activities and for gap-financing on
initially underestimated road rehabilitation costs.

50.     In spite of the thorough analyses carried out during preparation, the unusually high
EIRR calculated for the proposed road and other infrastructure investments should have
generated some caution. The EIRR at appraisal for widening for Vaitele Street was 31
percent, but was re-calculated as 22 percent in 2007 and finally as 11 percent by the end of
the project (see Annex 3). The high value at design was a consequence of unrealistically
high population growth projections, which in turn exerted pressure for higher than
necessary design standards. It also was a result of unrealistically low initial cost estimates
for works. In part, this was due to limited comparators for project costing during appraisal.
Other reasons (during implementation and not foreseen at appraisal) included international
increases in petroleum-based product prices and competing demands (e.g., the South
Pacific Games) on the small local construction contracting capacity that drove prices
upwards. However, as Vaitele Street works comprised some 23 percent of total project
costs, the too low initial cost estimates coupled with an insufficiently budgeted contingency


                                              21
provision (10 percent), resulted in implementation delays that required extensive redesign
and repackaging of the works. For similar reasons, the planned Fugalei Street works were
finally dropped from the project due to insufficient budget and some of the West Coast
Drainage improvement works had to be deferred for subsequent funding.

51.      An underestimation of important risks may have resulted in implementation delays.
Project preparation did identify land acquisition as a high-risk to implementation. As
predicted, delays in Vaitele Street widening occurred as a result of the largest land
acquisition exercise ever carried out in Samoa and affecting 158 plots. However, the
provisions of the LARAP were followed and the matter of compensation was resolved.

52.     Less well scoped were the potential impacts as a result of natural disasters which
were stated at appraisal as being only “Moderate.” During the ten-year implementation
period, the country was impacted by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2009, one of
the worst tropical cyclones in decades in 2012 (Evan), and powerful cyclones in 2004
(Heta), 2005 (Wilma) and 2006 (Tam). While the Project closing date could be (and was)
extended to accommodate the associated implementation delays, the natural disasters also
resulted in an understandable, but not completely foreseen, siphoning of financial resources
for recovery and reconstruction purposes. This made the achievement of a number of the
original road maintenance targets overly ambitious.

53.     The design of the Project Management component, the institutional arrangements
(limited to only two implementing agencies), and oversight by a well-representative
Steering Committee (including the strategic inclusion of the Public Service Commission)
were based on recent experience with SIAM-1, which provided proven approaches. The
mix of physical investments created opportunities for robust technical designs, quality
supervision and a high standard of operations for staff of implementing agencies and local
consulting firms to “learn-by-doing” on the project activities. The physical investments
were complemented by parallel support for developing policies and legislation based on the
tangible lessons learned. A number of dated covenants were used, for example, to ensure
that the: (i) LTA was established and funded; (ii) SAA maintained and reviewed its
corporate business plan annually; and (iii) environmental impact assessment regulations
were prepared and adopted. While the covenants were based on sound technical studies and
largely served their purpose, in a small number of cases, the Government did not fully
accept their need. For example, as required for the financial viability of the SAA, the
Government closed the domestic Fagali’i Airport by June 2005, but subsequently reopened
it in 2012 due to changed circumstances, and so only partially complied with this legal
requirement.

54.     Given the small size of the country, even taking into account the long-term program
approach that closely matched national needs and priorities and resulted in significant
outputs (see Annex 2), the large number of activities incorporated in the original design
(and then subsequently scaled-up) stretched the capacities of the implementing agencies.
The Government responded positively by funding full-time supplementary engineering
staff and component managers in MWTI, LTA and MNRE. The costs had to be met from
its own resources in addition to the counterpart funding required on other sub-components.
The large project design with multiple components was translated through to an onerous



                                            22
and difficult to implement monitoring framework that finally required a stand-alone
restructuring to rationalize (see Section 2.3).

2.2   Implementation

55.     SIAM-2 was declared effective on June 18, 2004, five months after the signing of
the financing agreement on January 20, 2004. The initial delays to effectiveness were
mainly due to factors that did not reflect shortcomings in lack of Government commitment
or lack of readiness at appraisal. Rather, they were related to the Government undertaking
due diligence in contracting an appropriate caliber of Component Managers in each
implementing agency and establishing a qualified PMU (all drawn from a very small
country), and then setting in place adequate accounting software and training the financial
managers in its use.

56.    Component C: Sustainable Management of Infrastructure, Natural Resources and
Risks and Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure were
implemented smoothly and without major problems. Both components benefitted from
opportunistic additional- and co-financing (2007 and 2012) that, by the end of the Project,
had doubled the originally planned levels of finance and enabled the activities to be
successfully scaled-up.

57.      Component A: Airport Infrastructure had some early momentum, but by the time of
the mid-term review and first additional finance (2007), was clearly showing signs of
diminished engagement by SAA. Component B: Road and Other Infrastructure, which
ultimately accounted for 75 percent of SIAM-2 expenditures, had early momentum and
there was progress on some of the sub-components. However, by 2007 it encountered
implementation difficulties and delays, particularly regarding the Vaitele Street widening,
and improvements that required an extension of the closing date and restructuring on three
occasions (2007, 2012 and 2013) to correct some of these difficulties and address gap-
financing needs.

58.    At project closing on June 30, 2014, all activities were completed.        Annex 2
provides a summary of all project outputs by component.

59.     The factors that contributed to successful implementation or gave rise to problems
during the course of implementation are summarized below by component.

Component A: Airport Infrastructure

60.     As recommended under SIAM-1, the loss-making Fagali’i Airport was closed in
January 2005 and financial targets for operations of Faleolo International Airport were
being met. The planned instrument landing system at Faleolo Airport (fully funded by
GoS) was installed by December 2006. In June 2006, a project supported study was carried
out to assist SAA with the supply and installation of a computer based Airport asset
management system (AMS) and to support the authority to update its corporate plan and
maintain operational safety and monitoring of asset maintenance. A key recommendation
of the study was that SAA should discontinue its use of the Government’s Samoa Asset



                                            23
Management System and install a dedicated SAA AMS (to be known as SACAMS).
However, this was found to be too sophisticated and complex a system for the operations of
SAA and was rejected by the Authority. Additional funding (US$60,000) was provided
under the 2007 Additional Finance for SAA to undertake a new review of available options
for a more appropriate AMS.

61.     SAA did not place much priority on the activity and the continued connection
between the funding available and SIAM-2 reporting requirements was tenuous. SAA
continually failed to meet one of the Project legal covenants, viz. that it submit regular
reports on the status of its corporate business plan and financial performance under the
Project. Finally, in September 2009, nine months after the planned date, a contract was
signed for a review of AMS options and by early 2010, the new preferred AMS software
had been procured and installed and staff trained on its use. As the component was now
fully expended and given SAA’s ongoing reluctance to separately report to the Project, the
Bank project team mooted with the Government that the Project be restructured and SAA
be removed as an implementing agency. However, the Government chose not to have a
formal restructuring for this purpose. With all activities completed, SAA no longer actively
participated in SIAM-2 but was still required to provide regular reports on its operations.
As it did not do so, the implementation performance of the Component, albeit inactive,
remained “Moderately Unsatisfactory” until the end of the Project.

Component B: Roads and Other Infrastructure

62.      As a result of the upstream work undertaken during project preparation and the
contracting of a MWTI Component Manager (Engineer) and PMU Manager (Engineer) for
support, the component made strong early progress.            In the first 24 months after
effectiveness, new two-lane concrete bridges had been built to replace the single lane ford
at Fagali’i and the single lane timber bridge at Falefa, and rehabilitation works along nearly
30 km of the West Coast Road from Faleolo International Airport to Vaitele Street had
been completed. In addition, pedestrian facilities along Lelata Street had been designed
and constructed, detailed feasibility studies on the Apia Road Network Development for the
widening of Vaitele Street, Fugalei Street and selected priority junctions in Apia had been
completed with design and bid documents prepared, design and reseal of 3.93 km of
Fagaloa Bay Road and drainage improvements to a further 4.87 km had been completed,
and protection works for approximately 6,000 meters of coastline at Mulinu’u, Fasito’o-uta
and Manono-uta had been completed.

63.     In the following 12 months (through mid-2007), a fourth bridge was constructed to
replace the old single crossing at Tuanaimato, 11 road junctions and accident black-spots
within Apia town upgraded to improve pedestrian safety, visibility and capacity, and
widening and pavement preservation works had commenced on the Lalovaea, Vaimoso and
Lepea Bridges on Vaitele Street. GoS had fully funded legal and surveying services to
identify all legal land owners that would be affected by the proposed Vaitele Street
widening and had contracted a full-time Administration Officer to record all affected
landowners and to keep minutes of associated meetings.




                                             24
64.      However, from 2007 onwards, implementation challenges led to delays, some of
which were beyond the Government’s control. Most notably was the 8.0 magnitude
earthquake that struck Samoa on September 29, 2009, which was followed by two
tsunamis. The natural disaster resulted in 183 fatalities, displaced some 5,500 people, and
caused estimated damages of $124 million, or around ten percent of GDP. Understandably,
the recovery and subsequent reconstruction efforts had to take priority over SIAM-2
activities, some of which were put on hold. Following a request from GoS on June 24,
2010, SIAM-2’s closing date was extended by 18 months to December 31, 2011 to allow
for the completion of the remaining 14 percent of contracts that were not yet completed,
including the large Vaitele Street works. 13

65.       A second extreme event occurred when Cyclone Evan, a Category 5, struck Samoa
on December 13 and 14, 2012. It was the worst cyclone to affect Samoa since Cyclone Ofa
in 1990 killing five people and temporarily displacing approximately 4,250. The Damage
and Loss Assessment that was carried out immediately after TCE14 estimated the combined
physical damage and economic losses to transport infrastructure, houses, and tourism
facilities at about US$210 million. The total estimated damages and losses were equivalent
to about 30 percent of the total value of goods and services produced in the country in
2011. Once again, SIAM-2 activities were put on hold. On December 19, 2012, the MOF
requested an extension of one year (to June 30, 2014) to allow the full use of the TF Grant
funds (the remaining IDA Credit and Grant funds would be fully disbursed and were not
extended). However, Bank policy states that projects with additional finance must close
within three years of the original project’s closing date. Since SIAM-2 received additional
financing, the Project was required to close by June 30, 2013 and the Project team had to
seek a revised investment policy that would allow for use of the additional finance for more
than three years. The processing of the exceptional extension took six months and as a
result, put the implementing agencies, in particular LTA under considerable pressure, not
knowing if the extension would be approved. LTA then had to scramble to complete what
it had planned would be an 18 months’ work program into the final 12 months.

66.     Further difficulties encountered during implementation were within GoS’s control.
In July 2008, the Government announced its intention to switch the side of the road on
which users travel, which required extensive design modifications in both planned and
already-constructed roads and junctions. The switch went into effect on September 7,
2009.

67.     However, the most obdurate of the challenges faced was the significant under-
estimation at both appraisal and during implementation of the costs of the largest works
contracts, namely the Vaitele Street widening (Central and East) and the West Coast
Drainage works. 15 In part, this was due to limited comparators for project costing during

13This was the second extension to the Project closing date. The first extension had been from December
  2008 to December 2010 associated with the additional finance facility (see Figure 1).
14 Samoa Post-Disaster Needs Assessment Cyclone Evan 2012, Government of Samoa, March 2013.

15   It should be noted that in the case of the WCR drainage works, the Project budget had been based on
     preliminary designs only and once detailed designs were completed, the Government was able, with the
     Bank’s support, to fund the required works under a separate Project with PPCR funding administered by the
     Bank.



                                                      25
appraisal. Other reasons included increased prices in petroleum-based products, competing
demands on the small local construction contracting capacity that drove prices upwards
(e.g., the South Pacific Games construction hosted in Samoa), and the scale and standard of
planned works that had been allowed to “creep” under pressure to do more.

68.     The Project team, in discussion with the Ministry of Finance, agreed that it would
be prudent to reduce the size and technical specifications of the works to be consistent with
the country’s needs and capacity. However, this led to a delay of about 13 months while
contracts were restructured. Following the mid-term review, MWTI undertook the redesign
by reducing the number of bridges, redesigning street lighting, changing the position and
type of drains, reducing preliminary and general schedules in bid documents, and re-
packaging the size of contracts to reduce contractor mobilization costs, all in an effort to
generate greater competition between domestic and regional bidders without compromising
structural integrity. Nonetheless, gap-financing of US$4.38 million above the appraisal
estimate (US$5.27 million, excluding the Vaitele bridges), was still needed. Through the
2007 Additional Financing and counterpart funds from GoS, the shortfall was finally met
and the works completed in September 2010. A further reason behind the delay in
implementation had been that this being one of the early Additional Financing operations in
the region, the transition process still took about six months longer than anticipated to
achieve (e.g., extending contracts for consultants assisting the project unit, adjusting the
accounting system for grants and credits, contracting new works, etc.). With limited funds
and time constraints of the Pacific Games, the Fugalei Street works were finally dropped
from IDA financing and the funds reallocated to Vaitele Street.

69.       The Government also faced difficulties in locating, negotiating and compensating
land and building owners affected by the widening of Vaitele Street West and Central. The
difficulties were compounded by the initial unfamiliarity of the IAs with the Bank’s
operational policies and difficulty in ascertaining ownership and boundaries in an
environment of unsurveyed Customary Land plus some privately-owned plots. After some
initial problems (e.g., determining land value in a country where only four percent of land
is privately owned, ascertaining the legitimate head of household to negotiate on behalf of
groups owning communal land, locating absentee owners, determining boundaries, etc.),
the acquisition and compensation procedures were resolved. Although challenging, the
land acquisition was closely monitored and did not result in undue implementation delays.
The Government established a high-level working group to address land owners at critical
times and fully funded additional legal, surveying and administration services to support
the processes. A factor that also assisted was that both contracts were awarded to a local
company.      It was willing to adjust its work plan on several occasions and without
penalizing LTA, in order to work around individual lands until the acquisition issues were
resolved.

70.     Other positive steps that facilitated implementation were the ongoing training for
local companies by MWTI and LTA, and the packaging of contracts to enable the growth
of a domestic private sector contracting capacity.

71.   SIAM-2 made use of an opportunistic restructuring in February 2012 that provided
an additional amount of US$3.83 million in concessional grant co-financing from the



                                             26
Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF).      US$2.24 million was used to scale-up
(extend) the construction of a further length of Vaitele Street widening works to Vailoa,
which was substantially completed by May 2013.              It also funded the design and
construction of a fifth bridge at Togafuafua, completed in 2014.          The potential for
restructuring was first raised with GoS in mid-2010 and a formal request submitted by the
Ministry of Finance in November 2010. The additional co-financing to scale-up activities
was made available by the Government of Australia in order to assist the small Pacific
Island countries that are highly vulnerable to external economic shocks, and to respond to
the Global Financial Crisis through, among other measures, investments in infrastructure.
SIAM-2’s development objective and implementation progress fit well with the strategic
priorities of the PRIF, through which the funds were channeled. 16

72.      With all activities now complete save for the PRIF-TF funded works, the
component was still not able to regain a satisfactory rating during its last year. As the
request for an exceptional extension of the closing date was not yet assured, it was clear
that the Vaimoso and Togafuafua bridge replacements would not be completed within the
closing date of June 20, 2013. As such, implementation progress was rated as “moderately
unsatisfactory.” Once SIAM-2’s closing date was extended, the remaining activities were
completed. However, the defect liability period on the works extended beyond the Trust
Fund closing date and LTA and PMU did not proactively update and report accurately on
the Project monitoring indicators.

Component C: Sustainable Management of Infrastructure, Natural Resources and
Risks

73.    The component was implemented smoothly and without major problems. Making
use of processes established under SIAM-1, and with strong leadership provided by MNRE
senior staff, Component Manager, and the overall, high quality of consulting services
outputs on most activities, the component was able to complete all planned activities
according to agreed work plans. The project made significant contributions to
environmental, risk resources and emergency management in Samoa.

74.     Within the first three years, all of the original Credit-funded activities had been
completed, including institutionalizing routine data collection processes for environmental
monitoring.    In addition the installation of satellite communications equipment and IT
equipment for the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Planning and Urban
Management Authority (PUMA) was completed.              In 2006/07, the legal drafting and
passage through Parliament of some of the pieces of legislation prepared under SIAM-2 did
take longer than anticipated due to competing demands and the component required careful
monitoring. Assistance was offered to GoS, but was not needed and all legislation was
enacted. None of the laws was on a critical path and caused no delays to the Project.
Thereafter, the component benefitted from opportunistic additional- and co-financing (2007
and 2012) for a continuation and scaling-up of successful activities that, by the end of the
Project, had implemented double the originally planned levels of investment and within
agreed work plans.

16 The Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) is “a multi-donor coordination mechanism which
  supports the delivery of more efficient and sustainable infrastructure”.



                                                   27
75.      A Coastal Infrastructure Management (CIM) strategy was prepared and adopted by
Cabinet as national policy, and CIM Plans were prepared for all 41 Districts (283 villages)
in the country in a highly participatory manner that involved the consultation of some 15
percent of Samoa’s population. This was supported through a small grants sub-component
for 25 communities to implement simple resilience strengthening works and practices.
Further, approved sustainable aggregate sources were identified and publicized as an
alternative to the destructive coastal mining practices, a feasibility study into disaster
insurance was completed, educational leaders thoroughly reviewed measures to reduce the
risk of disasters and incorporated it into the school curricula, and tsunami awareness raising
workshops were held in a number of villages. The component also supported training of
local agencies in enforcing EIA Regulations, natural disaster simulation, and land
management information systems.

76.      All pieces of legislation prepared under SIAM-2 were approved by Parliament and
passed into law, namely the Land Transport Authority Act and Regulations, the Disaster
Management Act, EIA Regulations, Survey Act and Regulations, Valuation Act, Valuation
Standards and Code of Ethics, Spatial Information Agency Act, Land Titles Registration
Act and Regulations, and Unit [Strata] Titles Act. One of the implementation challenges
that did arise was a misunderstanding by the public regarding the intent and reach of the
Land Titles Registration Act, and the introduction of the Torrens system of land
registration. Following Parliamentary debate on the Bill, the system initially was approved
for freehold lands and further preparation of Unit Titles legislation for application to
customary land was implemented.

77.     As a result of the February 2012 restructuring, an additional amount of US$300,000
in a concessional grant from PRIF (see Component B above) was used to: (i) continue
training activities for MNRE staff, including to implement and apply the recently approved
Unit (Strat) Titles Act; (ii) manage and enforce approved EIA Regulations; (iii) use of GPS
equipment; and (iv) use of advanced software applications for electronic map examination.
Except for the map examination software, all activities were completed.

Component D: Institutional Development in Transport and Infrastructure

78.     The component was implemented by MWTI, and subsequently LTA, and did not
encounter problems. The most important of the activities was the preparation and passage
of the Land Transport Authority Act in March 2007. The LTA itself was established July
1, 2008 with an initial start-up budget of WST 1.35 million allocated for FY2009. In terms
of the revenue proposal, it was recommended that a portion of the fuel excise would be
earmarked for LTA maintenance purposes. However, the proposal was not supported by
MoF as it was not consistent with wider economic reforms to the taxation system to reduce
reliance on import duties and excises, and the need for budget flexibility in a period of
fiscal challenges. However, through dialogue by both LTA senior staff and Bank project
team with MoF staff, it was agreed that fees and charges from vehicle and drivers licenses
would be earmarked for LTA. It was further agreed that sufficient additional funds should
be allocated as part of the budget process to cover LTA operations and sustainable
maintenance of the road network.




                                             28
79.      As in the case of Component C, funds from the additional financing in 2007 were
allocated to hire a contracts engineer and assets engineer for MWTI to assist with project
implementation and to facilitate training of staff and contractors. Funds from the February
2012 restructuring (US$320,000) were also used to provide technical assistance to LTA for
improved road maintenance and contracts supervision, purchase specialist equipment
(portable weighbridges and road roughness measuring equipment), vehicles to enable better
monitoring of road conditions and checking of overloaded heavy vehicles, and staff
training. With the exception of the specialist equipment, which is being funded under the
Samoa Enhanced Road Access Project (see Section 2.5), these additional activities were
successfully completed.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization17

80.       M&E Design. M&E design had a number of weaknesses. There was no clear,
targeted set of indicators to adequately track PDO-level outcomes for the overall Program
(both phases). For SIAM-2, some indicators that were described as “outcome indicators”
were closer to measuring outputs and achievements of individual sub-component activities
that quickly became dated. The PAD contained a long-list of 18 indicators against each of
the Project components with little guidance for priorities in their collection.           The
Performance Indicators as set out in the Project Financing Agreement, while more limited
in number, were an eclectic mix of both outcome and output indicators from the PAD.
Finally, one of the lessons learned put forward in Project design was that under SIAM-1,
insufficient attention had been paid to carrying out on-going and progressive user group
evaluations of project activities through the project cycle and that monitoring of social
issues had been weak. To address this, a specific indicator was put forward as “improved
service quality rating by road users and other affected groups.” However, no methodology,
guidance, or budget was provided to carry this out and as a result, the important lesson from
SIAM-1 was overlooked.

81.     M&E Implementation and Utilization. The M&E reporting on the Project was
undertaken by the PMU and by the Component Manager at MWTI/LTA through the
quarterly reporting. Faced with the long and somewhat confusing list of PAD indicators,
the Progress Reports initially replicated the PAD logical framework without attempting to
provide values to the indicators. The Component Manager provided some information of
relevant indicators, but in a different section of the reports. After the first year of
implementation, the Project team agreed with the PMU to use the Performance Indicators in
the Financing Agreement. Here too, different definitions were used at different times (for
example, for “maintenance,” it was not clear what level of maintenance was referred to).
As a result, the reports caveated several of the indicator and over time, it became clear that
the values were not being updated in a verifiable or systematic way.

82.      Consequently, by February 2013, the Bank project team reviewed the indicators,
identified more meaningful ones, and suggested that the project be restructured to revise the
indicators. This last restructuring became effective on November 30, 2013.


17   Please also refer to Annex 11.



                                             29
2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

83.     SIAM-2 triggered the safeguards policies on Environmental Assessment (OP4.01)
and Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30).        Compliance was considered satisfactory
throughout implementation.   An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and a Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) were prepared for the project. There
were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank’s safeguards policies and
procedures.

84.      Environment. The Environment Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.01) was applied
effectively. SIAM-2 was classified as a Category B project requiring partial assessment at
appraisal, and the EMP included environmental screening procedures for all sub-projects.
Those with high enough potential impacts that they would have required a full
Environmental Impact Assessment were not eligible for financing under the project. Sub-
projects determined to require only the less intensive instruments of a site-specific
Environmental Management Plan were considered consistent with the project’s Category B
rating and were therefore eligible for project financing. The majority of the screened sub-
projects fell under the category of “standard operating procedures” (under MNRE’s
Environmental Safeguard Category), whereby it was determined that they would only have
impacts as a result of the construction process, and these were dealt with through the
technical specifications in the works contracts as monitored by the LTA.

85.     A set of operating procedures was agreed for routine smaller works with minimal
environmental impacts, based on a set of Codes of Environmental Practice (COEPs) that
were compulsory on all publicly financed civil works contracts. Larger sub-projects, with
potentially higher environmental impacts and beyond the scope of the COEPs, were subject
to Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) drawn up and approved by the Government’s
Planning and Urban Management Authority. Both the EMPs and Land and Resettlement
Framework (LARF) were adopted and legally binding on the Government as one of the
conditions of project effectiveness. Both Bank and counterpart safeguard experts monitored
and ensured that all Safeguard conditions were being observed. Safeguards assessments
carried out during implementation were Satisfactory.

86.    The EIA compliance target was increased from an end of project target of 80
percent to 100 percent at the time of the 2010 Additional Finance.

87.      A legal covenant of the original project was that by October 31, 2004, the MNRE
had to prepare (and furnish to IDA for review and comment), draft regulations on
environmental impact assessment and environmental management, adopt the regulations by
January 31, 2005, and thereafter retain adequate numbers of relevant staff to implement the
regulations. By June 30, 2005, the Government then had to adopt regulations to enforce the
application of the CIM Plans, which were to be adopted by the Government and
communities in assessing compliance and clearing planning of infrastructure development,
land use and natural resource use in coastal zones. Thereafter, the Government had to
annually monitor natural hazards and changes in baseline conditions and publish the
information at least every three years (not done regularly).




                                            30
88.     Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30). The Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Framework was updated in November 2003. Three sub-projects involved land acquisition
and resettlement.   Only the road widening works along Vaitele Street required a full Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARAP), which was prepared by MWTI and endorsed
by MNREM in November 2003. This was well implemented, and documented in Aide-
Memoires. The LARAP was documented and disclosed on borrower and Bank websites.

89.     In compliance with the IDA-approved LARF, the government, through its Taking of
Lands Act (1964) initiated, on September 1, 2006, a consultative process to acquire the
small parcels of land required for rights-of-way for Vaitele Street widening and a few
intersection works that impacted the boundaries of 158 plots. This was the largest exercise
of its type the country had undertaken and, understandably, it took considerable time to
review and address the issues that arose. The Cabinet approved total compensation of WST
5.57 million was based on land valuations carried out by independent valuation consultants,
which was consistent with the IDA-approved LARF. At the time of the Vaitele Street
contract signing, GoS had documented 93 cases (of the 158) where, for various legal
reasons, payments would take some time to finalize. 18 So as not to delay the works, GoS
placed all compensation funds in an escrow account, created on June 3, 2005 (Special
Purpose “IAMP–2 Land Compensation” Account under the Ministry of Finance), and as
individual cases were reviewed and finalized, payments were made from the dedicated
account. The arrangements were reviewed by the Bank’s Resettlement Specialist and
found to be satisfactory.

90.      For the WCR drainage works, appropriate arrangements were initially made with
land owners, which enabled access to install needed drainage systems along the road and
affected areas to prevent damage to the road and personal property from flooding. To assist
with such arrangements, GoS passed the Public Drains Regulation in 2007. However, the
sub-component was subsequently dropped and is to be included in a separate PPCR-funded
project.

91.     Fiduciary. There were some minor shortcomings in procurement during the last 12
months, but they did not negatively affect project implementation or outcomes. Financial
Management was timely and provided reliable information throughout the life of the
Project. Counterpart funds, which amounted to 38 percent of all contracts, except for TF-
funded contracts in the last two years, was provided in full and in a timely manner.

92.     Procurement. The main procurement challenge under SIAM-2 was the large
number of contract packages, which totaled 104. The large discrepancy between budget
and bid prices received delayed the award of the contract for the Vaitele Street (East and
Central) works, while GoS and PMU worked on a redesign and repackaging of the works


18   These included: (a) Customary Land where ownership was yet to be confirmed by the Land and Titles
     Court (15); (b) Freehold Land that is the subject of deceased estates in the process of being finalized (43);
     (c) owners thought to reside outside of the country (13); (d) lands with mortgage where commercial banks
     have not yet decided if payment is to go to owner or banks (11); (e) an owner challenging compensation in
     court (1); (f) owners negotiating equal exchange of lands (2); and (g) owners still undecided on the form of
     compensation (8).



                                                         31
for subsequent rebidding. Delayed processing of the PRIF TF co-finance caused suspension
of procurement for the planned additional contracts (see Section 2.2).

93.      Bids were announced through local and national newspapers. Contracts for national
road were announced through the MWTI/LTA website, and all ICB contracts were
announced through DG Market and UNDB Online. Minor delays were experienced during
the initial start-up of the project, due to non-availability of critical staff for the Evaluation
Panels. After the project team followed up with the respective CEOs and the Steering
Committee, attendance improved and was no longer a cause for delay.

94.     Financial Management. Financial management under the project was Satisfactory.
The project’s financial management system, including accounting, budgeting, internal
control, funds flow, financial reporting and auditing, was acceptable to the Bank. Financial
Management Reports were submitted on time, and the audits reported no significant
weaknesses in internal controls.

2.5   Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

95.     SIAM-2 made significant contributions and reforms to the land transport sector, and
to how resources for environmental risk and emergency management systems are utilized in
Samoa. Early program (SIAM-1) engagement and strengthening of the air transport sector
were less influenced by SIAM-2 and showed signs of deteriorating, but are once more
receiving Government attention. Post-completion operation of outputs, ongoing
commitment to sustaining most of the reforms, and continued use of procedures set in place
by the project are expected to continue. Indications that this is so are shown, by component,
below.

Component A: Airport Infrastructure

96.      The Credit Agreement for SIAM-1 provided a financial ratio to measure SAA
financial performance as “percent cost recovery for air transport infrastructure.” With only
a limited level of support through the component, the SAA was not compelled to regularly
report on the ratio and it was finally dropped in the 2013 restructuring. Nonetheless, the
mid-term review found that on the basis of available unaudited accounts for SAA, a healthy
85 percent was being achieved (and above the original end of project target of 80 percent),
assuming “costs” as being operating costs, depreciation and interest due. Historically, SAA
has been dependent on GoS loans for all capital investment, which were recently converted
to equity in the Authority. As part of appraisal for a March 2014 Bank approved Samoa
Aviation Infrastructure Project, it was confirmed that SAA’s operating revenues continued
to meet its operating expenses.

97.     The Samoa Aviation Investment Project (SAIP), a Grant of US$25 million, will
invest in key infrastructure at Faleolo International Airport where the SIAM-1 financed
aerodrome upgrades that were completed in 2000 have reached their end of lifecycle. The
project will also upgrade navigation and communications equipment, and provide technical
assistance and develop capacity for regulatory oversight, and operation and management of
Samoa’s airports and regional airports. As recommended under SIAM-1, SAA closed the



                                               32
loss-making Fagali’i Airport in January 2005. Airport operations were taken on by the
state-owned airline Polynesian Airlines to provide short-haul services to American Samoa
and a limited number of domestic flights. Under the changed circumstances of renewed
capital support, SAA is currently in the process of re-acquiring Fagali’i Airport. With co-
financing from the European Investment Bank, the SAIP also will finance the preparation
of a Samoa National Aviation Strategy and Business Plan, and provide training for SAA
staff in the development and use of an integrated management information system.

Component B: Roads and Other Infrastructure and Component D: Institutional Development
in Transport and Infrastructure

98.     Under SIAM-2, there were some notable achievements in the land transport sector,
including the establishment of LTA on 1 July 2008, which separated the operator (LTA)
from policy and regulation (MWTI). The LTA Act (2007) legally mandates the Authority
to (i) “undertake necessary planning, design, supervision, construction and maintenance of
national roads and land transport infrastructure throughout Samoa;” (ii) “undertake
responsibility for road use management in Samoa;” and (iii) “implement the policies of the
Government and the lawful directions of the Minister.” The Act also sets out sources of
revenue for the Authority which includes “levies and fees imposed on road users by the
Authority” and “all money appropriated by Parliament.”

99.    As per the Act, LTA receives all fees form vehicle and drivers’ license, but MoF
has been reluctant to authorize it to automatically receive an annual portion of fuel excise
and excise-equivalent customs duties, as recommended by a Project study. MoF has
accepted the principle that LTA requires an annual budget sufficient to meet its legally
mandated road maintenance and safety responsibilities.        It has chosen to meet the
approximately 30 percent gap between the LTA’s own source revenues (road user levies
and fees) and maintenance funding needs by budget appropriations, as also permitted by the
Act.

100. LTA has confirmed that over the past three years, central transfers have been
sufficient to cover maintenance requirements. 19      However, although the Act envisages
appropriations by Parliament to supplement LTA’s operations, reliance on this source of
revenue does mean that LTA does not have full autonomy in setting its own annual budgets
and its budgets are not entirely predictable from year to year as it may be affected by other
national priorities. As such, long-term planning of the works program can be problematic
and at times may need to be revised. Related to this, under the Samoa Public Bodies
(Performance and Accountability) Act, the Authority is required to pay a seven percent
dividend to the Government on any profits. If LTA does not spend its annual budget in a
given financial year, the savings made are automatically viewed as profit and a dividend
becomes due.         Given the “lumpy” nature of infrastructure programs, this makes it
operationally difficult for the LTA to undertake any works that cannot be completed in a
given financial year and serves to distort incentives to maximizing operating efficiencies by
reducing costs.


19   However, the calculation of the annual maintenance need is based outdated calculations and the figure is
     not adjusted annually and so is declining in real terms.



                                                        33
101. An additional complication is that the gap-financing (and         possibly even the full
annual transfer, i.e., including user charges) is provided to LTA by   MoF as a loan and so
LTA accumulates debt. In time, as has happened with other public       enterprises in Samoa, if
the debt is not regularly serviced, it is converted to Government      equity, a measure that
further undermines LTA’s autonomy.

102. In terms of the Act, following natural disasters (for example the 2009 tsunami and
2012 Cyclone Evan), the LTA has been called upon by the Minister to assist with the
immediate post- recovery efforts of opening roads, rebuilding bridges and removing debris.
The nature and cost of the reconstruction works are clearly beyond typical routine or
periodic maintenance programs. Furthermore, some of the roads are small village access
roads and outside of the prescribed national roads. In these instances, the Authority might
expect, but as yet has not received, to be reimbursed for at least the direct costs incurred.

103. While LTA management is aware of the slow erosion of the Authority’s autonomy
and financial position, the Board, chaired by the CEO of MWTI, is concerned with a further
policy gray area. After some initial challenges in finding and appointing suitably qualified
technical staff, the Authority is now relatively well staffed with a high caliber of technical
professionals (see IRI Indicator 1 in the Data Sheet). As such, staff are proactive in setting
technical standards for works and implementing traffic management strategies with the
objective of meeting road safety requirements. In some instances, staff have been reluctant
to accept censure on the quality of its works by MWTI staff. MWTI is of the view that
some of these areas are beyond the legal mandate of the Authority and are its responsibility
as land transport regulator and policy setter.

104. Since its creation, LTA has operating relatively efficiently (see Data Sheet
indicators) and maintenance needs of the network have been, and are expected to be, met.
Furthermore, two recently approved new projects will continue the capital funding for the
road network and provide on-going support for strengthening the capabilities of LTA. On
December 19, 2012, the Bank approved the Samoa Enhancing the Climate Resilience of the
West Coast Road Project (WCR) in a Grant amount of US$14.8 million with funding
through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. The project is being implemented by the
LTA over a five-year period. On October 17, 2013 the Bank approved the Samoa
Enhanced Road Access Project in Grants amounts of US$25 million. The objective of the
project is to restore key road sector assets damaged by extreme weather events and enhance
the climate resilience of critical roads and bridges in Samoa. Project components will help
to repair roads and bridges damaged by tropical cyclone Evan, and upgrade, rehabilitate
and or reconstruct existing road sector assets to higher standards to strengthen resilience to
climate change and extreme weather events. The second component of technical assistance
directly builds on the foundations created under SIAM-1 and will further embed and
strengthen management of the transport sector.

105. Importantly, the significant funding inflows to the sector will provide on-going
commercial opportunities for the number of private sector operators that have emerged into
and grown in the roads market as a result of SIAM-1 and SIAM-2 contracts.




                                             34
106. However, there continue to be a number of increasingly gray areas regarding the
long-term management and financial autonomy of LTA, which could impact its
sustainability. The lack of a clear separation of roles and responsibilities between LTA and
the MWTI are cause for concern. In an attempt to address the concerns, an LTA-funded
review has been initiated to study and provide recommendations regarding increased
autonomy of the Board and to prepare subsidiary Regulations to enable practical effect of
all provisions of the Act (incl. assignment of user charges and fuel revenues).

Component C: Sustainable Management of Infrastructure, Natural Resources and
Risks

107. In September 2009, Samoa was selected as one of three pilot countries in the Pacific
(and 16 in the world) for participation in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR).
In addition to funding the WCR Project (above) a Grant of US$14.6 million has been
provided through the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) of the Climate Investment Funds (CIF),
administered by the World Bank. The Samoa Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Coastal
Resources and Communities (ECR) Project, approved October 15, 2013 has the
development objective to support coastal resources and communities to become more
resilient to climate variability and change. The project provides continued funding for
similar activities as initiated under SIAM-1 and SIAM-2, and will assist 45,000 Samoans in
coastal communities to adapt to climate change and climate variability, protect coastal
infrastructure, and strengthen climate information services and increase awareness about
climate change impacts. It is anticipated that the designs prepared under SIAM-2 will
support these activities. The project design drew considerably from lessons learned from
development of CIM Plans under SIAM-1 and SIAM-2. The initial CIM Plans concentrated
primarily on coastal hazards of flooding, erosion and landslides, and identified
infrastructure vulnerable to these hazards by the year 2100 and potential solutions to reduce
this vulnerability. The CIM Plans produced under SIAM-2 also incorporated emergency
management and disaster risk reduction.

Component E: Project Management

108. The private sector firm contracted as the Project Management Unit continues to
provide management and fiduciary services to a number of public and private sector
projects in the country. For the first time in several years, a PMU has been formed within
LTA and staffed entirely with LTA staff to manage the two new road sector projects
(ERAP and WCR Project).

3      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

109.     Rating: Satisfactory.

110. SIAM-2’s objectives, design and implementation are consistent with Samoa’s
current development priorities and with the Bank’s current country assistance strategy for
Samoa.



                                             35
111. Relevance of objectives. The development objectives remain highly relevant under
GoS’ recently prepared Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2012-2016, which
articulates ongoing national to a number of relevant strategic areas including:

       •   supporting cost effective infrastructure;
       •   enforcing construction standards for roads and drainage including pedestrian
           safety and climate resilience;
       •   strengthening community engagement in environmental management;
       •   strengthening disaster preparedness and response capacity and implementing
           revised coastal infrastructure management plans; and
       •   mainstreaming climate change and disaster risk management.

112. At the global level, Samoa’s past efforts, including those implemented under SIAM-
2, to enhance the sustainability of assets and managing those assets and natural resources
and responding to disaster risks through an effective partnership with private sector
stakeholders is recognized by it being among only 16 countries worldwide selected to
receive substantial Climate Investment Funds, and so to continue to implement the
activities which are seen as being able to result in transformational change.

113. Project objectives are also consistent with the Bank’s current Country Partnership
Strategy 2012-2016, which calls for “strengthened planning systems and public expenditure
management” as being “critical to ensure efficiencies and maintain service delivery
standards.”   It confirms that “given vulnerabilities, targeted investments to improve
Samoa’s long-term resilience to natural disasters and climate change will be a key focus for
new Bank engagement.”

114. Relevance of design and implementation. Project design and implementation were
relevant to the current country and Bank’s Strategies above. As called for by the current
Strategies, the three main Project components (B, C and D) specifically targeted the
establishment of an efficient, effective and economically self-reliant LTA, able to work in
partnership with an emerging private sector and maintain service delivery standards, and
strengthening community engagement in environmental management to improve Samoa’s
long-term resilience to natural disasters and climate change.

115. The Project restructuring in 2012 introduced co-financing to Component B to scale-
up cost effective infrastructure investments and improve standards for roads and drainage,
supporting the country’s current Strategy. Over the life of SIAM-2, two extreme weather
events (the 2009 tsunami and the 2012 category 5 cyclone) brought a renewed resolve for
improved post-disaster emergency management procedures and pre-disaster resilience
strengthening of community and public assets. Through the 2007 additional finances and
2012 additional co-financing, SIAM-2 continued to provide, and in the end doubled,
additional funding and support for Components C and D. The two components support
ongoing country and Bank priorities of improving Samoa’s long-term resilience to natural
disasters and climate change, and of creating more efficient transport infrastructure
management structures.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

116.        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

117. The final outputs by component of the Project are provided in Annex 2. The
achievement of the Project’s development objectives and associated outcome targets are
described by component below. The analysis makes use of the original logical framework
approach of the PAD (Annex 1), whereby achievement of the individual “component-
output 20 ” must be met in order to cumulatively achieve the PDOs.

Component A: All airport infrastructure assets are performing satisfactorily, under an asset
management system and financially sustainable.

118. There are no end of Project indicators associated with Component A. Prior to the
2013 restructuring, the original key performance indicators (in the DCA) associated with
the component were:

            (i)    Samoa Airport Authority achieves 80 percent cost recovery for air transport
                   infrastructure assets (assumed to exclude capital investment costs). The SAA
                   did not regularly report as required on the indicator. However, the mid-term
                   review assessed that 85 percent cost recovery as being achieved. As part of
                   appraisal for a March 2014 Bank approved Samoa Aviation Infrastructure
                   Project, it was confirmed that SAA’s operating revenues continued to meet its
                   operating expenses.
            (ii)   Asset management system operational for airport infrastructure assets. After
                   some delays, the AMS was installed and staff trained on its use by early 2010.
                   However, due to the lack of reporting by SAA, it is not known if the AMS has
                   been maintained and is still in use.

119. Given that the component was completed four and a half years before Project
closing, and the limited activity prior to that, many of the SAA assets have reached the end
of their life and require replacement. It is unlikely that the Project has been able to
positively impact on the Authority’s financial performance or sustainability.

Component B: The road system has improved capacity, safety and resilience, and
access for remote communities and Apia.

120.        The end of Project PDO-level indicators associated with Component B are:

            (i)    Ninety percent of roads in good and fair condition as a share of total
                   classified roads. Based on visual monitoring by LTA engineers, the target
                   was substantially achieved (84 percent). During the life of the Project, the size
                   of the total classified road network increased from 560 km to 768 km. As a
                   result, the value in 2010 (69 percent) fell to below the baseline (75 percent).
                   However, over the final four years of the Project, the percent of improved
                   roads steadily increased and is likely to be sustained.

20   The PAD sets out component outputs at a level that is akin to outcomes by component.



                                                           37
       (ii)   Ten percent of the national road network receiving periodic maintenance. The
              target was not fully achieved by 2014 (9 percent) although the intermediate
              targets for 2010 and 2011 were met. The indicator then declined to below the
              2012 target before increasing once again in 2013 and 2014. The 2012 decline
              was largely due to the diversion of LTA human and financial resources to
              post-Cyclone Evan recovery works, including on cyclone affected village
              roads over and above the national roads/classified network for which LTA is
              responsible.

121. There were no specific indicators for measuring safety and resilience or for
improved access for remote communities. An original key performance indicator (in the
DCA) was:

       (i)    Service quality ratings of “good” by 80 percent of road user groups and
              affected groups. No mechanism was established under the Project to carry out
              user group surveys (see Section 2.3). However, nine bridges and their
              approaches were replaced or improved, 32 km of coastal road through peri-
              urban settlement received spot maintenance, and eleven road junctions,
              including black-spot intersections, were upgraded for improved visibility and
              pedestrian safety. In addition, footpaths were constructed along a busy arterial
              leading past the central Apia Park and stadium, and the road and pass through
              Lemafa and on to the remote communities of Taelefaga and Samamea were
              sealed or received drainage works. All works were well designed and to a
              high standard of finish, and all in compliance with EIA provisions (IRI
              Indicator 3), as verified by Bank missions.

122. Overall, the component contributions to achieving the development objectives are
rated as having been substantially achieved and all directly attributable to the Project.

Component C: Infrastructure assets, natural resources, land and national emergency systems
are under environmentally and socially sustainable management.

123.   The end of Project PDO-level indicator associated with Component C is:

       (i)    100 percent of coastal communities covered by CIM Plans. By June 2008, a
              national-level Coastal Infrastructure Management (CIM) Strategy had been
              developed and CIM Plans prepared with, and adopted by, all 41 districts (283
              villages) across the country.         The plans have the potential to be
              transformational in that they assess, for the first time, the resilience of coastal
              infrastructure to flooding, coastal erosion and landslides. They also identify
              potential solutions and assign responsibility for implementation.              The
              participatory planning methodology expanded consultations from the original
              village/family elders (matai), to also specifically include women and untitled
              youth. The process encompassed over 190 village and district meetings and
              workshops and the direct involvement in preparing plans by over 5,000 people
              (2,100 matai, 1,200 women and 1,500 untitled youth). Under the intentionally
              linked, risk adaptation small grants sub-component, 25 community



                                               38
             implemented projects (identified as priorities off the respective CIM Plans)
             were funded with 22 completed. Under the scheme, grants to local community
             group-initiated requests, were selected and implemented according to
             procedures outlined in a Grants Operational Manual. Typically the grants
             funded protected spring water supplies, coastal mangrove planting, coral
             gardening, and protection of no-fish zones (see Annex 11). On-going
             maintenance was assured through the self-managed procedures of the
             women’s groups and others. The award for excellence in planning practice
             from the New Zealand Planning Institute of this broad-based community
             approach to land-use planning and development in Samoa confirms the
             significance of the component achievement.

124. There were no specific indicators for measuring the sustainable management of land
and national emergency systems. Original key performance indicators (in the DCA) were:

       (i)   Staffing and effective functional capacity of MNRE – the target of 90 percent
             of technical and management positions being filled was not fully achieved but
             staffing of key positions were typically 80-85 percent through most of the
             Project.
       (ii) 100 percent compliance with EIA provisions was achieved by mid-2008 and
             Project support for monitoring equipment and staff training has assisted to
             ensure that the provisions continue to be enforced. All public works complied
             with the Codes of Environmental Practice, which guided construction
             activities since they were formally adopted in 2002 (under SIAM-1).
       (iii) 30 percent of titles on available cadastral land plans are digitized and
             validated was achieved by mid-2008.

125. The Project directly assisted MNRE to institutionalize routine data collection
processes for environmental monitoring; equip and ongoing training for staff of the
National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Planning and Urban Management
Authority (PUMA) and land administration and survey services.          It also funded the
preparation of key pieces of legislation to underwrite reforms in the land registration and
administration systems and empower the responsible authorities for environmental
management and disaster recovery efforts (see Section 2.2).

126. Overall, the component’s contribution to achieving the development objectives is
rated as having been substantially achieved and largely attributable to the Project.

Component D: Institutional reforms are completed, operational and sustainable for effective
policy, oversight and asset management for the infrastructure sector.

127.   The end of Project PDO-level indicator associated with Component D is:

       (i)   Reformed management structures in place for Land Transport . A Land
             Transport Authority Act was prepared under the Project and approved by an
             Act of Parliament in March 2007, and the Authority established July 1, 2008
             with responsibility for road asset management and road use management. In
             keeping with Project-funded advisory support, the LTA has been adequately


                                            39
              staffed (see IR Indicator 1) and receives an annual budget from Treasury
              sufficient to cover routine and periodic maintenance needs. The separation of
              operations from policy and regulator activities remains in place and is a sound
              model. However, the autonomy of LTA’s Board is equivocal, leaving it open
              to, on the one hand, ad hoc requests to meet unfunded mandates (community
              service obligations) and, on the other to press the boundaries of its authority
              for setting policy and standards which, according to the Act, is the
              responsibility of MWTI. Its multi-year revenue position, dependent in part on
              annual Parliamentary budget appropriations, is unpredictable which impacts
              on its ability to undertake forward planning with certainty. LTA has initiated a
              detailed review of the issues but the outcome, including commitment by the
              Government to its recommendations, is not yet known. While the institutional
              reforms are currently operating well, they are still a work in progress.

128. Intermediate results indicators for the component also provide insights into the final
achievement of the PDO:

       (i)    Competitive price savings of 20 percent on 2003 prices for maintenance
              work s. The indicator serves to inform whether further reforms, regarding
              stronger partnerships with private sector, were forged. The underlying
              assumption was that with the entry of private sector involvement in
              maintenance as promoted and enabled by the Project, prices would decrease.
              The end of Project prices were seven percent lower than 2003 and so well
              below the target.
       (ii)   However, in a small overall market, there have been highly variable savings
              each year. By 2007, the average savings were 25 percent of 2003 average
              prices but increased by more than 40 percent from 2009 through 2012 after the
              2009 tsunami and road switch. Prices settled back lower once again in 2013 to
              7 percent lower than the 2003 baseline on all maintenance. On reconstruction
              only, contracted out prices fell sharply from WST 270,000/km in 2003 to
              WST 110,000/km by the end of the Project. Furthermore, national competitive
              bids for routine maintenance works enabled the start-up of new companies,
              which increased from four at the start of the Project to up to 17 companies by
              the end of the Project. General growth of the Samoan economy over the same
              time would have also contributed to new business start-ups. However, road
              maintenance contracts (periodic and reconstruction) call for specialized skills
              and equipment over and above what is typically found in building construction
              firms and would have been the direct result of Project funded works contracts
              (both construction and design and supervision) and contractor training. The
              reform bodes well for a sustainable future.

129. There is no direct indicator to assess whether effective asset management for the
infrastructure sector was achieved. To assess the management and condition of the coastal
protection infrastructure, a legal covenant of the Project obligated MNRE to monitor
natural hazard zones and changes in baseline conditions and publish the results every three
years. After meeting the condition early on in implementation, MNRE did not have the
staff available to routinely assess the infrastructure on either the main or the smaller islands


                                              40
and public reporting ended. Over and above the coastal protection measures (Component
B), there were parts of the coastline protected by village and private household constructed
seawalls, which did not always meet the project improved designs and quality of
construction. However, LTA did monitor the condition of coastal roads and adjacent
seawalls (but not the condition of other seawalls) and continue to do so.

130. Regarding the condition of road infrastructure, SIAM-2 funded specialists to
support the existing Samoa Asset Management System (SAMS), recover old information
and represent the system in GIS format, but LTA regarded the system as overly complex
and costly to maintain. It maintains its road data and traffic information on a spreadsheet
based system. The condition assessments and consequent asset management plan and
annual work programs are largely based on visual monitoring by its engineers.

131. Overall, while the component contributions to achieving the development objectives
have been strong in some key areas and largely attributable to the Project, there are some
areas that remain a work in progress and at possible risk of not being sustained in the long
term, such as LTA’s financial autonomy and the systems in place to assess the condition of
road and coastal infrastructure.

Component E: The Project achieves the development objectives and targets, within budget, on
time and in compliance with safeguard and legal provisions.

132.   There are no end of Project indicators associated with Component E.

133. The Bank’s internal reporting system (ISRs) rated Project Management (and
similarly on time-implementation progress) as satisfactory through the life of the Project,
but Moderately Satisfactory in the last year when it was noted that the PMU could have
been more proactive and provided better technical guidance and procurement assistance to
LTA, which was struggling to complete the two TF-funded works contracts. Procurement
of the contracts had been put on hold earlier while awaiting the protracted processing and
approval of the additional co-financing and subsequently a 12 month requested extension to
the TF closing date (see Section 2.2). No significant cost overruns were experienced during
the course of the contracts. However, there was a significant discrepancy between the
amount budgeted for the Vaitele Street widening and West Coast Road drainage. These
were not attributed to poor project management, but to limited comparators during
appraisal and external factors during implementation (see Section 2.2). Counterpart funds
amounted to 38 percent of all contracts, except the TF-funded contracts in the last two
years. Funds were provided in full and in a timely manner.

134. Project Management fell short in monitoring SIAM-2. In part, this was due to poor
initial design (see Section 2.3). However, the implementing agencies and PMU responsible
for collecting the indicator values made use of varying and, at times, inaccurate indicator
definitions. Over time, it became clear that the values were not being updated in a
verifiable or systematic way.

135.      Overall, the component’s contributions to achieving the development objectives
have been strong, but objective monitoring against quantifiable indicators was not given
sufficient attention.

3.3     Efficiency

Economic Rate of Return and Cost Effectiveness
136. At project close, all planned investments had been completed. The financing gaps
for the works associated with Vaitele Street and WCR and agreed increases in scope of
works were financed through the two additional financing facilities to ensure that key
infrastructure improvements and associated policy and legislative reforms would be
completed.

137. End of project economic internal rates of return (EIRR) and overall net present
values (NPV) for three representative roads were calculated using the actual average costs
of each road work type. The roads selected were: (i) the West Coast Road, a rural, main
highway; (ii) Vaitele Street, an urban transport corridor vital for economic growth; and (iii)
Fagaloa Bay Road, a rural road. All three road sections were sealed. The following table
presents the results of the ex-post economic evaluation of the three road sections. A
calculation is also made for all major works investments made under the project.

138. A significant reduction in the EIRR and NPV for each individual investment as
compared to the ratios at appraisal, is noteworthy. This is likely due to the significant
increase in the cost of the investments (see Section 2.3, Component B). Also, the scope of
works included in the originally planned investment was considerably less than what was
finally achieved. Actual EIRRs for both higher volume, urban/peri-urban roads (West
Coast Road and Vaitele Street), while lower than calculated at appraisal, are still an
acceptable 14 percent and 11 percent respectively. The NPV is negative for Vaitele Street
Widening and Fagaloa Bay Road works. However, the economic calculations have not
attempted to take into account the social benefits that resulted, such as improved road user
and pedestrian safety or improved access to markets and health and education facilities.
The positive impact that road improvements have on rural poverty and sustaining socio-
economic growth is well documented internationally.         As such, the program remains
economically justified considering the actual road works costs.

139. Although the EIRRs and NPVs of the investments are less than the ratios calculated
at appraisal, the final unit costs for the civil works under the Project appear reasonable. A
report prepared by the Bank listed the mean cost per kilometer for rehabilitation and
reconstruction of inter-urban roads as US$446,750 per km and of secondary roads as



                                                    42
US$172,712 per km. The data was sourced from World Bank projects in Europe and
Central Asia. 21 However, when compared to the recent unit rates for rehabilitation works
in other Pacific countries, the unit cost for the West Coast Road and Fagaloa Bay Road
investments are comparable. For example, from a recent project in Papua New Guinea, the
unit cost for road resurfacing and rehabilitation was US$577,000 per km, 22 while in
Kiribati, the unit cost for road rehabilitations in 2013 were found to be US$816,000 per
km. 23 It should be noted that comparison of costs provides only limited insight into road
prices per km, as challenges, including the availability of materials, security concerns, and
logistical issues, are not uniform across countries.

140. An anomaly in the analysis is the widening of Vaitele Street. The design of the
works kept increasing to accommodate expected increases in traffic volumes passing
through a built-up area and the road’s importance as a link between the main port, industrial
area and international airport. This section of road was widened from three lanes to four,
pedestrian footpaths were installed on both sides of the road, and a large amount of land
was acquired, all of which was costly. The mean cost of the construction of a new 2-lane, 7
meter wide equivalent road was found to be US$1.48 million. 24 Although the unit cost for
Vaitele Street is in excess of this, the additional costs associated with the civil works of
widening and installing pedestrian access along with the required land acquisition and the
less competitive market in Samoa, it is not surprising that this unit rate would be higher.

Financial Rate of Return

141. Air transport subsector. At the time of project appraisal, SAA’s operating loss was
about WST 1.2 million annually, but declining gradually and expected to decrease further
as tariff increases were implemented. A contributing factor to the losses was the debt
servicing cost of the SIAM-1 credit, which was on-lent to SAA by MoF.

142. The Legal Agreement between GoS and SAA required that each year of SIAM-2,
SAA was to review its financial performance, operations and infrastructure rationalization,
including minor airports, and would submit a report on its performance to the Bank for
review and comment. As SAA was largely self-sufficient in financing its investment needs,
SIAM-2 funding to SAA was reduced to a single consultants services contract (A6.01) to
assess the most appropriate AMS and equipment for SAA, and to procure appropriate
software. By the time of the mid-term review (November 2007), SAA had ceased carrying
out or submitting quarterly or annual analyses to the PMU. Even audited accounts became
difficult to obtain from SAA due to a long-standing land transfer valuation issue with GoS.

143. Therefore, it was not possible to accurately update the appraisal information
regarding the financial performance of SAA. On the basis of available data, SAA’s

                                                  43
operating revenues have been sufficient to cover its operating expenses. However, between
2009 through 2011, SAA received loan finance from MoF of approximately US$1.48
million per year to cover expenditures on plant and equipment operations and capital
replacement costs.

144. The original Credit Agreement contained only one financial ratio on which to report
on SAA, namely “percent cost recovery for air transport infrastructure assets.” Neither the
PAD, nor the Credit Agreement defined how the ratio was to be calculated. Assuming a
definition of “total revenue/(operating costs + depreciation + interest),” SAA was achieving
85 percent cost recovery, above the end of project target of 80 percent by 2006/2007 (on
the basis of unaudited financial statements).

145. However, profits and losses were less positive, indicating that while revenues may
be close to operating costs, it had insufficient revenues to build adequate reserves for new
investments, and on-going financial support from GoS is likely to be required. In 2012,
MoF converted all outstanding loans to SAA into Government equity in the Authority,
totaling an amount of WST 31 million, or about US$13.9 million.

146. Land transport sub-sector. At the time of appraisal, the level of GoS expenditure on
roads was WST 15.0 million per year, compared with a long-term average annual need of
WST 25.1 million (or WST 34.1 million if a real 5 percent return on equity is included).
There was no explicit road user charge for recovery of road costs, but revenues from roads
included WST 4.5 million from fixed charges (vehicle registration and drivers’ licensing),
and WST 17.0 million from fuel excise taxes.          Revenues adequately covered road
maintenance expenditures, plus an additional WST 1.5 million returned to general
revenues.

147. In 2014, LTA’s road maintenance expenditure is WST 20.0 million per year, of
which WST 14.0 million is raised from the fuel levy. The shortfall/subsidy of WST 6.0
million per year is provided as an equity payment by the Government. In terms of the
Public Finance Act, LTA is required to pay the Government 7 percent per year interest on
all equity contributions.  However, whereas LTA accounts the equity (and associate
required interest payment) as being the shortfall of WST 6.0 million, MoF accounts the
equity as being the full WST 20.0 million per year, giving rise to an alarmingly high
cumulative level of debt.

148. A further factor undermining LTA’s financial performance is a number of unfunded
mandates that it is required to attend to, such as responding to carry out rapid road
clearance and opening works during extreme climatic events. The costs of meeting these
and similar community service obligations have not been met with additional funding from
MoF. As such, sustainable self-financing of LTA’s operations is uncertain.

3.3    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

149.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.




                                            44
150. SIAM-2s objectives, design and implementation remain relevant to Samoa’s current
development priorities. Through both the 2007 additional finance and 2012 additional co-
finance, the Project doubled the funding provided to support those components that directly
spoke to the ongoing country and Bank priorities of improving Samoa’s long-term
resilience to natural disasters and climate change and of creating more efficient transport
infrastructure management structures. The Project 2012 co-financing also scaled-up cost
effective infrastructure investments and improved standards for roads and drainage.

151. It is unlikely that SIAM-2 has been able to positively impact SAA’s financial
performance or sustainability. However, there is evidence that SIAM-2 enhanced the
economic, environmental and social sustainability of transport infrastructure assets and the
management of those assets through an effective partnership with private sector consulting
and contracting engineering companies. It has also substantially and directly achieved
reforms in the land transport sector. However, there are some areas that remain at possible
risk of not being sustained, in particular the long-term financial autonomy of LTA and the
systems in place for monitoring the condition of road and coastal infrastructure and
objectively setting maintenance needs. SIAM-2 substantially and directly contributed to
enhancing the environmental and social sustainability of coastal infrastructure assets and
the management of those assets and natural resources and response to national emergencies,
through an effective partnership with private sector including civil society stakeholders.

152. Overall, SIAM-2 achieved the major physical investments in roads at acceptable
economic rates of return, although the final actual economic justification is not as high as
anticipated at appraisal and cannot be demonstrated on the rural road works (Fagaloa Bay
Road). Final unit costs for civil works appear rather high, but still reasonable compared to
similar works elsewhere in the Pacific although there are limited comparators available.
Delays in achieving the development objectives were experienced due to higher than
budgeted bid prices for the major Vaitele Street widening and subsequently, due to slow
processing of the co-finance for additional activities that disrupted the works program in
the final two years of implementation.      Notwithstanding these limitations, overall, the
component contributions and overall project management for achieving the development
objectives have been strong, but objective monitoring against quantifiable indicators was
not given sufficient attention.

3.4   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

153. The project contributed to alleviating poverty in Samoa in several ways. Firstly,
road access by rural and peri-urban communities in vulnerable coastal areas was
strengthened through improved access to markets and social facilities. Secondly, the design
solutions introduced in the preparation of the CIM Plans, as well as the eligible activities
for funding by the small resilience grants, both supported improvements to the natural
environment and in particular to fish and crab breeding areas, an important part of rural
communities’ food intake. Similarly, community-enforced “no catch” areas in offshore fish
breeding areas have contributed to improvements in fish stock levels. Anecdotal interviews
with family heads in some of the affected areas confirmed these findings. Thirdly, the


                                            45
packaging of the roads and bridges improvements contracts for national procurement was
designed to stimulate the domestic contracting industry and increase local employment
opportunities. The number of person days/months of work created was not tracked, nor any
efforts made to gather this or other data (e.g. beneficiaries of small grants) disaggregated by
gender. However, as all works contracts under the Project were competitively awarded to
domestic contractors, the multiplier effects on the economy would have been positive.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

154. Although not designed as a post-disaster recovery or reconstruction project, during
the course of implementation, two major natural disasters occurred. The LTA, recognized
for its efficient procedures was brought in to the recovery efforts by the Government. It
was quickly able to contract and mobilize a number of local companies, sufficiently skilled
and equipped, to implement the recovery efforts of clearing debris and reopening damaged
roads and bridges.

4      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
155.     Rating: Substantial.

156. There are three changes that may occur in the operating environment that would be
detrimental to the Project’s development outcome.

157. Natural hazard risk. The probability is almost certain, and the consequences would
be major to catastrophic.

158.    If unmitigated, natural hazard risk could result in significant risk to SIAM-2’s
development outcome. However, several follow-on projects have been approved that will
continue natural risk reduction measures (see Section 2.5).

         •   ERAP will upgrade, rehabilitate and or reconstruct existing road sector assets to
             higher standards to strengthen resilience, and revise standards for maintaining
             and constructing roads and bridges to be more climate resilient.
         •   Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Coastal Resources and Communities
             Project will provide training to targeted Districts to update and implement their
             CIM Plans and provide community grants for village-level projects that target
             coastal resilience.
         •   WCR will improve conditions to 26 km of WCR pavement passing through
             peri-urban settlements, and prepare a vulnerability assessment of the Samoa
             road network.
         •   The Aviation Investment Project will invest in key infrastructure improvements
             at Faleolo International Airport.

159. Political risk. The risk that further financial autonomy for LTA is not approved and
that the current annual appropriations by Parliament to LTA’s maintenance budget are not
pegged to inflation or are reduced for other priorities. The probability is possible and the
consequences moderate.



                                              46
160. If unmitigated, political risk would result in Moderate risk to the Project’s
development outcome. Given the high visibility and public regard for the improved roads
and bridges on Upolu, the risk is possible to unlikely. LTA has proactively initiated an
independent review of its operations and recommendations are likely to point to the need
for strengthening of its financial autonomy and reducing the burden on the central budget.
However, the risk remains possible that although a dramatic reduction in LTA’s budget
would not occur, further necessary commitments are not made and that its financial position
continually erodes over time.

161. Private sector. The negative impact by a reduction in demand for road maintenance
services. The probability is possible, and the consequences would be major.

162.    As in political risk, there is a possibility of a reduction in demand due to an eroding
annual LTA budget. Given that there is only one large client in the road maintenance
sector (LTA), and that a large number of companies have emerged or grown rapidly as a
result of the commercial opportunities offered under SIAM-2, the consequences for a
number of the companies and the people they employ would be considered major.
However, as a large number of recently approved and effective projects will provide work
for the private sector consultants and contractors for at least the next five years, the risk is
not immediate.

5      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

163.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

164. The strategic relevance of SIAM-2 is well demonstrated by the fact that the PDOs
and main components at the time of appraisal remain relevant to Samoa’s development
priorities. The rationale for on-going Bank involvement in the second phase of the APL
was consistent with the then and current Bank country assistance strategies (see Section
3.1). By facilitating GoS’s access to a PHRD Project preparation grant (TF50506), a
number of robust technical, environmental and social impact studies and safeguards plans
were undertaken and all with strong engagement by the Government agencies in the
preparation process and design decisions. As a result of these analyses and the lessons
learned from SIAM-1, the assessment of risks was largely accurate and their occurrence
during the life of SIAM-2 was not unexpected. The implementing agencies were prepared
in advance for risk as it arose, with the Project support needed and procedures to be
followed set out in advance (for example, the acquisition of lands for the Vaitele Street
widening works).

165. The project design of four components (plus a Project Management component)
and, prior to any scaling up, the need to procure and manage 60 contracts was large for a
small country. However, this was the second phase of the program, and implementation
arrangements were relatively simple (only two implementing agencies and a high-level



                                              47
Steering Committee) and unchanged from SIAM-1. Most of the sub-components to be
implemented were the core business of the IAs.

166. However, despite the rigorous preparations, the initial economic evaluations
(EIRRs) were unrealistically high. This report assess the main urban road packages as
having been economically justified, but the cost estimates and budget provisions for Vaitele
Street, Fugalei Street and West Coast Road drainage works, as was the total Project
contingency provision (of 10 percent), were too low. These three contracts assessed and a
poorly designed M&E framework (see Section 2.3) would raise substantial challenges
throughout implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

167.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

168. The Bank provided strong support in the initial years of implementation, including
holding a launch workshop so that roles and responsibilities were understood and making a
presentation to the Cabinet to garner a high level understanding of, and support for, the
Project.    Preparation and clearance of non-standard bidding documents (templates for
Consultants services ToRs, NCB docs for goods and works) was done by May 2004,
shortly before SIAM-2 became effective. A balanced emphasis was placed by the Bank
team on the different components, and within the first three months, procurement was well
underway for the environment, risk and resource management and land administration sub-
components, and design and construction of Lelata Street improvements.

169. The large discrepancy between the appraisal estimates/available budget and revised
cost estimates/bid prices for the Vaitele Street and Fugalei Street works became apparent
by late-2005.       The project team’s technical experts interacted with MWTI and its
consultants to adjust the scope of works and to repackage the contracts in an effort to
reduce costs to match available funding levels. When it became clear that the budget was
insufficient for the needed works, an additional finance facility was processed. This was
used not only for gap-financing of the works (Fugalei Street finally was dropped from the
Project), but also was an opportunity to increase SIAM-2’s development impact by scaling-
up support for a number of other activities (see Section 1.6). However, because this was
one of the early additional financing operations in the region, processing the funding took
about six months longer than anticipated. The Bank could have been stronger in its
dialogue with GoS at this point to cancel the largely inactive Component A (Airports).

170. A further opportunity for greater development impact was presented by the
availability of concessional grant finance from the Government of Australia in the wake of
the global financial crisis. The potential for restructuring was first mooted with GoS in
mid-2010 and formally requested in November 2010. However, it took 15 months to
process the additional co-financing funds, in part due to the setting up of the new Trust
Fund arrangements. This resulted in a delay to the works program as GoS did not want to
assume the risk of awarding new contracts. Once the funding was approved, IA staff were
under considerable pressure to condense the planned three- year work program for the co-
financing into 18 months before SIAM-2’s closing date. Recognizing this, and at the



                                            48
request of GoS, the project team then worked hard to process an exception to the Bank’s
policy regarding limitations on additional finance closing date extensions. SIAM-2 was
finally extended by a further 12 months and all the TF-funded new activities were able to
be completed within this time.        The Bank could have used the restructuring as an
opportunity also to revise the M&E results framework. The framework was finally revised
by a subsequent restructuring, but too late to monitor any but a remaining few TF co-
financed activities other than retrospectively.

171. In other respects, supervision was satisfactory. From 2005 onwards, the Task Team
Leader was based in the region and was able to provide more continuous support to the
client through regular supervision missions and audio meetings. Fiduciary and safeguards
aspects of the Project were routinely monitored and reported on. As land acquisition posed
a high risk to SIAM-2 activities, the project team took proactive steps to mitigate the risk.
In the first few months of implementation, a rural road triggered customary land ownership
issues. GoS was alerted to the need to prepare a LARAP and was provided close guidance
in doing so. Similarly, detailed implementation planning of the land acquisition for the
Vaitele Street works were identified as being on the critical path. The project team
proactively engaged with all agencies to agree on the basis for determining and agreeing on
fair market values for compensation, and the detailed steps to be followed for the
transactions were compliant with Bank policy. Finally, through the long standing and
collegial working relations between the Bank project team and the IAs, both MNRE and
LTA have demonstrated an ability to continue, maintain and enforce the various activities
and business procedures commenced under SIAM-2. With the recent preparation and
approval of four related Bank projects over the past two years (see Section 2.5), funding has
been assured for them to do so.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

172.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

173. In spite of the shortcomings in estimates of constructions costs for the major works
packages, the M&E framework, and the processing times for restructurings, the PDO was
achieved and overall Outcome rating for the Project is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

174.    Rating: Satisfactory.

175. The initial delays in effectiveness were due mainly to factors that did not reflect a
lack of GoS commitment or readiness at appraisal. Rather, they were related to GoS
undertaking due diligence in contracting an appropriate caliber of Component Managers in
each implementing agency and establishing a qualified PMU. GoS actively participated in
preparation and the subsequent restructurings, in particular providing clear written guidance
as to its priorities, justifications and proposed timelines for implementing activities and
coordinating overall work program with other demands, particularly the South Pacific


                                             49
Games. The Project Steering Committee was well represented by senior staff able to take
necessary decisions and regularly met, although meetings waned towards the end of the
Project. Project Steering Committee members understood their roles to provide high level
oversight and coordination of SIAM-2 and did not overly manage the IA activities, as long
as they remained within budget, on time and true to the development objectives.

176. The nine pieces of legislation prepared under SIAM-2 were reviewed and debated in
readings of Parliament before being passed. When some proposals met with public
concerns (for example, the scope of the amended land registration legislation), the Minister
and senior staff on the Project Steering Committee held public meetings to hear and address
the public’s concerns. When lands were acquired to widen Vaitele Street, GoS did not rely
on its compulsory land acquisition powers, but chose to engage all landholders using
traditional structures that, although time consuming, did not overly delay implementation
and ensured a successful outcome.

177. When the country was heavily impacted by the two natural disasters in 2009 and
2012, GoS was obliged to divert staff and efforts away from SIAM-2 activities for recovery
efforts. However, it recognized the delays caused and on both occasions, sought well
justified and timely extensions to the Project (June 30, 2010 post-tsunami and on June 2013
Cyclone Evan) to accommodate the disruptions to SIAM-2’s work program. GoS met its
counterpart funding requirements in full and in a timely way, but at times took a long time
to act on applications prepared by the PMU to replenish the designated account. This made
tracking of expenditures slightly more complex, but did not impede implementation.

178. The Government’s decision to change the road user side required the redesign and
retrofitting of some junctions. The decision was taken in the national interest and did not
require an especial extension to the closing date. The decision to maintain Component A
(Airports) in the Project without ensuring that SAA was meeting its reporting obligations
meant that two legal covenants were only partially complied with and the PMU had to
make extra efforts for SAA to procure the AMS activity and to provide audited financial
accounts. This reflects on SIAM-2 overall. However, the Component comprised only 0.1
percent of the Project (US$62,000 out of the total project cost of US$41.2 million) and on
balance issues were minor.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

179.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

180. MNRE was engaged in original project preparation studies and design and
subsequently in providing the rationale for additional finance to scale-up activities. It
showed vision and leadership in identifying and being able to implement far reaching and
at times sensitive land administration reforms, as well as environmental protection and
disaster management approaches and procedures. The CIM Plans are recognized in the
Pacific as a “flagship” approach to inclusive and participatory planning for building risk
resilience at the community level where “resilience” requires individuals and communities
to be empowered to assume responsibility for managing their own layer of risk. The CIM
Plans were not finally tied to statutory procedures as originally intended. The Ministry



                                            50
chose rather, to facilitate public ceremonies between communities and the Minister to sign
joint undertakings adopting and implementing (and where needed self-enforcing) the
Plans, an approach that appears to be well suited to the norms of the country. The
Component Manager was diligent in monitoring the use of the small grants,
communicating with communities and providing timely reports.

181. In the early years, Ministry staff was not always available when needed to evaluate
procurement documents, but following approaches by the PMU and Bank team,
subsequently assumed their responsibilities.       After initially meeting a Project legal
covenant requiring the Ministry to assess the management and condition of the coastal
protection infrastructure and publish the results, MNRE did not have the staff available to
routinely assess the infrastructure on both the main or smaller islands, and public reporting
came to an end. This reflected negatively on performance and it would have been
preferable to have dealt more proactively with the requirement.

182. MWTI was involved in project preparation technical studies and assisted project
design with the selection and justification of physical investments. The Ministry oversaw,
in a professional way, the technical studies leading to it divesting itself of its
responsibilities for road asset management and road use management and for letting and
managing the early road and bridge improvements contracts that were in the main
completed on time and within budget. Subsequently, LTA took over responsibility for the
remaining physical works, including the challenging Vaitele Street widening. The issues
regarding Vaitele Street were largely as a result of an underestimation of budget compared
to bid prices received (even when repackaged and rebid) and not cost overrun. LTA
procured and managed the larger contracts competently and mainly within the contract
provisional sums, ensured that all works were carried out in accordance with the Codes of
Environmental Practice and, with assistance from the MNRE, Attorney General’s Office
and PMU, attended to land matters in accordance with approved LARAPs. However, the
time waiting for the TF to be processed caused delays in its work programs and staff
attention turned to other projects, and in SIAM-2’s final 18 months, found it difficult to
regain past momentum. As in the case of SAA and MNRE, LTA did not proactively
update and report accurately on the Project monitoring indicators.

183. The PMU provided strong support to the Project Steering Committee to ensure
SIAM-2 activities were coordinated and assisted the IAs with communications and
consultations with stakeholders. Its financial management of SIAM-2 was without notable
issue. The PMU could have been more proactive and provided better technical guidance
and procurement assistance to LTA, which struggled to complete the final works contracts.
Other than the SAA and MNRE legal covenants, all other Project covenants were complied
with and environmental and social safeguards carried out in accordance with GoS laws and
Bank policies. However, the PMU fell short on its responsibility to regularly update the
M&E indicators and its Progress Reports dealt with SIAM-2 outputs and not overall
outcomes. Concerned agencies seemed to view the poorly designed framework as a
burden, rather than a tool to manage SIAM-2.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

184.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

185. Implementation was consistently efficient and effective, but due to the poor
updating of the monitoring indicators, is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6      Lessons Learned
186. “Building resilience” is time consuming and should seek to empower
communities to identify and implement local solutions to manage their specific risk
levels. As a corollary, communities do not always have the means to build resilience with
only their own resources. Projects targeting resilience as an outcome will have greater
impact if they empower communities to develop locally-devised responses and provide the
resources to do so. SIAM-2’s inclusive and highly participatory planning approaches in
preparing CIM Plans are well documented in Samoa and within the Pacific. There are
indications that due to this participation, willingness to implement small community and
household-based resilience strengthening activities (coral and mangrove planting, fresh
spring water protection) and community-enforced protective measures (no fish zones,
limited build zones) is strong and adds to hard structural measures built by the public
sector. However, the participatory planning approach needs to be continual and can take
several years to implement. It began under SIAM-1 with 15 Districts and was rolled out to
all Districts under SIAM-2 over a period of 10years to 15 years. It also requires facilitated
inputs on the “science” of disasters and climate change as an input to community decision-
making. Communities were provided with this information and supplemented by specialist
inputs to complement local oral history and knowledge. Finally, the plans are only as good
as the degree to which they can be implemented. Linking the CIM Plans to a small grants
facility was fundamental to ensuring that resources were available to pay for materials and
resources from outside the community itself.

187. Long-term projects, particularly those that make use of restructuring and more
than one source of finance, should use the restructuring to close out completed
components, or to update legal covenants, monitoring indicators, and other design
elements.    SIAM-2 was separately restructured for the purposes for: (i) Additional
Financing on two occasions; (ii) extensions of the closing date; (iii) a change in
Implementing Agency (MWTI to LTA); and (iv) a revision to the Results Framework.
While it would have been more efficient and less disruptive to have consolidated the
number of restructurings, it does demonstrate that the Bank Team was both supportive and
proactive. The final performance ratings for both the Client and the Bank might have been
more positive if the completed component (A) had been closed out and the results
framework retrofitted earlier as part of an earlier restructuring.

188. In small countries where the Bank has few operations and local implementing
agencies have to contend with many different external support partners with differing
procedures, clearly establishing the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders,
including the Bank, and doing this early on can help to ensure that projects are
implemented efficiently and effectively. SIAM-2 offers a worthy example of effective
arrangements for implementing projects across multiple agencies without loss of local


                                             52
agency involvement or ownership. SIAM-2 was able to do this for several reasons,
including: (i) implementation arrangements were clear, unambiguous and understood from
the start; (ii) the Project Steering Committee provided the IAs with hard budget constraints
and approved their annual work plans, but did not involve itself in day-to-day issues,
although it did provide high-level support when needed; (iii) the IAs accepted
responsibility for all aspects of implementation; (iv) the PMU had a project specific, stand-
alone contract with unambiguous deliverables.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      Using the Roads Economic Decision (RED) model developed by the World Bank to
evaluate the economic impacts of low volume roads, the analysis assesses a life-cycle
comparison of project alternatives computing road agency costs, road user costs, and total
transport costs over the evaluation period.

2.      RED computes the net present value of benefits (NPV) and the economic internal rate
of return (EIRR) for project alternatives. The main economic benefits from the road
improvements in Samoa include: (i) a reduction in the road user costs, comprised of vehicle
operating costs and travel time costs, due to the improved ride quality and travel time across
the network; (ii) improved access for the rural areas to the urban center of Apia; (iii)
improved safety for road users through the upgrading or urban roads and bridges; (iv)
improved safety and access for pedestrians through footpath provisions; and (v) preservation
of the structural integrity of the network to reduce greater network investment costs in the
future.

3.     The analysis considered three major investments under SIAM-2:
       a) West Coast Road rehabilitation and improvements;
       b) Vaitele Street widening; and
       c) Fagaloa Bay Road works (rural road upgrading).

4.      Both the PAD and the 2007 Additional Financing Project Paper undertook economic
analyses on the proposed investments. However, since the project was prepared more than ten
years ago, there is a significant difference in the cost of the investments. In addition, the
eventual scope of the activities as completed under the project changed and entailed more
civil works than originally planned.

5.    During the earlier analyses of the project investments, the following factors were
assumed:
       •   Evaluation period of 20 years;
       •   Discount rate of 12 percent;
       •   Traffic estimates for 2003, based on actual traffic counts taken in 2001 and 2002;
       •   An annual traffic growth rate of 3 percent across the network, except 3.5 percent
           for West Coast Road and 6 percent for Fagaloa Bay;
       •   Capital investments and maintenance costs reflect 2003 prices; and
       •   The benefit stream includes savings in VOC and travel time.

6.     The economic analyses for the ICR included the following assumptions:
       •   Evaluation period of 20 years;
       •   Discount rate of 12 percent;
       •   Traffic estimates for 2014, based on actual traffic counts taken in 2012 and 2013
           at the nearest and geographical relevant traffic count site, including percentage of
           Heavy Vehicles;
       •   An annual traffic growth rate of 3 percent across the network, except 3.5 percent
           for West Coast Road and 6 percent for Fagaloa Bay;
       •   Capital investments reflect the contract prices, at the time of signing the contract
           award and payment;


                                             60
        •   Maintenance costs of 10 percent the original investment cost applied to the section
            of road at Year 5 and Year 15;
        •   Exchange rate was assumed to be WST 1 = USD 0.4;
        •   Average roughness across the network is 4.0 IRI;
        •   Price elasticity demand for transport was assumed equal to 1.0;
        •   Passenger time was assumed to be US$1.0 per hour per passenger corresponding
            to an average income of US$150 per month;
        •   Drainage costs were deemed negligible in the analysis as these work items are
            commonalities of each project alternative and necessary regardless of the timing
            of the project;
        •   The assumed Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) are given in Table 3.A; and
        •   No data was available on accident rates pre- or post-construction. Any benefits in
            a reduction in accidents as a result of safety improvements of the investments will
            be discussed as non-quantitative benefits.

7.      The overall NPV decreased from what was originally calculated at appraisal. This is
not unexpected, given the significant increase in the scope of works finally undertaken and
cost of the investments. When compared to a scenario where no investments were made in
the roads, the actual results produced a positive NPV of US$2.41 million. The value of the
project is readily apparent and it can be concluded that the benefits of the project significantly
outweighed the costs. When compared to the NPV calculated at appraisal, this value
decreased significantly and is likely attributed to the significant scale-up of the investment
level of the activities. The benefits derived from savings to vehicle costs, travel times and
reduction in long-term maintenance costs that would otherwise have incurred without the
investment, significantly outweigh the cost of the investment.

8.       A large reduction in the EIRR and NPV for each individual investment as compared
to the ratios at appraisal is noted. This is likely due to the significant increase in the cost of
the investments (see Section 2.2, Component B). The scope of works included in the
originally planned investments, particularly regarding Vaitele Street widening, were
considerably less than that finally was achieved under the project. Actual EIRRs for both
higher volume, urban/peri-urban roads (West Coast Road and Vaitele Street), while lower
than calculated at appraisal, are still an acceptable 14 percent and 11 percent respectively.
The NPV is negative for Vaitele Street Widening and Fagaloa Bay Road Works. However,
the economic calculations have not factored in social benefits, such as improved road user
and pedestrian safety, or the household economic and social gains from improved access to
markets, and health and education facilities.

9.      Data on accident rates for the investments were not available. Therefore, any
quantitative benefits resulting from the investment could not be included in the analysis.
However, it is widely accepted that pedestrian injury and fatality rates have reduced with the
introduction of footpaths. The widening of road corridors typically contributes to a reduction
in road fatalities and injuries.

10.     Although the EIRRs and NPVs of the investments are less than the ratios calculated at
appraisal, the final unit costs for the civil works under the Project appear reasonable. A report
prepared by the Bank listed the mean cost per kilometer for rehabilitation and reconstruction
of inter-urban roads as US$446,750 per km and of secondary roads as US$172,712 per km.
The data was sourced from World Bank projects in Europe and Central Asia. 27 However,
when compared to the recent unit rates for rehabilitation works in the Pacific, the unit cost for

                                                         62
the West Coast Road and Fagaloa Bay Road investments are comparable. However, when
compared to the recent unit rates for rehabilitation works in other Pacific countries, the unit
cost for the West Coast Road and Fagaloa Bay Road investments are comparable. For
example, from a recent project in Papua New Guinea, the unit cost for road resurfacing and
rehabilitation was US$577,000 per km, 28 while in Kiribati, the unit cost for road
rehabilitations in 2013 were found to be US$816,000 per km, 29 which is high for the Pacific
region, but given the logistical challenges of the country is understandable. The anomaly in
the analysis is the Vaitele Street Widening activity. However, the works under this activity
exceeded rehabilitation works owing to the current and expected increase in traffic volumes,
passing through a heavily built-up area and given the road’s importance as a link between the
main port, industrial area and international airport. This section of road was widened from
three lanes to four, pedestrian footpaths were installed on both sides of the road, and a large
amount of land was acquired, all of which was costly. In the Bank report mentioned above,
the mean cost of the construction of a new 2-lane, 7 meter wide equivalent road was found to
be US$1.48 million. 30 Although the unit cost for Vaitele Street is in excess of this, the
additional costs associated with the civil works of widening and installing pedestrian access
and with the required land acquisition, and the less competitive market of the Pacific, it is not
unexpected that this unit rate would be higher than that was found in Europe and Central
Asia. It should be noted that comparison of costs provides only limited insight into road
prices per km, as challenges, including the availability of materials, security concerns, and
logistical issues, are not uniform across countries.

           Annex 4. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

General Comments
Although several difficulties and delays occurred during the programme the Government of
Samoa feels that the overall results achieved where very satisfactory and have had a major
impact on the development of the country.

The most significant areas where difficulties were encountered are outlined herein with the
intent that lessons can be learned in order to streamline future projects.
Comments about the Scope of SIAM-2
The SIAM-2 started in 2003 and continued until June 2014. The program was extensive and
the aim was to invest in improving key infrastructure to be able to withstand impacts from
natural disasters and to make sure the management of such infrastructures are effective and
efficient throughout the life cycle. The program also included promoting the participation of
the private sector to deliver the services required and at the same time provided reforms to
the, at that time, Public Works Department and the Department of Lands and Survey.

The planning of such a program took several years prior to the start, and the scoping of the
program involved major reforms in the delivery of public works services. Plans were
provided for 48 coastal districts which provided a framework for communities to agree with
the government of how to manage and protect their environment. The program was very well
developed and implementation went as smoothly. As the program continued with its
implementation, budget shortfalls became apparent and that had impacts to the
implementation of the original 4-5 year program extending it to some ten years duration.

The program provided better infrastructure (roads, bridges, coastal protection) to much of
Samoa, especially on Upolu Island, and the notable results of the program were as follow:

       •   Newly reformed MWTI, LTA, and MNRE, fully staffed and functioning well.
           These three organizations functions and responsibilities were very well defined
           and work had gone through proper appraisal and sectoral management plans in
           order to account for better quality assets but also due diligence were taken in
           consideration for the implementation of such projects. So proper environment
           processes were followed for all projects and issues relating to the environment
           (social, green and economic environment) were taken in consideration in the
           implementations of projects undertaken by these newly established organizations
           during SIAM-2.

       •   All roads assets are now under the care of the private sector contractors and
           managed by LTA. There are maintenance contractors and the country is divided
           into zones and given to contractors to manage. This results in better quality assets
           and good rating by road users compared to the beginning of the project. There
           were other great achievements in the private sector through competitiveness of the
           quality of prices offer for work and made it more than 90% of the construction
           program were delivered by local contractors.

       •   On the other hand, local consultants were associating with overseas consultants to
           undertake design and supervision of projects while some specialised areas in the
           reforms aspect of MWTI into LTA, overseas consultants had to deliver those parts
           of the program.

                                              64
       •   Bringing down the maintenance costs may not be too significant of a dropped.
           However, there were significant reasons for such cost not coming down. In the
           overall picture, the real plus on maintenance was the fact that road standards
           improved from a year to year due to timely addressing of maintenance road
           problems throughout the year by local contractors.

       •   The increasing number of coastal communities with the coastal protection and
           mostly were rib-rap design using local materials. Some beach replenishes and
           upgrading of key fords and bridges were also achieved during SIAM-2.

       •   Coastal Infrastructure Asset Management Plans for 48 districts in placed and
           agreed with the government and this set a long-term planning process for all
           districts in Samoa.
Some difficulties experienced during the Implementation:

   a) Procurement Delays
There were several cases of procurement delays in this program. These were attributable to
some degree in preparations and approval but principally in funding. These delays were
identified, and commitments were made to compensate for such by giving extensions of
timelines to each process in the procurement.
The most significant delay however was that SIAM-2 funds were totally committed by mid-
2010 but the Pacific Regional Infrastructure grant funds allocated to make up for the shortfall
did not become available for use until November 2011. Despite an extension of SIAM-2 to
the end of June 2013 this gave only 19 months to complete all remaining projects under
SIAM-2.

The timeline was achieved with some difficulty and the programme successfully completed
by the cut-off date.
   b) SIAM-2 Project Component Manager (PCM)
The role of the PCM’s to manage all projects within MWTI (later LTA) and MNRE was
critical to the overall program. The MNRE PCM work-load was mostly manageable in scale;
however the PCM for MWTI and LTA was a multi-facetted role covering many large
projects which were primarily the responsibility of this one person which placed a most
considerable burden on the role. After the transfer to LTA the PCM also assumed the duties
of the Contracts Engineer which had previously been a separate appointment.

Terms of Reference of the Project Management Unit restricted their role and ability to assist.

Nevertheless it is considered that the four persons who successively undertook this role very
successfully completed all the intended scope of SIAM-2.

Under the new ERAP programme this restriction has been realized and the Terms of
Reference of the new PMU have been greatly expanded, especially as regards procurement.
Additionally a team of three engineers has been formed within LTA who now assume the
PCM’s role. Some six professionals hence are performing the tasks previously undertaken by
one. This thus allows a much more comprehensive input than was previously possible,
however it does significantly increase the difficulties of coordinating all activities which is
addressed by regular coordination meetings.

                                              65
   c) Funding for Training for Locals

The program started with funding allocation for training for local Ministry staff. This was
fully utilized early in the programme and there were no more training funds for the
remainder. This ought to be reactivated during the upcoming programmes as significant
benefits can be achieved in developing local expertise.
Final Impact of the Programs to Samoa
The two consecutive programs of the Samoa Infrastructure Asset Management Program,
Phase 1 and Phase 2 spanned more than two decades. It started more than twenty years ago
when 100yr cyclones (Ofa and Val) struck Samoa, one year after another. It was a difficult
challenge starting at the time of changing policies by development partners, like Japan, NZ,
and Australia. In those development partners, normal help was given to Public Works in the
form of providing plant, equipment, spare parts. However, the policies changes to providing
technical personnel to assist Public Works to change and modernize their procedures. They
provided funds to develop human resources within the department and strengthening
management within government department and ministries to look after the infrastructure
assets. So it was not just building up again assets that were destroyed by cyclones, but also to
make sure the rebuilding program and the assets were to be adequately maintained.

It was a journey that required great commitment from within government starting from
political leaders together with committed public servants who lead these reforms. Public
Works Department functions and responsibilities changed from an internal labor force
delivery services to outsourcing to the private sector. Public Works amalgamated with
Transport to form the Ministry of Works Transport & Infrastructure. MWTI later transferred
its road transport function to the newly formed Land Transport Authority in 2009.

The Department of Lands and Survey became the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment and this Ministry included the Forestry that used to be with Agriculture
Department.
The procurement and environment safeguards process of government strengthened and all
projects had to go through a due diligence process in the interest of transparency and
accountability. There has been a large improvement in how national assets were prioritized
for improvement and feasibility studies have been undertaken prior to any of these assets
being approved for construction.

Looking at the overall picture of this country, these two programmes have contributed a great
deal in providing Samoa with great basic infrastructure to the case of land transport. In the
area of coastal protection and related services to the environment, SIAM-1 and SIAM-2 also
provided that basic services for the environment. To achieve all these reforms legislation has
changed in time before some of these plans moved forward. The government made an impact
when it accepted those changes in the way public works should move forward in the
beginning as well in the area of land surveying and environmental protection.

There is no doubt that international evidence shows that economic infrastructures can be a
powerful catalyst for improved social and economic outcomes, and SIAM-1 and SIAM-2
have achieved that for Samoa in the area of land transport and environment. Samoa is most
appreciative of the assistance from the development partners. The World Bank and
Government of Australia who funded this program over the years must be commended for the
fruitful partnership which developed with the Government of Samoa.

A. PAD Indicators (see PAD, Annex 1)

1.      The PAD Indicators as appraised for both the overall Program and for Phase 2 (the
Project) made use of the logical framework approach (preceding the Results Framework

          12. Percent progress and slippage against implementation schedule of Project
          13. Actual cost/estimated cost of Project.

2.      The above eight Outcome/Impact Indicators and 12 Output Indicators31 were used for
reporting for the first 18 months of the project, from effectiveness (June 2004) through March
2006. During this time, it became apparent that the IAs were finding it a challenge to closely
monitor and report on the large number of indicators, some of which did not have well

 31   Output indicator “number of accidents per year” was not reported on due to the difficulties in collecting
      accurate data.

mission), it was agreed between the Government and the Bank project team to streamline
data monitoring and focus collection efforts on a subset of 11 Performance Indicators only
(drawn from both the outcomes and outputs indicators in the PAD) as had been set out in the
Development Credit Agreement (see below).

C. Additional Financing Indicators (Cr. 3848-1-WSO; Gr. H311-WSO, Additional
   Financing Agreement, August 13, 2007)

4.     The Project Paper (May 23, 2007) supporting the Additional Finance, continued to
make use of the same 11 original DCA Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (as above) and
the same KPIs also were cited in the Additional Financing Agreement of August 13, 2007.

5.     The only differences between the KPIs in the original Development Credit Agreement
(2004) and KPIs in the subsequent Additional Financing Agreement (2007) were changes
made to dates and some targets, as follows:

           (i)   The end-of-project (EOP) date for all indicators was amended from December
                 2008 to the newly extended project closing date of June 30, 2010;
           (ii) The baseline year for measuring “Competitive price savings for works and
                 services” was updated from the PAD’s original baseline of “2001” to a “2003”
                 baseline;
           (iii) The “Compliance with EIA provisions” target was raised from 80 percent to 100
                 percent as the original EOP target of 80 percent had already been met by August
                 2006; and
           (iv) The “available cadastral land plans digitized and validated” was originally
                 targeted as 100 percent of all titles but this was reduced to 30 percent.

6.     It was the above 11 KPIs that were monitored and reported on by the IAs and PMU
through the Project Quarterly Progress Reports.

7.      In addition to the KPIs, the Additional Finance Project Paper (May 23, 2007) set out
seven Project Outcome Indicators consisting of two Project Development Objective
Indicators and five Intermediate Outcome Indicators (one for each of the five Project
Components), as shown in Table 5.B below (only Baseline and EOP values and targets are
shown in the table). The Project Quarterly Reports note that in an effort to gather more
meaningful data on project performance, the below seven Project Outcome Indicators 32 were
reported on by MWTI (and it subsequent successor LTA) and MNRE in their project
component reporting. The indicator values also were captured in the Bank’s internal project
monitoring system (ISRs).

D. Project Restructuring Indicators (TF10785), November 2013

8.     The IAs, PMU and Bank’s supervision/implementation progress missions attempted
on-going reporting on all 18 Performance and Outcome Indicators.             However, the
implementing agencies found many of the indicators difficult to measure in a consistent and
meaningful manner.

9.       The following were amongst the difficulties faced. For the indicator “public road and
coastal protection infrastructure in good-fair condition” the road value was based on a visual
roughness assessment of roads as MWTI/LTA did not have mechanized roughness measuring
equipment and because the costs of carrying out a comprehensive condition assessment of the
road network on an annual basis were high. For assessing the condition of the coastal
protection infrastructure, MNRE did not have the staff available to routinely assess the
infrastructure on both of the main (or any smaller) islands and over above the project funded
infrastructure, there were parts of the coastline protected by village and private household
constructed seawalls which did not always meet the project improved designs and quality of
construction. LTA however, did monitor the condition of coastal roads and adjacent seawalls
(but not the condition of other seawalls).

10.     Regarding the two indicators for Component A,“Samoa Airport Authority % cost
recovery for air transport infrastructure assets” and “asset management systems operational
for airport infrastructure assets,” the small, funded activities had been completed in early

2009 and the SAA found it too onerous to regularly report on its corporate functions to the
project and was not always timely in its submissions. Under SIAM-2, SAA signed a
Memorandum of Agreement to, among other things, prepare annual reviews of financial and
operational performance that would be sent to IDA for comments. However, from 2003
through 2005, the financial auditors were not able to sign off on SAA’s financial accounts
due to what the auditors considered was an undervaluation of lands used by SAA to acquire
an equity position in a tourist resort facility. As such, while SAA provided unaudited reports
showing evidence of compliance with cost recovery targets, the figures were not based on
audited financial accounts.

11.     The “service quality ratings by road users and affected groups” did not have a regular
embedded methodology in place for collection.           The information overlapped with the
indicator regarding roads being in good and fair condition.

12.     “Cost recovery of road maintenance” was to have been measured by means of “user
charges as a ratio of total road needs.” The Land Transport Authority Act (March 2007)
brought together the road asset management and road use management functions previously
carried out by MWTI and placed them under the responsibility of the LTA. The Act also sets
out the funds and resources of LTA, including a range of user charges (levies on fuel, vehicle
license fees for some classes of vehicles and levies on road users) and appropriations by the
Samoan Parliament. However, supporting Regulations specifying the scope and size of LTA
charges on road users and revenue sharing arrangements with MOF for the fuel tax have not
been finalized or approved. As pointed out in the Samoa Transport Sector Review (2003),
there is no theoretical basis to make the argument that revenue form imposts on fuel used for
road transport should only be used for roads and to do so, would reduce funding for other
Government activities by WST 6.5 million (2003 estimate) that would need to be raised
elsewhere. The Government has preferred to transfer a road maintenance budget (based on a
range of revenue sources) approved annually by the Ministry of Finance to MWTI and
subsequently to the LTA. While this has provided adequate levels of financing for road
maintenance 33 , it was not possible to accurately attribute a specific portion of the annual
budget to road user charges.

13.    Finally, the five Intermediate Outcome Indicators (one for each of the five project
components) were more accurately defined as outputs than outcomes and became quickly
dated as the specific consultancies and other contracts were completed.

14.        In November 2013, a Level two restructuring of the Project was processed to
rationalize and update the monitoring indicators. The PDO indicators were reduced to four
(including the revision of one indicator to be a core indicator), while the intermediate results
indicators were reduced to three. No changes were made to the PDO or components.

15.       The changes made to the indicators through the restructuring were:

          (i)    those indicators that related to Component A that was no longer active under the
                 Project were dropped (Samoa Airports Authority implemented);
          (ii)   those indicators for which data collection had been problematic for some time
                 were dropped (reliant on a sophisticated asset management system that was not
                 finally used by LTA; requiring dedicated and costly road user surveys by LTA;
                 and unclear if measurement was of cadastral land plans vs. titled lands by

33   Communication with CEO, LTA, September 2014.

            MNRE); and
      (iii) output indicators measuring progress on completion of certain of certain
            activities that had already been completed were dropped.

16.     Table 5.C summarizes the modifications made. The end-of-project Results
Framework reflects this final set of four PDO Results and three Intermediate Results
indicators for the Project (see Section F of the ICR Data Sheet ).

                Project Development Objective (PDO):
                The PDO aims to (i) to enhance the economic, environmental and social sustainability of transport and coastal infrastructure assets; and (ii) to manage
                those assets and natural resources and respond to national emergencies, through an effective partnership with private sector stakeholders.

                The small activities associated with this indicator were completed in early 2009. The SAA did not
                regularly provide updates on the progress of this indicator. Under the Project, SAA had signed a

achievement) 2005, the financial auditors were not able to sign off on SAA’s financial accounts due to what the
                auditors considered was an undervaluation of lands used by SAA to acquire an equity position in a
                tourist resort facility. Thus, while SAA provided unaudited reports showing evidence of
                compliance with cost recovery targets, the figures were not based on audited financial accounts.

                 specifying the scope and size of LTA charges on road users and revenue sharing arrangements with
                 MOF for the fuel tax have not been finalized or approved. As pointed out in the Samoa Transport
                 Sector Review (2003), there is no theoretical basis to make the argument that revenue form imposts
                 on fuel used for road transport should only be used for roads and to do so, would reduce funding
                 for other Government activities by WST6.5 million (2003 estimate) that would need to be raised
                 elsewhere. The Government has preferred to transfer a road maintenance budget (based on a range
                 of revenue sources) approved annually by the Ministry of Finance to MWTI and subsequently to the
                 LTA. Whilst this has provided adequate levels of financing for road maintenance 34 , it was not
                 possible to accurately attribute a specific portion of the annual budget to road user charges.
