                         The project has already achieved most of its objectives, almost all originally planned outputs are completed, and new co-financing is now available to scale up priority investments
                         (and complete others). The condition, quality, and sustainability of land transport, aviation, and coastal infrastructure has been substantially improved. The largest investments have

                         management capacity of the government has been strengthened by upgrading equipment and systems, strengthening human resources, and developing investment and asset
                         management plans and strategies. This has benefited not only the infrastructure sector, but also environmental monitoring, natural resource management, and emergency
                         preparedness and response. Private sector stakeholders play a greater role in these activities through their coordinated work with government agencies.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was recently restructured and extended, mainly to accommodate new co-financing made available through the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) to scale up
                         some priority investments (and complete others).
