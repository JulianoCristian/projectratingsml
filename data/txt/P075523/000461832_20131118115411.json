This Restructuring paper reflects changes\n            discussed with the Ministry of Finance and the Land\n            Transport Authority (LTA) during the January 28 to February\n            7, 2013 mission to supervise the Second Infrastructure Asset\n            Management Project and recorded in the Aide M\u00e9moire dated\n            February 11, 2013. The closing date of the original project\n            was June 30, 2010. When the additional financing was\n            approved in 2007, the closing date matched that of the\n            original project. Shortly after the additional financing was\n            approved, the closing date was extended by 18 months to\n            December 31, 2011. When the PRIF trust fund was added to the\n            project, the project was restructured and the closing date\n            of SIAM-2 was extended once more to June 30, 2013. Most\n            recently, the closing date of the PRIF trust fund has been\n            extended by 18 months to December 31, 2014. Key project\n            ratings, progress towards achieving the PDO and overall\n            implementation progress have been rated as satisfactory\n            (PDO) or moderately satisfactory (implementation progress).\n            Indications forecast that the PDO is to remain relevant and\n            that generally satisfactory progress towards the PDO will\n            continue. The modifications proposed under this\n            restructuring will not change the PDO, and the PDO will\n            still be achieved with the activities being carried out\n            under the remaining project components. No new activities\n            are being proposed. There is no escalation of the safeguard\n            rating, and no additional safeguards triggered. As such, a\n            Level 2 restructuring is to be carried out."}, "docdt": "2013-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
