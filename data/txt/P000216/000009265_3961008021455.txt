MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SECOND HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 14.3 million, the equivalent of
US$21.3 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Second
Health and Population Project. Of the total project costs of US$36.9 million, IDA would finance
US$21.3 million (58%), KfW would provide a grant of US$13.6 million (37%), and the
Government of Burundi would finance US$2.0 million (5%).
2.    Country/Sector Background. With a population of about 5.8 million and an area of
27,834 km2, Burundi has the second highest population density in Africa. The population
comprises two main ethnic groups, the Hutus (85 percent) and the Tutsis (14 percent). Despite
demographic pressure (3.1 percent growth per year) on already constrained land, urbanization is
limited; 94 percent of the population is still rural. Burundi's GDP per capita is one of the lowest
in the world, at US$180 in 1993. Agriculture is the main economic activity, contributing half of
GDP and over 80 percent of employment and export earnings. Prior to the 1993 political crisis,
Burundi was one of the few African countries self-sufficient in food.
3.    The first free elections held in June 1993 resulted in the election of the first Hutu
president and the acquisition of legislative power by the political party FRODEBU. In October
1993, the president and other key FRODEBU leaders were assassinated in a coup attempt led by
a small group within the army. This event gave rise to an outbreak of violence that left at least
50,000 dead and resulted in the migration of about 800,000 persons to neighboring countries.
Many of them returned in the spring of 1994 following the outbreak of larger-scale violence in
neighboring Rwanda, triggered by the airplane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of
both Rwanda and Burundi.  While Burundi succeeded in averting renewed widespread
massacres, these events aggravated long-standing ethnic tensions. In September 1994, 12 of the
country's 13 political parties signed a power-sharing agreement, which is to remain in effect for
four years. On October 1, 1994, a new interim president was sworn in and a new government
was formed. In March 1995, there was a further change of Prime Minister and some Cabinet
posts. The political situation remains fiagile, and needs to be consolidated, in part through rapid
improvement in the economic and social conditions of the population.
4.    Burundi's education and health sectors were paralyzed for nearly a year from October
1993 because of the insecurity prevailing throughout the country. Large numbers of personnel
fled to safer zones while others were killed, leaving schools and health facilities inadequately
staffed. Equipment, supplies and vehicles were vandalized or stolen and national distribution
channels broke down.  The health system has relied almost exclusively on international
emergency aid since the crisis began. The substantial flow of humanitarian relief (which
amounted to US$85 million in 1994) and the efficiency of aid-coordination mechanisms
managed by the MOPH and donors helped to prevent major health problems on a national scale.
With the progress in the resolution of the politico-institutional crisis of October 1993, the
national health system has started to operate again. However, it faces serious sectoral issues and
operational constraints that will require bold and immediate reforms. The main sector issues are:



(i) an acute shortage of health personnel, which has deepened because of both the crisis in
Burundi and the return of many Rwandese expatriate physicians to Rwanda after fighting ended
there; (ii) insufficient financial resources and the poor yields and inequity of existing financing
mechanisms; (iii) weak management and institutional capacity; (iv) inadequacy of the rural
hospital network to deliver adequate curative health services and support health centers in the
provision of primary health care; (iv) rapid population growth which hinders Burundi's economic
and social development; and (v) a major AIDS epidemic.
5.    The Government, with IDA support, prepared an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP)
for 1995 to finance the immediate needs of priority sectors, including health. It submitted the
ERP to various donors, and IDA approved a US$14.6 million Emergency Assistance Credit (Cr.
2668-BI) in December 1994, which became effective in April 1995. Of this amount, US$6
million should be spent for the health sector; this aid, together with that to be provided by other
donors, should cover the financing needed for the sector's rehabilitation program in 1995,
amounting to US$15.5 million. Beyond this, the Government plans to introduce the structural
reforms required to make the system operate more effectively and equitably and respond better to
the needs of the population. To do this, it intends to implement the following strategies: (i)
decentralize the health system, by giving management autonomy to public hospitals and
provincial health bureaus (BPS), and later to health centers, and by strengthening their
capabilities; (ii) reduce the acute shortage of medical personnel; (iii) improve the yields and
equity of health care financing mechanisms; (iv) improve drug availability and affordability, by
developing an essential drug policy and establishing an autonomous drug procurement unit; (v)
strengthen basic health services and hospitals in peripheral areas; (vi) control public health
problems, such as AIDS; and (vii) implement innovative family planning strategies, as a way to
control population growth.  The country's main donors have made a commitment to assist
MOPH in implementing its key strategies over the next few years.
6.    Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to improve the health
status of Burundi's population and contribute to sustainable per capita income growth by slowing
population growth, thus reducing population pressures on resources. The project was appraised
in May 1993 but had to be re-appraised in December 1994; its content has been redefined on the
basis of the new priorities of MOPH and other donors' interventions. It aims to help increase the
availability, quality and efficiency of health services, and make them more responsive to the
public's expectations. The proposed project and the contributions of other donors together
constitute a coherent program to support the Government in its efforts to implement its sector
policy and strategies. Specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen MOPH's capacity to design and
implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the availability and quality of health care delivery in
rural areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child mortality rates;
and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning behaviors.
7.    Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the proposed project would support
policies and investments designed to: (i) strengthen MOPH capacity to effect reforms in human
resource management, hospital management autonomy, health financing (especially the pre-
payment scheme - CAM - and user fees), quality of health services, and maintenance; (ii)
strengthen service delivery in five of Burundi's 15 provinces, by supporting basic health services
and rehabilitating nine hospitals; (iii) implement the national maternal and child health and
family planning (MCH/FP) policy; and (iv) improve information, education and communication
(IEC) activities.



8.    Project Implementation. The project would be implemented over a five year period.
All project activities would be implemented by existing MOPH directorates: (i) activities aimed
at strengthening MOPH's capacities to design and implement sector reforms would be managed
by:  the Directorate for Health Services, for human resource management; the General
Inspectorate for Health, for hospital management autonomy and quality assessment and
management; the Planning Unit, for improving health financing mechanisms; and the Directorate
for Health Logistics, for the maintenance strategy; (ii) the strengthening of service delivery in
five provinces would be managed by the General Directorate for Health, in cooperation with the
Directorate for Health Logistics; (iii) MCH/FP would be managed by the Coordination Office for
Family Planning (CPPF); and (iv) IEC activities would be managed by the Health Education
Unit. A project coordination team (PCT) would be established in the MOPH and would be
responsible for day-to-day coordination of project activities, procurement, financial matters
(disbursements, accounts and audits), monitoring and evaluation. As is the case for all donor-
financed projects in Burundi, the PCT would report to the Minister's adviser in charge of the
Planning Unit.
9.    Project Sustainability. Improved performance of the existing financing mechanisms
(the health insurance card and user fees) would strengthen the overall financing of the sector. In
addition, improved management at all levels of the health system (e.g., better allocation of
resources, improved hospital management, decentralization of health administration,
rationalization of drug procurement and supply) would contribute to reducing waste and getting
more value for money. This would help MOPH to allocate more resources to public health
programs.  Incremental recurrent costs to deal with current understaffing and inadequate
maintenance will be generated by the project. They have been estimated and could be financed
after project completion from cost recovery and continuing MOPH budget allocations.
10.   Lessons from previous IDA Involvement. The Bank's assistance to the health sector
started in 1988 with the on-going Population and Health Project (FY88), to be completed in June
1995. An Education Sector Development Project (FY88) is also ongoing, and will be completed
by the end of 1995 (new education lending is being prepared). A Social Action Project (FY93)
was further initiated to improve living conditions among the poor. The main lessons learned are
that: (a) a project is better implemented when the government is committed and when
beneficiary opinions are taken into account during project preparation; (b) MOPH's capacity to
design and implement sector reforms needs to be strengthened; (c) strengthening health centers is
not enough to ensure an improvement in overall service delivery; (d) rehabilitation activities
should emphasize equally physical and qualitative inputs and outputs; and (e) key functions, such
as project coordination, procurement and accounting need to be strengthened. The design of the
proposed project has incorporated all these lessons by: (a) involving MOPH in the project design
and carrying out a beneficiary assessment during project preparation; (b) recruiting high level
local consultants qualified in areas of MOPH deficiency; (c) rehabilitating hospitals to improve
their capacity to backstop the first level of care; (d) ensuring that, within three months of being
granted autonomy, public hospitals have adopted the related regulations and by-laws; and that
within six months after their rehabilitation, project hospitals have introduced management
accounting systems and training programs in hospital management, and have sufficient staffing;
and (e) strengthening coordination, procurement and accounting functions within the PCT.
11.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Burundi
is being presented to the Executive Directors on May 25. 1995 along with the proposed project.
The CAS aims to help Burundi avert a socio-political breakdown and lay the foundations for



- 4 -
economic recovery and diversified growth, with a view to increasing employment opportunities
and improving equity, mainly through productivity gains in agriculture and increased access to
social services. The broad reform agenda focuses on the following: (i) increased equity and better
governance; (ii) environmentally sustainable, accelerated growth based on private sector
development; and (iii) human resource development through better quality of, and increased
access to, education and health services, and reduced population growth. The proposed project is
a central part of the CAS and is included in all three alternative lending scenarios proposed in the
CAS. It forms an integral part of the Government's and the Bank's strategies. The proposed
project would support areas of reform and policy decisions and health services in those provinces
which other donors are not tackling.
12.   Agreed Actions. Before negotiations, the Government submitted a draft sector policy
letter. During negotiations. the Government gave assurances that: (a) (i) not later than
December 31, 1995, it would prepare a policy framework, draft regulations and by-laws for
autonomous public hospitals; (ii) not later than March 31, 1996, it would adopt a policy
framework including a timetable for implementation, satisfactory to IDA; (iii) not later than June
30, 1996, it would cause each existing autonomous hospital to adopt the new regulations and by-
laws; and (iv) it would cause each new autonomous hospital to adopt the regulations and by-laws
within three months of its autonomy; (b) not later than six months after credit effectiveness, it
would recruit the following local consultants: two for standardized management accounting
systems and training programs in hospital management in the autonomous public hospitals; one
for improving the CAM scheme; one for the public expenditure program in health; and one for
the family planning IEC strategy; (c) in preparing its rolling public investment program and its
annual budget, it would: (i) not later than October 31 of each year, submit to IDA for its review
and comments its investments and budgetary allocations proposals for the health sector; and (ii)
take into account IDA's comments in finalizing the draft budget before it is sent to the Council of
Ministers for approval; (d) not later than six months after the rehabilitation of each project
hospital, it would: (i) introduce standardized management accounting systems and training
programs in hospital management there; and (ii) assign personnel to it, as recommended by a
study of the project hospitals; (e) the project coordinator and the other key staff of the PCT
would be maintained at all times according to terms of reference and selection procedures
acceptable to IDA; (f) annual reviews of the implementation of the project and sector strategies
would be conducted by October 31 each year, starting in 1996; and (g) a joint mid-term review
would be carried out by June 30, 1998.
13.   As conditions of Board presentation, the Government has: (a) submitted a signed sector
policy letter, including an action plan and timetable, acceptable to IDA; and (b) initiated the
recruitment of a project coordinator, by submitting proof that the position has been advertised
locally, with terms of reference and selection criteria acceptable to IDA. As conditions of credit
effectiveness, the Government would: (a) submit an assessment of total personnel needs within
the public health sector; (b) recruit internationally a consultant in mass communications
planning; (c) prepare all bid documents for the first year of project implementation; (d) make an
initial deposit of US$80,000 equivalent in a project account; and (e) recruit the key staff of the
PCT and an independent auditor, and put a project accounting and financial management system
in place.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The environmental category assigned to this project is C. The
possible decline in the rate of population growth would have a positive impact on the



-5-
environment. Improved maintenance and hygiene of hospitals and their surroundings would also
have a positive impact.
15.   Program  Objectives Categories.  The project responds to the country's poverty
reduction and human resource development strategies and hence to the corresponding POCs.
Because of its focus on MCH/FP, it has a WID dimension.
16.   Participatory Approach. A beneficiary assessment was conducted during project
preparation to identify beneficiaries' perception of public health services and their opinion with
regard to the existing payment mechanisms for health (especially the CAM).  Similar
assessments would be conducted throughout project implementation to help MOPH design
reforms that are responsive to the public's expectations. By extending management autonomy to
all public hospitals (and later to public health centers), the project would promote local
communities' involvement in decision-making and management of health services (through their
participation on hospitals' boards of directors). Finally, the project would involve local NGOs in
carrying out qualitative studies and operational research.
17.   Project Benefits. The rehabilitation of health services and the implementation of key
sector reforms would contribute to improving the overall quality of health services, while making
them more accessible to the poor at an affordable cost. The project is therefore expected to help
reduce mortality and morbidity rates in Burundi. In addition, the successful implementation of
the family planning policy and IEC activities would help Burundi reduce its population growth
rate and promote beneficial health behaviors among the population. The project would be
expected to have the following principal outcomes: (i) quality of health services in the project
area would be judged satisfactory by 60 percent of the beneficiaries surveyed at the end of the
project; (ii) management autonomy would have been introduced in all public hospitals, with
management systems and skills strengthened; (iii) overall sector financing would increase; (iv)
modern contraceptive prevalence would increase from 1.6% now to 10% by the year 2000; and
(v) IEC programs would contribute to more efficient use of services and greater health coverage.
18.   Risks. This is a project with above-average risk. The main risk relates to the country's
unstable political situation; to address this risk, the project has been designed in a flexible
manner, so that some components could be implemented even during a crisis and the project's
intended benefits could be safeguarded; for example, hospital rehabilitation, implementation of
MCHIFP and IEC activities, and strengthening of hospital management autonomy and service
quality could be implemented first in the safest provinces. However, implementation of some
sector reforms (particularly health financing and staff redeployment) could be delayed, since they
involve political decisions and actions that may not be feasible. In case of a continuous crisis,
the project would be restructured substantially as needed during the mid-term review. Other
risks relate to: (i) the population's response to MOPH's reforms; to address this risk, a
beneficiary assessment has been conducted and the results used during project preparation;
similar assessments and quality surveys would be carried out throughout project implementation;
(ii) the institutional weaknesses of MOPH; to address this risk, project support would include
strong capacity-building activities in areas where MOPH lacks expertise; project implementation
would be divided among a number of different directorates within MOPH, while PCT
procurement and financing functions would be strengthened; and the project conditions and
covenants would enable close monitoring of project implementation and development
performance; (iii) the weak human resource base, especially the lack of qualified health
personnel; to address this risk, the project would help MOPH reduce the overall deficiency of



- 6-
personnel, in terms of both quantity and quality; and (iv) insufficient MOPHfunding, which may
jeopardize improvement of health services, especially drug availability; to address this risk,
Government agreed at negotiations that its proposals for health sector investments and budgetary
allocations would be reviewed by IDA annually, and that the draft budget would incorporate
IDA's comments before its approval by the Council of Ministers.
19.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
(As of April 1995)
1.    The implementation of IDA's portfolio in Burundi has typically been above average for
the Africa region, despite deficiencies in the quality and timeliness of audits. Performance has
deteriorated since FY93 with the onset of the political crisis. The average portfolio rating was
1.94 in FY93 and 18.8% of projects were rated unsatisfactory in FY94. These problems were the
result of the breakdown of law and order in October 1993, and resulting disruptions in civil
service functioning and reduced Bank supervision (30% decline due to travel restrictions). In
spite of an increase in disbursements of 19% in 1994 (due to good performance of quick
disbursing components in the agricultural service project and private sector lines of credit), the
undisbursed share of the portfolio amounts to SDR125 million. In order to address this situation,
IDA has undertaken the restructuring of its portfolio taking into account capacity constraints and
focusing on reconstruction needs, strengthened financial management and increased contracting-
out to the private sector. Two projects are expected to be closed over the next two months (SAC
III and Water Supply Sector Project) and another seven are currently scheduled to close before
the end of the calendar year. The remaining 6 active projects have been strengthened and will
take over viable components of those projects that come to an end.
2     Existing problems with special accounts have been addressed and their management has
improved. In addition, the amounts on deposit in special accounts have been reduced to levels
commensurate with the actual pace of implementation. To help rebuild capacity at the local
level, IDA is reinforcing training of resident mission staff in standard procurement practices,
accounting and project and financial management.  The problem of timely provision of
counterpart funds has been addressed last fall with IDA's decision to finance on an exceptional
basis 100% of project costs net of taxes and duties.
