Specifically the project will: (i) strengthen the\n            Ministry of Public Health's capacity to design and\n            implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the efficiency\n            and affordability of health care delivery in rural areas;\n            (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal\n            and child mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial\n            health and family planning behaviors."}, "docdt": "1995-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
