The\n            EBRP Program is an integrated attempt at:  (a) dealing\n            simultaneously with the debt overhang of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs) and the portfolio problem in the banking\n            system; and (b) resolving the root cause of the SOE crisis,\n            i.e., the unclear structure of enterprise ownership and\n            governance.  In addition, the loan will also support a\n            comprehensive program to strengthen bank supervision, thus\n            allowing more rapid bank privatization."}, "docdt": "1993-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
