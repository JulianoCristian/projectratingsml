"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan in Poland. The project's key objectives\n            were to (i) improve the enterprise sector's\n            responsiveness and ongoing adaptation to market signals, and\n            to facilitate the exit of nonviable enterprises when unable\n            to respond or adapt; and (ii) raise the level and quality of\n            financial intermediation through better credit allocation\n            and enhanced commercial bank capacity to impart and enforce\n            financial discipline on banks' enterprise debtors.\n            Bank's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) importance of up-front\n            establishment of enabling legislation; (ii) importance of\n            donor coordination and responsible use of Technical\n            Assistance (TA) for successful implementation and\n            institution-building; and (iii) the importance of\n            institutional capacity for successful project monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1997-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
