to plan, manage,\n            and maintain the road infrastructure in a cost-effective\n            manner; (b) improve the cost-effectiveness of the\n            borrower's public sector investments; and (c) improve\n            road safety.  The project finances managerial and technical\n            strengthening of MOC(W), and part of an infrastructure\n            investment program designed to upgrade and bring back to a\n            condition of maintainability, and improve safety on, the\n            nation's road infrastructure.  Components to be\n            financed by the project include: (i) reorganization of\n            MOC(W), development and annual updating of the multi-year\n            road infrastructure investment program, development of\n            mechanisms to coordinate and expedite external funding\n            programs, development of an environmental impact assessment\n            process, technical assistance, training of staff, studies,\n            and equipment to facilitate subsector management; (ii)\n            design, construction, and supervision of selected civil\n            works including construction, rehabilitation and maintenance\n            of roads and drainage facilities, roadway geometric\n            improvements, and traffic and safety improvements; (iii)\n            measures to improve the management of MOC(W)'s\n            equipment fleet, including equipment, spare parts and tools,\n            and management systems; and (iv) technical assistance,\n            equipment, and other support  necessary to develop a\n            comprehensive road safety program."}, "docdt": "1990-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
