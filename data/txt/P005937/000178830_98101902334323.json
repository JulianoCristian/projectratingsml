The\n            continued Bank involvement in the Argentine energy sector\n            through the project will help improve sector organization,\n            management, tariff policies, and investment planning for\n            generation and transmission facilities. The Yacyreta\n            Hydroelectric Project consists of (a) 70 km of earth dam;\n            (b) a power house with 20 units each of 135 MW capacity to\n            be installed between 1986-90 and intake structures for 10\n            additional units; (c) an avigation lock; (d) fish passage\n            facilities; (e) irrigation intakes and Aguapey, Tacuary,\n            Caragueta and San Martin dikes to prevent flooding; (f)\n            ancillary works including housing for personnel during and\n            after construction; (g) relocation of infrastructure and\n            resettlement of a total of about 33,000 people on both banks\n            of the river; and (h) Argentine power sector studies on\n            transmission system and small hydroelectric plants. The\n            project will benefit the Argentine population at large by\n            supplying electricity for the continued economic development\n            of the country and provide substantial earnings for Paraguay\n            through royalty payments."}, "docdt": "1979-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
