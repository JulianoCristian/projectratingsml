achieved through completion of the following\n            works: widening of existing supply canal from the Danube\n            including extension of an existing floating pumping station,\n            construction of four low pumped storage dams on Mostistea\n            River; installation of eight fixed pumping stations and six\n            repumping stations for feeding the new irrigation systems;\n            surface drainage for 82,683 ha; tile drainage for 4,238 ha;\n            soil erosion control works to protect an area of 13,344 ha;\n            and equipment for maintenance and operation and for farming\n            operations. Calmatui: Drainage of 66,930 ha gross and\n            irrigation of about one third of this area would be\n            accomplished through the following works: extension of\n            existing floating pumping station; irrigation works to serve\n            23,980 ha gross; surface drainage works to serve 66,930 ha;\n            subsurface drainage works for 14,455 ha; reclamation of\n            saline soils covering 9,200 ha; and equipment for operation\n            and maintenance of irrigation and drainage works and for\n            farming operations."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
