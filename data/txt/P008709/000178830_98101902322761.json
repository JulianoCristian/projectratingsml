achieved through completion of the following\n            works: widening of existing supply canal from the Danube\n            including extension of an existing floating pumping station,\n            construction of four low pumped storage dams on Mostistea\n            River; installation of eight fixed pumping stations and six\n            repumping stations for feeding the new irrigation systems;\n            surface drainage for 82,683 ha; tile drainage for 4,238 ha;\n            soil erosion control works to protect an area of 13,344 ha;\n            and equipment for maintenance
