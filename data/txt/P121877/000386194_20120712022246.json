Tonga were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: sectoral\n            development policy operations can be quickly mobilized and\n            achieve good results in the context of strong reform\n            momentum. The Bank has the ability to respond quickly to\n            provide budget support when facilitated by strong government\n            ownership of a reform agenda. The government had a deep\n            commitment to a sector-specific reform agenda which formed a\n            ready foundation for the operation when the country needed\n            budget support. The Bank's engagement provided momentum\n            in the right direction at a time when the reform agenda\n            could have gone off-track due to multiple challenges then\n            facing the governments. Project level engagement can assist\n            in identifying key priorities to be supported through policy\n            operations. Close coordination and engagement with other\n            development partners in identification of policy priorities\n            is useful in sectors where the Bank has limited knowledge\n            and engagement. Both technical assistance and investment\n            support are more effective when there are real plans and\n            opportunities to put it into practice as in the case of the\n            development and implementation of the Tonga Energy Road Map\n            (TERM). In the case of a small country like Tonga there is a\n            real value and efficiency in packaging reforms in key\n            sectors like energy. Preparation and implementation\n            resources irrespective of the size of the country, the level\n            of effort of the Bank staff in development and\n            implementation of projects and policy operations is the\n            same. In the case of a country like Tonga, though the\n            country is small, the staff time and effort involved in the\n            operation is close to those in larger economies. When the\n            Bank implements these types of operations in Pacific\n            countries, there is a demonstration effect on other\n            neighboring countries and they also become interested in\n            having similar operations. Government commitment for a\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO) to be successful a\n            country's commitment is crucial and it will not work\n            just by exerting pressure by the Bank or other donors."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
