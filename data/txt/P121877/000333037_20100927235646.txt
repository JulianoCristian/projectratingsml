                 TN- ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION



Recipient                The Kingdom of TONGA
Implementing Agency      Ministry for Finance and Planning
Financing Data           IDA Grant
                         Terms:
                         Amount: SDR 3.4 million (US$5 million equivalent)
Operation Type           The proposed operation is a Development Policy Grant, which consists
                         of a single tranche SDR 3.4 million (US$5 million equivalent) to be
                         disbursed upon effectiveness date.
Main Policy Areas        Policy areas the proposed operation will support include: (i) Energy
                         Sector reform to reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price rise and
                         shocks; and (ii) Public financial management reform.
Key Outcome Indicators   The key outcome indicators over the medium term (5 years) to which the
                         proposed operation will contribute are; (i) Petroleum imports for
                         electricity generation relative to a "business as usual" scenario are
                         reduced by 15% in a cost-effective manner; (ii) Diversification of
                         sources of electricity generation to improve energy security and reduce
                         impact of oil price on the price of electricity supply; (iii) Petroleum
                         price risk management in place; (iv) Fiscal consolidation achieved
                         including reduction in risk of debt distress.
Program Development      Tonga faces a fiscal deficit resulting in large part from the knock-on
Objectives and           effects of the global economic slow-down. The development objectives
Contribution to CPS      of the proposed operation are to contribute to reducing Tonga`s fiscal
                         deficit and to support the Government`s efforts in implementing reforms
                         in the energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and stable
                         growth in the medium term.
                         The proposed operation directly supports two of the three themes of the
                         Tonga Country Assistance Strategy which will be presented to the Board
                         with this operation: (i) Supporting policy reform to strengthen growth
                         prospects and improve service delivery, and (ii) Building resilience
                         against shocks.
                         Implementation of the energy sector reforms set out in the Tonga Energy
                         Road Map will reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price shocks and
                         achieve an increase in quality access to modern energy services ­ both
                         necessary conditions to strengthen prospects for equitable growth and
                         improve service delivery. By highlighting the Tonga Energy Road Map,
                         this operation reinforces the importance of addressing energy sector

                                               i
                 weaknesses as a necessary condition for economic growth and stability.
                 The proposed operation would provide fast-disbursing budget support
                 aimed at shorter-term economic recovery. The operation is an integral
                 part of the Bank`s overall engagement in the energy sector. Following
                 the year-long dialog in preparing the TERM, this proposed operation
                 reinforces the importance of adhering to the objectives, principles and
                 strategy set out in the TERM. Progress on TERM implementation will
                 be further supported by the Tonga Energy Road Map Project currently
                 under preparation, an investment project which will strengthen the focus
                 and provide support to achieve the medium term energy sector
                 outcomes.
                 Any subsequent budget support operations would include a focus on
                 continued implementation of the energy sector reforms discussed in this
                 Program Document. The operation has also served as a vehicle to
                 strengthen the Bank`s dialog with the GoT in areas of public expenditure
                 and financial management. This DPO sets the stage for a more robust
                 engagement in PEFM going forward, particularly in the area of joint
                 public expenditure analysis which will be especially important as the
                 new Government works to rationalize expenditures while maintaining
                 and improving core service delivery functions in the medium term.
Risks and Risk   The main risks and their associated risk mitigations measures are the
Mitigation       following:
                     The need to address immediate budget shortfalls could distract the
                     new administration from focusing on the implementation of critical
                     energy sector reforms, as per the TERM, needed to support medium
                     term economic stability and growth. Budget pressures could also
                     result in insufficient resources being available for the GoT`s role in
                     implementation of the TERM. The mitigation measure is to
                     contribute, along with other development partners, to reducing the
                     budget gap through this proposed budget support operation.
                     A new, possibly inexperienced administration may take some time
                     to appreciate the importance of focusing on energy sector reforms.
                     This could result in a loss of momentum, or actions at odds with the
                     TERM, which could undermine the progress and credibility to date.
                     The risk will be mitigated to some extent by clear signaling, in this
                     document and as part of the preparation of the energy sector SIL
                     which will be appraised after the new administration takes office,
                     that progress on energy sector reform will be an important
                     component of the overall country dialog going forward, as well as a
                     pre-requisite for further support in the energy sector. A further
                     mitigation measure is the strong development partner coordination
                     around the development of the TERM and the commitment provide
                     support in line with implementation of the TERM. The benefits and
                     importance of maintain the focus on energy sector reforms and on
                     adhering to the principles set out in the TERM will be emphasized
                     not only by the Bank, but by a wide range of other development
                     partners.

                  Natural Disasters and Climate Change negatively impact the
                  expected benefits associated with implementation of the planned
                  energy sector reforms. Two approaches to mitigating this risk are
                  built into the TERM. First, design of new investments will routinely
                  take into account Tonga`s vulnerability to natural disasters and
                  specify equipment and designs accordingly. Second, one of the
                  Phase 0 activities of the TERM is Analysis of environmental
                  change impact on Tonga to identify any risks to long term safety and
                  security of energy infrastructure.            The findings and
                  recommendations of this study will inform subsequent
                  implementation of the TERM.
                  Progress on Public Financial Management reforms could stall if the
                  new administration focuses on other priorities. The primary
                  mitigation measure is the planned joint development partner efforts
                  to support the GoT in implementing improvements in the areas of
                  public expenditure and financial management. The Bank intends to
                  work closely with other development partners to provide the support
                  and emphasis necessary to maintain the GOT`s focus and capacity to
                  take action on PEFM reforms.

                                     I.     INTRODUCTION

1. The proposed Tonga Energy Development Policy Program will provide budget support to
reduce the near-term fiscal deficit. It will also reinforce the importance of implementation of
energy sector reforms necessary to reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks,
which otherwise would pose a significant risk to achieving stable growth in the medium term.

2. Like other Pacific Island nations, Tonga is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and to
external economic shocks because of its small size combined with a large distance from the
nearest large market. The knock-on effects of the global economic crisis, in particular in
remittances and tourism revenues, contributed to GDP contractions of 0.4 percent in FY2008/09
and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009/10. As the government recognized the extent to which
its tax revenues had been affected by the global economic crisis last year, it took emergency
measures to limit recurrent expenditures including imposing lower ceilings on the expenditures
in most ministries toward the end of FY2009/2010. It also sought budget support in the form of
grants from donors. While the outlook is for growth to recover in FY2010/2011 to around 1.5 to
2 percent, downside risks remain. Containing expenditure to the level set in the budget will be
challenging, even with greater attention to expenditure prioritization, given the emergency-nature
of the budget cuts already instituted in FY2009/10.

3. The budget support proposed under this operation would play an important role, in
conjunction with support from other donors, in reducing the projected financing gap in
FY2010/2011 from 7.8 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent of GDP. The proposed budget support
will allow the government the fiscal space to continue implementing key energy sector reforms
which are fundamental to securing medium-term economic growth and stability.


WHY THE ENERGY SECTOR IS IMPORTANT

4. Energy is a fundamental building block for Tonga in its social and economic development
and in enhancing the livelihoods of all Tongans. It affects all businesses and every household.
Accessible, affordable and sustainable electricity that is environmentally responsible and
commercially viable is a high priority. Tonga is highly dependent on imported fuels to meet its
overall energy requirements. In 2000 when the last energy balance for Tonga was compiled,
imported petroleum products accounted for about 75% of Tonga's total energy needs. Currently,
all grid-supplied electricity, which accounts for over 98% of electricity used in Tonga, is
generated using imported diesel fuel. Over 95% of Tongans are connected to grid-based supply
of electricity.

5. Tonga's total fuel imports account for about 25% of all imports and about 10% of GDP.
Hence changes in the price and amount of petroleum imports have a significant impact on
Tonga`s balance of payments situation and inflation. In particular, sudden price shocks can be
difficult to absorb. Automotive Diesel Oil, ADO (i.e. diesel) accounts for about two thirds of
petroleum imports; the rest is petrol and aviation fuel, with minimal LPG. About one third of
total petroleum imported is used for electricity generation.


                                                4
6. Oil prices over the last ten years illustrate the volatility to which the Tongan economy and
electricity consumers are exposed. Between 2001 and 2004, the average price of crude oil
increased from around US$25 per barrel to around US$40 per barrel - a 60% increase. This was
followed by a dramatic and continuous rise in crude oil prices between 2004 and 2008, where the
average annual price of crude rose from US$40 per barrel to a peak of around US$140 per barrel.
In late 2008 through 2009 crude oil prices fell to 2006 levels, with the average price in 2009
being around US$62 per barrel. Diesel prices tracked the price of crude oil.

7. The oil price spike of 2008 led to the highest electricity tariffs Tonga has ever seen, with
electricity prices peaking at over TOP1.00 per kWh (approximately 50USc/kWh). This had a
significant negative impact on economic activity and on the quality of life for all Tongans. The
experience highlighted the risk to Tongan electricity consumers and the economy as a whole of
the combination of 100% dependency on imported petroleum for grid-based electricity
generation together with essentially spot market pricing of all imported petroleum.

8. Scenarios for future petroleum price trends indicate that on average, the price is expected to
increase as the global financial situation normalizes. The history of international oil prices
demonstrates the high price volatility that characterizes this commodity. Acknowledging the
prospect of increasing and volatile petroleum prices, the Government recognized that the energy
sector as currently structured and operated represents a major risk to the economy overall, and to
the standard of living of individual Tongans. The Government determined that it must, as a
matter of priority, take measures to mitigate these risks. Without implementing reforms in the
energy sector, the economy will remain highly vulnerable to oil price rise and shocks. Reducing
this vulnerability is an important factor in securing stable economic growth in the medium term.


ACHIEVEMENT IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE WAY FORWARD

9. In 2008, GOT initiated electricity sector reform by creating an electricity sector regulator and
putting in place a Concession Agreement between the newly-created, state-owned Tonga Power
Limited (TPL) and the regulator designed to keep the sector financially viable. These initial
steps set the stage for a second round of reform needed to address the risk of Tonga`s high
dependence on imported petroleum combined with an absence of petroleum price risk
management.

10. In April 2009, the Government and Development Partners with the coordination of the
World Bank, embarked on a process to undertake a sector-wide review and develop an approach
to improving the performance of the energy sector and to mitigating the risks. The resulting
document entitled the Tonga Energy Road Map 2010-2020: Ten Year Road Map to Reduce
Tonga's Vulnerability to Oil Price shocks and Achieve an Increase in Quality Access to Modern
Energy Services in an Environmentally Sustainable Manner, or Tonga Energy Road Map
(TERM) addresses improvements in petroleum supply chain and consideration of price hedging
instruments, increased efficiency both in electricity supply and use, development of grid-
connected domestic renewable energy resources, improved access to quality electricity services
in remote areas, reduced environmental impacts both locally and globally, enhanced energy
security, and overall sector financial viability. The scope includes policy, legal, regulatory and
institutional aspects of the sector as well as investment. It covers a ten year time period. As

                                                5
technologies, costs, demand for electricity and sources of financing change over time, it is
envisioned that the TERM will be periodically updated to take these factors into account.

11. The TERM focuses on reducing cost and volatility in the price of petroleum imports and on
de-linking electricity production from petroleum to the extent feasible. A further set of actions
could focus around use of petroleum for transport applications. This was beyond the scope of
the TERM exercise, but work is already underway in this area and would complement the
TERM.

12. Development of the TERM involved unprecedented information-sharing by Government
Ministries and Tonga Power Limited (TPL), and set a new standard in the Pacific for
Government leadership and coordinated development partner support. The process has benefited
from the active participation of more than fifteen development partners, including multi- and bi-
lateral agencies and regional organizations responsible for energy in the Pacific, over the course
of one year. The TERM is important not only for the expected impact on the energy sector in
Tonga. It is already being cited as an example in other PIC energy sector discussions and is
expected to serve as a model for Government leadership and development partner coordination
of sector-wide planning applicable to infrastructure more broadly.

13. The TERM sets out priority actions in the areas of policy, legal, regulatory and institutional
arrangements, and sets out an investment program based on a least cost approach for reducing
reliance on diesel for power generation, with explicit consideration given to managing risk
through development of a portfolio of options to meet the demand for electricity. The TERM
also recommends a detailed program of actions with indicative funding sources and costs for
each element. The TERM will serve as the guiding document for Government and TPL actions
and development partner support.

14. GoT formally adopted the TERM in August 2010 and by doing so, committed to key
principles for the energy sector and an indicative implementation plan. The Bank plans to
provide on-going support to the GOT in implementation of the TERM in the form of the Tonga
Energy Road Map Project, an investment project currently under preparation which will
reinforce the focus on, and provide support to achieve the medium term energy sector outcomes
highlighted for this proposed operation. Other development partners are also working with GOT
preparing support for specific aspects of TERM implementation.


BUDGET SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO MEET FINANCING NEEDS AND MAINTAIN MOMENTUM IN
ENERGY SECTOR REFORM

15. Absent budget support from donors, Tonga is facing a fiscal deficit of around 7.8% of GDP
in FY2010/11, following an estimated 3.9% deficit in the previous year. A fiscal deficit situation
is expected to continue for the next two to three years. Further borrowing is constrained due to
debt sustainability concerns. Medium term measures include implementation of plans to
improve Public Expenditure and Financial Management and improve revenue forecasting.
Government of Tonga has sought support from the Bank and other development partners for
assistance to close the fiscal gap.


                                                6
16. At the same time, Tonga is preparing for a major political and constitutional transition from
a near-absolute monarchy under which the King appoints the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to a
constitutional monarchy where power is exercised by an elected Government. Elections for the
new government will take place in November 2010. As would be the case in any country
undertaking a significant political change, together with the expected benefits of the change there
is also a significant level of political uncertainty associated with the election process itself and
the performance of a new, possibly inexperienced administration.

17. The convergence of the fiscal deficit and the up-coming political transition poses a risk to
implementation of the reforms envisaged in the energy sector. If the fiscal gap is not addressed,
the budget pressures may lead to insufficient resources being available to support
implementation of the Energy Sector reforms. The need to address immediate budget shortfalls
could also distract the new administration from focusing on the implementation of critical
reforms needed to support medium term economic stability and growth, of which the energy
sector reform will be a key component.

18. The proposed program is designed to support the Government in implementation of energy
sector reform as per the TERM by (i) underscoring the importance of implementation of energy
sector reform; (ii) providing assistance in closing the near-term budget gap so that adequate
funds will be available to move forward with implementation of the TERM and the new
government is not unduly preoccupied in addressing a large financing gap; (iii) encouraging key
steps in PFM reform so that the resources provided under this program are used as effectively as
possible, and the momentum of wider public expenditure and financial management reforms is
maintained in the medium term.


                                   II. COUNTRY CONTEXT


RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

19. Tonga is a small and remote island economy, consisting of 176 islands with a total area of
748 km2, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 700,000 km2 and a total population of
102,000 spread across 36 inhabited islands. There are four groups of islands (Tongatapu,
Ha`apai, Vava`u and Niuas). The capital, Nuku`alofa, is located on the largest island, Tongatapu.
Seventy-one percent of the population lives on Tongatapu.

20. In 2009, per capita income in Tonga was approximately USD 3,250. Over the past 15 years,
per capita income has grown modestly, with average real annual growth of around 1.9 percent
exceeding population growth of about 0.5 percent. Economic activity has exhibited significant
fluctuations as underlying structural constraints, political disturbances, and global economic
developments have adversely affected growth. Following the civil service strike in 2005 and civil
disturbances at the end of 2006, the economy recovered strongly in FY2007/08. But growth has
subsequently slowed sharply, initially due in large part to the food and fuel price shocks and
more recently as a result of the global slowdown, which, as discussed further below, has hurt
remittance flows, tourism arrivals and exports.


                                                 7
21. While external factors have resulted in economic contractions in Tonga over the past two
years, the country remains one the best performers among World Bank members in the Pacific in
terms of making progress toward the MDGs. Extreme poverty is almost non-existent, and Tonga
is on track to meet goals to significantly reduce maternal and child mortality, and achieve
universal primary education with no disparities between boys and girls. Only on broader
measures of empowering women is Tonga not largely on track to meet MDG goals.

22. The Tongan Government has also undertaken significant reforms over the past few years.
Most notable has been the constitutional reform that will see substantial power transferred from
the King to Parliament. Although constitutional reform has to some extent dominated the agenda
and the government`s recent priorities, on the economic front Tonga did undertake extensive
structural reform as part of its successful bid to join the WTO in 2007. While a significant
outstanding structural reform agenda remains, Tonga is the highest ranked Pacific island member
country in terms of Doing Business (with a ranking of 52, Tonga is in the top third of all
countries). Similarly, an Australian-led Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment (PEFA) completed in early 2010 found real improvements in overall public financial
management systems since the 2007 PEFA, although a significant reform agenda remains. This
is discussed further in paragraphs 44 - 49. Reflecting reforms, the World Bank`s CPIA rating for
Tonga has been increased from 3.0 to 3.5 over the past 3 years; with Tonga`s policy performance
now above average.

23. Tonga is highly vulnerable to external economic shocks and natural disasters. Small size
combined with a large distance from the nearest large market means that the country is unable to
exploit economies of scale in production. A narrow resource base and a small market result in a
production structure that is highly undiversified. Remittances account for a large share of the
GDP. Size and remoteness also have an impact on the cost of key imports such as petroleum,
exacerbating the risk to the economy from external shocks. All these vulnerabilities have come
into play in the last two years, taking a heavy toll on Tonga`s economy. Table 1 highlights recent
trends in key economic indicators.

24. The knock-on effects of the global economic crisis resulted in GDP contractions of 0.4
percent in FY2008/09 and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009/10 (IMF estimate). GDP growth
in Tonga has not exceeded 2 percent in any of the last five years. Domestic political disturbances
in 2006 caused widespread damage in the capital, and GDP contracted by 1.2 percent in
FY2006/07. The economy rebounded to grow by 2 percent the following year, leading up to the
coronation of the new King in August 2008. However, Tonga was unable to build on this
upswing as it was adversely impacted by the global economic crisis. In addition, the country was
buffeted by two natural disasters, a tsunami on September 29, 2009 causing loss of life and
significant material damage, and then a cyclone in February 2010.

25. The main impact of the GEC was on remittances which, on average, are the equivalent of 67
percent of imports and 30 percent of GDP. As a result of the economic slowdown in the key
remittance-sending countries of the US, NZ and Australia, remittances are projected to fall by 18
percent in FY2009/10 compared with the previous year. This substantial decline comes on top of
a 12.5 percent fall in remittances in FY2008/09. Tourist receipts are projected to fall by 15
percent in FY2009/10 compared with the previous year, following a decline of 5.6 percent in

                                                8
FY2008/09. The latest data indicate a 13 percent fall in the value of exports year on year, to
February 2010.

26. As a consequence the current account deficit is projected to widen to 17.4 percent of GDP in
FY2009/10 compared with 14.3 percent in the previous year. However the trade deficit is
projected to narrow to a 37¼ percent of GDP due to a projected decline in imports of 11 percent.
The increase in the current account deficit is thus a result of the sharp decline in remittances.
International reserves are estimated to have risen from USD 68 million in FY2008/09 to USD 71
million (5.3 months of imports) in FY2009/10 largely as a result of one-off factors, including the
recent allocation of SDRs by the IMF and the disbursement of donor grants.

27. Inflation, following the trend of international oil and food prices, reached 12 percent in mid-
2008 but fell to 1.2 percent by end 2009. Inflation is however expected to pick up to around 4
percent in 2010 with the strengthening of commodity prices and a pick-up in domestic demand.
Food accounts for 44 percent of the consumer price index (two-thirds of it imported), transport
accounts for 14 percent and domestic fuel and power for 12 percent. The food price shock of
2007-08 is estimated to have hurt most severely the urban poor, who have little land and must
pay cash for food. Rural populations and those on the outer islands relying more on subsistence
farming, are more likely to have been able to switch towards traditional root crops for their staple
diet.

28. In the year to April 2010, credit growth was ­14.6 percent, due largely to highly risk-averse
behavior by the two major commercial banks. Reflecting in part the impact of slowing growth
and remittances and also inadequate risk management in the banks during a lending surge in
2008, bad debts began to build from mid-2008. The non-performing loan ratio stood at 20
percent in mid 2009 compared with 5 percent at end 2007. The ratio of non-performing loans has
now begun to fall, and is currently below 18 percent.

29. During FY2009/10 the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) eased its monetary policy
stance. It lowered reserve requirements (from 10 percent to 5 percent), reduced the interest rate
on its repo facility (from 10 percent to 4½ percent), and stopped issuing central bank bills.
However the impact of this monetary easing on the real economy was more than offset by the
unwillingness of commercial banks to lend. Nevertheless, provisioning against bad loans has
risen ahead of write offs and profitability is expected to resume next year.


REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE TRENDS

30. In the last two years, the global downturn has pushed government finances into deficit. The
deficit was 3.3 percent of GDP in FY2008/09, and is expected to increase to 3.9 percent of GDP
in FY2009/10. In both years, tax revenues were significantly lower than they were previously, as
is evident from comparisons with the three-year averages for FY2005/06­FY2007/08 (see Table
2). As the government has recognized the extent to which its tax revenues have been affected by
the global economic crisis, it has taken steps to limit recurrent expenditures. It has also sought
budget support in the form of grants from donors.

31. The fall-off in tax revenues experienced in FY2008/09 and FY2009/10 was led by
consumption, import tariffs and excise taxes. These key sources of tax revenue all depend
primarily on the value of imports ­ not only tariffs but also excises fall exclusively on imported
products, and approximately three-quarters of consumption tax receipts come from imported
products. The sharp decline in remittances and the contraction of the economy occurring in
FY2008/09 and FY2009/10 translated directly into a decline in the value of imports in USD
terms. Simultaneously, new tariff and excise regimes were implemented just prior to FY2008/09,
completing tax reforms begun in FY2004/05 in anticipation of Tonga`s accession to the WTO
and involving significant tariff liberalization. Overall, the tax reform package was designed to be
revenue neutral, as reliance on border taxation was reduced in favor of general consumption

                                                11
taxation, but within that calculation of revenue neutrality was an expectation that lower tax rates
under the reformed regime would yield increases in transaction volumes, which did not
materialize in the context of the global downturn.1

32. It is difficult to distinguish the contribution of changes in the value of imports and changes
in the import tax regime to the lower revenues Tonga experienced in FY2008/09 and FY2009/10.
Income and profits taxes, which lag economic activity, declined sharply in FY2009/10, after their
peak in FY2008/09. Leading this fall was the decline in profitability ­ or, in the case of the major
commercial banks, the losses ­ of a handful of large enterprises that normally provide around
half of income and profits tax revenue.

33. During FY2009/10, the government recognized that tax revenues were coming through
significantly below budget forecasts, and took steps to reduce spending and address the financing
gap. This delayed recognition of the impact of the GEC on tax revenues was due to several
factors. First, while the government expected the GEC to impact fiscal revenues, it found it
difficult to forecast its intensity and depth. Secondly, while current tax revenues were
significantly affected in FY2008/09, the government received a substantial payment of arrears,
which provided a degree of comfort. (Including arrears, the government actually experienced
higher revenues in FY2008/09 than in FY2009/10.) Thirdly, the task of recognizing the impact of
the GEC on tax revenues as it rapidly unfolded was made more complicated by lags in the
availability of data in real time. In addition to taking steps to reduce expenditure in FY2009/10
(see Box 1),2 the government sought budget support in the form of grants from donors, in
response to which the ADB provided some 9.7 million pa`anga ­ reducing the deficit from 5.3 to
3.9 percent of GDP.

34. On the expenditure side, Tonga is still tackling the implications for the civil service wage
bill of the prolonged strike in late 2005. The strike resulted in a settlement whereby civil service
wages increased 60-70 percent over FY2005/06 and FY2006/07. In response, the government
introduced a large voluntary redundancy program which was taken up by some 800­1,000 civil
servants (about a quarter of the total), and sought to find other economies in overtime,
maintenance, subsidies and capital expenditures. These measures mitigated some of the impact
of the wage settlement (by FY2007/08, both the wage bill and total expenditure were around 40
percent higher than before the wage settlement), but at the cost of losing key skilled and
experienced staff. In FY2009/10, civil servants received a further 10 percent wage increase ­ the
first since the earlier settlement. This increase is viewed as an integral part of the ongoing reform
of the public sector that aims to contain the wage bill through reducing the size of the public
service, while improving performance through recognizing merit and flattening the grade
1
  The introduction of the consumption tax and other tax reforms in April 2005 resulted in an increase in tax revenue
of some 35 million pa`anga or 6 percent of GDP in FY2005/06. The decreases in tariffs and increases in excises that
were to accompany these changes were expected to be phased in during FY2005/06 and FY2006/07, but this did not
in fact occur until late in FY2007/08 (making FY2008/09 the first full year under the fully reformed tax regime).
2
  The figures for total expenditure and net lending in the government`s budget papers differ from those produced by
the IMF for FY2009/10, because the government`s figures exclude capital expenditures proceeding from China`s
Exim Bank loans but which are not disbursed through the government budget, as well as the on-lending of funds
from the first Exim Bank loan to the private sector. Taking account of these amounts, the IMF projects total
expenditure and net lending in FY2009/10 to be some 10 percent higher than the previous year. (Note that
government`s budget papers do include donor expenditures that are disbursed through the government budget.)

structure. The current package, which is supported by the workforce, includes linking annual
salary increments to merit (not seniority), reducing leave entitlements and abolishing vacancies.

35. In the FY2010/11 budget, the government has adopted realistic revenue forecasts and has
extended its recent efforts to rationalize expenditure. On the revenue side, tax receipts are
projected to remain relatively flat, in line with the economic conditions likely to prevail in Tonga
in the coming year. Revenue forecasting has been assisted by recent reforms to revenue and
customs software, which have enabled finance officials to access much more timely data when
formulating the budget. These reforms mean that finance officials are also able to assess actual
revenue flows against forecasts in a timely manner, throughout the year. On the expenditure side,
the government has sought to adopt a more considered approach to expenditure rationalization
than was possible when making emergency budget cuts in the latter part of the previous fiscal
year (see Box 1). Notably, wage and salary expenditure is set to remain constant, in real terms.
However, once off-budget capital expenditure and lending activities relating to China`s Exim
Bank loans are included, total expenditure and net lending is projected to rise by nearly 25
percent in FY2010/11 on the previous year (see the discussion below about debt sustainability).

                            Box 1: Expenditure Rationalization in Tonga

   The government`s expenditure rationalization is designed around the government-funded
   budget`, a data format that differs from that used by the IMF. The government-funded budget`
   includes all current and capital expenditure that is funded by government revenue and budget
   support grants. (The government-funded budget` does not include donor-funded or China`s
   EXIM loans-funded project expenditures).

   In FY2009/10, when the government recognized that tax revenues were coming through
   significantly below budget forecasts, it imposed new, lower ceilings on the expenditures of most
   ministries. It is estimated that an overall expenditure cut of some 11½ percent was achieved as a
   result (measured against the expenditure that was forecast to occur if spending patterns in the first
   half of FY2009/10 were repeated in the second half of FY2009/10). The health and education
   budgets were protected from the sharp cuts imposed on all other areas, with their respective
   ministries asked to reduce their expenditure by about 2½ percent each. The preliminary outturn
   shows that health expenditures were reduced by around 2½ percent ­without cutting programs ­
   through efficiency improvements achieved in the course of ongoing reform initiatives, while
   education expenditures were maintained at least at the level of the original budget allocation.

   In advance of the FY2010/11 budget, Tonga`s Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) consulted
   with individual ministries to delineate essential and non-essential activities, and to prioritize the
   former in their programs and budgets for FY2010/11. The objective was to adopt a more
   considered approach to expenditure rationalization than was possible when making emergency
   budget cuts in the latter part of the previous fiscal year. Overall, the FY2010/11 government
   budget limits expenditure to a level 2.7 percent above the previous year in nominal terms ­ which
   represents a decline of 1.5 percent in real terms. As in FY2009/10, the health and education
   budgets are to be protected from the more stringent rationalization measures imposed on other
   areas.


36. Containing expenditure to the level set in the budget will be challenging, even with greater
attention to expenditure prioritization under the leadership of the ERC, given the emergency-

                                                    13
nature of the budget cuts already instituted in FY2009/10. As the government seeks to continue
to contain its expenditure, measures to improve the quality of expenditure and of the resultant
service provision will be essential. The level of expenditure set in the budget considerably
exceeds government revenue and identified grants, making further financing necessary. It will be
important for this financing to be available on grant or highly concessional terms, given Tonga`s
already high debt burden, discussed further below. The budget support proposed under this
operation would play an important role, in conjunction with other donors, in reducing the
projected financing gap from 7.8 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent of GDP (see Table 3).3

projects proceeds as planned, with the government being able to ensure an adequate contribution
from domestically available inputs, mainly labor. The recovery also crucially depends on a pick-
up in remittances and tourism revenues. In addition, it assumes a resumption of commercial bank
lending. However, global recovery is not assured and weak economic performance in key partner
countries would preclude the needed reversal in remittance and tourism receipts. In addition,
risks could arise from delayed fiscal consolidation, especially if the provision of donor grants
falls short. Key indicators of the medium-term macroeconomic outlook are presented in Table 4.

38. Reconstruction loans have caused a sharp increase in debt levels and Tonga is judged to be
at a high risk of debt distress on the basis of a joint IMF-Bank DSA. Tonga`s total public sector
debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt) is high and rose substantially in FY2008/09 and
FY2009/10, reaching over 50 percent of GDP. This increase reflects the contracting of two loans
from China`s Exim Bank for reconstruction--together with face values totaling over 30 percent
of GDP--as well as the impact of the weaker external environment on both GDP and the fiscal
balance. The loan commitments were signed in November 2007 (for reconstruction of the central
business district) and February 2009 (for roads), and bear a 2 percent interest rate, a 5-year grace
period, and a 20-year maturity. Work under the first reconstruction loan was initially postponed,
as the government sought to ensure it was used productively and negotiated for a greater use of
local inputs. The first drawdown was made in April 2009, with over half the amount projected to
be disbursed by end-June 2010. Currently, it is believed only 30 percent of the funds from this
loan will be used to finance direct government capital spending, with the remaining 70 percent of
funds expected to be on-lent to the private sector for office, residential, and retail construction.
The second loan agreement was signed in February 2010, and the first disbursement (30 percent)
occurred shortly after the signing.

39. Despite the rise in overall debt, the government has continued to reduce its domestic debt
level. Domestic debt has fallen from around 20 percent of GDP at the beginning of the decade to
around a projected 7¼ percent of GDP by June 2010. Outstanding bank loans were repaid in
2007/08. This fiscal year, the government issued bonds amounting to a net issuance of 8 million
pa`anga to partly cover the deficit, leaving outstanding bonds at an expected 4¼ percent of GDP
                                                   15
by end-June. The remaining domestic debt reflects mainly government guarantees and
obligations to the Retirement Fund Board.

40. The DSA assumes that near-term GDP growth will recover to rates close to its historical
average. Although the current reconstruction will likely lift growth in the short-term, the DSA
conservatively assumes little increase in long-term growth despite the current large infrastructure
investment. The reconstruction and road infrastructure projects are assumed to take place over
the period until FY2014/15, although they will be drawn down over the period through
FY2012/13. Excluding reconstruction and road spending, public spending will be set to grow
more slowly than projected revenues and grants over the medium term, limiting the longer-term
need for additional external borrowing. Remittances are assumed in the medium- and longer-
term to remain an important external cushion.

41. Under the baseline scenario of the DSA, the external debt trajectory breaches several policy
dependent thresholds in FY2009/10 before receding to safer levels. Public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt is currently over 30 percent of GDP, the indicative threshold
level (Table 5). Given the drawdown of the Exim Bank loans the present value (PV) of PPG
external debt is projected to increase to about 42 percent of GDP by FY2011/12, before falling
below the threshold in FY2017/18, and declining further to around 8 percent of GDP by 2030.

         10 percent rule-of-thumb.


42. External debt remains well above the PV of debt-to-export distress threshold, but
remittances provide a cushion. Reflecting Tonga`s low exports, the PV of PPG external debt-to-
exports ratio is well over two times the indicative threshold of 100 percent, and is projected to
remain above the threshold well past 2020. However, Tonga`s large remittances would help to
reduce liquidity risks. Remittances have averaged more than twice export receipts over the past
decade, and have provided a considerably more stable source of foreign exchange inflows. When
the PV of PPG debt is considered relative to the sum of remittances and exports it remains above
the threshold only until FY2013/14, i.e., the threshold is breached for a shorter period. The PV of
debt is expected to decline below the revenue threshold by 2014. Debt and debt service are also

                                                                 16
expected to stay above the exports threshold for most of the projection period, though not when
remittances are accounted for.

43. The macroeconomic policy framework discussed and agreed to with the government at the
time the DSA was conducted, is adequate for the purposes of this operation, but subject to
uncertainty. This judgment is subject to two important assumptions. First, it requires the
government to make a modest adjustment to current expenditure and an improvement in revenue
effort in the near term. Secondly, given the high risk of debt distress, the adequacy of the
macroeconomic policy framework depends on the continued availability of grants to finance
fiscal deficits in the near term. This medium-term macroeconomic framework also underlies the
DSA, which projects a return to primary surpluses of just under 1 percent of GDP from
FY2015/16. The uncertainty associated with Tonga`s macroeconomic framework is due to the
difficulty in predicting the timing of Tonga`s recovery from the impact of the global recession,
which in turn stems from uncertainty over the speed and strength of the global recovery.


REFORMS IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Financial Management

44. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment was first undertaken
in Tonga in 2007 and a follow-up PEFA assessment was completed in May 2010. The PEFA
framework is a commonly used diagnostic tool to develop a benchmark of the quality of public
financial management (PFM) systems and processes in a country, and use that baseline data to
monitor progress over time. This most recent assessment was undertaken as a joint exercise by
the Government of Tonga and development partners including two experts engaged by AusAID
and the ADB/World Bank Focal Point in Tonga.

45. The report from the March 2010 PEFA provides an overview of the current performance as
well as an indication of areas of strength and weakness. The Public Financial Management legal
and regulatory framework in Tonga provides a solid basis for budgeting, spending and
accountability. The overall impression of the assessment team is that there are clear rules and
procedures in place and these tend to be followed. Based on the ratings for the standard PEFA
performance indicators, about two-thirds of Tonga`s PFM system is performing at or above
average levels compared to international best practice, and measured against six core PFM
indicators6, most parts of the system work reasonably well.

46. The PEFA assessment consists of 31 indicators, of which three relate to donor practices.
Tonga`s 2010 performance in the five main groups of the 28 country-related PEFA indicators is
described below:




6
 The six core indicators are (i) credibility of budget, (ii) comprehensiveness and transparency, (iii) policy-based
budgeting, (iv) predictability and control in budget execution, (v) external scrutiny and audit, (vi) donor practices.=

                                                          17
        Credibility of the budget: Although aggregate revenue and expenditure outturns have
        broadly matched budget plans over the three years FY2006/07­FY2008/09,7 there is
        significant variation in the composition of the expenditure outturn at the agency level.
        This transfer of resources between agencies within the year is not achieved through a
        formal supplementary budget process, but instead through use of the Contingency Fund,
        and this is a weakness of the system.

        Comprehensiveness and transparency: The comprehensiveness of budget documents for
        government agencies has improved, but further improvements, such as the inclusion of
        balance sheets and an assessment of financial risks, should be made for public
        enterprises. The failure to make individual audits of government agencies publicly
        available negatively impacts transparency.

        Policy based budgeting: A significant PFM improvement since the 2007 PEFA is the
        introduction of a limited form of multi-year budgeting. The positive impact of this reform
        will be strengthened if the government builds capacity within line agencies to accurately
        cost their sector strategies and corporate plans on a multi-year basis. If these costs are
        captured in the forward estimates, the credibility of the multi-year budget will be
        improved. Additionally, the publication of forward estimates will enhance transparency
        and accountability.

        Predictability and control in budget execution: Significant improvements in revenue
        administration have occurred since the 2007 PEFA assessment, including more publicly
        available information on taxation policy and rulings, the introduction of a tax appeals
        mechanism, and improved management of arrears. Internal audit has improved, but the
        lack of focus on systemic issues, and of publication of audit results, are two areas that
        require attention.

        External scrutiny and audit: The Audit Office has acted as both the internal and external
        auditor for government agencies, and there are significant delays in tabling and approving
        audit reports by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly receives a summary
        of audit activities, instead of being able to scrutinize the actual audit reports, limiting
        their oversight function.

47. Two areas for further reform are highlighted in the PEFA: (i) accountability and
transparency relating to both internal and external audit and (ii) formal adoption and
implementation of the Treasury Instructions.

48. Audit: One aspect of PFM that drew significant attention from the 2010 PEFA assessment
team was the lack of accountability and transparency relating to both internal and external audit.
The government has already taken steps to improve this key area of PFM, with introduction of

7
  With respect to the aggregate revenue outturn, the PEFA team`s assessment did not encompass FY2009/10, for
which the outturn was not available (the IMF estimate is for actual recurrent revenue to be 77 percent of forecast
recurrent revenue). For FY2008/09, the PEFA team appears to have used government revenue figures and thereby
the classification of funds made by government; using IMF figures and classifications, actual recurrent revenue was
only 66 percent of forecast revenue, as opposed to the 88 percent calculated by the PEFA team.

                                                        18
the Public Audit Act 2007 (effective February 2008), which provides greater independence of the
Audit Office, and by establishing an internal audit unit within the Ministry of Finance and
National Planning. It is expected that the internal audit unit will be able to focus attention on the
consideration of systemic issues undermining the quality of the PFM system, and that the Audit
Office will become Tonga`s Supreme Audit Institution. In addition to the responsibility for the
audit of all ministries and government agencies, the Auditor General is now also mandated to
undertake an audit program to review and approve the audited financial statements of all public
enterprises audited by private audit firms. The AG is also mandated to conduct performance
audit i.e. to review whether the resources are employed and managed with economy, efficiency
and effectiveness, and there has been no waste or extravagance. Before this Act came into being
there was no mandate for performance audit.

49. In addition to these legislative and institutional arrangements to support the audit function, it
is crucial that the outcomes of the audits, and the responses by management to any issues raised,
are made publicly available. Currently, agencies receive an internal audit report and management
letter, but do not make these documents, or any management response, publicly available. The
Audit Office`s Annual Report contains only a short (approximately half page) summary of key
audit findings for each agency, and does not contain useful details or the management response.
Without publication of the audit reports or management responses, it is not possible to accurately
determine what action, if any, is being taken to address audit recommendations. Increased
information availability is an important step to increase the value of the audit function.

50. Treasury Instructions: The 2010 PEFA report noted a number of areas of PFM that were
expected to be improved with the formal adoption of the draft Treasury Instructions. These
instructions codify the administrative rules that have been developed by the MoF for
implementing the Public Finance Management Act 2002, and their formal adoption will make
them legally binding. The Treasury Instructions will formalize the required procedures for a
number of key PFM processes, establishing, among other things:

       The requirement that the corporate plans and annual management plans of government
       authorities be submitted as part of the preparation process for the budget each year,
       together with the required content of all corporate plans (including the roles and
       responsibilities of the authority, how these contribute to government policy objectives as
       laid out in the NSPF, and the targets and measurement indicators for their outputs);

       A set of procurement instructions aligned with the draft Public Procurement Regulations;

       Rules governing changes to the personnel database and payroll;

       Controls and processes in respect of expenditure commitments, including the recording
       and reporting of payment arrears;

       Controls and processes in respect of receivables, including the requirement that all non-
       tax revenue be banked within 24 hours of receipt;

       Processes for handling virements; and

                                                 19
        Rules governing the use of the Contingency Fund.

Public Sector Procurement

51. An Operational Procurement Review (OPR) was carried out for Tonga in May-June 2003
and the OPR was issued by the Bank on June 30, 2003. The OPR identified that Tonga lacked a
legal framework governing public procurement, and noted the absence of any formal
procurement policies and guidelines. The Government of Tonga showed keen interest to pursue
reforms related to public procurement. As a follow up, the Bank provided an IDF grant to
support the implementation of public procurement reforms and capacity building. The technical
assistance supported preparation of a legal framework for public procurement; draft regulations
and procurement manual, along with standard procurement documents; and development of the
capacity of Government officials in managing public procurement. It was envisaged that with
these actions there would be significant efficiency gains in processing public procurement, and
more transparency in the award of contracts.

52. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, the preparation of the legal and regulatory
framework, procurement manuals and standard procurement documents involved the active
participation of line agencies and consultation with development partners. Following in
principle approval by Cabinet8, the draft Public Procurement Regulations were submitted to the
Law Committee in July 2010, together with the comments provided by the Bank and ADB. The
primary function of the Law Committee is to assess whether the proposed regulations are
consistent with the existing legal and regulatory framework and standards, before the final
regulations are submitted to Cabinet for approval and thereafter to Privy Council. As such,
submission to the Law Committee is a clear indication that the Government intends to pursue the
substance of the regulations. Approval of the regulations for public procurement by Privy
Council is a prior action for the second tranche of the ADB Economic Support Program.

53. The Bank has reviewed and provided comments on the draft Public Procurement
Regulations. It does not appear that there is any appreciable distance between ADB and the
Bank on the draft regulations. Overall the Bank comments were relatively minor, with only one
point of significant interest: for purposes of legal certainty, the Bank suggests a clarification on
Article 29, which seems ambiguous on the grounds for exclusion of foreign bidders. The
recommendation is that the grounds for excluding foreign bidders, if any, should be specified in
the law. Once cleared by the Law Committee, these will be submitted to Cabinet. A
procurement manual is in draft but requires modification to simplify the procedures.




8
  As per normal procedure, the draft regulations were reviewed by Cabinet to determine whether the substance of the
draft regulations reflects the approach the GoT intends to pursue. Cabinet then issued a decision to submit the draft
regulations to the Law Committee. By issuing this decision, Cabinet is effectively endorsing the substance of the
draft regulations. The primary function of the Law Committee is to assess whether the proposed regulations are
consistent with the existing legal and regulatory framework and standards, before the regulations are submitted to
Cabinet for final approval. As such, submission to the Law Committee is a clear indication that the Government
intends to pursue the substance of the regulations.

                                                         20
54. At a donor meeting in April 2010, the government saw merit in conducting a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) jointly with the donors in order to increase the efficiency with which
public resources are deployed. The Bank has offered to join this effort, and will discuss with
government and development partners on its potential contribution to the PER process. The Bank
stands ready to strengthen the dialog with the incoming administration on PEFM more generally
and anticipates building the engagement in these areas, should there be interest from the new
government in further assistance. It is anticipated that the increased engagement would form the
basis for a component of any subsequent DPO.


                          III. THE TONGA ENERGY ROAD MAP

55. Tonga`s development strategy aims to improve the living standards and quality of life of all
Tongans. The current articulation of Tonga`s development strategy is the National Strategic
Planning Framework (NSPF), whose vision statement, objectives and enabling themes were
approved by Cabinet in February 2009. Relative to Tonga`s previous development strategies, the
NSPF takes a longer-term view of national development, framed in a 5-10 year time horizon. It
emphasizes the need to build a foundation for sustainable and lasting economic growth. To this
end, the NSPF takes a more strategic approach, focusing on the key determinants of economic
and social development in Tonga.

56. Maintaining and developing infrastructure to improve the everyday lives of the people of
Tonga is among the primary outcome objectives of the NSPF. The NSPF explicitly recognizes
that high-quality infrastructure underpins the competitiveness of enterprises and is a pre-requisite
for a thriving and successful economy. Under this objective, the government is committed to
strengthening and modernizing Tonga`s infrastructure in order to reduce business costs and
facilitate access to markets.


OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR

Petroleum

57. Petroleum Supply. Petroleum is supplied to Tonga by two international oil companies, BP
and TOTAL, and a locally owned company, Uata Shipping, which supplies the Ha`apai group of
islands. Both BP and TOTAL have onshore storage and distribution facilities on Tongatapu,
while BP also owns the storage facilities on Vava'u. TOTAL bought Shell`s assets in 2006 when
Shell decided to exit the storage and distribution of fuel in Tonga and other South Pacific
countries.

58. The bulk storage and distribution facilities on Ha`apai are owned by a local Tongan
businessman. The Government of Tonga`s own fuel storage facilities on Vava`u, which were
leased to Shell, fell into disrepair and are now closed. BP and TOTAL are active in the
Tongatapu ground product market (ADO, kerosene and gasoline), and BP is the sole supplier of
aviation fuels across Tonga. LPG is bulk supplied by Tonga Gas, (a subsidiary of Fiji Gas, 51%
owned by Origin Energy, Australia), and marketed and distributed onshore by the GOT`s
Homegas Company.

                                                21
59. Like other small Pacific Island countries, Tonga faces a long supply chain from the refinery
source. Products are shipped from refineries in Singapore (or sometimes Australia) to bulk
storage in Fiji via medium range (MR) tankers, based on TOTAL and BP's regional supply
schedules, and then trans-shipped to Tongatapu and Vava'u in local coastal tankers (LCT). Thus,
landed costs of product in Tonga have a relatively high freight component.

60. The outer islands are supplied with products trans-shipped through Nuku`alofa. The Niua's
and 'Eua islands are normally the only areas for which main products (gasoline, ADO, and
kerosene) are supplied by drum. Drum distribution is more expensive than bulk distribution and
costs are compounded by the fuel losses through evaporation, leakage and drum decanting which
contribute up to 15% of total drum content.

61. Price regulation. The Competent Authority is empowered to regulate petroleum prices
under Section 5 of the Price and Wage Control Act 1988. The Tonga Competent Authority
regulates the retail price of petroleum products, using a pricing template originally developed by
the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. The pricing template builds up the retail prices by taking
the Singapore price for fuel, then adding on shipping and storage fees and wholesale and retail
markups. In effect, the average price for the next month is determined by fuel prices, shipping
rates and margins two months prior.

62. The pricing philosophy seeks to build petroleum prices for Tonga that reflect the actual costs
of buying fuels on the international market and the various costs of delivering that fuel to Tonga
and then distributing it across the country. This petroleum pricing approach is exactly the same
as the import parity pricing`, which is used in Australia and New Zealand, and is common
across the petroleum industry.

63. The pricing methodology is subject to annual, triennial and ad-hoc reviews. Every year the
pricing template is supposed to be reviewed, using a consultation process with the oil companies
and other interested parties. However, there was no annual review in 2008. The 2009 annual
review, completed in June 2009, was the first since May 2007.9 The 2009 review resulted in
number of significant adjustments to some of the parameters used to build up fuel prices.
Triennial reviews assess regional freight rate differentials, and the overall incentives for
continued investment in petroleum supply, storage and distribution. Ad-hoc reviews of the
pricing templates may be required to deal with issues such as changes in Duties, Taxes, or
Wharfage costs.

64. Wholesale and retail fuel prices across Tonga vary, reflecting the higher transport costs to
provinces distant from the main island, Tongatapu. However, in each province, a single price is
set regardless of supplier. Retailers have a 7% mark-up on the wholesale price. The wholesale
price incorporates a 15% return on investment for the oil companies. Retailers have expressed
concern to the Competent Authority about the adequacy of the 7% retail margin.

65. Safety regulation. Both BP and TOTAL state that they operate under international standards

(TCA) & Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, TCA, Nuku`alofa, June 2009.

for petroleum handling and storage and that their insurance companies require annual
independent safety audits of their facilities and safety processes. Both companies claim that
international standards are more stringent and specific than the very general safety requirements
set out in Tonga`s Petroleum Act. The model for ensuring compliance with safety standards
appears to be one of self-enforcement by the oil companies, under the oversight of
internationally accredited and independent auditors.


Electricity

Grid-connected Electricity

66. The Electricity Act 2007 provides the governance framework for the grid-connected
electricity sector in Tonga. In accordance with the Act, the Electricity Commission was
established in 2008 as the regulatory agency for grid-based electricity supply. The Act defines
the role of the Electricity Commission in regulating the generation and selling of electricity, and
establishes the role of a concessionaire in producing and delivering electricity. The Act provides
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) authority to be a party in the Concession Agreement (CA)
between the Commission and the Concessionaire and to establish regulations to ensure effective
management of the electricity utility. The CA formed under the Act states the utility`s operations
in comprehensive detail, including very specific details as to how the tariffs are calculated.

67. The ownership of electricity assets has changed twice in recent years, firstly in 1998 when
the national utility was bought by Shoreline Power10 and more recently in mid-2008 when GoT
bought the assets from Shoreline to create Tonga Power Limited (TPL) as a state enterprise
wholly owned by GoT. This latest ownership change was already being planned in 200611
before rioting in Nuku`alofa resulted in considerable damage to buildings in the downtown area.
The riots damaged international confidence in investment in Tonga and GoT chose not to
proceed with its preferred option to sell the assets to private interests. Given the intention of the
Crown Prince to assume a constitutional monarchy soon after his coronation and withdraw from
commercial activities within Tonga, the Government concluded the agreement with the Shoreline
Group to purchase the utility in 2008.

68. There remains a strong interest to bring the private sector into the electricity generation and
supply business as evidenced by regulatory policy and the subsequent CA intended to ensure that
TPL remains financially viable and therefore potentially interesting to private investors.

69. The CA distinguishes fuel and non-fuel components of the tariff. Although the CA allows
TPL to treat the four island grids individually, in May 2009 TPL chose to standardize tariffs
across all grids and consumer classes. Tariffs are allowed to be adjusted every three months, the
latest being a 2.5% increase effective June 1, 2010. The non-fuel tariff component follows the
CPI, while the fuel tariff component is adjusted so that the Concessionaire recovers the permitted

  A Conditional Agreement existed in 2006 to sell the assets and business to Northpower Limited of New Zealand
but the Conditions Precedent of the Sale and Purchase Agreement could not be met due to the destruction of the
Shoreline Corporate Office including all its records.

fuel costs12. The CA requires that TPL earn a rate of return (currently set at 12.9 %) of its
Regulated Asset Value (RAV). TPL is required to submit capital expenditure plans to the
Commission for approval and the Commission can deny approval of a capital expenditure that is
not in line with a least-cost supply strategy. The overall tariff structure is designed to ensure that
the TPL operates using full commercial standards.

70. The value of TPL assets when the company was established in mid-2008 was approximately
TOP48.5 million (US$24.25 million). TPL has since revalued its assets downwards based on
depreciated replacement costs for network assets and on depreciated historic costs for other
assets. TPL currently has a US$6 million loan from a commercial bank for operating capital
scheduled to be fully paid by the end of 2013, coinciding with the first year when TPL is
expected to start paying dividends. In addition, TPL is paying off the balance of a loan from
Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation for the purchase of the MaK diesel-generator. The
audited financial statements for 2008/09 have been submitted to the Auditor General. Based on
information provided by TPL, in 2009 TPL made an after-tax profit, with a current ratio of 1.3
and return on equity of 12.9%.

71. TPL has the concession and operates four grids in Tonga: the largest on Tongatapu, and
three smaller grids on the main islands of the Vava`u and Ha`apai island groups, and on the
island of Eua. Table 6 shows the characteristics of the grid.

   To calculate the permitted fuel cost in a given month, the demand for electricity is estimated. Target system losses
are then used to calculate the amount of generation that should be required at the supply efficiency target. From this
level of generation and permitted fuel conversion efficiency the liters of fuel that should be required under those
target conditions is calculated. Liters of fuel, multiplied by the fuel price, gives the permitted fuel costs. This
adjustment mechanism is designed to provide an incentive for the Concessionaire to work to meet the CA mandated
targets of fuel and system efficiency.

72. Electricity sector data are quite limited at present. With more complete and reliable
information on customer electricity use, TPL will be better able to monitor characteristics of
electricity demand and development plans that affect future electric consumption. Such
information will be essential to tailor end-use efficiency programs across the system. Improving
data generation and collection is an activity identified for early implementation under the TERM.

73. TPL inherited its database and data management systems from its predecessor. A significant
amount of data was lost during the 2006 civil disturbance. Also the previous owners were
apparently reluctant to share information outside the organization and the data collection systems
reflect this attitude. Typically, electric utilities will maintain System Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems to electronically collect a wide range of system performance data
and so provide management with the information needed to keep their operations efficient.
There was a SCADA system at the power station on Tongatapu that automated data collection on
the generating units, but the system failed and has not yet been replaced. There are no
comparable systems at power stations supplying the other three grids and there are no systems to
automatically monitor the performance of key sections of any of the grid networks. Hence there
is no record of the hourly load demand, a key requirement in any planning activity.



                                               25
74. The billing database system is over 15 years old, it has certain limitations and TPL only has
consumption data by customer back to when it acquired the business in 200813. TPL did not
purchase the accounts receivable records from the previous owner.

75. Overall technical and non-technical losses have been high in recent years and TPL
management has committed to reduce these as quickly as practical. On the Tongatapu grid
where approximately 85% of all of the grid-supplied energy is consumed, total losses represented
just over 17.5% of the energy generated at the engine-generators in 2009 while on the three
smaller grids, recent total losses have been between 12.5% and over 20.0% of generated energy.
Based on the total losses and TPL`s estimate that technical losses are in the order of 12% on
Tongatapu, non-technical losses are running around 3%, with station service around 2-3%. TPL
has committed to reduce these losses as a first priority and has undertaken a more aggressive
position on payment arrears and reducing the grace period for payments before disconnecting
delinquent customers. In addition, TPL has changed out over 1,000 meters that were known or
suspected of malfunction.

76. Diesel theft was not identified by TPL as a significant problem. However, a number of fuel
supply lines lack meters. TPL is in the process of installing these. Better measurement of actual
fuel supply compared to fuel purchased and electricity output will enable TPL to determine the
level of diesel theft, if any.

77. The TPL meter records show that overdue bills reached almost TOP1.9 (US$1.045) million
in late 2008 and that these have since been reduced to about TOP600,000 (US$330,000). Based
on data provided by TPL which covered about 85% of their customer accounts, their accounts
receivable were less than 11 days14 as of September 30, 2009. While these figures do not
include all of the billed energy, it is reasonable to assume comparable accounts receivable
performance on the balance of the billed energy.

78. TPL advises that their supply reliability performance has been good since mid-2008 and that
the majority of supply failures may be traced to network and distribution faults. TPL changed its
inventory policy to ensure appropriate levels of replacement poles and other network repair
supplies are on hand so that repairs were made and supply restored quickly following weather
emergencies such as the April 2009 cyclone.

79. TPL`s database on end use by sector includes some irregularities so customer numbers
should be considered as indicative only. The database indicates residential customers account
for 47% of energy sold, commercial users for 34%, religious institutions for 7%, government 6%
with the remainder split between street lighting and educational facilities.

81. The cost of Automotive Diesel Oil (ADO or diesel), the fuel used in all of TPL`s diesel
generator sets, has varied widely during recent years. In Table 7, the total energy generated, the
fuel used and the total cost of that fuel is shown for calendar years 2005 through 2008. Although
annual electric demand grew by just over 10% in the four years, the annual fuel cost in TOP
increased by almost 120% in the same period.

82. Figure 2 illustrates how the cost per unit of electricity on Tongatapu has varied since March
2002. The cost of diesel fuel drove the tariffs to record highs during 2007 and 2008. The tariff
for Tongatapu reached 102.67 seniti (US$0.56516) and 104.67 on Vava`u (US$0.576). Since
mid-2008, international oil prices have fallen significantly and the correspondingly lower diesel
fuel costs have been passed on to customers through the tariff changes in February and May
2009. In addition, the tariff structure changed in May 2009 to make the tariff uniform across all

83. Table 8 shows the medium term demand forecast for Tongatapu, taking into account both
increases in efficiency of supply and end use, as per the TERM. Figure 3 shows the combined
high, median and low forecasts for the four grids combined. Improvements in efficiency will
reduce demand growth by about 17% overall compared to a do nothing approach. Even at the
modest rate of demand growth projected taking into account improved supply and end use
efficiency, demand is expected to increase by nearly 30% over the next decade. Without taking
action to address the vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks, the Tongan economy and
electricity consumers will be increasingly exposed to risks associated with the growing
dependency on imported petroleum for electricity generation.

Off-Grid Electricity Supply

84. A Renewable Energy Bill was developed prior to the TERM process and passed by
parliament in 2009. The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal framework to promote
the utilization of renewable energy in Tonga through the creation of an enabling market
environment. However at the time of drafting, the use of renewable energy for grid-connected
supply was not foreseen. Since the bill relates only to direct current (DC) supply, such as comes
from solar panels supplying households directly, the Bill does not cover any renewable energy
supply to the four island grids. Although not directly stated, the Bill is relevant for off-grid
supply only. The Bill creates a Renewable Energy Authority within the Ministry of Lands,
Survey and Natural Resources to deal with matters concerning DC supply of renewable energy.
The Energy Planning Office under the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources has
responsibility for electrifying the areas of Tonga not reached by a TPL grid.

85. The Outer Islands` (OI`s) of Tonga are a group of 26 islands scattered throughout the three
primary island groups of Tonga. The total population of the OI`s is approximately 6,001 people,
with 5,300 of these living on islands without reticulated diesel generated electricity. The
approach set out in the TERM while providing almost 100% renewable energy generation to
supply all households in the outer islands will only impact 6% of the total population and will
have no impact on reducing diesel use.

86. Providing reliable and adequate electricity supply to the remote, declining and dispersed
population of the outer islands is a major challenge and requires an entirely different strategy
than that for the urban island of Tongatapu. Beginning in 1988 GoT, with the assistance of
various international agencies and donors, has implemented a number of outer island electricity
supply models with varying levels of success. The focus has mainly been on solar energy, but
projects utilizing diesel generation have also been undertaken. In developing an improved outer
island electrification strategy for the future, the strengths of those supply models need to be
emphasised and their weaknesses avoided.

87. For the islands that have a low population, donor programmes have provided solar home
systems in the 100Wp to 160Wp range to provide enough electricity for lighting and low demand
entertainment devices. Around 1,000 homes have been supplied with this type of SHS
installations on the basis of the users covering all operation and maintenance costs. Several
institutional approaches have been used with the most successful being a utility type approach
where systems are owned and maintained by an entity external to the island and users pay a
periodic fee for the service provided that is based on the cost of O&M. For four islands that have
larger populations, Nomuka, Ha`afeva, Uiha and Ha`ano, diesel powered mini-grids have been
installed under an AusAID programme in the late 1990s. Those grids are community operated
and do not provide 24 hour power, only at peak times or for extended hours when there are
special events. All O&M costs are expected to be borne by the community. These electrification
programmes cover nearly 100% of all outer island households that desire electrical services.

88. Funds have been committed by donors to rehabilitate all of the installed SHS in Vava`u and
the pre-2000 installations in Ha`apai. This rehabilitation will include upgrading the size of all the
installations to around 150 Wp, providing new batteries and controllers and where needed,
                                                 30
upgrading lights and wiring. When these rehabilitation programmes are complete, all but about
80 of the SHS installed in Tonga will be operating at design levels. Those 80 SHS were installed
under the PREFACE programme of 2001-2002 and require battery replacements. The Tonga
Energy Unit has plans for their replacement using funds collected from users. So by the end of
2010, all of the around 1,000 households that have SHS installed are expected to have the full
level of services allowed by the installed capacity.

89. However, that installed capacity is based on a one size fits all approach for SHS
installation and households that desire more services, for example for income-generating
activities, must purchase their own extra solar panels and batteries. The high cost of adding
capacity to the SHS has prevented significant user investment in extended services. It is clear,
however, that there is a demand for added capacity to operate video systems, fans, refrigerators,
freezers and other urban appliances both for life-style improvements and for income
generation.

90. It is not practical to design the SHS to specifically fit the current needs of a household since
those needs are highly likely to change over time. A key component of the approach planned for
implementation under the TERM is based on a concept of modular additions (or subtractions) of
capacity for the user. It is proposed that the existing ~150 Wp size of installation constitute one
system module complete with solar panel, battery and control unit and that services be based on
multiples of those service modules. Thus a two service module installation (300Wp) could
provide lights, video, radio and other small appliance services. A three service module (450Wp)
could provide lights radio, small appliance services plus an efficient refrigerator or freezer and a
four service module system (600 Wp) could provide full urban scale electrification.


CROSS-CUTTING ENERGY SECTOR ISSUES

91. Compared to many Pacific Island Countries Tonga has a relatively well-functioning energy
sector. However, the Government recognizes that significant adjustments are needed to move
the sector to a more secure and sustainable footing. The review of the current situation has
highlighted a number of cross-cutting issues that will need to be addressed to improve the energy
security while achieving environmental and financial sustainability. These include data
limitations; distributed institutional responsibility for the energy sector, transparency and
simplification of regulatory and oversight processes; and gaps and inconsistencies in the policy
and legal framework. These issues and recommended actions to address them are addressed in
the TERM.


ENERGY SECTOR PRIORITIES

92. The overarching priorities in the energy sector are to reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil
price rise and price shocks and achieve an increase in quality access to electricity services in an
environmentally and financially sustainable manner.           The TERM highlights financial
sustainability and transparency as important components of a longer term strategy to attract
credible private sector and maximize the benefits from private sector involvement.

EVOLUTION OF THE TONGA ENERGY ROAD MAP (TERM)

93. In April of 2009, the Kingdom of Tonga hosted the Pacific Energy Minister`s Meeting
(PEMM), which brought together most of the Government`s development partners. The Prime
Minister took the opportunity provided by the PEMM to meet with all Development Partners to
set out the Government`s objective of reducing the vulnerability of Tongan electricity consumers
and the economy as a whole to oil price shocks. He emphasized the need for coordination and
flexibility on the part of development partners while at the same time committing the
Government to taking the needed actions, with development partner assistance, to achieve
environmental and financial sustainability in the electricity sector. Building on the strategic
overview provided by the Prime Minister, the Development Partners and Tongan counterparts
represented by the Renewable Energy Advisor to the Prime Minister engaged in a set of studies
and series of discussions to develop a program that would have as its outcome the Tonga
Energy Road Map 2010-2020: Ten Year Road Map to Reduce Tonga's Vulnerability to Oil Price
shocks and Achieve an Increase in Quality Access to Modern Energy Services in an
Environmentally Sustainable Manner, or Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM).

94. The first formal consultation meeting took place from 16-17 November 2009, in Vava`u,
Tonga. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the draft technical inputs including off-grid
analysis, petroleum supply chain and hedging, energy efficiency, and options for grid-connected
renewable energy supply. The meeting was attended by the Prime Minister of Tonga, the
Minister of Lands and Natural Resources and their staff, the CEO and Board Chairman of TPL
and senior representatives (including ambassadors and directors) from ten development partner
organizations. The Government agreed to prioritize its own resources to support implementation
of the Road Map and take needed actions for implementation. Development Partners agreed to
coordinate their funding to help develop and implement this Road Map.

95. The second meeting took place from April 7-9, 2010 in Nuku`alofa, Tonga. Prior to the
meeting, the draft technical reports and the draft TERM were circulated. The meeting involved
technical representatives from thirteen development partner organizations, the CEOs of all
relevant Tongan ministries and the CEO and Board Chairman of TPL. The meeting concluded
by confirming that the revised TERM had the full support of those present and recommended
that the TERM be adopted by Tonga and endorsed by development partners as the basis for
future development in the energy.

96. Informal discussion among development partners and with Tongan counterparts took place
throughout the year. Government of Tonga launched a TERM website (www.tonga-energy.to)
in January 2010. All relevant documents and updates are available of the website.


OBJECTIVE OF THE TONGA ENERGY ROAD MAP ("TERM")

97. The objective of the Tonga Energy Road Map is to lay out a least cost approach and
implementation plan to reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price shocks and achieve an increase
in quality access to modern energy services in a financially and environmentally sustainable
manner. The TERM will serve as the guiding document for Government actions and

                                              32
development partner support. It covers a ten year time period. It is envisioned that the TERM
will be periodically updated. The TERM considers the full range of options to meet the
objective, including:

       Improvements in petroleum supply chain to reduce the price, and consideration of price
       hedging instruments to reduce price volatility of imported petroleum products;

       Increased efficiency of conversion of petroleum to electricity supplied to consumers (i.e.
       increases in efficiency and reduced losses at TPL);

       Increased efficiency of conversion of electricity into consumer electricity services (i.e.
       end-use efficiency measures);

       Replacing a portion of current or future grid-based generation with renewable energy.

98. In addition, in order to meet the objective of increasing access to good-quality electricity
supply, the TERM includes recommendations for a new approach to meeting the needs of
consumers too remote to be connected to a grid-based supply.


PRINCIPLES UNDERPINNING THE "TERM"

99. Further information with respect to utility, customer and resource data is needed to improve
the understanding of the energy efficiency and renewable energy options available in Tonga.
Many other factors that impact investment decisions also change over time. Flexibility to update
and adjust the implementation plan is needed to ensure the TERM remains relevant and responds
to evolving circumstances. Recognizing the need for on-going adjustments, the TERM sets out
the key principles that will be adhered to, as the specifics of the implementation plan are
updated.

100. The key principles of the TERM are set out below.

101. Least Cost Approach to Meet the Objective of reducing Tonga's vulnerability to oil price
increases and shocks. To identify the least cost approach, the full range of options must be
considered and evaluated relative to one another rather than being considered in isolation. These
include improvements in the petroleum supply chain efficiency; supply and demand side
efficiency improvements; and options for non-diesel power generation for both grid and off-grid
electricity supply. The selection of each new investment will be based on the principle of the
lowest lifecycle cost among the technically feasible alternatives.

102. Managing Risk. The introduction and implementation of new technical and institutional
approaches will be designed and managed to avoid inadvertently increasing interruption risks in
the effort to address price risk issues. The sequencing and timing of adjustments will allow
sufficient time to undertake the detailed work and get in place the required specialist expertise.
An important element of managing risk is to develop a portfolio of options to meet the demand
for electricity. The value of establishing a portfolio of supply sources will be considered when
evaluating alternatives with comparable cost characteristics.
                                               33
103. Financial Sustainability. In this context financial sustainability means that the cost of
operating the energy sector, including regulatory, operations, maintenance, fuel and financing
costs are recovered through the tariff. While the provision of a subsidy for a particular
investment is not incompatible with the concept of financial viability, it should be applied in
cases where there are specific objectives outside the normal commercial operation. For example
to address specific social or equity objectives related to providing electricity services in remote
areas, to address specific negative externalities including funds aimed at supporting a transition
to renewable energy to reduce GHG emissions, or to support gaining experience with
technologies that may be expected to become more cost effective over time. The essential
feature is that the source of any subsidy required to keep the sector financially viable must be
secure. Continued dependence on significant injection of subsidy to meet the cost of normal
operations and expansion would not be considered a financially sustainable situation.
Investment options must be evaluated considering the cost implications over the investment
lifetime, to avoid substituting short term price relief for continuing high prices in the medium to
long term.

104. Social and Environmental Sustainability. Environmental and Social sustainability
encompasses both minimizing local negative social and physical environmental impacts of the
energy sector, as well as aligning with global goals with respect to minimizing impact on climate
change where possible. New energy investments under the TERM would be subject to
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and Mitigation Plans as necessary, as per
international practice. Special consideration will be given to those groups with specific needs
including youth, women, religious groups and those with special needs. Investments that have
major negative environmental or social impacts or constraints that cannot be mitigated or solved
will be avoided. As one of the group of countries which has contributed least to global climate
change, yet stands to be severely impacted, Tonga is committed to setting an example for larger
countries with respect to responsibly and sustainably reducing GHG emissions. Social
sustainability also incorporates an element of equity. Hence the scope of the TERM includes the
provision of sustainable, affordable electricity supply that meets the needs of people living in
remote areas.

105. Clear, appropriate and effective definition of roles for Government, TPL, and the Private
Sector. GoT is responsible for strategic direction in the energy sector (policy and legal
framework), sector oversight (regulation), creating an enabling environment and monitoring of
progress to achieve the strategic goals, and facilitating where possible the direction of financial
assistance to the sector in accordance with the principles listed above. This implies a strong role
in supervising the implementation of the TERM and actions to revise policy, legal and regulatory
arrangements. For projects and investments that have as a major goal the testing and gaining
experience with technologies new to Tonga, to the extent that public sector funding is available
ownership should remain with Government, possibly but not necessarily through TPL.

106. TPL will be an important implementing agency for the early TERM activities, including in
improved network and efficiency, and implementation of the off-grid program. TPL will also
have responsibility of maintaining supply of electricity to customers on the four grids. TPL is a
key source of technical expertise in the energy sector and this role will be strengthened through
training as part of the implementation of the TERM. TPL`s role will focus increasingly on the
                                                34
network and supply aspects of the electricity sector. TPL will participate as a developer of new
generation projects only to the extent that there are clear benefits and when private sector options
have been demonstrated to be technically or financially unworkable.

107. For new proof-of-concept generation projects, the construction and operation and
maintenance will be contracted out to the private sector with explicit provision for training of
TPL staff and other Tongan technicians in the private sector. Generation projects, for which data
are sufficient to fully define and objectively evaluate bids, should be private sector-led with
selection following a competitive and transparent approach. Private sector competition for new
generation will play a key role in maintaining downward pressure on prices and limiting the
commercial and operational risk borne by electricity consumers.

108. By maintaining a financially sustainable energy sector and maintaining TPL as a
financially viable company, the option of privatizing or concessioning TPL in the future remains
open.

109. The TERM explicitly recognizes that technologies, costs, demand for electricity and
sources of financing change over time. Also experience gained in Tonga from initial
implementation of the TERM should be analyzed and lessons incorporated into future plans. For
these reasons it is envisioned that the TERM will be periodically updated. Assumptions will be
reviewed compared to actual experience and evolving technologies and costs will be re-assessed.


"TERM" INDICATIVE TERM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

110. The Indicative Implementation Plan is divided into three phases. Phase 0 defines the most
urgent steps that should be undertaken without delay, including policy, institutional, legal, data
gathering actions as well as some investments. Phase 0 activities should be considered a priority
in terms of allocating funding whether from Government, private sector, sector revenues or
development partner support. Phase 1, which can proceed in parallel with phase 0, includes
work designed to gather sufficient information and experience about each possible option to
allow subsequent firm decision making. Phase 2 will be initiated when all policy, legal,
regulatory and institutional adjustments have taken place and when data and experience from the
phase 0 and phase 1 activities is sufficient to define the full-scale developments of renewable
energy and other actions to reduce the use of imported fuel are implemented.

111. The combination of Phase 0 and Phase 1 activities will result in a reduction of diesel use
for electricity generation, relative to the Do Nothing (no efficiency improvement) / Business As
Usual (all diesel) scenario, of about 25%.

112. The items noted in the following sections represent the core activities in the indicative
implementation plan.




                                                35
Phase 0

113. The key activities for Phase 0 are:

       Recommendations from the Petroleum Supply Chain and Price Hedging Study are
       considered by GoT and decisions made on implementation; initial activities launched;

       Institutional, legal, policy and regulatory updates for petroleum and electricity
       implemented, as per issues identified in the TERM;

       Data gathering activities and data collection and monitoring system in place;

       Environmental screening of the TERM to identify environmental considerations of the
       planned activities in the TERM;

       Analysis of environmental change impact on Tonga to identify any risks to long term
       safety and security of energy infrastructure;

       Initial end use efficiency / demand side management program launched and development
       of data and analysis to design and implement more extensive end use efficiency program
       underway;

       Off-grid program launched;

       Necessary TPL investments for safety, data acquisition and improved efficiency
       launched;

       Mechanism to channel available grant assistance to buy down the cost of renewable
       energy generation and energy efficiency investments is in place (Tonga Green Initiative
       Fund: TGIF).

114. GoT Actions and Responsibilities. A permanent institutional arrangement will be
established to manage, coordinate, monitor and report on the TERM implementation.
Coordination of the various components of the TERM will require frequent interaction among
the various agencies planning and implementing policy, legal and regulatory changes and
projects. A project monitoring and coordinating committee will be designated. The committee
will be Chaired by the Head of the Civil Service, and include all CEO`s of the GoT agencies that
will be impacted by the TERM (electricity and petroleum) and TPL.

Phase 1

115. Key activities indicated for Phase 1 are:

       Implementation of second-generation end-use efficiency / DSM measures;
       Implementation of up to about 1 MW on-grid solar PV. Most of this would be installed
       on Tongatapu and could include at least one other island grid. Elements including

                                                 36
       centralized, decentralized and possible battery storage would be appropriate. Operation,
       maintenance and training contract in place.

       Implementation of a Proof of Concept Coconut Oil Project. Operation, maintenance and
       training contract in place.

       Implementation of Landfill Gas IPP (if resource proved in Phase 0)

       Review of initial experience with petroleum financial risk management and
       implementation of modifications as required.

       Transaction advisor for Phase 2 projects selected.

Phase 2

116. The specific investment projects for Phase 2 will be defined based on the data and
experience gathered during Phases 0 and 1. Phase 2 actions will include:

       A formal analysis of the data and findings from the Phase 1 projects. In particular, the
       success of the loss-reduction programs and the DSM programs should be assessed to
       identify shortfalls on target energy reductions. The load forecast will be updated to drive
       the needs and timing of ongoing sector development. The successes and problems with
       each of the Proof-of-Concept project will be carefully evaluated. New grid system
       performance data will need analysis to confirm what measures need to be taken and new
       technology added to ensure that the most practical renewable energy alternative can be
       successfully integrated. Any promising (but not yet commercial) technologies that have
       generated a track record in Tonga or elsewhere during the Phase 0 and 1 implementation
       period, could be evaluated at this point and considered for inclusion in Phase 2.

       A very important activity during Phase 2 will be to institutionalize the data collection
       systems set up during Phase 1. The value of databases is often to be found in their
       longevity and continuity so as the Tonga economy and energy systems develop, the best
       data on what can be expected in weather, ocean regimes and electric system performance
       will ensure that Tonga`s continuing efforts to use its domestic energy resources can
       progress in as timely a manner as possible.

       A full-scale development of renewable energy projects on an IPP basis, utilizing the
       Tonga Green Initiative Fund designed and established in Phase 0. Sequencing of the
       Phase 2 projects will be determined based on the key principles of the TERM, set out at
       the beginning of this section.

117. Table 9 below shows the key activities with indicative costs and sources of funding, as well
as key indicators. The indicative financing shown below does not rely on significant
Government borrowing to implement the TERM. Virtually all the development partner
assistance is expected to be on a grant basis. It is recognized that full implementation of the
TERM will depend on the availability of sufficient grant funding, in particular to buy-down

                                               37
the cost of development of renewable energy. Having strong GoT ownership and full
development partner participation in developing the TERM increases the likelihood that the
required resources will be available and will be targeted appropriately.

                IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


OBJECTIVE

Development objectives

118. The development objectives are to provide budget support to contribute to reducing
Tonga`s fiscal deficit and to support the Government`s efforts in implementing reforms in the
energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and stable growth in the medium term.

Beneficiaries

119. The budget support will contribute to providing the resources necessary to implement the
FY10/11 budget. The general public will benefit from the operation. Timely budget support
provided through this operation will contribute to the stable provision of government services
and will help avoid emergency expenditure savings measures caused by budget shortfall, such as
occurred at the end of FY09/10.

120. Energy consumers (households and businesses) and the public will benefit from the
operation. Adoption of the TERM and implementation of a formal arrangement for coordination
and oversight across the energy sector will set in motion actions to improve the efficiency, cost-
effectiveness and transparency of the sector institutions, investments and operation. By signaling
that the Bank-supported Tonga Energy Road Map Project currently under preparation is
planned to provide support for implementation of key Phase 0 TERM activities aimed at
achieving the medium term energy sector outcomes for the proposed operation, and that any
subsequent budget support operation would include a focus on continued implementation of the
energy sector reforms discussed in this Program Document, the operation reinforces the
importance of TERM implementation. TERM implementation will lead to more efficient use
and targeting of available resources which will in turn lead to lower, more stable energy bills,
improved quality of electricity service and improved access to affordable electricity compared to
a situation without the implementation of the TERM.

121. As part of the overall reforms included in the TERM, improvements will be made in the
basic infrastructure necessary to deliver reliable electricity services. This will include upgrading
of sub-standard distribution networks to ensure the infrastructure meets international safety
standards. Local populations will benefit from reduced local pollution as generation of
electricity from renewable energy sources displaces diesel-fired generation. The international
community will benefit from reduced GHG emissions. Reducing the vulnerability of the
economy to oil price rises and shocks will improve the macroeconomic stability which will have
positive implications for the general public.

122. Benefits with respect to the energy sector aspects also extend beyond Tonga. The process
of developing the TERM is widely seen in the region as a concrete example of a new paradigm
for Government leadership and development partner coordination to undertake sensible planning
followed by coordinated implementation. It is anticipated that other countries in the region will
follow this example, extending the benefits of the Tonga work to other Pacific Island countries.

                                                40
CONSISTENCY WITH THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

123. The World Bank Group is significantly scaling up analytical and financial support to help
the Kingdom of Tonga and other small and remote Pacific island countries (PICs) reduce the
constraints of economic geography and make the most of opportunities available. The Bank`s
strategy for the PICs was previously set out in a single Regional Engagement Framework (REF)
covering the period 2006 to 2009. As Bank Group engagement intensifies, however, Pacific
island clients are increasingly demanding individual custom-tailored strategies to reflect their
individual circumstances, and to incorporate the support that can be provided from across the
Bank Group, including both IDA and IFC. To take advantage of benefits from greater regional
integration, these individually-tailored strategies will draw from key elements of a common
regional approach by the Bank Group. But country-specific strategies will also allow for a
greater acknowledgement of the different histories, development situation, and challenges of the
individual Pacific island countries, as well as a more nuanced discussion of how common
regional themes in the Bank Group`s engagement with the region are translated into specific
country contexts.

124. The proposed Tonga Energy Development Policy operation is consistent with the Tonga
Country Assistance Strategy and the World Bank Group`s overall strategy for the Pacific island
countries. The Tonga Country Assistance Strategy will be presented to the Board in early FY11
together with this proposed Operation.

125. The Bank`s strategic approach to the Pacific island nations recognizes that they are shaped
by their economic geography, perhaps more so than any other countries. Because of their small
size and remoteness, these countries are highly vulnerable to external economic shocks. Key
themes running through Bank Group engagement with Tonga, as with most of the rest of the
Pacific, include:

       (i)     Supporting policy reform to strengthen growth prospects and improve service
               delivery;

       (ii)    Generating opportunities through greater global and regional integration; and

       (iii)   Building resilience against shocks.

126. This proposed operation directly supports themes (i) and (iii). The Tonga Energy Road
Map sets out the institutional, legal and policy areas of reform needed to reduce Tonga`s
vulnerability to oil price shocks and achieve an increase in quality access to modern energy
services ­ both necessary conditions to strengthen prospects for equitable growth and improve
service delivery. The focus of the TERM on petroleum supply chain efficiency, petroleum price
risk management, increased efficiency in electricity supply and diversifying Tonga`s electricity
supply from the almost total reliance on imported petroleum, directly addresses the theme of
building resilience against shocks, specifically oil price spikes. By highlighting the Tonga
Energy Road Map, the proposed operation reinforces the importance of addressing energy sector
weaknesses as a necessary condition for economic growth and stability.

                                               41
127. The proposed operation is an integral part of the Bank`s on-going overall engagement in
the energy sector. Following the year-long dialog in preparing the TERM, this proposed
operation reinforces the importance of adhering to the objectives, principles and strategy set out
in the TERM. Importantly, highlighting the adoption of the TERM as a key prior action of a
budget support operation reinforces the reality that the energy sector issues addressed under the
TERM are critical to overall macroeconomic growth and stability, and hence have impact well
beyond the sector boundaries. Progress on TERM implementation will be further supported by
the Bank-financed Tonga Energy Road Map Project currently under preparation, an investment
project which will strengthen the focus and provide support to achieve the medium term energy
sector outcomes identified for this operation. As set out in this document, it is anticipated that
any subsequent budget support operations would include a focus on continued implementation of
the energy sector reforms discussed in this Program Document.

128. The operation has also served as a vehicle to strengthen the Bank`s dialog with the GoT in
areas of public expenditure and financial management. This DPO sets the stage for a more
robust engagement in PEFM going forward, particularly in the area of joint public expenditure
analysis which will be especially important as the new Government works to rationalize
expenditures while maintaining and improving core service delivery functions in the medium
term.

129. There is scope in the Tonga Country Strategy Note for the Bank to prepare a multi-year
development policy operation, starting in FY12, to underpin an agreed and coordinated program
of reforms as well as to respond to the aftermath of current economic shocks. Reflecting
demands from partners and clients to re-engage in a coordinated macro-economic policy
dialogue in the Pacific, the Bank intends to work with PFTAC, the ADB and key bilateral donors
on public expenditure policy issues in Tonga. As well as supporting energy sector policy
reforms, a subsequent DPO series would underpin a strengthened macro-economic dialogue with
GOT.


RATIONALE

130. The Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) represents the result of a year of intensive dialog
with the Government, and consultation and coordination with energy sector development
partners. The World Bank played a major role in development of the TERM, from the initial
conception of the scope and approach, through support for and supervision of the key analytic
work, managing the coordination of long-term energy sector development partners as well as
helping to bring on board new players, and synthesis of the inputs into the final TERM
document. As described above, the proposed operation forms an integral part of the Bank`s
overall energy sector engagement in Tonga.

131. The Bank has been able to play this role for two reasons. First, it is seen to provide
valuable international experience in energy sector policy and development. Second, it is viewed
as an impartial source of guidance and funding within a field of bi-lateral players which may be
viewed as having more complicated, political agendas.


                                               42
132. The approach and program set out in the TERM are fully in line with the institutional
agenda on Climate Change. The TERM integrates energy efficiency and renewable energy
generation into the mainstream sector planning and policy framework, through the focus on
reducing vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks as a key factor in enhancing national energy
security. Further, the TERM explicitly recognizes the potential for climate-change related
impacts on the sector and includes an evaluation of these risks and mitigation measures as an
early step implementation of the TERM.

133. Including key public financial management actions in this operation sets the stage for a
deeper engagement in this area and signals both the importance attached to improved PFM and
the willingness of the Bank to expand its program in these areas if requested by the new
Government.


COLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

Coordination with international partners

134. The World Bank is cognizant of budget support being provided to Tonga by other
development partners, particularly the Asian Development Bank and potentially the European
Commission. In preparing this operation, the Bank has taken into account progress by the
Tongan authorities toward meeting the second tranche conditions of the ADB grant, especially in
areas such as public expenditure policy, public financial management, procurement, and audit,
where the World Bank and ADB intend to work collaboratively with the Government to
strengthen reform.

135. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment was conducted in
March 2010 as a joint exercise by the Government of Tonga and development partners including
two experts engaged by AusAID and the ADB/World Bank Focal Point in Tonga. There is an
on-going dialog between GOT and development partners regarding reforms in public
procurement and the planned Public Expenditure Review.

136. Fifteen development partner organizations, including multi-laterals, bi-laterals, regional
organization and academic institutions have participated actively in the TERM process. As
presented above, the consultation process included two widely-attended, multi-day meetings to
discuss draft technical inputs and the draft TERM document, in addition to on-going exchanges
throughout the year.

Links with IMF

137. The IMF and the Bank collaborated on the recent DSA for Tonga, and Bank staff
participated in some of the Article IV mission meetings, which took place in March 2010. In
connection with the proposed operation, an assessment letter from the IMF regarding the
macroeconomic framework for Tonga is included in Annex 2.




                                              43
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

Energy Sector

138. The proposed operation is an important element of the continuing energy sector
engagement. Energy sector reform in Tonga started in 2008, prior to the Bank`s involvement in
the energy sector, when the Government of Tonga bought the monopoly electricity utility from a
private owner, establishing the state-owned Tonga Power Limited (TPL). GOT established a
regulatory agency to oversee TPL based on a Concession Agreement designed to maintain a
financially sustainable power sector. Steeply rising oil prices focused the government on the
impact of oil price rise and shocks. The combination of the restructured sector and the
government`s desire to address the dependence on oil set the stage for the year-long TERM
process in which the Bank was fully involved. The proposed operation will reinforce the
government`s commitment to the principles and plan set out in the TERM. It also highlights the
reality that the energy sector issues addressed under the TERM are critical to overall
macroeconomic growth and stability, and hence have impact well beyond the sector boundaries.

139. The Tonga Energy Road Map Project utilizing IDA and co-financing is planned for
presentation to the Bank`s Board in Q4 FY11. This investment project is expected to support
activities drawn from the TERM Phase 0. This could include technical assistance to finance
implementation of agreed recommendations from the Petroleum Supply Chain Study;
implementation of institutional, legal, policy and regulatory updates for petroleum and
electricity; design of the proposed Tonga Green Incentive Fund; funding of consultants to
strengthen the TERM Implementation Unit if needed; other technical assistance activities as
noted under Phase 0 of the TERM which are not covered by other development partners. The
SIL could also include investment activities associated with resource data gathering, and
necessary TPL investments for safety, data acquisition and improved efficiency. It could also
include technical assistance and training required for TPL related to TERM implementation. The
objectives and outcomes of the proposed DPO and investment project will be mutually
reinforcing. The DPO energy-related prior actions are important elements in the preparation of
the investment project. The DPO indicators and outcomes will be re-iterated in the investment
project design and monitoring framework. Support provided under the investment project will
contribute to the implementation of the TERM.

Other Bank-Supported Activities

140. Recent and planned Bank Group support has focused predominantly on policy reforms to
strengthen infrastructure services, including through greater involvement by the private sector.
In addition to the energy sector activities discussed above other Bank-supported activities
include:

       The Bank Group provided analytical and advisory support to assist Tonga in the opening
       of the telecoms market. This has been backed up by a $7 million investment by IFC to
       encourage a $30 million investment by the new private operator, Digicel ­ one of the
       largest single investments in Tonga. Competition has helped to increase the number of
       mobile telephone subscribers from about 5% to 50% of the population. Building on this,


                                              44
       the Bank Group is now also working with the ADB, the Tongan authorities, and private
       providers, to explore option to lay a broadband cable to Tonga.

       The Bank is supporting improved transport infrastructure asset maintenance, modeled on
       a successful involvement in this sector in Samoa over the last decade. This will ensure
       better management of infrastructure assets, help to provide designated maintenance
       funding, and build private sector capacity to undertake routine maintenance. The
       Australian Government has provided additional financing through the Bank particular to
       support local contracting of road maintenance as one way to offset the impacts of the
       global slowdown.

       The Bank has agreed to assist in the post-tsunami infrastructure rehabilitation in the
       outlying Niuas islands.

141. The Bank has previously been involved in supporting Tonga`s successful effort to make
progress toward health and education MDGs. In both health and education, however the Bank
has been a relatively small player compared to significant bilateral assistance. While there has
been a good history of coordinated engagement among partners in these sectors, the need for
further Bank engagement as bi-laterals scale up further is potentially limited.


LESSONS LEARNED

142. A number of good practice principles were highlighted in the 2009 Development Policy
Lending Retrospective, Operations and Country Services Department of the World Bank. These
included the importance of ownership (development policy operations should be firmly rooted in
the government`s own reform agenda), harmonization (development partners should work
coherently in support of government outcomes) and customization (the operation should be
tailored to the country priorities). One important lesson is the potential for positive impact of
active engagement on decisive aspects of policy measures adopted. In other words, making an
action that is likely to be taken anyway (even in the absence of the dialog around a financing
operation) the focus of a support operation can have a beneficial impact on aspects such as the
timing, coherence and content due to the enhanced attention of senior leadership that comes with
significant financing operation. Also noted was the contribution made by strategic lock-in
measures that make other aspects of a reform program fall into place.

143. These lessons are reflected in the design of this operation. The TERM, which is the anchor
of the proposed energy-related prior actions, has strong government ownership and is the best
example of development partner harmonization in any sector in Tonga. Every aspect of the
TERM program is customized for Tonga. While it is anticipated that the Government`s adoption
of the TERM would occur even without the incentive provided by this proposed operation,
making energy sector reform the centerpiece of this operation serves to highlight the importance
of these actions and focus high level attention on implementation of the TERM needed to
maintain the current momentum. The specific energy-related prior actions are selected to be
lock-in measures, critical for moving forward with the sector reforms under the TERM.



                                               45
144. The Public Financial Management-related conditions are selected as important aspects of
on-going engagement supported by major development partners. They address one of the key
recommendations drawn from the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review,
analytic work conducted by a joint development partner­government team, and pick up on the
Bank`s previous engagement in public procurement reform.


SRATEGIC CHOICES

145. One strategic choice in the design of the operation is whether this should be a single
operation with the option of a future DPO (or DPO series) to be discussed with the new
government after the November elections, or a program of a series of two linked operations.
Given anticipated fiscal pressures, a series of linked operations would provide a degree of
certainty for the Tongan authorities that additional financing could be made available in a 12-18
month timeframe. It would also reinforce the key actions in line with the Tonga Energy Road
Map and PFM reforms.

146. On the other hand, engagement with the current Government on important PEFM issues is
at a relatively early stage. Defining PEFM-related triggers for a second DPO at this stage would
be premature and dialog with the new Government could raise additional reform issues that
would benefit from the support of a DPO.

147. On balance, and after discussion with Government of Tonga, it was deemed most
appropriate to design this as a single operation, with explicit intention of maintaining a strong
engagement in the energy sector and strengthening the dialog on PEFM and macroeconomic
issues. The FY11-FY14 Tonga Country Assistance Strategy underscores the expectation of
continued engagement in these areas. The planned energy investment project discussed above
will provide solid follow up and reinforcement to the energy-related prior actions in the proposed
operation. Given the importance of addressing energy sector issues and the depth of engagement
in this area between the Bank and GOT, it is anticipated that future strengthened economic
dialogue would include a focus on the implementation of the Tonga Energy Road Map. As noted
in the FY11-FY14 Tonga Country Assistance Strategy. It is also anticipated that the
macroeconomic dialogue would address the need for further improvements in public financial
management and the implementation of the public procurement reforms highlighted in the prior
actions.

148. A second strategic choice is whether to proceed with the proposed budget support operation
in early FY10/11, or delay the operation until after the new government is in place and has had
time to take meaningful steps in energy and PFM to demonstrate commitment to pursuing
reforms in these areas. An important consideration is that delaying the operation until after the
November 2010 elections would likely mean that any budget support would be available only
towards the end of FY10/11, potentially failing to mitigate the negative impacts of fiscal stress
which the operation is designed to address. A significant delay may also result in missing
important opportunities to demonstrate the Bank`s commitment to strengthening the overall
engagement in Tonga, and to reinforce the role of energy sector reforms for macroeconomic
growth and stability. Engaging early provides a good opportunity to set out key elements of the
dialog going forward.

                                               46
149. The risk associated with engaging ahead of the elections in the energy sector is to a large
extent mitigated by the engagement around the planned investment loan, and in the PFM area
through existing engagements by other development partners, particularly ADB. Although the
World Bank does not yet have a deep engagement with Tonga on macro issues, there is a clear
demand for strengthening our engagement both from the GOT and other development partners.
The Bank anticipates building this engagement as well as expanding our support in the sectors,
including energy as described above. The anticipated expanded engagement is discussed in the
FY11-FY14 CAS which will be presented to the Board together with the proposed operation. In
this context the benefit of proceeding in early FY10/11 was determined to outweigh the possible
risk.

                                   V. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM


DEVELOPMENT POLICY AREAS

152. The proposed operation is a single tranche grant of US$5 million. The operation will
support policy and institutional measures that will help Tonga sustain its reform momentum in
the energy sector and implement recommendations from the 2010 Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Assessment. The operation will also provide short-term fiscal relief to
address the budget deficit projected for FY10/11 as key determinants of government revenue,
particularly remittances, remain well below normal levels as a result of the global economic
slow-down. GoT has worked with the donor community to identify funding for the fiscal gaps it
has been confronting. Resources from the proposed operation will provide the GoT with the
needed fiscal space to respond to the economic impacts of the global recession, while
maintaining traction on key medium-term economic reforms in the energy sector. This operation
is being complemented by a package of other support from the Bank, both for tsunami-related
reconstruction needs and for technical assistance and investment priorities in the energy sector.

153. In support of the GoT program for tackling the weaknesses in the energy sector and
implementing improvements in public financial management, the proposed operation includes
actions related to: (i) Energy sector reform to reduce Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price rise and
shocks, and to increase access to quality energy services; and (ii) Public Financial Management
reform which will formalize and make legally binding the required procedures for a number of
key PFM processes18. The actions related to energy sector reform are designed to support the
development of a costed and prioritised program, which will improve the performance, cost-
effectiveness and stability of the energy sector so that it becomes a factor contributing to, rather
than constraining economic growth. These reforms, supported under the proposed operation,
could well have been set back with the in-coming government`s attention diverted to managing
immediate fiscal constraints. In addition by strengthening public financial management the
reforms will assist the government in adhering to sound practices.

Development Policy Areas in Energy

154. The Tonga Energy Road Map sets out a program of reform and investment in the energy
sector for the period 2010 ­ 2020. The program is divided into three phases: 0, 1 and 2. Phase 0
activities include the most urgent steps including policy, institutional, legal, and data gathering
actions. Phase 0 also highlights the need for improved energy sector data gathering, recording
and analysis as the basis for further improvements.

155. During preparation of the TERM the need for revising an updating electricity sector policy,
laws and regulations in several specific areas was identified. The areas include: private
participation in electricity generation both through IPP and consumer-owned renewable energy
systems, including policies emphasizing competition and transparency for the process for

18
  The Treasury Instructions address areas relating to corporate plans and annual management plans of government
authorities, procurement instructions aligned with the draft Public Procurement Regulations, rules governing
changes to the personnel database and payroll, and controls and processes in respect of expenditure commitments.

                                                      48
procuring electricity; treatment of grant-funded renewable energy investments and development
of a mechanism so that available subsidy is channeled to the least lifecycle cost investments;
standards, regulations and incentives for energy efficiency; regulations relating to both technical
and non-technical components for IPPs and consumer owned renewable energy systems;
requirements for development and maintenance of an energy sector database for monitoring the
impact of the TERM and a renewable energy resources database; and integrating livelihoods,
biodiversity and environmental considerations in the energy policy framework. In the petroleum
sector, revisions should be considered in the areas relating to petroleum licensing, safety and
environmental laws, and taxation of fuels.

156. Under Phase 0 of the TERM, a revised set of institutional, policy, legal and regulatory
instruments will be put in place to address the set of issues noted above. Action will be taken to
establish a data gathering and recording system and to complete the baseline data. Completion
of these actions will ensure that the sector structure and governance is conducive for undertaking
a least cost program to achieve the TERM objectives and for achieving the benefits of bringing
private sector investment and expertise to the sector.

157. Institutional aspects of the energy sector also require attention. In both the petroleum and
electricity sectors, different Government entities are responsible for almost every aspect of the
petroleum and electricity supply, planning, monitoring and regulation. There is little interaction
among these entities in terms of data sharing or cross-checking, with the result that it is very
difficult to create an accurate picture of the sector needed to regulate effectively and understand
the opportunities for improvement. To strengthen implementation of the TERM and achieve and
maintain an efficient, secure and sustainable energy sector, it will be important that GoT puts in
place a long-term arrangement to consolidate responsibility for maintaining strategic overview
and monitoring of both the petroleum and electricity sectors.

Development Policy Areas in Public Financial Management

158. The PEFA recognizes that significant progress has been made in improving PFM in recent
years, and also highlights key areas for further reform. One of the recommended next steps is
the adoption of Treasury Instructions so that Government officials have clear guidance on and
are subject to legally-binding rules and procedures governing key PFM processes.

159. The specific actions supported under these two areas are described in the following
paragraphs. The prior actions are summarized in Table 10.

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

160. The proposed Tonga Energy Sector Development Operation is a single tranche operation
providing general budget support in recognition of strong progress towards strengthening the
energy sector and moving forward with PFM reform.

161. Prior actions have been selected on the basis of strong ownership by GoT, harmonization
with other development partners and based on solid sector analysis. In the energy sector where
the reform efforts are at an early stage, the selected prior actions are determined to be decisive
in the sense of focusing high level attention on important actions (i.e. adoption of the TERM)
and to have an important lock-in effect as discussed in the section on Lessons Learned. The
PFM-related prior actions have been selected to reinforce the Government`s efforts to implement
one of the key recommendations emerging from the PEFA sector analysis and to support clear
procedures for budget preparation and execution.


PRIOR ACTIONS

162. Prior actions for the disbursement of the full amount of the grant are:

i. The Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) adopted by Cabinet. The TERM sets out the GoT`s
   priorities and objectives in the energy sector and the over-arching principles that will guide
   further development of the energy sector. It also sets out an indicative implementation plan.
   In content, the TERM is essentially the equivalent of an overall energy sector policy and
   strategic development plan. Because of the high level of consultation with the development
   partners in preparation of the TERM, adoption of the TERM commits both the GoT and
   development partners to the principles and course set out.

                                                50
     The TERM was completed in April 2010 and formally presented to participating
     development partners in June 2010 at a meeting hosted by the International Renewable
     Energy Association. Since then the Government has taken a number of steps to begin
     implementation and to ensure that on-going processes conform to the key principles set out in
     the TERM:
          The process of establishing the TERM Implementation unit and identifying key staff.
            The planned structure of the Implementation Unit is shown in Annex 7.

            The FY10/11 budget makes available funds which can be targeted to support early
            initiation of critical institutional, policy, legal and regulatory aspects of the TERM,
            while simultaneously working with development partners to prepare projects which
            will provide additional funding for phase 0 activities.

            Work is already underway on drafting revisions to the Electricity Act that will
            facilitate third party (i.e. Independent Power Producer) generation of electricity and
            sale to the retailer, TPL.

            In line with the key TERM principles of least cost and transparency, the Government
            and TPL are committed to pursuing a process of competitive selection for new IPP
            investments. In specific situations where a negotiated deal is indicated to be the best
            approach, the Government will undertake due diligence to demonstrate that the
            proposed costs and risk allocation adequately protects the interests of Tongan
            electricity consumers, as determined through bench-marking against relevant
            comparators. To assure transparency in the sector, the key findings of the
            Government`s due diligence will be publicly available. The Government has
            confirmed its intention to apply the due diligence and information-sharing to
            project(s) which were initiated prior to the development of the TERM and but not yet
            finalized.

ii. An intra-governmental mechanism to coordinate energy sector activities across government
    is established and operationalized. A key weakness identified in the TERM is the absence
    of a GoT entity with a mandate to maintain a strategic overview and coordination in the
    energy sector. The most suitable arrangement for the longer term will require review and
    possible revisions to the legal framework in the sector and will be targeted as part of the
    implementation of Phase 0 of the TERM. However to make progress toward that goal, and to
    move forward with early implementation of the TERM, Cabinet has approved the
    establishment of the Tonga Energy Road Map Committee. The Committee is mandated to
    monitor and evaluate the progress of the TERM across line ministries, to facilitate and
    implement Government policy as related to the TERM and to report as required to Cabinet.
    The committee membership, approved by Cabinet, includes the Chief Secretary, Secretary
    for Finance, Secretary for Lands, Survey and Natural Resources, Director for Environment,
    CEO of Public Enterprises and CEO of Tonga Power Ltd., as well as the Economic Advisor
    and Renewable Energy Coordinator in the Prime Minister`s Office. Minutes of the meetings
    of the Committee are posted on the TERM website19.

19
   GOT is in the process of expanding the membership of the committee to include representatives from several
other Ministries who hold key responsibilities in the energy sector, including: Ministry of Marine and Ports
                                                     51
iii. The Tonga Power Limited FY08/09 Audit Report submitted to the Auditor General`s Office.
     TPL is the government-owned, regulated monopoly electricity supplier for grid-connected
     customers in Tonga. As set out in the Public Enterprise Act, the Public Audit Act 2007 and
     the Public Financial Management Act 2002, TPL must submit audited financial statements
     which are reviewed by the office of the Auditor General and subsequently transmitted to
     Cabinet and the Legislative Assembly. The 08/09 TPL audit represents the first time in well
     over a decade that information regarding the financial situation of the monopoly electricity
     supplier will be available20. It enhances the prospects for improved oversight of TPL`s
     financial situation and for quality private participation in the sector, as potential investors
     will be able to gain a clear understanding of TPL`s financial position as the off-taker for
     electricity generated by a third party. As noted in the TERM, the lack of reliable data in the
     energy sector is a significant impediment to good decision-making, planning, performance
     monitoring and understanding opportunities for improvement. TPL is one the key entities in
     the energy sector. Information available in the audit report will be an important contribution
     to establishment of the baseline for the energy sector database which is to be created under
     Phase 0 of the TERM. The timely submission of the first audit report, despite the poor
     quality of information available when TPL was created, sets a good precedent for future
     reporting. It is also an indicator that the management and Board of TPL are focused on good
     financial management practices and commercial operation.

iv. Treasury Instructions to line ministries issued by Ministry of Finance and Planning. The
    Public Finance Management Act 2002 provides the legislative framework for public
    financial management in the Kingdom of Tonga. As with similar legislation in other
    countries, it is not intended to provide detailed day-to-day instructions to government
    agencies. Instead, Section 45 of the Act provides that "the Minister may issue Treasury
    Instructions setting out detailed procedures and requirements not inconsistent with this Act".
    In contrast to financial regulations, which provide higher-level guidance on how to
    administer financial legislation, the Treasurer`s Instructions provide detailed,
    implementation-level guidance to line ministries on specific policies and procedures that
    must be adhered to when managing public funds. These may include (but are not limited to)
    policies, processes and procedures relating to appropriations, revenue and expenditure
    management, asset management, debt recovery, use of bank accounts by line ministries,
    financial authorizations, and payroll deductions. Unlike financial regulations, which are
    usually approved and issued by the Parliament, Treasurer`s Instructions can be more
    responsive to changing circumstances as they can be revised and re-issued by the Treasurer
    as needs emerge. By ensuring that the Treasury Instructions are finalised and implemented
    in all government agencies, the Government of Tonga and development partners will have
    increased assurance that public finances are being managed consistently, and in accordance
    with the Act.


(petroleum sector licensing, petroleum and marine safety, marine pollution prevention); Ministry of Works (National
Emergency Management); Ministry of Labor Commerce and Industry (petroleum price regulation).
20
   As noted in Section 3, from 1998 through mid-2008 the monopoly electricity supplier was privately owned.
Government oversight was relatively weak with little information about the financial performance provided. Only
incomplete financial records were available at the time of the state buy-back which created the current TPL in 2008.

                                                        52
v.    Public Procurement Regulations Submitted to the Law Committee.                Following in
                                     21
     principle approval by Cabinet , the draft regulations were submitted to the Law Committee
     in July 2010, together with comments from the ADB and Bank (discussed in paragraphs 52
     and 53). A primary objective of the Law Committee review is to assess whether the
     proposed regulations are consistent with the existing legal and regulatory framework and
     standards, before the final regulations are submitted to Cabinet for approval and thereafter to
     the Privy Council. As such, submission to the Law Committee is a clear indication that the
     Government intends to pursue the substance of the regulations. The Law Committee review
     process is expected to be completed in October 2010. Prospects for bringing forward the
     review timeline are uncertain as there are a number of items critical for the upcoming
     election still pending with the Law Committee. Completion of the process, i.e. approval by
     the Privy Council, is a prior action for the second tranche of the ADB budget support
     operation. Implementation of the new Public Procurement Regulations is expected to lead to
     gains in efficiency in processing public procurement and to increased transparency in the
     award of contracts.

163. Macro-economic framework. Development policy lending is undertaken in the context of
an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. This assessment is usually undertaken in
consultation with the IMF. In preparing this proposed operation the Bank has discussed with the
IMF its assessment of the adequacy of the macroeconomic framework in Tonga. As part of a
broader macroeconomic dialogue, the Bank and the Government of Tonga will continue to
discuss the process of reprioritizing expenditure allocations in the government budget, consistent
with a constrained fiscal outlook, while giving priority to protecting social service delivery.

164. Coordination with international partners. The Bank is cognizant of budget support being
provided to Tonga by other development partners, particularly the Asian Development Bank and
potentially the European Commission. In preparing this operation, the Bank has taken into
account progress by the Tongan authorities toward meeting the second tranche conditions of the
ADB grant, especially in areas such as public expenditure policy, public financial management,
procurement, and audit, where the World Bank and ADB intend to be working collaboratively
with the Government to strengthen reform.

FOCUS AREAS FOR FUTURE DIALOG

165. The paragraphs below provide an indication of the themes which could be the focus of
strengthened policy dialog going forward in the energy sector and building on the engagement on
PFM and macro issues developed during preparation of this proposed operation. Such dialog
with the incoming government could potentially for the basis of a future development policy
operation.

21
   As per normal procedure, the draft regulations were reviewed by Cabinet to determine whether the substance of
the draft regulations reflects the approach the GoT intends to pursue. Cabinet then issued a decision to submit the
draft regulations to the Law Committee. By issuing this decision, Cabinet is effectively endorsing the substance of
the draft regulations. The primary function of the Law Committee is to assess whether the proposed regulations are
consistent with the existing legal and regulatory framework and standards, before the regulations are submitted to
Cabinet for final approval. As such, submission to the Law Committee is a clear indication that the Government
intends to pursue the substance of the regulations.

                                                        53
166. The energy sector dialog going forward would likely focus on implementation of the
TERM Phase 0 activities, including progress on the institutional, policy, legal, regulatory review
and updating. The planned investment project is anticipated to provide support toward
implementing these measures. Key elements going forward would likely include:

       promoting development in the energy sector based on a least lifecycle cost approach to
       meet the objective of reducing Tonga`s vulnerability to oil price increases and shocks,
       while maintaining a financially sustainable energy sector and maintaining TPL as a
       financially viable company.

       developing an energy sector database for monitoring the impact of the energy sector
       performance, including the implementation of the TERM, and a renewable energy
       resources database;

       integration of livelihoods, biodiversity, environmental and social equity considerations in
       the energy sector framework.

       facilitation of private participation in electricity generation both through IPP and if
       deemed appropriate, consumer-owned renewable energy systems, including policies
       emphasizing competition and transparency for the process for procuring electricity;

       addressing current weaknesses in the petroleum sector arrangements with respect to
       energy security, licensing, risk management, safety and environmental laws, and pricing
       and taxation of fuels, based on the findings of studies, including Opportunities for
       Improved Efficiency in Tonga Petroleum Supply Chain Efficiency and Price Hedging
       Options and The Regulation of Tonga`s Petroleum Sector.

167. Under the TERM, one of the tasks of the Implementation Unit is to prepare a
comprehensive annual report for stakeholders including development partners, providing the
status of the TERM implementation, and any planned modifications to the Indicative Action
Plan. This will provide the basis for continued coordination among stakeholders and updated
implementation plans.

168. Public Expenditure and Financial Management-related dialog going forward would likely
focus around actions to implement recommendations from the PEFA, developments following
the proposed Public Expenditure Review and implementation of improvements in public
procurement, including finalization of the procurement regulations.

169. In the overall macroeconomic dialog going forward, the Bank will continue to discuss with
the IMF its assessment of the adequacy of the macroeconomic framework in Tonga. The Bank
will also take into account progress by the Tongan authorities toward meeting the policy actions
of the ADB grant and any other budget support operations, especially in areas such as public
expenditure financial management, procurement, and audit, where the World Bank and ADB
intend to be working collaboratively with the Government to strengthen reform.


                                               54
GRANT AMOUNT

170. The amount for this operation would be $5 million IDA grant.


                            VI. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION


ECONOMIC AND FISCAL IMPACTS

171. The net economic impacts of implementation of the TERM supported by this DPO will be
positive and substantial. Reforms will generate efficiency gains in the sector and economy-wide
through more stable energy prices, reduced vulnerability to energy price shocks, reduced cost of
electricity supply, reduced household and business expenditure on electricity, and growth in
competition, compared to a business as usual scenario.

Electricity

172. Successful implementation of the TERM is expected to yield substantial reductions in
diesel imports for electricity generation purposes, relative to a business-as-usual approach. This,
in turn, is expected to reduce the merchandise import bill and the current account deficit, and
improve overall price stability in the event of oil price spikes, without significant detriment to
government revenue from diesel imports.

173. For illustrative purposes, estimates have been generated for alternative scenarios in 2020,
based on the extent of the implementation of the TERM. In the event that electricity supply and
demand are made more efficient and reasonably large-scale use of renewable energy sources is
achieved by 2020, diesel imports for electricity generation are estimated to be some 45 percent
below those under a business-as-usual scenario. Other things being equal, that reduction in diesel
imports for electricity generation is estimated to have the following implications for government
revenue from diesel imports, merchandise imports and the current account deficit, and overall
price stability in 2020:

       Government revenue from diesel imports is likely to fall by a negligible amount
       (estimated to be a fall of just over 0.1 percent of total government annual revenue). The
       reason for this negligible impact on government revenue is because government does not
       derive significant revenue from diesel imports for electricity generation under the tax
       regime as it currently stands: these imports are exempt from excise tax on fuel; as an
       intermediate good they do not incur consumption tax; and the wharfage they do incur is a
       negligible contributor to government revenue.

       Merchandise imports are likely to fall significantly, given both the estimated size of the
       reduction in diesel imports for electricity generation and the significant share of
       merchandise imports that diesel imports represent. Given a mid-range fuel price forecast,
       the reduction in diesel imports for electricity generation in 2020 is estimated to yield a
       merchandise import bill that is almost 6 percent less than the business-as-usual scenario.

                                                55
       That, in turn, would reduce the current account deficit by nearly a quarter, relative to the
       business-as-usual scenario.

       The volatility of the electricity price ­ and, in turn, of the overall level of prices ­ in the
       event of a spike in oil prices is expected to fall in the event that efficiency gains and
       large-scale renewable energy use is achieved by 2020. For example, a fuel price spike
       from a low price forecast in 2020 to a high price forecast (nearly a 150 percent price
       increase), is estimated to increase electricity prices by just under 40 percent ­ relative to a
       more than 80 percent increase in electricity prices under the business-as-usual scenario.
       Overall, then, this would more than halve the inflationary impact of the rise in electricity
       prices caused by such a fuel price spike.

174. The above estimates are simply provided for illustrative purposes. They focus on
estimating direct impacts of the reduction in diesel imports for electricity generation, and are not
intended to capture wider implications of reduced energy costs, for example on the general level
of business activity. In making these estimations, it is assumed that the changes that need to be
made under the alternative scenarios have been completed by 2020. This means, for example,
assuming that the equipment required establishing large-scale renewable energy generation has
already been imported by 2020. In each case, the estimates are made using the assumption that
other things remain the same. For example, in estimating revenue impacts, it is assumed that the
current tax regime remains in place in 2020.

Petroleum

175. Tonga`s high dependency on petroleum for its overall energy needs (i.e. energy for both its
stationary and transport sectors) is likely to continue, even if steps are taken to improve fuel
efficiency in the power sector and diversify some power generation towards renewable energy
sources. For Tonga, there appear few other sources of energy with the security and reliability of
supply, proven performance, energy density and portability of petroleum fuels. Tonga`s energy
policy needs to recognise that oil will continue to play a vital role in meeting the energy
requirements of the country, and appropriately manage the risks and consequences of this energy
dependency. Tonga`s high dependency on imported petroleum products to meet its energy
demands makes Tonga highly vulnerable to two types of risks: 1) Oil price shocks; and 2)
Interruptions in the delivery of fuel. These risks pose threats to Tonga`s energy security.

176. Recent analysis of Tonga`s downstream petroleum sector identified a number of gaps and
made recommendations aim to: (i) improve the regulation of the petroleum sector; (ii) improve
petroleum supply chain efficiency; and (iii) introduce improved risk management practices.
These recommendations are summarized below. A number of the recommendations are for
further, more detailed assessment in certain areas - making it premature to quantify the economic
or fiscal benefits. Other recommendations target actions to bring the sector up to international
standards with respect to safety and environmental considerations. In some cases, this requires
that Tonga`s existing laws and regulations be implemented and enforced. In other instances,
changes to current laws, regulations and their application are recommended. The cost to the
economy and environment of delaying or avoiding improvements in these areas could be very
high, especially given the central location of the fuel storage facilities on Tongatapu.

                                                 56
177. The recommendations also include the introduction of price risk management. The main
benefits would be greater price stability overall and in particular a much reduced exposure to
price spikes which can have a destabilizing effect in a small economy such as Tonga`s.
Illustrative cost/benefit analysis for a range of price risk mitigation instruments applied to
petroleum prices in Tonga using actual data from 2009 show a break-even to small (~$0.4
million) cost of purchasing a financial cap, on a quarterly basis, to hedge the total annual
petroleum import for Tonga. This indicates that the cost of reducing the petroleum price risk is
likely to be manageable, and in years where the price rises quickly, the benefits could be
substantial. Clearly more detailed analysis of specific options would be required to select the
best strategy for Tonga and to quantify the potential fiscal and economic impacts. The
recommendation is for Tonga to begin to gain experience with simple price risk management
instruments (e.g. caps or swaps) covering only a limited portion of the annual fuel purchase
volumes initially. The gradual introduction of financial hedging on some of the fuel volumes
imported into Tonga (such as those used for power generation) would enable understanding of
financial risk management to grow, together with an understanding of the costs, benefits and
risks of various hedging strategies.

                                     allowing other parties to supply petroleum
                                              58
POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

180. Implementation of the TERM supported by this DPO will have significant, direct positive
social impacts including:

       reducing household expenditure on electricity services through reduced cost of supply
       passed on to consumers and improved end-use efficiency to reduce the amount of
       electricity required to achieve a given level of electricity services;

       reducing the volatility of electricity prices so that households can budget sensibly for the
       cost of electricity.

       improving access to affordable, quality electricity services in remote areas. The Off-Grid
       Initiative which is part of the TERM will provide remote communities with access to
       electricity options from renewable sources that are sustainable and also provide for their
       varied power needs. The program aims to provide both enhanced quality of life and offer
       the potential to increase economic activity of the outer islands communities through a
       novel Tiered Approach. The approach takes into account the wide variation of energy
       demand and development opportunities as well as the economic abilities throughout the
       islands and to match the supply concepts to match energy demands.

181. The TERM includes principles of environmental and social impact assessment as an
integral part of new energy sector investments. Any potentially negative social impacts will be
identified and plans developed to avoid or mitigate possible negative consequences.

Consultation and Participation

182. Information on development of the TERM has been made available to the public
throughout the process via press reports, televised and radio presentation and question and
answer sessions with reporters. The Tonga Energy Road Map was set up in January 2010. All
draft and final technical reports are posted as well as minutes of the TERM Committee. While
the level of outreach and information available to the public has been relatively high during the
process to date, more focus on soliciting feedback and public participation would strengthen the
TERM implementation.          The Government intends to establish a program of public
communication and consultation with citizens and relevant public stakeholders.

183. As described below, any energy investments under the TERM will be subject to an
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment which would include consultations with any
project-affected people as and when specific investments are contemplated.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

184. The proposed operation is not expected to have any significant negative effects, and the
overall effect on the environment, forests or other natural resources is expected to be positive.
The positive effects are expected to stem from the energy sector reforms. The public sector
management reform supported under the operation is unlikely to have any environmental effects.
                                               59
185. Any infrastructure development potential could lead to negative environmental effects if
not designed and managed with environmental sustainability as a key consideration. However,
in the case of the energy sector development that could take place as the TERM is implemented,
a number of mitigation measures are built into the TERM approach to assure that any potential
environmental issues are fully assessed and mitigated to avoid any negative effects..

186. First, the key technical reports feeding into the TERM ­ those on renewable energy options
for grid supply and the petroleum sector ­ both included specific analysis on potential
environmental impacts associated with action or inaction on the part of the Government in
implementing the recommended actions. For renewable energy all options were first screened
for any environmental or social showstoppers, i.e. any significant negative impact that could
not be avoided or mitigated. If a showstopper were identified the option was not included in
further assessment. Hence any potentially negative environmental impacts from the RE
investments included in the TERM can be mitigated. Many of the RE options will have a
significant positive environmental impact through displacement of diesel-based electricity
generation with clean technologies such as solar PV. Environmental sustainability is an integral
part of the Tonga Energy Road Map and one of the key principles as discussed above. The
TERM principle on Environmental Sustainability requires that any new energy investments
under the TERM will be subject to Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and Mitigation
Plans as necessary as per international practice. By building the process of routinely undertaking
environmental impact assessment and implementing mitigation plans for new energy investments
under the TERM, the practice in the sector could become an example for other infrastructure
sectors ­ another potentially very positive effect of implementation of the TERM.

187. One of the recommendations from the petroleum sector studies was the need for increased
attention to environmental and safety aspects of petroleum storage. TERM implementation will
address the recommendations from the petroleum studies, including those on environmental and
safety issues. This would have a significant positive environmental effect.

188. In addition, specific activities to be undertaken in Phase 0 of the TERM implementation
include:

       Environmental screening of the TERM to identify environmental considerations of the
       planned activities in the TERM;

       Analysis of environmental change impact on Tonga to identify any risks to long term
       safety and security of energy infrastructure.

189. Other factors considered in the selection and sequencing of investments include
consistency with other national policies such as the Tonga National Action Plan on Climate
Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management 2010 - 2015 - where energy initiatives will
be consistent with, and supportive of, national efforts to address and respond to climate change,
environmental issues and natural disasters.

SUPERVISION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Supervision

190. A close dialog will be maintained with the GoT, TPL and other development partners.
Contributing to the energy sector dialog will be: (i) formal supervision/preparation missions
related to this operation; (ii) preparation activities related to the proposed SIL utilizing IDA with
co-financing, planned for presentation to the WB Board in Q4 FY11 to support implementation
of specific aspects of the TERM; and (iii) formal engagement with development partners
initiated by GOT as a regular feature of TERM implementation, as specified in the TERM. The
Bank maintains an on-going dialog with energy sector development partners in the Pacific
through the Energy Development Partner Working Group, chaired by the Bank with quarterly
meetings. This provides a regular forum for an update on the implementation of TERM
activities financed by other development partners.

191. For the PFM aspects of the operation, a dialog will be maintained with Ministry of Finance
and other development partners supporting PFM reforms. PFM specialists will visit Tonga at
least twice during the year following Board approval. It is anticipated that the dialog with the
GOT on macroeconomic issues will be strengthened once the new government is in place, and
this engagement will include working jointly with GoT and other development partners in areas
of public financial management and public procurement. Bank participation in the joint
initiatives will also provide a platform for on-going supervision of the PFM aspects of this
operation.

Monitoring and Evaluation

192. The monitoring and evaluation framework for progress in the energy sector will be an
integral part of the energy sector database which will be set during Phase 0 of the TERM
implementation. Establishing the monitoring and evaluation framework is a monitoring
indicator for this proposed operation.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public financial management environment

193. While a significant reform agenda remains, a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) completed in early 2010 found real improvements in overall
PFM systems and processes since the 2007 PEFA. The budget is considered credible at the
macro level, with variations in composition of the expenditure outturns identified at the agency
level. The budget is comprehensive, but additional transparency would be gained by including
information regarding financial risks of state owned enterprises. Improved access to information
about taxation policy and rulings, and the introduction of a tax appeals mechanism have been
part of the revenue reforms. Reforms are also underway in audit, with recent legislation
formalising the independence of the Audit Office.



                                                 61
194. Reflecting recent reforms, the World Bank`s CPIA rating for Tonga has been increased
from 3.0 to 3.5 over the past 3 years; with Tonga`s policy performance now above average for all
IDA countries. Given these improvements, but acknowledging the identified weaknesses and
reforms still required, the overall fiduciary risk is rated as Significant.

195. This conclusion is based on the 2010 PEFA`s assessment that the PFM legal and regulatory
framework in Tonga provides a solid basis for budgeting, spending and accountability, and the
government`s commitment to continue to implement PFM reforms. Among the reforms are the
introduction of a limited form of multi-year budgeting, and improvements in revenue
administration.

196. Opportunities to reduce gradually the fiduciary risk have been identified and actions
considered. A number of areas were identified and require further improvement in order reduce
the government`s overall fiduciary risk to the moderate level. Two areas for further reform
highlighted in the PEFA are accountability and transparency relating to both internal and
external audit, and formal adoption and implementation of the Treasury Instructions. The prior
action in this DPO relating to the issuance of Treasury Instructions by the MoNFP is aimed at
reducing the fiduciary risk, and demonstrates the Bank`s support of this government reform
action.

197. The Government indicated its willingness to pursue further PFM reforms in future years,
and already has a number of reform activities underway. These include the continuing roll-out of
common financial IT systems to line agencies, enhancing the audit function through the ongoing
implementation of the Public Audit Act 2007, improvements to the corporate governance
arrangements and transparency of state owned enterprises, and ongoing taxation and customs
reforms.

Foreign exchange environment

198. In terms of the foreign exchange environment, there is no current IMF Safeguards
Assessment of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), as Tonga has not accessed IMF
Funds. However the NRBT had committed to undergo a Safeguards Assessment. The NRBT
publishes its annual report together with the audited accounts and the report of the independent
auditors on those accounts. The 2008/09 annual report has been published and the audited
financial accounts were unqualified. The NRBT has an established Revaluation Reserve
Account, which provides an additional buffer for any foreign exchange losses and maintains
foreign reserves composed of a basket of currencies reducing the sensitivity to exchange rate risk
as movements of these currencies generally offset each other.

199. While there is no indication of substantial issues within the foreign exchange environment,
without an IMF Safeguards Assessment there is insufficient information available at this time to
draw any substantiated conclusions risk, so the foreign exchange risk must be rated as High.

Disbursement and Audit

200. The disbursement measures proposed are to ensure that the grant funds disbursed by the
Bank are deposited in a dedicated account of the central bank, the NRBT, and then an amount
                                               62
equivalent to the grant is credited to an account of the government available to finance budgeted
expenditures.

201. The grant will be disbursed according to IDA disbursement procedures for development
policy operations. The full grant amount of $5 million will be disbursed against satisfactory
completion of the specified policy actions as listed in Table 9 and Government agreement as
summarised in the letter of the development policy, and is not tied to any specific purchases.
Once the grant is approved by the WB Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the grant
will be deposited by IDA in one tranche, at the request of the Recipient, into a dedicated Foreign
Currency Deposit Account at the NRBT.

202. Flow of funds (including foreign exchange) is subject to normal FM processes. It is not
possible to track the ultimate use of the foreign exchange provided by the DPO proceeds, but
grant proceeds flow into a dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account at the NRBT and from it
to Government of Tonga`s budget, and are thus subject to normal public financial management
processes and NRBT procedures. By way of a letter, the Government will provide confirmation
to the Bank when the grant amount has been credited to a Local Currency Deposit Account used
to finance budgeted expenditures. The diagram below depicts the envisaged flow of funds
arrangements:


    World Bank                NRBT                  MoFNP                  Budget
                              USD$                   TOP$                Tonga PFM
                          Dedicated Bank            General                System
                             Account                Account


203. The Bank will request the auditors of the government to conduct a special audit of the
dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account established in the NRBT. The audit will cover the
following: (i) the accuracy of the summary of the transactions of this account, including accuracy
of exchange rate conversions; (ii) that this account was only used for the purposes of the
operation and that no other amounts were deposited into this account, including confirmation
from corresponding bank(s) involved in the funds flow; and (iii) that payments from this
dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account were in a timely manner (normally within 30 days
of disbursement) transferred to a Local Currency Deposit Account available to finance budgeted
expenditure. The audit will be provided to the Bank as soon as available, but not later than six
months after the last disbursement from the Association, and will be made publicly available in a
timely fashion.


RISK AND RISK MITIGATION

204. The main risks and their associated risk mitigations measures are the following:

   The need to address immediate budget shortfalls could distract the new administration from
   focusing on the implementation of critical energy sector reforms, as per the TERM, needed
   to support medium term economic stability and growth. Budget pressures could also result
   in insufficient resources being available for the GoT`s role in implementation of the TERM.

                                               63
   The mitigation measure is to contribute, along with other development partners, to reducing
   the budget gap through this proposed budget support operation.

   A new, possibly inexperienced administration may take some time to appreciate the
   importance of focusing on energy sector reforms, within the wide scope of demands on a
   new administration, especially if oil prices do not rise significantly in the coming months.
   This could result in a loss of momentum, or actions at odds with the TERM, which could
   undermine the progress and credibility to date. The risk will be mitigated to some extent by
   clear signaling, in this document and as part of the preparation of the energy sector SIL
   which will be appraised after the new administration takes office, that progress on energy
   sector reform will be an important component of the overall country dialog going forward, as
   well as a pre-requisite for further support in the energy sector. A further mitigation measure
   is the strong development partner coordination around the development of the TERM and the
   commitment provide support in line with implementation of the TERM. The benefits and
   importance of maintain the focus on energy sector reforms and on adhering to the principles
   set out in the TERM will be emphasized not only by the Bank, but by a wide range of other
   development partners.

   Natural Disasters and Climate Change negatively impact the expected benefits associated
   with implementation of the planned energy sector reforms. Two approaches to mitigating
   this risk are built into the TERM. First, design of new investments will routinely take into
   account Tonga`s vulnerability to natural disasters and specify equipment and designs
   accordingly. Second, one of the Phase 0 activities of the TERM is Analysis of
   environmental change impact on Tonga to identify any risks to long term safety and security
   of energy infrastructure. The findings and recommendations of this study will inform
   subsequent implementation of the TERM.

   Progress on Public Financial Management reforms could stall if the new administration
   focuses on other priorities. The primary mitigation measure is the planned joint development
   partner efforts to support the GoT in implementing improvements in the areas of public
   expenditure and financial management. The Bank intends to work closely with other
   development partners to provide the support and emphasis necessary to maintain the GOT`s
   focus and capacity to take action on PEFM reforms.

            ANNEX 3: TONGA ASSESSMENT LETTER FOR THE WORLD BANK

                        Tonga--Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                      July 14, 2010

1. Tonga has been hit hard by the global crisis. Tourism activity, remittances, and
exports declined. At the same time, in large part due to worsening credit quality, bank
balance sheets have weakened. This, in turn, has restrained the availability of credit despite
the central bank`s efforts to stimulate demand. Compounding these downward pressures, part
of the Tongan archipelago was hit by a tsunami on September 29, 2009 causing loss of life
and significant material damage. Activity is expected to bottom out in the coming months as
capital spending plans are implemented and financial conditions ease.

2. Macroeconomic policies were loosened to support the real economy.
   Fiscal Policy. In FY2009/10, the government fiscal position posted an estimated
deficit of about 4 percent of GDP, with the further deterioration in the fiscal balance
from 2008/09 levels due to a 10 percent hike in civil servant wages, increased
infrastructure spending, and weak revenues. Revenue performance was lackluster,
falling short of the ambitious budget targets by about 6 percent of GDP, mainly due to
lower trade and corporate income taxes. The fiscal deficit is expected to worsen next
year as infrastructure plans are rolled out.

   Monetary Policy. During the course of 2009 the National Reserve Bank of Tonga
lowered reserve requirements, reduced the interest rate on its repo facility, and
stopped issuing central bank bills. Despite this, declining credit quality has taken a
toll on bank profits and their willingness to lend. This has more than offset the effect
of looser monetary policy on the real economy. Nevertheless, provisioning has risen
ahead of write offs and profitability is expected to resume next year.

3. The external position is expected to deteriorate. The current account deficit is
forecast to rise in the next few years, before returning to more sustainable levels over the
medium term. This deterioration reflects lower remittances and reconstruction-related
imports that are fully financed.

4. The increase in Tonga's both external and public debt over the past year has left
the economy more vulnerable to shocks. Public and external debts are estimated to have
reached 51½ percent of GDP and 44¼ percent of GDP in 2009/10, up from 38½ percent of
GDP and 31 percent of GDP in FY2008/09, respectively, reflecting drawdown`s from two
renminbi loans from China`s Exim bank with a face value totaling over 30 percent of GDP.
This has pushed Tonga further into the range of high risk of debt distress according to the
World Bank-IMF debt sustainability framework.

5. Going forward, macroeconomic policies will need to give priority to mitigating
the risks to Tonga's external and fiscal sustainability and laying the foundations for
higher growth. This will necessitate continued progress on structural improvements to raise

growth potential, continued grant-based support from donors, fiscal consolidation, and
careful management of liabilities, reserves, and Tonga`s external position. Further details on
our policy advice can be found in IMF Country report 10/112.
