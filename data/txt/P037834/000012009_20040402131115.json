While a wider\n            range of issues were addressed under the project, the skill\n            and personnel capacity limitations of the Directorates,\n            particularly in northern areas, appears to have yielded the\n            more modest gains found in the areas of decentralized\n            monitoring, and support to schools, as well as in\n            improvements in learning achievement, as a function of\n            inputs for improved in-service training of teachers and\n            curriculum/textbook reform. There is also the need for more\n            accurate assessment of financial, and time requirement;  for\n            more accurate assessment of institutional capacities; for\n            adequate back-up provisions when inputs are contingent on\n            each other; and, for recognition of collective reinforcement\n            of community development. Lessons on implementation suggest\n            improved teacher training; engaging communities to support\n            schools in underserved areas; and, foster gradual phasing of\n            new educational concepts."}, "docdt": "2004-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
