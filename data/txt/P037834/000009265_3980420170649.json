Project's\n            objectives are: a) to improve the quality of education,\n            increase learning achievement and improve completion rates\n            in elementary education; b) to increase access, equity, and\n            retention of students, particularly girls; c) to strengthen\n            institutional capacity to plan and manage educational\n            programs; and d) to encourage greater community and\n            nongovernmental organization participation. The project\n            consists of four main components: 1) improving educational\n            quality by instituting changes in teacher recruitment and\n            training, developing curriculum and educational materials,\n            and developing assessment capacity; 2) increasing equitable\n            access -improving the quantity, physical quality, and gender\n            balance of elementary schools operating in the Northern\n            areas and Azed Jammu and Kashmir by rebuilding dangerous\n            schools and erecting new school buildings for currently\n            shelterless schools; erecting community schools buildings\n            with community participation; and helping to establish a\n            maintenance capacity in each school for receiving\n            interventions to improve physical infrastructure; 3)\n            strengthening the management capacity of the\n            Department/Directorate of Elementary Education through\n            organizational changes, providing limited additional staff,\n            training, and technical assistance; improving the\n            information base for planning and management decisions by\n            conducting baseline studies, rationalizing information\n            flows, and developing information management systems at the\n            local level; and regularly monitoring and evaluating the\n            proposed five-year program; and 4) supporting community\n            participation in the Northern areas by supporting and\n            improving the existing community schools program; and in\n            Azad Jammu and Kashmir, by establishing school committees in\n            existing government schools."}, "docdt": "1997-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
