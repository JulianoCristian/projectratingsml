The first helps improve maternal\n            health services, prevents unwanted pregnancies, and prevents\n            and controls STDs/HIV (sexually transmitted diseases and the\n            human immunodeficiency virus). The second component aids in\n            integrating vertical programs to combat childhood diseases\n            through introducing and implementing the \"integrated\n            management of childhood illnesses\" (IMCI) approach. The\n            third component supports nutrition policy formulation and\n            institutional strengthening; as well as community and\n            micronutrient approaches to improve the nutritional status\n            of women and young children. The fourth component supports\n            the management and implementation of a family health program\n            by capacity building and policy development, upgrading and\n            maintaining health infrastructure--rebuilding selected\n            primary health care facilities, establishing a blood supply\n            system, procuring equipment, maintenance support, a local\n            fund initiative fund, and project management.
