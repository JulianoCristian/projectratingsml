Lessons learned from the project: The success\n            of EERP confirms both post conflict intervention theory and\n            practice in other countries (in particular the Balkans). The\n            project corroborates the relevance of a flexible strategic\n            and programmatic approach. The ring-fenced approach has both\n            positive and negative aspects. The project demonstrates that\n            it is worthwhile to take measured risks. The project also\n            demonstrates the benefits of having a locally-based task\n            team leader, in a context such as Democratic Republic of\n            Congo (DRC). Some of the difficulties of the project reveal\n            that communication with local population is crucial.\n            Government implementing agencies also highlighted the need\n            to have funding available for performance-based premium for\n            civil servants involved in project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
