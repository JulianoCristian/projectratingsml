Project\n            will finance a limited set of priority activities that will\n            provide the backbone of the assistance needed in the first\n            phase of the Transition Support Strategy (TSS). In\n            particular, the project will assist the government to a)\n            strengthen institutional capacity and formulate economic\n            policy, and b) address urgent needs and pilot implementation\n            solutions. In terms of strengthening institutional capacity\n            and formulating economic policy, the capacity building for\n            management of donor assistance component will assist the\n            government in building capacity to manage external\n            assistance, so as to prepare the ground for the recovery\n            phase during which levels of external assistance are\n            expected to be large. The support to good governance and\n            economic management component will address priority capacity\n            building and technical assistance needs in the next twelve\n            months. To address urgent needs and piloting implementation\n            solutions, the HIV/AIDS component will finance a scale-up of\n            activities using those agencies that already have a track\n            record of successful implementation in the respective areas.\n            The community driven development pilot fund will support\n            community driven development activities in rural areas. The\n            infrastructure component will focus on only one road which\n            have the most potential for immediate impact on the\n            livelihood of a large part of the population. The\n            unallocated US$3 million will be kept for flexible use."}, "docdt": "2001-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
