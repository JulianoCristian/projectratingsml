           to low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns designed to\n            reach particular groups have not significantly affected\n            sexual practices. Part of the challenge lies with the fact\n            that key populations at higher risk have to be better\n            involved in the prevention and control work; and a\n            comprehensive training program in behavior change\n            communication (BCC) was in place just before project\n            closing. Separation of biomedical waste is an important\n            public health issue and should be continuously supported.\n            Capacity building on waste management should be continuous\n            due to attrition and the difficulty of maintaining staff up\n            to speed on the latest developments. In Jamaica and\n            elsewhere in the Caribbean, there has been an increasing\n            awareness that enabling environments are critical to the\n            reduction of transmission of HIV/AIDS and increased access\n            to treatment and care. This includes policy and legislative\n            changes and workplace and sector-specific policies and\n            programs, to safeguard privacy, and confidentiality and\n            address stigma and discrimination. Popular figures,\n            particularly those admired by adolescents, need to be\n            engaged in speaking openly about the risk of HIV/AIDS, how\n            to protect themselves, and the importance of knowing their\n            status and seeking appropriate care."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
