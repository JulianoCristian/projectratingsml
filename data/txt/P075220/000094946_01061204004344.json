high-risk groups; 2) improving\n            access for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to care that\n            is effective, affordable, and equitable within the context\n            of government health policy; and c) strengthening their\n            institutional capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS in a\n            sustainable way. The development objectives would be\n            country-specific and depend on the stage of the epidemic,\n            income levels, and the socioeconomic status of those who are\n            infected. The interventions chosen for each country project\n            will be based on the countries' epidemiological and\n            programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting\n            them, and include: 1) communication and advocacy to increase\n            government commitment, attention, and funding related to\n            HIV/AIDS and to raise awareness, knowledge, and\n            understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS;\n            2) scaling up prevention activities at the national and\n            community levels; 3) scaling up care and support activities\n            at the national and community levels; 4) supporting research\n            and surveillance at the national level; and 5) capacity\n            building.
