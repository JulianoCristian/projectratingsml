MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 7.6 million, the
equivalent of US$11.0 million, to help finance a Judicial Reform Project. The credit
would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of forty years.
Background
2.    Bolivia's economic adjustment program, implemented since the mid-1980's, has
succeeded in restoring macroeconomic stability and stimulating moderate growth.
Inflation has declined steadily, falling to 8.5% per annum in 1994. Growth averaged 4%
during 1990-1993 and reached 4.2% in 1994. Despite recent improvements, however,
growth rates must be accelerated in order to improve the welfare of Bolivia's people,
especially of those at low-income levels. A major determinant of the slow pace of growth
has been the low level of private investment, averaging just 5% of GDP in 1991-1993 and
estimated at 6%/o in 1994.
3 .    Two main factors explain these low  levels of private investment: (i) the
predominance of public enterprises in sectors with strong growth potential; and (ii) the
lack of a legal and institutional framework to guarantee private agents the consistent and
predictable enforcement of their rights. To address the first issue, the new administration
in Bolivia has launched a bold program of privatization, using a process called
capitalization, aimed at rationalizing the role of the state in key sectors. The program will
be supported by IDA with a proposed Capitalization Program Adjustment Credit and a
series of accompanying technical assistance operations. Important improvements in the
investment environment are expected from this program.
4.    There would still remain, however, a substantial agenda of reforms related to the
country's legal and institutional fiamework. Public confidence in the Bolivian justice
system is very low. Litigants face inordinate delays in obtaining adjudication of disputes,
leading to a generalized disinclination to seek judicial enforcement of legal rights. Court
decisions are not based on uniform and predictable judicial standards, creating uncertainty
about the application of legal provisions. In addition, major groups in the society have
very limited access to the formal system of justice, yet alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms are not well developed.
5.    These problems stem from a variety of causes. Structural defects include weak
judicial autonomy and perverse incentives caused by inadequate human resource
management. At the court level problems include: (a) the passive role assumed by judges
in managing cases; (b) judges' weak professional skdlls; (c) the absence of standards and



2
information for case management; and (d) deficient court organization and administrative
support.
6.    The crisis in the courts has generated a broad consensus about the need for judicial
reform, giving rise to a number of recent initiatives. In early 1993, a new Law of Judicial
Organization was approved, and in September of that year, a Ministry of Justice was
created. Most recently, the new administration has introduced reforms to the Constitution
that included an institutional restructuring of the Judiciary through the introduction of a
specialized Constitutional Tribunal and a Judicial Council responsible for the sector's
administration.
Government Strategy
7.    The Government's goal is to create a judicial system that contributes to economic
growth by facilitating private sector activity, and to social welfare by guaranteeing the
basic rights of all citizens. To achieve this objective, the Judiciary and Executive have
agreed to embark on a far-reaching Judicial Reform Program, which will include institutional
and administrative, as well as legislative measures. The reform strategy aims to increase
efficiency through improved courtroom administration. However, it also takes into
account the need to seek improvements in the quality of the justice provided by the
present system. Thus it seeks reform of the judicial process and incentive framework, as
well as of management systems.
8.    The reform effort will need to be sustained over several years and phases. The first
phase, to be supported by the proposed credit, will last three years and will focus on
establishing the institutional and policy framework for reforn. It would include the
establishment and strengthening of judicial institutions, improvements in human resource
management and courtroom administration, and quality improvements in judicial
procedures. IDA's support of reform efforts in civil law areas will work in conjunction
with an ongoing USAID project focused on criminal justice. Subsequent phases would
expand quality improvement efforts, building on changes introduced earlier, but reinforced
by an overhaul of procedural codes. Specialization by courts in areas such as mining, tax
and administrative law would also be promoted.
Project Objectives
9.    Through support for the first phase of a comprehensive Judicial Reform Program,
the project aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of civil justice administration,
strengthen the capacity of the Judiciary to provide judicial services, and of the Ministry of
Justice to prepare, review and implement laws and programs related to the country's
constitutional, judicial, economic and social reforms.
Project Description
10.   The project would support: (a) judicial process reforms (42% of total base costs);
(b) human resource management reforms (16%); and (c) institutional strengthening of the
Judiciary (9%), all to be implemented by the Judiciary. Activities to be managed by the



3
Ministry of Justice would include: (a) implementation of constitutional reforms (6%);
(b) altemative dispute resolution (4%); (e) legislative reforrns (7%); and (d) institutional
strengthening of the Ministry of Justice (8%). While institutional reforms would benefit the
justice system as a whole, specific interventions would focus exclusively on civil justice.
11.   Judicialprocess reforms would represent the central effort to improve civil justice
administration, through: (a) the introduction of policy guidelines for handling civil judicial
proceedings; (b) training to improve judges' abilities to implement the new guidelines; (c)
establishment of information systems to track progress in cases and compliance with
duration guidelines; and (d) a reform of courtroom organization, based on clearly defined
structures, fuinctions and skills requirements.
12.   The human resource management component would restructure performance
incentives through: (a) the introduction of a judicial career system; (b) development of a
permanent training capacity, focused in particular on new judges appointed under the
career system; and (c) the development of ethical standards applicable to judges, and
mechanisms for enforcement of the standards. The career and ethics systems would be of
general application within the Judiciary, while training programs financed by the project
will focus exclusively on civil judges.
13.   Institutional strengthening of the Judiciay will include efforts to establish: (a) a
perrnanent planning systern, which will assume responsibility for preparation of the next phase
of the reform; (b) a legal studies office to advise the Court on judicial policies; and (c) a Judicial
Development Fund, to encourage demand-driven solutions to judicial administration issues.
The effects of these activities will be system-wide, except that subprojects under the Judicial
Development Fund will focus on civil courts.
14.   Implementation of constitutional reforms will consist of preparation of a law and
regulations for the Judicial Council and Constitutional Tribunal, as well an administrative
design and implementation plan. The component would support the provision of relevant
technical assistance, training and institution-building requirements (including purchasing
equipment) for these bodies. Its effects will be system-wide.
15.   The alternative dispute resolution component would help to introduce a system of
justices of the peace, as a complementary initiative aimed at marginalized urban, rural and
indigenous communities. Financing would be provided for preparation of a draft law, a one-
year pilot program, evaluation study and expansion plan. The justices of the peace are
expected to have a more significant effect on civil rather than criminal justice.
16.   Legislative reforms would be promoted to improve both the rules governing private
sector activity in specific areas and the mechanisms for their enforcement. Reforms would
focus on the Commercial and Civil Procedures Codes, and on introducing laws on altenative
dispute resolution, secured transactions and adminisrtive procedures.



4
17.   The component for institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Justice would
concentrate on developing the Ministry's capacity to improve the quality of primary and
secondary legislation in Bolivia, by establishing a Technical Office in the Ministry to provide
research and advisory services to those respensible for preparation legislation.
18.   The total project cost is estimated at US$12.75 million, including refinancing of a
US$0.5 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF)'. The proposed credit in an amount of
SDR 7.6 million (US$ 11.0 million equivalent) would finance 85% percent of project costs,
except for subprojects under the Judicial Development Fund which will be fully financed
by the credit. Project costs and financing are shown in detail in Schedule A. Procurement
and disbursement arrangements are given in Schedule B.
Project Implementation
19.   Interest in this comprehensive reform  program, and thus responsibility for its
implementation, are shared between the Executive and Judiciary, who have agreed on an
implementation plan that defines their respective roles based on the constitutional
separation of powers and their comparative advantages.
20.   The Supreme Court has established an Executive CounciL,2 responsible for policy
matters related to the refonn program, and a Program Directorate, responsible for
implementation of the Judiciary's components. The Directorate includes a full-time trinirng
coordinator and full-time personnel management expert.  In addition, the Information
Department of the Court will report to the Program  Directorate for purposes of the
inlbrination system components of the program.
21.   Since experience ofjudicial reform activities is very limited in Bolivia, the Ministry of
Justice and Executive Council have agreed on the need for a project office that would be
headed by a Coordinator with intemational experience ofjudicial reform prograr1Ls. This office
would have direct responsibility for implementation of the Ministry of Justice components, and
would monitor and support the reform process in generaL including through the provision of
advice on the Judiciary components of the project. It would be responsible for providing
timely information on all aspects of program implementation to the Govemment and IDA, and
would play a central role in the project implementation reviews to be carried out on an annual
basis.
1.    A Project Preparation Facility of US$1.5 million was approved in August 1993. US$0.5 million
of this facility was earmarked for preparation of the judicial refonn component of a proposed
Regulatory and Judicial Refonn ProjecL Subscxuenlly, the decision was taken to divide that
operation into separate projects, the Regulatory Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance
Project and the proposed Judicial Reform Project, and to allocate the reimbursement of the
facility pro rata between the two. The original Letter of Agreement was amended to rdlect this
change.
2.    The Council is composed of two Justices, the Minister of Justice or his representative, three
Appeals Court Judges and the President of the National Bar Association.



5
22.   Implementation will be paced to match a gradual build-up of institutional capacity,
and relies on pilot programs in several cases. A detailed implementation plan has been
agreed with the Judiciary and Ministry of Justice. Key outputs of the plan have been
singled out as progress indicators to be reviewed in semi-annual reports and during annual
implementation reviews.
Project Sustainability
23.   The proposed operation would support the first phase of a long-term reform
process. The sustainability of the process will depend on the continued commitment of
authorities to the long-term objectives of the program. The participatory process of
strzategy formulation and strong degree of program ownership at the various levels of the
Judiciary and Government will help to ensure that the chosen reform path is maintained.
In addition, the strong demand by all sectors of Bolivian society for radical reform of the
justice system provides a powerful incentive for authorities to persevere in the proposed
reform path. Finally, IDA's support of the reform program would also contribute to its
sustainability.
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement
24.   Since this project would represent EDA's first operation in support of justice
administration in Bolivia, no lessons of sectoral experience are available. Nevertheless,
Bank experience in Bolivia, as reflected in recent Project Completion Reports and a
Project Performance Audit Report (Schedule C), has identified the need for: (i) developing
clear understanding on policy objectives to ensure borrower comnmitment; (ii) building up
project implementation capacity; and (iii) periodic evaluations to permit adjustments in
design and implementation arrangements.
25.   In the design of the proposed operation, these lessons have been taken into
account. The development of a direct and frank dialogue with the Supreme Court, leaders
within the Judiciary, and the Ministry of Justice, has contributed to strong ownership of
the reform strategy. Institutional arrangements to ensure project implementation capacity
have been introduced up front during project preparation. Finally, annual implementation
reviews will be camed out to permit any necessary adjustments to the project's design and
implementation plan.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
26.   The proposed operation is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy
discussed by the Board on February 8, 1994, which cites judicial reformn as a key element
of IDA's stmtegy of encouraging private-sector-led growth by strengthening public
institutions so that they may play their vital complementary role. The project would
provide the basis for future operations aimed at strengthening the legal and institutional
framework for private sector development. It complements actions under other IDA
operations in Bolivia, in particular, the Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2298-BO),
Public Financial Management Operation II (Cr. 2279-BO), and the proposed CPAC and
accompanying technical assistance operations.



6
Agrmed Actions
27.   During negotiations, it was agreed that: (a) the Supreme Court would issue not
later than December 31, 1995 the Judicial Procedures Guidelines on conciliation, oral
procedures, the direct and active involvement of judges in the judicial process, and the
expected average duration of judicial procedures; and (b) the Ministry of Justice would
submit not later than June 30, 1996, for review and approval by the Association, the
specific proposal for establishment and operation of the system of Justices of the Peace;
28.   As a condition of disbursenents for subprojects under the Judicial Development
Fund, the Supreme Court would approve the Operational Manual for the processing,
approval and supervision of subprojects and set up the institutional arrangements for
handling the funds. Disbursements for activities related to the operation of the Judicial
Council and Constitutional Tribunal would be conditioned in each case on IDA's approval
of an implementation plan, and on satisfactory progress in the program for establishment
and operation of these entities.
Environmental Aspects
29.   The proposed project does not present environmental risks. and has been assigned
a ':" environmental rating.
Progaiam Objective Category
30.   This project would contribute to Private Sector Development objectives by
improving the quality and effectiveness of civil justice administration services
Participatory Approach
31.   Regional experience with judicial reform programs has highlighted the dangers of
trying to impose externally designed reforms on an unwilling judiciary. For that reason,
project preparation has involved a process of extensive consultation with leading
representatives of the judiciary and legal community. Seminars and workshops were held
to debate future strategies for the sector and to identify priority activities for the proposed
project. Results of these meetings were disseminated throughout the Judiciary. The
implementation plan, itself the result of a participatory process, includes several features
designed to ensure broad participation in project activities.
Project Benefits
32.   The proposed operation would support the first step in a process of reform that
would generate substantive benefits in the medium term by helping to establish an
institutional framework that ensures private agents' consistency and predictability in the
enforcement of their rights. The reforms would remove the serious distortions in Bolivia's
business environment that inhibit private investment and an efficient allocation of
resources. By levelling the playing field for investors, regardless of size or status, the
project would encourage private-sector-led development in a way that both raises growth



7
and improves equity. It would help to alleviate the economic and social costs imposed on
low-income groups by the prevailing justice system.
Risks
33.   The design of the operation is complicated by the need for coordination between
two branches of government. During preparation, this issue was addressed through joint
policy dialogue with the Executive and Judiciary. For implementation of the proposed
project, permanent channels of communication have been established between the two
branches. Most important, care has been taken to define clearly the tasks of each under
the project, so that the lines of responsibility are distinctly drawn.
34.   Other main risks are related to the institutional capacity of the judiciary, which has
limited experience in implementing refonn programs. The proposed project is dealing
with this risk by using a highly participatory approach to ensure strong commitment to the
reform program, and by early identification of the program's institutional needs. It -is
required up-front action on the institutional elements that would make successfil
implementation possible and is supporting firther institutional strengthening initiatives.
The judiciary's willingness to move decisively in these areas provides a clear indication of
the priority assigned to the reform program.
Recommendation
35.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
