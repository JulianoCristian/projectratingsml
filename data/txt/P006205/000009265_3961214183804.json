growth by facilitating private sector activity, and\n            to social welfare by guaranteeing the basic rights of all\n            citizens. The project will support two main sets of\n            activities. Those directly related to the daily operations\n            of the courts will be managed by the Judiciary and will\n            include: 1) judicial process reforms, designed to improve\n            the quality an swiftness of civil dispute resolution within\n            the current legislative framework; 2) human resource\n            management reforms, aimed at restructuring the incentives\n            under which judges and clerical personnel operate in order\n            to promote professional excellence and administrative\n            efficiency; and 3) institutional strengthening programs.\n            Activities not directly related to day-to-day court\n            functions will be managed by the Ministry of Justice and\n            focus on: 1) implementation of constitutional reforms, to\n            establish the new institutions of the modern Bolivian\n            judiciary; 2) alternative dispute resolution to improve\n            access to dispute-resolution services; 3) legislative\n            reforms designed to improve the legal environment for\n            private sector activity, and 4) institutional strengthening,\n            in support of the Ministry."}, "docdt": "1995-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
