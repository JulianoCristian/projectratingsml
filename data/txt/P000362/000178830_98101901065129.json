relevance to needs of small\n            farmers. The main actions of the project will be to first\n            (a) construct and upgrade the physical infrastructure and\n            strengthen technical, operational and managerial\n            capabilities of the Institute of Agronomic Research (IRA)\n            and the Institute of Animal Research (IRZ). It would also\n            (b) create central documentation and analytic units to\n            support the research system; and (c) introduce systematic\n            procedures for the review and programming of research and\n            for ensuring dissemination to the extension system."}, "docdt": "1986-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
