3. Program Description

3.a. The Overall Program

The objective of the Social Sectors Programmatic Credit program, a series of three single tranche
credits, is to ensure that progress in the areas of health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation
and social protection is maintained and that remaining disparities in outcomes across different regions,
ethnic groups and income classes are reduced, contributing to achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). The program is supporting the implementation of specific actions in each of these
areas, including measures to increase a results-based orientation in some programs, promote
accountability and strengthen participatory monitoring of the MDGs. The first credit, the Social
Sectors Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (SSPSAC I) (covered by this ICR) closed on
December 31, 2004. The preparation of the second credit, the Social Sectors Programmatic Credit
(SSPC II) (a Development Policy Lending, DPL), began in November 2004 and was approved by
Board on May 26, 2005.

A programmatic approach was adopted to maintain a priority on important progress in the social
sectors, yet allow for flexibility in specific actions and instruments. IDA support for this program is
consistent with the Bolivia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (January 8, 2004), which identified the
role of this program in supporting progress in the social sectors. The program is also consistent with
the CAS progress report currently under preparation (expected during the first half of FY06), which
will include the scope for the third credit. The overall program has been closely coordinated with the
international community, including joint financing with the German international development
agencies (KfW).

3.b. The SSPSAC I Project

The SSPSAC I, a SDR 17.2 million (US$25.0 million equivalent) credit, supported the GOB's Social
Sectors Program in the following areas (see also Policy Matrix in Annex 1):

Health and Nutrition: strengthen results-oriented health management at the municipal level; expand
coverage of primary health care with an intercultural approach, in order to reach underserved sectors
of the population; establish a human resources policy for the health sector that improves urban/rural
distribution and strengthens primary health care; implement policies to reduce malnutrition in children
under three years of age and anemia in pregnant women; and secure financing of programs aimed at
reducing the incidence of communicable diseases and increasing the coverage of immunizations.

Education: develop the Bolivian Educational Strategy with popular participation through the National
Education Council (Consejo Nacional de Educación, CONED) and the Second National Education
Congress; design and implement specific actions to improve secondary education and increase
completion rates.

Water and Sanitation: implement new financing and technical assistance policies for the sector and
measures to improve the management and efficiency of service providers, leading to increase access to
water and sanitation services.

Social Protection: create and implement a Social Safety Net (Red de Protección Social, RPS) that
includes coordination mechanisms with the Unique Directorate of Funds (Directorio Único de

Fondos, DUF1) programs, to be followed by the definition of a National Social Protection Strategy;
carry out improvements in the efficacy of the Emergency Employment Program (Programa de Empleo
Emergencia, PLANE), and introduction of incentives for municipalities to achieve the MDGs.

Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation of the MDGs: undertake measures in all sectors to increase
citizen access to information on public social sector expenditures, and consolidate a national system
for statistical information that includes users' opinions, for the participatory monitoring and evaluation
of progress towards achieving the MDGs at the national and municipal levels.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

ICR Rating: Satisfactory.            Overall, the SSPSAC I was successful in achieving its objective,
notwithstanding the fragile political and economic context in Bolivia and the less than satisfactory
performance in the water and sanitation sector, due to events that ensued after the approval of the
loan.2 This first credit has helped the GOB to maintain progress in the selected social sectors,
integrate key reforms and actions, and promote greater results orientation and accountability. The
SSPSAC I provided important budget support to a fragile economy, maintained a focus on the social
sectors in the national agenda, and assisted the GOB in refining its social sector strategy by providing
an anchor and a set of guideposts to the policies being implemented towards achieving the MDGs. All
of the policy actions in the Policy Matrix (Annex 1) were conditions prior to Board approval and the
credit disbursed shortly after effectiveness. All indications are that the actions supported by this
program have resulted in a satisfactory development outcome.                          The GOB has shown a strong
commitment to meeting the second phase triggers of the program and the SSPC II was approved in
May 2005. A summary of the main achievements and the current status is detailed below in Table 1
(see triggers and prior actions in the Policy Matrix in Annex 1).




               Table 1: Summary of Main Achievements of SSPSAC I and Current Status of Program
Health Objective: Reduce morbidity and mortality associated with transmissible diseases.

Achievements: Activities to extend health services to underserved areas included: (i) the regulation of Law 2042
provided an additional source of funding for disease promotion activities and immunization programs; (ii) an impact
evaluation of the Universal Mother and Child Insurance (Seguro Universal Materno-Infantil, SUMI) is in progress;
(ii) a bill of rights of pregnant women was published and disseminated, and surveys were implemented to review
quality of care and patients' satisfaction in indigenous populations; and (iv) an office in charge of the design of a
human resources policy for health was created in the Ministry of Health (MOH). The GOB also defined a set of
criteria to prioritize municipalities in terms of their likelihood of achieving the MDGs.

Current Status: The GOB is showing progress in a number of indicators related to immune-preventable diseases,
including in the Malaria-Control Program, the Chagas-Control Program, and the immunization program. The budget
of the immunization program has increased from Bs.15.6 million to Bs.19.7 million in 2004. The approved budget

interventions.
2Bolivia's current fragile socio-political environment is the result of stubborn high levels of poverty and inequality, and
governance weaknesses in a context of lower incomes as a result of the economic slowdown since 1999. Increasing
inequality has led to mobilizations of poor and long-excluded people. But these groups do not share yet a unified voice;
hence there are growing tensions among them, in particular among regions, social classes, and indigenous/non-indigenous
groups. As part of the social movement, there is a desire for greater political and economic power.


                                                               3

for 2005 is Bs.47 million. The program has also increased the number of doses of DPT vaccine from 188,567 to
195,738 between November 2003 and November 2004. The early results of the SUMI impact evaluation will be
available by late May 2005. A radio communications campaign was launched in the rural areas to promote SUMI's
services. A nutrition plan for at-risk municipalities was prepared. The service coverage for indigenous populations
has been targeted through a ministerial resolution that incorporates traditional doctors and midwives into the national
health system; special equipment was installed in 60 facilities to make them more culturally sensitive to indigenous
patients. The GOB distributed a performance agreement template to all municipalities and about 60 percent have
already signed them.
Education Objective: Contribute to the institutionalization of participative democracy in education.

Achievements: (i) Creation of the National Education Council (Consejo Nacional de Educación, CONED); (ii)
Preparation of a new educational council regulatory framework; (iii) Legal convening of the Second National
Education Congress (Congreso Nacional de Educación, CNE); (iv) Preparation of the Multi-annual Operational Plan
(POMA) 2004-2008, incorporating the MDGs in its objectives.

Current Status: The POMA was prepared and made public. The CONED discussed the POMA extensively and eight
of the nine departmental workshops were held. The 12 national thematic workshops were held and eight of the nine
departmental congresses were also held. Terms of Reference (TORs) were prepared for the secondary curricular
reform and the studies for the curricular reform are underway.
Water and Sanitation Objective: Improve the efficiency of investments in the sector through the implementation of
a new financing policy, the institutional modernization program, and a mechanism for institutional development.

Achievements: (a) Approval of Law 2649 (eliminates restrictions on channeling public investment resources directly
to all service providing utilities, including to cooperatives and to utilities managed by private operators). (b)
Enactment of a Supreme Decree that establishes a new financing policy and the Institutional Modernization Program
for the sector, including mechanisms for the allocation of credits and grants to the public or mixed water and
sanitation service providers (Empresas Prestadoras de Servicios de Agua y Saneamiento, EPSAS), either directly or
through the municipalities. (c) Enactment of the Supreme Decree to create the Foundation for Sustainability Support
of Basic Water and Sanitation (FUNDASAB--the entity that will support the institutional reforms and development
of the service providers and will provide technical assistance to the sector).

Current Status: After enacting the law and the supreme decrees, the GOB has concentrated on putting these policies
to work. There have been some challenges in this sector (see Section 5 below). The financial policy will be in effect
legally by May 2005 and its operating scheme will be ready for implementation. Consultants are working on the
institutional modernization program for the sector utilities and on the regulations that will allow FUNDASAB to
have a legal status by May 2004. The coverage targets of water and sewerage services show progress, having been
revised down two percentage points from the original objective of 89 and 51 percent of potable water coverage for
urban and rural areas respectively and 53 and 34 percent of sewerage in urban and rural areas respectively.
Social Protection Objective: Create and implement a national Social Safety Net (RPS) and develop a national Social
Protection strategy

Achievements: The GOB created the RPS within DUF, to implement medium-term counter-cyclical interventions in
a more systematic way. The first phase of the RPS consisted of income-generating mechanisms to address both high
unemployment and social unrest with two complementary programs: (i) a labor intensive projects component in
which the RPS would finance only labor costs (PLANE), and (ii) a small projects component in which the RPS
would transfer resources for financing entire projects (PROPAIS). Through DUF, part of the National Compensation
Policy (Política Nacional de Compensación, PNC) was being partially reformulated and PTC (Spanish acronym for a
policy of conditional transfers to municipalities) was designed. The initial mechanism was based on introducing a
scheme of incentives to local governments through matching grants. Specifically, through this scheme the GOB
defined a mechanism to encourage local governments to design and implement projects and interventions directly
related to the achievement of the MDGs. The GOB started a process to prepare a comprehensive and mid-term social
protection policy, which would be included as a trigger for the SSPC II. PLANE was adjusted to improve targeting

and effectiveness..

Current Status: The GOB has: (i) defined the specific MDGs that will be targeted with the PTC ­to reduce infant
mortality and to reduce maternal mortality; (ii) agreed with the MOH on the specific criteria to select municipalities,
allocate resources, and define the menu of interventions to be financed; (iii) re-allocated funds within the national
budget to finance the first phase of the process; and (iv) started implementing the PTC on a pilot basis.

The GOB is also currently implementing PLANE III as a counter-cyclical workfare program within the RPS. Yet, as
it is expected that the demand for this type of program will decline, the GOB has decided to phase out the program
with an exit strategy once the third phase is completed by the end of 2005.

The Social Cabinet started discussing a social protection strategy drafted by an inter-institutional team led by the
Analysis Unit for Social and Economic Policies (UDAPE) and DUF. This strategy, presented to the authorities in
May 2005, includes: (i) an analysis of vulnerabilities; (ii) priority policy areas of intervention; and (iii) main social
protection programs to address vulnerabilities in specific policy areas.

Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation of the MDGs Objective: (a) Develop the institutional capacity to
perform permanent evaluations of the progress in the achievement of the main indicators related to the MDGs; (b)
Include the opinion of the beneficiaries of the education, health and water and sanitation programs in the evaluation
of these services.

Achievements: The GOB presented a strategy for gathering and disseminating financial information at the municipal
level, disseminated the 2003 financial execution of the central government and those municipalities where it was
available, and published information with financial indicators and coverage of basic services, separated by gender,
ethnic groups and other variables pertaining to the MDGs at the municipal level. It also prepared departmental
reports with information on the execution of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) II resources and indicators
related to the MDGs for health, education, and water and basic sanitation. The GOB started a process to implement a
participative evaluation system of citizen report cards. On the technical issues related to monitoring and evaluation
of the MDGs, the GOB started to develop a strategy for the technical evaluation of the achievement of the MDGs,
including the conformation of an inter-sectoral technical committee, the preliminary identification of objectives,
goals and indicators, and the definition of a work plan to achieve the strategy.

Current Status: UDAPE published information on the MDG-related indicators for health, education and water and
sanitation disaggregated by gender and ethnic groups at the municipal level, and financial information regarding the
allocation and execution of HIPC resources. A process to disseminate information on the MDGs and sensitize
grassroots' organizations and municipalities on the need to work towards reaching targets has started. The GOB
adopted the methodology of citizen report cards to evaluate a number of social programs and an NGO has been
contracted and has begun its implementation. The GOB has established a technical and multisectoral strategy for the
evaluation of progress made in the achievement of the MDGs in the health, education and water and sanitation
sectors. SSPSAC I supported the development of the Governmental Information and Administrative Reform System
(SIGMA) a system of public sector accounts, yet there are some concerns about the system and a study is currently
being carried out.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

The major factors affecting implementation of this program have been unprecedented rapid political
changes and the ensuing uncertainty. However, considering these radical changes over the past year
and continuing unrest, the results of the SSPSAC I operation and the overall program have not been
significantly affected. Indeed, the program support to the social sectors is likely ameliorating the
negative impacts of the crisis on the poorest populations.

Political Context. The current administration continues to endure significant pressures from different
and oftentimes opposing forces in society. The main issues that could affect program results are: (i)
the still fragile political situation and latent potential for social unrest; (ii) the uncertain effects on the


                                                             5

economy of the recently approved Hydrocarbons Law, and the country's different views on when and
if to call a Constitutional Assembly that would discuss, among other things, regional autonomies; and
(iii) the issue of water privatization in the populous township of El Alto, which is adjacent to La Paz
(see below).

Water and Sanitation Sector. Due to recent developments in the water and sanitation sector (protests
concerning high new connection charges and private participation in service provision, request to
terminate the private sector concession in El Alto and La Paz, and possible departure of the French
concessionaire), IDA and the KfW agreed with the GOB that it would be useful to continue
monitoring the global policies for this sector, providing technical assistance, but it is not possible to
support these policies with funding until the uncertainty is resolved. While the Bank acknowledges
the progress made in the global policies for the sector, under the current circumstances it is not
possible to assert that the global policies are being implemented fully. For this reason it was agreed to
reduce the amount of the SSPC II credit from US$25M to US$15M, but in recognition of the GOB's
effort, the triggers were not be eliminated, but rather turned into benchmarks. If the GOB continues to
implement reforms, if an acceptable solution is adopted for La Paz/El Alto and if the sector
performance improves, the water sector triggers might be reincorporated into the third credit.

Hydrocarbons Law. The recent debate on the new Hydrocarbon Law revealed deep divisions in
Bolivian society. As it currently stands, the approved law could have significant impact on the
economy. Even though revenues from higher taxes will increase in the short term, the gas companies
currently working in Bolivia have stated that they will not increase their investments in the country,
which could have negative long term consequences.

Economic Context. Even though the fiscal situation is not as dire as it was when the SSPSAC I was
approved, there is still urgency in providing budget support, as the budget deficit, though lower than a
year ago, is still high, which could require cuts in all public expenditures, possibly reducing the
investments on the social sectors.

Participatory Processes. Since the approval of the SSPSAC I, Bolivia has followed an impressive
participatory approach to define its medium-term strategy for development. The 2004 National
Dialogue involved almost 70,000 representatives of different stakeholder groups and the main
conclusions have been considered in the SSPC II.           Other activities like the national education
workshops, departmental congresses, and political discussions have a positive impact in Bolivia, but
they have weakened the ability of the current government to implement strong policies on its own.
The need to reach consensus with political parties in congress, and with many different power groups
outside the traditional party organization, has sometimes reduced the capacity of the GOB to act
independently.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank: Satisfactory. IDA's performance is rated satisfactory for the following reasons. First, IDA
supported an operation that is consistent with the CAS and contributes to the implementation of
Bolivia's Social Sectors program. IDA prudently supported the GOB's objectives and targets related
to the MDGs, which the country is strongly committed to implement. Second, the Bank helped the
GOB in designing the Policy Matrix and selecting the appropriate lending instrument.                The
programmatic approach has provided an opportunity for sustained, but flexible support to the social



                                                     6

sectors through a period of potentially deep changes in the country. Third, the preparation of the
program was timely and it provided critical budget support. Fourth, the Bank provided quality
technical assistance to the GOB and there was substantial sector work on the social protection
framework, the health and nutrition sector, education, and a poverty assessment, and lessons learned
from other operations supporting decentralization, institutional reform, and social protection. Fifth,
IDA worked effectively with the GOB to ensure that the credit was declared effective and disbursed
soon after effectiveness to meet Bolivia's financial needs. Finally, IDA considered environmental
sustainability recommendations in the health, water and sanitation, and social protection sectors and
many of the actions to be supported by the program are directed at improving access to social services
in predominately indigenous areas.

Borrower. Satisfactory. In the absence of a "Moderately Satisfactory" category, the Borrower's
performance is rated satisfactory for the following reasons. First, the GOB developed a clear vision of
the actions and support needed in the social sectors and even in a time of great change, the policies
have been embraced by the new officials. This commitment to these important sectors has guided the
preparation and implementation of the operation. The GOB maintained focus on the overall objective.
Second, the GOB ensured that the actions could be achieved as planned. Third, despite the turmoil of
the recent years, the MDGs have been maintained as an anchor in the national debate and a target used
for implementation of policies. The GOB, as represented by all the agencies involved in this operation
including the Ministries of Finance, Health, and Education, have shown a very strong commitment to
working together to implement this programmatic operation.               Finally, in coordination with this
program, the GOB has set up a technical group in charge of coordinating policies among different
sectors, with the MDGs as guiding principles, and this group has been working in setting up the
instruments that will allow it to monitor progress towards the MDGs and the impact of different
policies.

On the other hand, the recent events in the water and sanitation sector have created some uncertainty
as to the future of the overall investment policy in the sector, and this is why the Borrower's
performance should have been rated as moderately satisfactory if that option were available.

Institutional Development Impact and Sustainability: Modest and Likely, respectively. The
SSPSAC I contains a number of actions that have the potential to provide support for developing the
institutional capacity in Bolivia. For example the regulatory framework in the water and sanitation
sector, the support to the inter-institutional committee to evaluate MDGs, and the support to the
development of a social protection strategy among others. However, the political problems affecting
Bolivia at this time could outweigh the positive forces implied by the actions included in the SSPSACI
and therefore institutional development is rated "modest". The sustainability of the actions is difficult
to establish at this particular stage, because of the fragile political situation that has prompted the
resignation of President Mesa and the replacement of the entire cabinet. If it were available, a
preferable rating at this time would be "not evaluable". However Bolivia has a good track record in
the recent past of maintaining the course in the social sectors, even after similar changes at the highest
levels of government (e.g. resignation of President Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003). Therefore at
this stage there is no reason to doubt that the actions accomplished with the support of the SSPSACI
will be maintained and sustainability is rated "likely".

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

The main findings of this operation are the following:

Appropriate Instrument. This Social Sectors programmatic series, now entering its second phase,
continues to be the right instrument to support Bolivia's social policies at this point in time. In
addition to the urgent need for budget support, the program acknowledges the commitment to global
policies that the GOB is maintaining in the social sectors, yet at the same time provides some
flexibility in specific actions. The contents in the program are expected to remain highly relevant
irrespective of how the current uncertainty is resolved.

Selectivity. The support provided by the SSPSAC I was selective, it did not focus on all the MDGs but
a few, related to education, health, and water and sanitation. It built mostly upon existing institutions
and legal frameworks rather than seek legislative changes, which at this moment would be unwise. It
did not focus on activities designed to improve income or consumption measures of poverty, as those
policies are being currently discussed as part of the revision of the PRSP and will be supported
through other channels.

Need for consensus-building. The Bolivian political context has undergone several radical changes
over the past year and the GOB is faced with significant pressures from different and opposing forces
in society. There has been a surge of popular participation in national political decisions, which has
led to an unprecedented need for a broad-based consensus-building process. In this context, the
subsequent credits should focus on supporting policies that will increase the "voice" of certain groups
that have been silent in the past. This may include a higher level of participation of civil society in
evaluating the quality of basic services and higher accountability in the use of resources.
