programmatic operations:\n            Social Sectors Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SSPSAC I) and Social Sector Programmatic Development Policy\n            Credit II (SSPC II). The SSPSAC I has a satisfactory\n            outcome, and is likely to be sustainable. Both the\n            Bank's and Borrower's performance are\n            satisfactory. The outcome of the SSPCII is moderately\n            unsatisfactory and there is a significant risk to\n            development outcome. The performance of the Bank and\n            Borrower is moderately satisfactory. Among the lessons cited\n            for both operations were the following: 1) the programmatic\n            approach was a suitable instrument to help anchor policy in\n            a period of growing uncertainty and instability; 2) using\n            progress in a few selected Millennium Development Goals\n            (MDGs) as a theme provided a well focused overall objective;\n            3) clearer guidelines are needed for the role of supervision\n            when a Development Policy Lending (DPL) program is\n            interrupted; 4) the design of the monitoring system for this\n            operation could have been improved; 5) a stronger alliance\n            between the Ministry of Finance and line ministries and\n            agencies is critical for meeting agreed benchmarks; and 6)\n            the Bolivian context requires support for broad-based consensus-building."}, "docdt": "2006-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
