Findings and implications: the Social Sectors\n            programmatic series, now entering its second phase,\n            continues to be the right instrument to support\n            Bolivia's social policies at this point in time. The\n            support provided by the Social Sectors Programmatic\n            Structural Adjustment Credit I (SSPSAC I) was selective, it\n            did not focus on all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\n            but a few, related to education, health, and water and\n            sanitation. The Bolivian political context has undergone\n            several radical changes over the past year and the\n            Government of Bolivia (GOB) is faced with significant\n            pressures from different and opposing forces in society."}, "docdt": "2005-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
