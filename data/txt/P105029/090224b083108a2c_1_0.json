Colombia experienced\n            economic stagnation during the late 1990s and the early\n            2000s, and the financial crisis during that period curtailed\n            firms\u2019 access to funding. With support from the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            (IBRD), Colombia has implemented reforms to improve the\n            business environment, develop the financial sector, and\n            foster innovation. As the global financial crisis deepened\n            in October 2008, IBRD also backed several measures to\n            strengthen the sector\u2019s resilience The World Bank\u2019s efforts\n            supported several reforms, identified in a series of sector\n            studies backed by IBRD. The reforms improved the business\n            environment and fostered capital market development,\n            considered key to sustaining growth and alleviating poverty,\n            which benefited the whole Colombian population."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T05:44:00Z"}
