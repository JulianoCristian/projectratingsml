                      THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

Recipient              Georgia
Implementing Agency    Ministry of Finance
Financing Data         IDA Credit of SDR 25.0 million (US$40 million equivalent).
                       IDA terms: 25 year maturity including a 5 year grace period.
Operation Type         Programmatic Development Policy Operation (DPO)
Main Policy Areas      The proposed Third Development Policy Operation (DPO-3) is the third
                       in a series of three programmatic development policy operations intended
                       to support the Government of Georgia’s policy reform program to (i)
                       mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in the short-term; and (ii)
                       facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the
                       medium-term. In addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal
                       framework, the main policy areas supported are: (i) improving the
                       efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the
                       effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external
                       competitiveness.
Key Outcome            The macroeconomic and fiscal framework includes significant fiscal
Indicators             adjustment to safeguard sustainability as economic recovery takes hold
                       during 2010-13, following the countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate
                       the downturn during 2008-2009. Improved efficiency and effectiveness
                       of public expenditures are directed at facilitating fiscal adjustment and
                       creating the conditions to sustain recovery and post-crisis growth in the
                       medium term. Improved effectiveness of the social safety net is directed
                       at cushioning the impact of the downturn and ensuring that the benefits of
                       post-crisis growth are broadly shared. Improved external competitiveness
                       is directed at ensuring that a vibrant and competitive tradable private
                       sector sustains economic recovery and serves as the engine of post-crisis
                       growth in the medium term.
Program Development    The DPO series supports the objectives of the Government’s policy
Objective(s) and       reform program, which are to mitigate the impact of the downturn in the
Contribution to CPS    short-term and facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis
                       growth in the medium term. The proposed DPO-3 emphasizes the second
                       objective, to sustain the economic recovery and prepare the conditions for
                       post-crisis growth. These development objectives are central to the 2010-
                       2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) which is built upon the twin
                       pillars of meeting post-conflict vulnerability needs and strengthening
                       competitiveness for post-crisis growth. The CPS Progress Report which
                       rebalances emphasis toward the intersection of the two pillars was
                       discussed by the Board in April 2011.
Risks and Risk         Georgia faces a number of macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities.
Mitigation             First, given the uncertain global economic outlook, the external
                       environment could suffer a renewed deterioration, which would
                       negatively impact exports, remittances, FDI, and other private capital
                       inflows. Second, renewed domestic and regional tensions or other factors
                       could affect investor and consumer confidence, which would constrain
                       further private investment and growth of credit to the private sector.
                       These scenarios would have an adverse impact on the growth outlook and
                       require further external adjustment, including further realignment of the
                                               1
               real exchange rate, faster fiscal adjustment, and additional official
               financing. Such a scenario would also add to the public debt burden and
               increase the ratio of nonperforming loans of the banking sector.
                  Third, increases in food and fuel prices could intensify or result in
               second-round effects onto the prices of other products, which would raise
               pressures to further tighten monetary policy and also increase the fiscal
               costs for assistance to the vulnerable. Fourth, the 2012-13 elections carry
               the risk of adding to fiscal pressures.
                  These risks are mitigated by a number of factors. First, the authorities
               are committed to the fiscal adjustment program and a flexible exchange
               rate policy, which provide key anchors for external and debt
               sustainability. Second, Georgia’s debt burden indicators remain within
               relevant prudential thresholds, with successful refinancing of the
               Eurobond in April 2011 providing a strong vote of confidence from
               capital markets. Third, on price pressures, the NBG has already
               preemptively tightened policy, which should help stabilize inflation to
               about 8.5 percent by end-2011. Fourth, the authorities have front-loaded
               a good part of fiscal adjustment and are committed to financing additional
               necessary expenditures through savings in other areas or through
               improvements in revenue collection.
                  On mitigating regional tensions, mediation efforts are ongoing with
               support from the international community and bilateral partners.
               Domestically, political conditions remain stable, with parliamentary and
               presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and 2013, respectively.

            PROPOSED THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
                             TO GEORGIA


                                 I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Third Development Policy Operation (DPO-3) is the third in a
series of three programmatic development policy operations for Georgia. The DPO
series was prepared in the aftermath of the twin crises of the August 2008 conflict and the
global economic downturn. It also follows the successful completion in 2008 of the PRSO
series which supported far-reaching reforms since 2004 with impressive results. The DPO
series is a central component supporting structural reforms in Georgia of the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering 2010-13, which is built upon the twin pillars of meeting
post-conflict vulnerability needs and strengthening competitiveness for post-crisis growth.
The CPS Progress Report which rebalances emphasis toward the intersection of the two
pillars was discussed by the Board in April 2011. The proposed DPO-3, in the amount of $40
million equivalent, supports the strategic developmental objectives of the Government’s
medium term reform program described in its poverty reduction strategy document entitled
“United Georgia without Poverty”, supplemented by the annual “Basic Data and Directions”
document.

2.      The reforms supported by the DPO series are directed at: (i) mitigating the
impact of the economic downturn in the short-term; and (ii) facilitating recovery and
preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium-term. The double shocks to the
economy from the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global economic crisis resulted in
a sharp downturn in economic growth to 2.3 percent in 2008 and 3.8 percent contraction in
2009, from growth in excess of 9 percent during 2004 to mid-2008. In this context, DPO-1
balanced support for immediate crisis mitigating measures with structural reforms while
DPO-2 facilitated an orderly transition in the focus of the authorities from immediate
mitigating measures toward preparing the conditions for post-crisis growth.

3.       The proposed DPO-3 shifts emphasis toward measures directed at sustaining the
economic recovery and preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term.
Although growth has rebounded strongly to an estimated 6.4 percent in 2010, challenges
remain in sustaining the economic recovery and in creating the conditions for sustained post-
crisis growth. To address these challenges, the proposed DPO-3 program supports a
satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework and key reforms organized under three
pillars: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the
effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external competitiveness.

4.      The reforms supported by the proposed DPO-3 are contributing to a number of
important objectives. First, under the macroeconomic and fiscal framework, fiscal
adjustment to safeguard sustainability is being implemented in a manner that protects
important social and infrastructure investment expenditures. Second, improvements in the
efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures are facilitating fiscal adjustment and
ensuring that expenditures are targeted better at sustaining recovery and creating the
conditions for post-crisis growth. The associated adjustment should also free up domestic
resources to finance private sector growth in an environment where foreign capital inflows are

                                              3
expected to remain scarce. Third, tax, customs, and trade-related reforms are improving
external competitiveness by further reducing the burden of tax payment, streamlining customs
procedures, and creating the pre-conditions for improved access of Georgian products to
world markets. Fourth, the effectiveness of the social safety net is being improved to ensure
that the benefits of growth in the medium term are broadly shared.

5.      The DPO series is anchored in a strong Government program to respond to the
crisis in the short term and implement key structural reforms in the medium term. In
response to the double shocks, the authorities adopted a number of immediate mitigating
measures. These included the scaling up of critical social and infrastructure investment
expenditures as part of a countercyclical fiscal response, providing liquidity and regulatory
support to the banking sector, and working with the international community to secure donor
assistance.

6.     The Government’s response to the crisis has received broad support from the
international community. Following a “Joint Needs Assessment” (JNA) in October 2008
led by the World Bank and the United Nations (with the collaboration of ADB, EC, EBRD,
EIB, and IFC), and an International Donor Conference in Brussels, Georgia received pledges
of financial support from the international community of $4.5 billion over three years,
including $850 million for the banking sector. Furthermore, the IMF Board in September
2008 approved a $750 million Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was subsequently
augmented by about $400 million and extended to June 2011. The Ninth and final Review of
the IMF program was successfully completed on June 8, 2011. Support from the international
community has included general budget support from the World Bank, ADB, US Treasury,
and the EC. The Dutch Government has provided co-financing of Euro 4.5 million for DPO-1
and DPO-2.

7.      The Government’s medium term structural reform program addresses key
medium-term post-crisis development challenges (see Section IV). The areas of the
Government’s reform program include: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability through
fiscal adjustment and single-digit inflation; (ii) generating employment by restoring rapid
economic growth, upgrading infrastructure, ensuring high quality education, and maintaining
a market-friendly business environment; (iii) enhancing competitiveness by continuing to
reduce the burden of the state, maintaining an open trade regime, and establishing a deep and
comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU; (iv) continuing to improve public service
delivery; and (v) strengthening the social safety net comprising the two pillars of social
assistance and health insurance with a focus on enhancing access for the most vulnerable.

8.     The reforms supported by the DPO program have strong Government
ownership. The Bank has focused the DPO on areas where it has comparative advantage and
by working closely with other development partners, is leveraging resources, expertise, and
technical support. With the Government having strong ownership of the reforms supported
by the DPO (which are part of a broader Government reform program) with close
collaboration of development partners, the Government of Georgia is in the driver’s seat in
these reforms efforts. This strong ownership ensures implementation and safeguards
sustainability of the reforms supported by the DPO.

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
9.     During much of the first decade of transition, Georgia was one of the poorest
performing economies in the Europe and Central Asia region. In 2003, real GDP was at
about 40% of its 1989 level and Georgia was a weak state, with accumulating unpaid pensions
and wages, electricity service limited to a few hours per day, weak public finances, and
pervasive corruption.

10.     From 2004 through mid-2008, Georgia implemented far-reaching reforms with
impressive results. Reforms were undertaken to strengthen public finances, improve the
business environment, upgrade infrastructure services, and improve social services. As a
result, economic growth averaged in excess of 9 percent per year during 2004 through mid-
2008. A key driver of this growth was substantial inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI),
which increased from $542 million (8.5 percent of GDP) in 2005 to $1.67 billion (16.4
percent of GDP) in 2007. This was made possible by strengthening investor confidence
resulting from improvements to the business environment, with Georgia’s Doing Business
rank improving from 112th place in 2005 to 15th place in 2008. In addition, far-reaching trade
liberalization was implemented in 2007, which made Georgia one of the most open trading
regimes in the world, with a very low average tariff and with 91 percent of product lines
subject to a zero tariff.

11.     Another key pillar of growth and stability in Georgia from 2004 through mid-
2008 was its strengthening public finances. As a result of tax reform and effective anti-
corruption measures, tax revenues increased from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 25.8
percent of GDP in 2007. This major achievement allowed the government to increase social
and infrastructure investment expenditures which in turn contributed to the strong growth
performance of the private sector. Budget execution and public financial management
systems improved during this period, particularly through the implementation of the Treasury
Single Account. Effective public debt management led to steady improvement in debt burden
indicators, with external public debt declining from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to 17.5
percent of GDP in 2007.

12.      Georgia experienced a sharp downturn in economic growth as a result of the
double shocks from the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global economic crisis.
The double shocks led to deterioration in investor and consumer confidence, contraction in
foreign direct investment, exports, and remittances, and a cutback in bank lending. As a
result, the economy grew by only 2.3 percent in 2008 and contracted by 3.8 percent in 2009,
which was a sharp slowdown from rapid growth in excess of 9 percent during the preceding
four years (see table 1 and figures 1 and 2). FDI inflows collapsed from $1.67 billion (16.4
percent of GDP) in 2007 to $659 million (6.1 percent of GDP) in 2009, while exports fell
from 31 percent of GDP in 2007 to 29.8 percent in 2009. The downturn during 2008-09 was
concentrated in those sectors which fueled strong growth during the preceding four years,
including construction, manufacturing, and services (particularly retail and wholesale trade,
hotels and restaurants, and transport).

13.    The authorities responded swiftly with a countercyclical fiscal stimulus to
mitigate the downturn. Public expenditures increased from 34 percent of GDP in 2007 to

                                              5
38.4 percent in 2009 and the fiscal stimulus was also associated with a marked reprioritization
of expenditures. Expenditures on transport infrastructure, as well as on education, health, and
social protection were scaled up, with the fiscal space for these increases coming in part from
a marked reduction of defense expenditures. At the same time, tax revenues declined from
25.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24.4 percent in 2009. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit
widened from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.2 percent in 2009. The higher fiscal deficits
have been financed primarily through increased donor support.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
14.     Economic recovery took hold in 2010, with growth patterns suggesting that the
drivers of growth in the post-crisis period are evolving. The economy rebounded strongly
by an estimated 6.4 percent in 2010. The recovery has been led by a strong rebound in
several sectors, including manufacturing (20.3 percent), construction (7.6 percent), and
services including transport (13.1 percent), wholesale and retail trade (14.1 percent), and
hotels and restaurants (12.9 percent). The recovery has benefited from a pickup in exports,
tourism, bank lending, and continued high levels of public investment. At the same time, FDI
inflows have remained weak at 4.7 percent of GDP in 2010, down from 12 percent in 2008.
This suggests that the underlying drivers of growth are evolving in the post-crisis period, with
a greater role for domestic private investment and the tradables sector. Private investment
rates have recovered only modestly in 2010, suggesting that the strong growth rebound has
been facilitated in part by higher capacity utilization.

15.     The rebound in both merchandise and services exports have played a major role
in the economic recovery. Exports of goods and services were up to 34.8 percent of GDP in
2010 from 29.8 percent in 2009. Merchandise exports (up 39.5 percent y-o-y in 2010) were
composed primarily of metals and metal products, repaired and remanufactured vehicles,

wines and beverages, and fruits and nuts (together accounting for more than 60 percent). The
leading export destinations include Azerbaijan, Turkey, United States, Armenia, Ukraine,
Canada, and Bulgaria, which together accounted for more than 65 percent of Georgia’s
merchandise exports in 2010. The rebound in the services sector has been driven in part by
the recovery of export of services, including tourism and transport. Export of services was up
21.9 percent (y-o-y) in 2010, with tourism and transport receipts up 38.5 percent and 12.0
percent, respectively. The number of tourists increased by 36 percent to 2.03 million in 2010,
with the bulk of visitors (1.58 million) coming from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. The
export rebound has benefited from improved conditions in external markets as well as real
exchange rate (RER) depreciation in the post-crisis period.

16.     Significant external adjustment has taken place in the post-crisis period as the
exchange rate has remained flexible in the face of lower FDI and other private capital
inflows. The external current account deficit has adjusted from 22.7 percent of GDP in 2008
to 11.2 percent in 2009 and 9.6 percent in 2010. From 2008 to 2010, imports were down by
6.1 percentage points of GDP and exports were up by 6.1 percentage points of GDP. This
external adjustment has been facilitated by the credible fiscal program and a flexible exchange
rate. The real exchange rate (RER) depreciated by about 13.2 percent between October 2008
and October 2010 after appreciating by 38 percent in the pre-crisis period (from 2004 through
October 2008). More recently, as private capital inflows have picked up, the RER has
appreciated by 10 percent between October 2010 and March 2011, although exports have
continued to grow by 36 percent in the first quarter of 2011. The macroeconomic framework
has been supported by a $1.15 billion IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) approved in
September 2008 to bolster investor confidence and support international reserves. Gross
international reserves improved from 2.4 months of imports ($1.48 billion) in 2008 to 4.5
months of imports ($2.26 billion) in 2010.

17.     The authorities have implemented fiscal adjustment in 2010 as recovery has
taken hold. The overall fiscal deficit declined from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.6
percent in 2010. Most of the adjustment has come from expenditure consolidation,
particularly current expenditures, including further cuts in defense expenditures. Overall
expenditures declined from 38.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 34.8 percent in 2010, with current
expenditures declining from 30.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 26 percent in 2010. Defense and
internal security expenditures declined from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.2 percent in

                                                                                                                                                        7
2010. Capital Expenditures actually edged up from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.8 percent
in 2010 as the authorities sought to support economic recovery in the face of continued weak
FDI inflows. Important social expenditures have also been protected in 2010: although
education, health, and social protection expenditures declined from 12 percent of GDP in
2009 to 10.8 percent in 2010, they remain up from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2007 and have held
steady at about 34.5 percent of the budget between 2009 and 2010.

18.     External public debt increased during 2008-10, although much of the new debt is
concessional. As growth slumped and Georgia borrowed externally to finance the fiscal
stimulus, the level of public external debt increased from 17.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 33.7
percent in 2010. A good part of the post-conflict financial assistance has, however, been in
the form of grants and concessional loans. The composition of Georgia’s total public external
debt stock of $4 billion (at end-February 2011) was 72.5 percent multilateral, 15 percent
bilateral, and 12.5 percent Eurobond, with an average weighted interest cost of 2.0 percent.
Private debt almost doubled in the lead up to the downturn, but then declined as the private
sector made large repayments in 2009.

19.     In April 2011, Georgia received a strong vote of confidence from international
capital markets by successfully refinancing its Eurobond. In April 2011, Georgia
successfully issued a new 10-year benchmark Eurobond at very favorable terms ($500 million
at a 6.875% coupon rate and 7.125% yield), with the offer more than 5 times oversubscribed
(an order book of $2.66 billion). The issuance was combined with a concurrent exchange of
$417 million (83%) of the previously issued 5-year Eurobond coming due in 2013. This has
allowed Georgia to smooth out its debt repayment profile by significantly reducing the 2013
debt service spike.

20.     Inflation has picked up markedly since the second half of 2010 after being in the
low single digits for most of the post-crisis period. Inflation picked up to 11.2 percent
(end-of-year) in 2010 and 14.3 percent (y-o-y) in May 2011 from 3 percent in 2009. This has
been driven primarily by higher international food and fuel prices (with food prices up 30.7
percent y-o-y in May 2011 and fuel prices up 21.4 percent). Food and fuel account for about
half of the consumption basket and about a third of the merchandise import basket, which
have contributed to the pass-through from global to domestic prices. In response to the
inflationary pressures, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) has progressively raised the
refinancing rate from 5 percent in June 2010 to 8 percent in February 2011. So far, there is no
evidence of second round effects on prices of products other than food or fuel (with core
inflation at about 2 percent). The authorities have also responded by distributing GEL 57
million (US$ 34 million) in untargeted food and electricity vouchers and by announcing a
plan to raise pensions by 25 percent from September 2011.

21.    Liquidity and capitalization of the banking sector have improved since mid-2009
and NPLs have abated, but the banking sector remains highly dollarized. Banking sector
deposits have grown strongly since mid-2009 and banks have raised precautionary balances
and increased loan provisioning, with the result that liquidity and capitalization indicators
improved significantly. The capital adequacy ratio remains above prudential levels at 17.3
percent (national definition) or 27.5 (Basel I definition) at end-March 2011. The profitability
of the banking sector has improved, with return-on-equity returning to positive territory in
2010. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) has eased from a peak of 8.3 percent in
September 2009 to 5 percent in March 2011, although it remains elevated compared to pre-

                                              8
crisis levels.1 The banking system also remains substantially dollarized, with about 74
percent of loans and 71 percent of deposits in foreign currency at end-February 2011. As a
result, while the direct currency-induced credit risk to bank balance sheets from exchange rate
depreciation is limited, the indirect risk through balance sheets of borrowers is significant.

22.    The authorities have taken a number of steps to enhance bank supervision and
encourage de-dollarization. The NBG has embarked upon a plan to further strengthen bank
supervision practices through gradual migration to risk-based supervision and has enhanced
its capacity in this regard. Amendments approved in September 2009 to the law on
commercial banks provide the supervisor authority to adjust regulatory requirements based on
bank-by-bank risk assessments. The NBG periodically undertakes stress tests of the banking
sector which indicate that the capitalization of banks should be adequate to deal with the
impacts of the indirect currency-induced credit risk stemming from the balance sheets of
borrowers. It is also monitoring recent increases in nonresident deposits and is considering
measures to limit banks’ reliance on nonresident deposits as a funding base for domestic
lending. The NBG has also taken a number of steps to encourage de-dollarization.

POVERTY DEVELOPMENTS

23.     Growth during 2004-07 was associated with improvements in several indicators
of well-being of the poor, although the economic downturn led to higher poverty in 2009.
Comparisons based on the annual national Household Budget Surveys (HBS) undertaken in
2003 and 2009 suggest a reduction in the poverty headcount during this period, from 28.5% in
2003 to 22.7% in 2008, and then rising to 24.7% in 2009 during the crisis (figures 3 and 4).2
Real household consumption per adult equivalent increased from 122 GEL in 2003 to 141
GEL in 2008 (about a 16 percent increase, in 2007 prices), before declining to GEL 136 in
2009. Inequality also followed a similar pattern, with the Gini coefficient declining from 38.0
in 2003 to 33.8 in 2008, before ticking up to 34.1 in 2009. Urban areas experienced a more
rapid decline in poverty than rural areas through 2008, and a smaller impact from the 2009
downturn. Urban poverty incidence declined from 23.7 percent in 2003 to 17.5 percent in
                        Figure 3                                                    Figure 4

  The NPL ratio quoted in the text is based on the standard IMF definition. According to the national definition,
which uses a broad classification of NPLs, the ratio has eased from a peak of 18.8 percent in June 2009 to 11.9
percent in March 2011.

percent in 2003 to 27.8 percent in 2008, before increasing to 30.7 percent in 2009.

24.     Important non-income dimensions of welfare have improved for those in the
bottom deciles of the population since 2004. These gains include significantly improved
access to electricity, natural gas, safe water, health, and higher education. Finally, during this
period, Georgia put in place an effective social safety net which, simulations indicate, have
had a significant impact in reducing the incidence of poverty.

25.    Evidence on the impact of the crisis suggests that greater hardship resulted in
particular from higher unemployment. Unemployment increased from 13.3 percent in
2007 to 16.5 percent in 2008 and further to 16.9 percent in 2009. Unemployment would have
been higher without the crisis mitigating measures adopted by the Government and it has
subsequently eased somewhat to 16.3 percent in 2010 as economic recovery has taken hold.
Survey data suggests that job loss was one of the most commonly cited reasons for increased
hardship resulting from the economic downturn.

26.    Another important transmission channel was household debt.                  Increased
borrowing during the rapid growth years left Georgian households vulnerable to the financial
shock in 2008. Household loans—including mortgages, credit card debt, and other consumer
credit—increased as credit became more widely available. A large share of the new
borrowing was denominated in foreign currencies and at higher interest rates. Households
were thus exposed on three fronts when the financial crisis hit, facing higher interest rates,
higher foreign exchange rates, and lower incomes. A large number of households assumed
new debt during the crisis.

27.      An analysis of poverty trends in 2010 will be undertaken once household survey
data becomes available during the second half of 2011. An important influence will be the
impact of higher global food and energy prices. Simulations undertaken as part of a regional
report suggest that Georgia may be one of the more vulnerable countries in ECA to the food
and fuel price shocks.3 However, the impact on poverty is difficult to predict, and will be
partly mitigated among those rural households which are also sellers and producers of food
commodities. In addition, as discussed, the Georgian authorities have already undertaken
initiatives to distribute food and electricity vouchers and to increase pensions for the elderly,
which should also help to reduce the impact.

28.     The economy is projected to grow by about 5 percent per year during 2011-14,
which will require higher private domestic investment and productivity in the tradable
sectors. Growth is projected at 5.5 percent in 2011, moderating to about 5 percent during
2012-2014. Exports, expected to play a key role in driving economic recovery, are projected
to expand further from 34.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 36.7 percent in 2011 and 39 percent by
2014. Export growth is expected to come from new products, as well as further growth of the
current export basket, including metals and metal products, wines and beverages, fruits and
nuts, and repaired and re-exported cars on the product side; and transport and tourism on the
services side. The authorities are refocusing their efforts to raise productivity and private

investment in tradables through targeted investments in infrastructure, initiatives to attract
private investors, reforms to enhance market access and raise quality and standards, and
renewed discussions on improving skills. Private investment is projected to recover from 8.3
percent of GDP in 2010 to 9.7 percent in 2011 and 15.3 percent by 2014. With FDI projected
to remain at 5-6 percent of GDP, most of the investment recovery is expected to come from
higher private domestic investment, projected to increase from 4 percent of GDP in 2010 to
4.5 percent in 2011 and 9.8 percent by 2014. Higher private domestic investment is expected
to benefit from a pickup in bank lending, with private sector credit projected to increase by
15.5 percent in 2011.

29.     There is uncertainty regarding the pace of growth going forward. With the
medium term growth outlook built upon improved exports, private investment, and bank
lending, as well as continued FDI at current levels, any deterioration in the external
environment or investor confidence would result in lower growth than currently projected.
Bank lending could also be affected by efforts to control further inflationary pressures. The
projected FDI inflows are expected to come from existing as well as new projects, and are
based on expressions of interest from foreign entities and prospects for major destination
sectors including transport, energy, hotels, retail, and industry. On the other hand, exports
have continued to grow strongly during the first quarter of 2011 and the economic outlook has
improved in a number of Georgia’s major export destinations (Turkey, EU, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Canada, and the United States). Still, export expansion going forward is
subject to uncertainty regarding both the external environment as well as domestic supply
constraints.

30.    Georgia’s overall macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for this
operation. The elements of this framework include: (i) a commitment to continued fiscal
adjustment during 2011-2014 to safeguard sustainability and maintain a sustainable level of
public debt; (ii) a flexible exchange rate consistent with external sustainability; (iii) low to
moderate inflation; and (iv) strengthening banking sector supervision to address
vulnerabilities and support sustainable credit growth. The macroeconomic policy framework
has been supported by the IMF SBA program: the Ninth (and final) Review of the SBA
program was successfully completed on June 8, 2011.

31.     The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal adjustment through expenditure
consolidation during 2011-14 provides an important anchor for safeguarding
sustainability in the medium term. According to the 2011 budget supplement and 2011-14
medium term fiscal framework approved by Parliament in April, the overall fiscal deficit is
projected to decline further from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.6 percent in 2011 and 2.0
percent by 2014 (figure 5). While fiscal adjustment in 2010 came primarily from current
expenditures, the strategy going forward involves adjusting both current and capital
expenditures as higher private investment and sustained growth take hold. Total expenditures
are projected to decline from 34.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 32.1 percent by 2011 and 28.1
percent by 2014, with current and capital expenditures making similar contributions to this
adjustment path. Deficit reduction in 2011 will benefit from a one-off increase in tax
revenues from 23.4 percent of GDP to 24.9 percent in 2011, resulting from the settlement of a
large tax liability (amounting to 1 percent of GDP). Other than the one-off settlement in
arrears, tax revenues are projected to rise only slightly to 24 percent of GDP during 2012-14,
although a decline in nontax revenues and the winding down of grants means that revenues

and grants are projected to decline from 28.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 26.3 percent
during 2012-14.

32.     The fiscal consolidation strategy involves continuing to refocus expenditures on
priority social and infrastructure development objectives, while winding down crisis-
related investments and controlling general administrative expenditures. Generally, the
2011 budget sustains and builds upon the major shifts in expenditure composition during
2009-10. Defense and internal security expenditures are budgeted to decline further to 6.2
percent of GDP in 2011 from 7.2 percent in 2010, down from 12.8 percent in 2007. Although
health, education, and social protection expenditures are budgeted to decline as a share of
GDP (to 10.4 percent in 2011 from 10.8 percent in 2010), they would still remain up from 8.2
percent in 2007 and increase as a share of overall expenditures (35.6 percent in 2011 from
34.6 percent in 2010). Capital expenditures are budgeted to decline to 8.0 percent of GDP in
2011 from 8.8 percent in 2010, as the crisis-related hump in infrastructure investment winds
down (table 2). The decline in transfers, subsidies, and grants is also a result of the winding
down of crisis-related expenditures. Wages and salaries are budgeted to decline to 4.9 percent
of GDP in 2011 from 5.5 percent in 2010, while goods and services are budgeted to decline to
4.6 percent of GDP in 2011 from 5.2 percent in 2010, reflecting that the authorities are
continuing to restrain growth of general administrative expenditures.

33.     The fiscal adjustment program faces challenges arising from the needs of the
elderly and vulnerable affected by higher food and fuel prices and from possible capital
spending pressures surrounding the 2012-13 elections. In order to meet the needs of the
elderly and vulnerable, the authorities have already distributed one-off food and electricity

vouchers costing GEL 57 million (0.2 percent of GDP) in February and announced a 25
percent increase in pensions from September 2011 (which will cost about GEL 150 million or
0.6 percent of GDP per year). Both of these initiatives are reflected in the fiscal framework.
The old-age pension, which is untargeted but nevertheless has a significant poverty mitigating
impact, is fixed in nominal terms and thus requires periodic adjustment to protect the
purchasing power of beneficiaries. The authorities are considering options to further increase
pensions by 2013. The authorities are also working to further improve the effectiveness of
targeted social and health programs after significant increases in coverage and benefits in
recent years. In the area of capital expenditures, in addition to winding down the crisis-
related hump in infrastructure investment, the authorities are working to further rationalize
capital expenditures by strengthening public investment management systems. The Bank is
maintaining an active dialogue through the programmatic public expenditure review work to
support the authorities in their efforts to implement quality fiscal adjustment.

34.     The current account is projected to widen temporarily in 2011 from higher food
and fuel prices although the structural deficit is narrowing, with a flexible exchange rate
providing the key anchor of sustainability in the face of uncertain capital inflows. As a
result of the adverse impact of higher food and fuel prices on Georgia’s terms of trade, the
external current account deficit is projected to widen temporarily to 10.8 percent of GDP in
2011 (table 3). This widening of the current account is more than fully accounted for by the
adverse terms of trade shock, without which the current account should have actually
narrowed in 2011. In the medium term, as productivity of tradables and savings levels
improve, the current account is projected to decline gradually to 6.8 percent by 2014. The
medium term financing plan requires continued public sector inflows, in addition to FDI and
other private inflows (figure 6). The recovery of private capital inflows and accumulation of
international reserves is expected to allow the authorities to make repayments of about
$900 million to the IMF during 2012-15. FDI is projected to remain at current levels of about
5-6 percent of GDP, but other private inflows are expected to pick up. A successor IMF
arrangement is also under consideration. In the face of uncertain capital inflows, the
commitment to a flexible exchange rate provides the central anchor of safeguarding external
sustainability.

35.   Georgia’s debt burden indicators are projected to remain well below relevant
prudential thresholds, with the successful refinancing of the Eurobond in April helping
to smooth out 2013 repayment obligations. The present value (PV) of public external debt

                                                                               13
is projected to rise from 29.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 32.7 percent in 2011 before falling to
25.9 percent by 2020, thus remaining well under the relevant prudential threshold of 50
percent (figure 7). The public external debt service ratio is projected to remain well below the
relevant prudential threshold of 25 percent, with the successful refinancing of the prior
Eurobond in April helping to smooth out repayment obligations in 2013. The ratio of public
external debt service to exports is expected to rise gradually from 5.2 percent in 2010 to 9.4
percent in 2013, before falling back to 4.7 percent in 2015. The debt service to revenue ratio
also follows a similar pattern. The authorities are accumulating reserves in anticipation of the
larger repayments during 2012-14. Georgia’s successful Eurobond refinancing in April and
its sovereign credit ratings provide indication that it has market access. Moody’s assigned the
country a first time foreign and local currency sovereign credit rating of Ba3/Not-Prime with
stable outlook in October 2010. This is one notch higher than Georgia’s existing sovereign
ratings from S&P and Fitch (both B+ with positive outlook assigned in the first half of 2011).
The authorities are also considering a successor IMF arrangement after the current SBA
expires in June 2011.

36.     Under a number of alternative stress scenarios, debt burden indicators generally
remain below relevant prudential thresholds. Alternative stress scenarios explored include
a lower GDP growth rate, a higher interest rate on new public borrowing, lower export
growth, a one-time depreciation, and lower non debt-creating flows.4 For each debt burden
indicator, the most extreme shock is the stress scenario that yields the highest ratio in 2020.
Even under the most extreme shock of a fall of non-debt creating flows to one standard
deviation below its historical average, the PV of public debt to GDP ratio rises to a higher
path, but remains below the prudential threshold of 50 percent. The debt service to exports
ratio also reaches its highest levels for the shock to non-debt creating flows, but nevertheless
remains well below the relevant prudential threshold of 25 percent for all years.

37.     Georgia faces a number of macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities. First, given
the uncertain global economic outlook, the external environment could suffer a renewed
deterioration, which would negatively impact exports, remittances, FDI, and other private
capital inflows. Second, renewed domestic and regional tensions or other factors could affect
investor and consumer confidence, which would constrain further private investment and

4
 The historical and baseline scenarios keep key exogenous variables (GDP growth, interest rate on new public
borrowing, export growth, exchange rate, and non debt-creating flows) at either their baseline projected levels or
at historical levels. The stress scenarios shock the variables by one standard deviation compared to the historical
average or, for the exchange rate shock, a one-time depreciation by 30 percent.

                                                                   14
growth of credit to the private sector. These scenarios would have an adverse impact on the
growth outlook and require further external adjustment, possibly including further
realignment of the real exchange rate, faster fiscal adjustment, and additional official
financing, preferably on concessional terms to safeguard debt sustainability. Such a scenario
could also add to the public debt burden and increase the ratio of nonperforming loans of the
banking sector. On the flip side, the recent economic recovery could gain momentum if the
global economic outlook improves further.          Given the uncertain environment, the
commitment to the envisaged fiscal adjustment and flexible exchange rate policy provide
important anchors in safeguarding sustainability.

38.     Further risks arise from the recent increases in food and energy prices and from
the upcoming 2012-13 elections. Increases in food and fuel prices could intensify or result
in second-round effects onto the prices of other products. These scenarios would possibly
raise pressures on the NBG to further tighten monetary policy and also increase the fiscal
costs for assistance to the vulnerable. However, the NBG has already preemptively tightened
policy, which should help stabilize inflation to about 8.5 percent by end-2011. Finally, the
2012-13 elections carry the risk of adding to fiscal pressures, although the authorities have
front-loaded a good part of adjustment and are committed to financing additional necessary
expenditures through savings in other areas or through improvements in revenue collection.


 III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

39.     The Government’s medium term reform program is described in its annual
strategy document titled Basic Data and Directions (BDD). The main directions of the
medium term strategy are based on the “United Georgia without Poverty” strategy document.
This was approved in January 2008 and thus predates the significant changes to the economic
environment following the August conflict and the global economic crisis. While this
strategy still provides the main directions of the Government’s reform program, the pace and
emphasis of reforms have necessarily adjusted to reflect the impact of the double shocks to
the economy and the subsequent policy response. The main elements of the Government’s
reform program are broadly supported by key political parties.

40.      The Government’s response to the August conflict and the global economic crisis
has included: implementing counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary measures; safeguarding the
stability of the banking sector; addressing the needs of internally displaced people and others
affected by the conflict (including providing temporary shelter, food, medical attention, cash
support, and durable housing); swiftly repairing and rehabilitating damaged infrastructure,
and seeking and obtaining international support. In October 2008, a team led by the World
Bank and the United Nations (and including the collaboration of the ADB, EBRD, EC, EIB,
and IFC) prepared a Joint Needs Assessment (JNA), which led up to an International Donor
Conference in Brussels where Georgia received financial pledges from the international
community of $4.5 billion over three years, including $850 million for the banking sector.
These pledges have enabled Georgia to scale up and reallocate public expenditures toward
addressing critical social and infrastructure investment needs.

41.      The BDD 2011-2014 was approved by Parliament in December 2010. The BDD
outlines the medium term reform program and its objectives, provides the medium-term
macroeconomic framework, including the fiscal resource envelope and fiscal allocations, and

                                              15
includes detailed descriptions of the individual sectoral strategies for achieving these
objectives.

42.    The overall strategic directions of the Government’s economic reform program
include:

      Economic, Fiscal, and Monetary Policy: The objectives include (i) returning to a
       trajectory of sustained economic growth; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic stability
       (and safeguarding the financial sector) over the medium term through fiscal
       adjustment and single-digit inflation.

      Employment: The objective is to generate employment by restoring rapid economic
       growth, upgrading infrastructure, ensuring high quality education, and maintaining a
       market friendly business environment.

      Competitiveness: The objective is to enhance competitiveness by continuing to reduce
       the burden of the state, maintain an open trade regime, and establish a deep and
       comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU.

      Support for social needs: The objectives are to strengthen the social safety net
       comprising the two pillars of social assistance and health insurance with a focus on
       enhancing access for the most vulnerable; and improve living conditions for new and
       existing IDPs.

      Support for critical infrastructure: The objectives include upgrading transport and
       trade logistics infrastructure (including priority for the E-W Highway and other
       segments in the South and West); enhancing energy reliability, including attracting
       donor and private investment to support a new power transmission line and increased
       hydropower generation; and restructuring and rehabilitating water supply and sewage
       systems throughout the country.

      Education: The objectives are to upgrade the skills of the labor force, including by
       bringing all public schools into line with modern standards, enhancing teacher
       training, and strengthening the quality of universities in line with international
       standards.

      Rural productivity: The objectives are to increase productivity in agriculture through
       rehabilitating irrigation systems and assisting farmers with critical inputs; and to
       promote agribusiness and agroprocessing to help create jobs.

      Upgrading institutions: The objectives are to strengthen the rule of law, modernize the
       enforcement system, and improve mechanisms to protect property rights; and to
       enhance government effectiveness and transparency by establishing measurable
       parameters for evaluating performance, improving budgetary and treasury processes,
       and strengthening the system of asset declaration and code of ethics of public servants.

43.     The Government has recently enhanced its communication effort to explain its
policies to the public and has received support from the Bank in this regard. Better
communication of the overall reform program as well as specific policies has been identified

                                             16
as an important need in Georgia. The recent communication and public outreach efforts have
responded to this need and have taken several forms. At a broad level, the President is
making biannual presentations on the state of the nation to Parliament, which includes a
question and answer session. The Government has also taken on a broad program to better
explain its services, programs, and policies to the public, through media presentations,
brochures, and other means, with the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet directly
reaching out to the public. Some of the specific public outreach efforts have been directly
supported by the DPO program. The Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs conducted
a public outreach effort to raise awareness about and explain the mechanics and benefits of
various social programs, including targeted social assistance (TSA). Similarly, in the area of
e-filing of taxes, the Revenue Service conducted an extensive public outreach effort to
encourage wider adoption of e-filing. At a broader level, the Government of Georgia has
teamed up with the World Bank and the IFC to launch a series of discussions on key policy
issues with a broad spectrum of stakeholders.


           IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO CPS AND OTHER BANK TASKS
44.      Link to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The DPO series is a central
component of the Country Partnership Strategy for Georgia covering 2010-2013. The CPS is
built upon a two-pillar approach to the Bank’s engagement with Georgia, including (i)
meeting post-conflict and vulnerability needs; and (ii) strengthening competitiveness for post-
crisis recovery and growth. These overarching objectives in the CPS reflect the objectives of
the Government’s reform program in the aftermath of the twin crisis of the August 2008
conflict and the global economic downturn. The CPS Progress Report was discussed by the
Board in April 2011 and rebalances emphasis toward the intersection of the two pillars. The
DPO covers the core sectors targeted for Bank Group support, and the reforms supported by
the DPO program are complemented by technical assistance and investments in essential
infrastructure and service delivery, public sector financial management, health, and energy.

45.    Link to AAA. The reforms supported by the DPO program have built upon a
foundation of extensive Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) by the Bank, including the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003; the Integrated Trade Development Study (2003);
Pension and Social Assistance Note (2005), various Doing Business Reports, the Financial
Sector Assessment Program Update (2006), the draft Country Procurement Assessment
(2007), and the Programmatic Poverty Assessment (2008), and the Bank-EC Joint PEFA
(2008). Earlier Programmatic Poverty Assessment activities (FY05, 06, 07) concentrated on
building capacity to track poverty and Programmatic Public Finance activities (FY05, 06, 07)
covered several developments and issues in public finance and challenges in
intergovernmental finances. Ongoing work on the Programmatic Public Expenditure Review
(PPER) is directed at identifying policy options to implement fiscal adjustment, while
improving the efficiency with which public expenditures deliver quality public services,
provide an effective social safety net, and meet infrastructure development needs. The
analysis of the PPER is complementing the dialogue of the DPO program, particularly on the
macro-fiscal framework and the budgetary reforms to improve the efficiency of public
expenditures. Similarly, the ongoing work under the programmatic poverty assessment is
complementing the dialogue on the reforms to the social safety net.


                                              17
46.    Link to Other Bank Operations. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform
Support Project which is directed at assisting the Government in addressing the capacity
constraints of key public sector agencies will also support implementation of DPO reforms.
The reforms to the statistics system are being supported by a trust fund on statistical capacity
building, which is helping the newly independent statistical office conduct a needs assessment
and develop a statistical master plan. Similarly, the health sector reforms supported in the
DPO program are receiving support from the ongoing Health Sector Development Project.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
47.    The Government has maintained satisfactory macroeconomic performance in
line with the IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) and the DPO program. In the aftermath
of the August 2008 conflict, an IMF mission prepared a Standby Arrangement (SBA) for
$750 million over 18 months to bolster investor confidence and support international reserves,
which was approved by the IMF Board in September 2008. The SBA program was
subsequently augmented by about $400 million and extended to June 2011 as part of the Third
Review in August 2009. The Ninth (and final) Review of the SBA was successfully
completed on June 8, 2011. The Bank and the Fund teams are closely coordinating their
monitoring of macroeconomic developments, technical assistance, and assessment of the
macroeconomic framework.

48.      The DPO program has been designed in close coordination with other donors and
with the private sector and NGOs in Georgia. In designing and monitoring implementation
of the DPO program, the Bank has coordinated with the Netherlands Embassy (which co-
financed DPO-1 and DPO-2), the Macro-Financial Assistance and sectoral budget support
programs of the European Commission, and the budgetary support programs of the Asian
Development Bank. These donors are supporting Georgia in a number of complementary
areas. The Netherlands Government supports Georgia in the areas of governance and
oversight institutions. The program of the EC, in addition to macro-financial assistance,
includes support in public financial management, intergovernmental fiscal relations, auditing,
and administrative reform. The ADB provided budgetary support in the aftermath of the
crisis in 2008 and 2009, as well as in 2010. The ADB has also been supporting the banking
sector and infrastructure projects. Monitoring of the social safety net pillar of the DPO
program has benefited from collaboration with UNICEF. The Bank also consults with the
private sector and civil society groups in Georgia and these consultations have influenced
design and preparation of the DPO program.

49.     The Government’s program is supported by other development partners in the
following areas. The program of USAID includes support in the areas of budgeting,
Treasury management, governance, anti-corruption, private sector development, agriculture,
sanitary/food safety, energy, and education. The program of SIDA includes support in public
sector, governance reform, agriculture, natural resources, the environment, health, and
education. The program of the UNDP includes support in the areas of administrative/civil
service reform, customs reform, and poverty monitoring. The program of DFID included
support in MTEF and health sector budget management but has been phased out since
February 2009. The EBRD focuses on investment promotion, municipal development and
energy. GTZ support is in the areas of legal and judiciary system, performance audit capacity
building at the CCG, land management, and private sector development, while the KfW
focuses on energy and municipal infrastructure. The Millennium Challenge Corporation


                                              18
(MCC) program includes rehabilitation of key regional infrastructure, delivery of regional and
municipal services, tourism and agribusiness.

LESSONS LEARNED
50.     The formulation of the DPO program draws on the lessons learned from
successful implementation of the PRSO program, previous development policy operations,
as well as overall IDA support to the reform process in Georgia. The policy dialogue between
IDA and the Government of Georgia has had a strong focus on public sector reform, anti-
corruption and governance issues.

51.     Specifically, design and preparation of the DPO program has taken on board the
following factors which underpinned the success of the PRSO program. First, the
Government had strong ownership of the reform program and led the reforms, with IDA
playing a catalytic and supportive role (see Box 1). Second, the operation was well defined
and focused on priority issues where the medium-term strategy is well understood and
accepted by the Government. Third, any reform program was grounded in a realistic
assessment of the Government’s implementation capacity. Careful balancing of these three
factors resulted in a well-focused and sequenced program, supported by well-coordinated
donor technical assistance. Increasing the Government’s implementation capacity and
leveraging World Bank Group resources through other donors are critical elements in the
design of IDA’s assistance program in Georgia.

                               Box 1. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
  Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
  The Government has strong ownership of the proposed DPO, which supports several dimensions of the
  Government’s reform agenda where the Bank has comparative advantage and complements the work being
  supported by other development partners. Furthermore, the proposed operation is in line with Georgia’s medium
  term structural reform program. The proposed DPO follows successful in implementation of the PRSO program,
  which demonstrates Georgia’s track record of significant Government ownership and strong commitment to the
  reform process. The Bank’s analytic work has contributed to the formulation and implementation of selected
  aspects of the Government’s reform program.
  Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
  framework
  At the core of the accountability framework is the operations policy matrix outlining actions over the medium-
  term with clear and monitorable outcome indicators developed jointly with the Georgian government during
  preparation of the DPO program. Lessons from the PRSO program show that the policy matrix may evolve over
  time to reflect that reforms exceed program expectations so that the program is able to adjust to the emerging
  reform priorities. The reform program benefits from close coordination and consultations with other
  development partners including the IMF, the Netherlands Government, US Treasury, the European Commission,
  the ADB, USAID, SIDA, KfW, GTZ, and EBRD (see Section IV). The program supports important features of
  Georgia’s Action Plan under the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP). The EC plans to provide financing
  under its Macroeconomic Financial Agreement. The ADB is expected to provide budgetary support.
  Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
  circumstances
  The DPO team works closely with Government counterparts from various ministries in designing and monitoring
  reform implementation. The agreed accountability framework is fully consistent with the Government’s
  expressed policy intentions and internal accountability mechanisms. Further, the program focuses on outcome-
  oriented actions, since that is the best way to calibrate the series of reforms that are necessary to achieve program
  objectives.
  Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
  The DPO program focuses on actions that are critical for the success of the reform which it supports. All triggers
  take the form of prior actions agreed upon with full participation of the Government and reflect the reform
  priorities of the Georgian Government which are supported by the Bank in the CPS.
  Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
  support
  Progress made with the implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals is monitored on a regular
  basis: a progress matrix, which outlines the status of reforms and outcome indicators, is updated and reviewed
  periodically. The DPO program’s financial support is expected to provide predictable budget support to the
  Government on a timely basis which is allowing its inclusion in the annual budget. As such, the proposed DPO
  support is fully consistent with the Government’s macroeconomic framework and the 2011 budget.




 V.       THE PROPOSED THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION (DPO-3)

52.     The proposed DPO-3 emphasizes support for reforms directed at sustaining
economic recovery and preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term.
At the same time, with real GDP and employment below the pre-crisis trajectory, a number of
DPO-3 reforms, particularly in the area of the social safety net, continue to contribute toward
cushioning the impact of the downturn. The emphasis is, however, on addressing the
challenges to sustain post-crisis growth in the medium term with an effective social safety net.
Toward addressing these challenges, the proposed DPO-3 program supports a satisfactory
macroeconomic and fiscal framework and key reforms organized under three pillars:
(i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the
effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external competitiveness.


                                                          20
53.      Important results were achieved under the support of DPO-1 and DPO-2. DPO-1
balanced immediate crisis mitigating measures with structural reforms while DPO-2
facilitated an orderly transition in the focus of the authorities from immediate mitigating
measures toward preparing the conditions for post-crisis growth. As a result, the economic
downturn was contained in 2009, the economy rebounded strongly in 2010, and fiscal policy
moved swiftly from stimulus to adjustment during 2010. On public finances, important steps
were taken toward further improving efficiency by enacting the new Budget Code and for the
first time, including annexes on program and capital budgets in the 2010 Annual Budget.
This has enabled a greater share of public expenditures to be covered by improved
performance indicators and it has also increased transparency and accountability for public
investment programming. On the social safety net, coverage was scaled up and benefits were
improved without significant loss of targeting effectiveness. The shares of the poor and
extreme poor receiving publicly subsidized health care and targeted social assistance have
increased markedly. On external competitiveness, improvements were achieved in reducing
the time required for tax compliance and for trading across borders (with e-filings up beyond
all expectations and the share of customs declarations through the red corridor down
significantly); furthermore, brisk progress was made in identifying trade-related reforms for
improved access of Georgian products to international markets. Independence of the statistics
agency with streamlined institutional structures has been established.

54.     Georgia has successfully implemented the reforms supported by the proposed
DPO-3, which build upon the earlier results to address a number of important
challenges. The overall reform program described in the policy matrix remains unchanged
from that presented at the time of DPO-1 and DPO-2. Specifically, on public finances, the
quality of results-based budgets and the public investment program are being strengthened to
ensure quality fiscal adjustment and to best target expenditures at sustaining recovery and
post-crisis growth. On the social safety net, measures are being pursued to protect coverage
in an environment of considerable fiscal adjustment and to further improve the effectiveness
of targeted social and health programs. On external competitiveness, measures are being
pursued to further streamline tax and customs procedures and to create preconditions for
enhanced access for Georgian products to international markets.

55.     The formulations of a number of prior actions have been refined to provide
greater specificity to the actions being implemented. Annex 4 details the refinements and
modifications to the DPO-3 prior actions. Under the public finance pillar, greater specificity
has been provided to the actions taken to enhance the results orientation of the budget and to
strengthen the public investment program. Under the social safety net pillar, greater
specificity has been provided to the actions on linking information systems to improve TSA
effectiveness and deploying an IT platform for medical claims processing. Under the external
competitiveness pillar, greater specificity has been provided to the actions on customs risk
management, trade-related reforms, and improving the statistics system.

56.    Two prior actions have been dropped and one prior action has been modified to
enhance the selectivity of the program and emphasize actions that are most important to
the overall success of the reform program. (See Annex 4) First, the prior action on the
new budgeting methodology has been dropped, with approval by Ministerial decree delayed
to end-June 2011, following a period of consultations with parliament, line ministries, and the
chamber of control. Second, the prior action on the social safety net strategy has been
dropped, with the authorities indicating that they would provide a summary of their strategy

                                              21
for social and health programs in the Letter of Development Policy. Third, the prior action on
health coverage has been modified to focus on the targeted MIP which provides the
overwhelming bulk of coverage and financial protection against health payments for the poor
in Georgia, with the smaller voluntary 5-Lari program being phased out because of limited
uptake.

PILLAR 1: IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC
FINANCES

57.     In order to sustain economic recovery and create the conditions for post-crisis
growth in the medium term, improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public
finances are a critical priority for Georgia. Given the substantial scaling up of public
expenditures in recent years and the important shifts in composition of spending that have
taken place, a critical priority for Georgia is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
public finances. This will contribute to a number of objectives. First, it will ensure that the
higher expenditures are contributing effectively to Georgia’s growth and poverty reduction
priorities. Second, with the authorities committed to fiscal adjustment during 2010-14,
efficiency improvements will ensure that adjustment takes place in a manner that protects
important social and infrastructure expenditures and continues to support economic recovery
and post-crisis growth. Third, greater efficiency will facilitate adjustment in the level of
public expenditures over time and thereby expedite the process of re-establishing private
investment as the engine for accelerating economic growth in the medium term.

58.    In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances, the DPO
proposes to support reforms in the areas of (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of public expenditures; and (ii) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public
investment program. The reform agenda in these areas requires technical assistance and
capacity building that are being supported by the Public Sector Financial Management
Reform Support Project.

Improve efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures5

Public Financial Management Framework
59.      Improving the efficiency of public finances requires improvements to the
strategic, regulatory, and methodological framework to coordinate progress in the
different areas of public financial management. Under the support of DPO-1, the Georgian
authorities developed a strategy on public finances (known as the Public Financial
Management Reform Policy Vision 2009-2013) to provide a framework for the coordination
of reforms and an integrated approach to strengthening the public finance system.6 Under
DPO-2, a new Budget Code was enacted to unify the existing legal framework for budgeting
at all levels, as part of implementation of the PFM Reform Vision. The new Budget Code
better integrates the BDD, results-oriented budgets, and the public investment program into
the annual budget cycle, making each of these a legal requirement for all spending units by

  The Program Documents for DPO-1 and DPO-2 provide greater detail on the rationale, history of
implementation, and results in each of the reform areas. In the current concept version program document, we
provide a brief rationale for each DPO-3 reform action and focus on status of implementation.
6
  The PFM Reform Vision was developed as a follow up to the findings and recommendations of the PEFA
(2008). The findings of the PEFA report and the overall state of the PFM environment are discussed in further
detail in section VI.

                                                      22
2012. The Budget Code provides an impetus to the results-oriented and public investment
budgeting reforms being supported by the DPO.

60.     The authorities have been developing a new methodological framework for
program budgeting, including instructions for capital budgeting. A draft decree on the
methodology was endorsed by Cabinet in October 2010. The draft decree systematically lays
out the definitions, concepts, and methodological framework for program budgeting,
including instructions for capital budgeting, and it formed the basis for preparation of the
2011 program and capital budgets. Work is ongoing to further improve the methodology in
consultation with line ministries, parliamentarians, and the chamber of control. The Budget
Code requires approval by Ministerial Decree of a new methodology on program and capital
budgeting, which is expected by end-June 2011. One potential area for improvement is in
formulating more meaningful capital budgeting guidelines (particularly procedures related to
project screening, preparation, and appraisal) which would set out a system to enhance value
for money from public capital spending, ensure that projects satisfy efficiency and
effectiveness requirements, and contribute adequately to Georgia’s growth and development
objectives. The authorities have indicated that a phased approach to introducing more
systematic capital budgeting guidelines is an important priority and recognize this as a key
instrument of medium term fiscal adjustment.

Improved results-orientation of the budget
61.     The DPO program supports a multi-year, stepwise process to enhance the
results-orientation of the budget to increase the focus on outputs generated beyond a
mere focus on inputs or resources allocated. This is intended to create pressures within the
budgetary process to reallocate resources both intersectorally across ministries and
intrasectorally within ministries. This creates embedded incentives to improve efficiency in
the use of resources and delivery of public services. Although the development of meaningful
performance indicators and their effective use in the budget process takes time, the DPO sets
in motion a process by which spending units identify measurable results and then report on
them in a structured manner. The goal is to build capacity and ownership over time, and to
create incentives for ministries to identify poorly performing programs and to take appropriate
actions.

62.     Important progress has been achieved on this front. The first step (DPO-1)
involved piloting results-oriented budgets for at least one program in three first-level spending
units. As part of the second step (DPO-2), the Annual Budget Law for 2010 included an
Information Annex incorporating results-oriented budgets of improved quality and coverage
for three ministries (Justice, Education, and Health). The budget circular for the 2010 budget
preparation was also updated to include three new forms dedicated to results and performance
indicators.

63.       The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy action in this area:
         Submitted to Parliament results-oriented budgets with a new program/subprogram
          structure and corresponding hierarchy of specific and measurable performance
          indicators for five ministries and reported on actual performance against the indicators
          of the prior year.



                                                23
64.     The focus at this step of the reform has been to develop a new program structure
with a corresponding hierarchy of specific and measurable performance indicators, to
initiate reporting on actual performance, and to further increase coverage. Program
budgets for six ministries (Health, Education, Justice, Probation, Agriculture, and
Environment) were submitted as an Information Annex to the Annual Budget Law for 2011.
The increase in coverage to six ministries exceeds the target of five. The new program
structure makes a clear distinction between programs and subprograms, with programs now
more closely aligned to the major policy areas of lasting concern to the ministries’ missions.
Both of these improvements should lead to a more stable program structure in the future. The
performance indicators generally make a clear distinction between program-level outcome-
based indicators and subprogram-level output-based indicators. The performance indicators
are also largely specific and measurable, and thus potentially operational. At the same time,
improving the quality of performance indicators is an ongoing endeavor and will require
further attention in subsequent years. Three ministries (Education, Justice and Health) that
had prepared program budgets for 2010 have reported to Parliament in March 2011 on actual
performance. For some programs, the reporting is of reasonably high quality, with clear,
often quantitatively-based, accounts of achievements and explanations for differences. The
challenge in the future will be to reproduce this quality more evenly across all programs and
ministries. The authorities plan to move to government-wide program budgeting for 2012 and
the team has provided inputs on areas for further improvement in implementing that effort.

65.     The authorities have received technical assistance from a number of donors in
this area. The DPO team has assisted in shaping the reform and has provided regular expert
assessments and suggestions on implementation. An IMF mission provided technical
assistance on next steps in program budgeting in April 2010. The Bank’s public sector
financial management project is also providing support in this reform area. Further training
and support for line ministries from the MoF will also be important for further progress on
this front. This would include regular feedback from the MoF to the ministries on the content
and completeness of their performance budgets and reports.

66.     As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include an increase in the share of the budget and number of first-level spending
units covered by results-oriented budgeting, with improved performance indicators, as well as
an increase in the number of spending units reporting on actual performance. Over time, the
increasing use of performance information is expected to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public expenditures in Georgia.

Increase efficiency and effectiveness of public investment program

67.     With Georgia facing substantial infrastructure development needs for sustained
growth in the medium term, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of public
investment is a critical priority in the face of fiscal constraints. In order to generate
sustained growth in the post-crisis period, Georgia faces very substantial infrastructure
development needs. Public investment plays a central role in developing this infrastructure,
particularly with the fall in private investment and FDI in the post-crisis period. Furthermore,
public investment has been scaled up in recent years and allocated to areas broadly supportive
of growth (public investment in Georgia as a share of GDP is among the highest in the ECA
region). Therefore, the priority at this point is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the public investment.

                                              24
68.     In order to achieve this objective, the DPO program supports the Government’s
priority of strengthening its public investment management systems. Specifically, this
includes development of a multi-year public investment program in which project priorities
and multi-year funding requirements are elaborated in a single document. This document is
intended to be used as a decision-making tool to prioritize and select projects, assess
appropriate investment levels, and identify and adequately provision for operations and
maintenance expenditures. Furthermore, the reform is expected to progressively strengthen
the procedures for identifying, preparing, appraising and selecting capital projects and for
monitoring and evaluating their implementation. It aims to do this by improving the guidance
on project preparation issued by the MoF to the major spending units and by enhancing the
transparency and accountability for project implementation. Although individual investment
decisions are often decentralized to line ministries, the MoF can set standards and guidelines
for project analysis and reporting that will create incentives for a more efficient and effective
management of public investment resources.

69.     DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported the development of the multi-year public
investment program along a number of parallel dimensions. First, in April/May 2009,
five spending units (Roads Department, Ministries of Finance and Probation, Municipal
Development Fund, and City of Tbilisi) piloted preparation of public investment program
summaries based on the already-approved 2009 budget. Second, the budget circular for
preparation of the 2010 budget was revised to include new forms dedicated to preparing
capital budgets as well as guidelines for preparing, submitting, and selecting project proposals
above a defined threshold. Third, the Annual Budget Law for 2010 included for the first time,
an Information Annex on the public investment program for two spending units (the Roads
Department and Ministry of Finance).

70.       The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy action in this area:
         Submitted to Parliament a public investment program including the complete time
          profile of project financial information, summary project justifications, and physical
          monitoring indicators covering a majority of public investment, and reported publicly
          on actual versus planned project implementation for 2010.

71.     The focus of this step of the reform has been to strengthen the public investment
program by incorporating the full time profile of financial information and reporting on
actual versus planned implementation. As part of the programmatic PER work, the Bank
prepared a policy note on Strengthening Capital Budgeting in Georgia, which provided
specific recommendations on steps to strengthen the public investment program, particularly
in the context of the 2011 budget preparation. The public investment program (also known as
the capital budget) was submitted to Parliament as an Information Annex to the Annual
Budget Law for 2011, including primarily donor-financed projects under the Ministries of
Infrastructure and Energy. Coverage included a majority of public investment. The capital
budget included the complete time profile of project financial information, including total
project cost, cumulative expenditures prior to budget year, budget allocation for 2011,
forecasts for 2012-13, and balance to complete from 2014. The nonfinancial information has
improved through the inclusion of summary project justifications and physical monitoring
indicators at the project level. The two ministries that prepared capital budgets for 2010
reported to Parliament in March 2011 on actual versus planned project implementation, with



                                                25
the Ministry of Infrastructure demonstrating greater success in providing reasons and
explanations for deviations where these have arisen.

72.     The team has provided specific suggestions for further improvement in preparing
the 2012 capital budget. These include expanding coverage to domestically financed
projects, deepening the nonfinancial information on project description and justification, and
improved reporting on actual versus planned project implementation of the prior year. The
reporting mechanism is intended to increase accountability for project implementation and
strengthen the incentives for ministries to improve efficiency and effectiveness of their public
investment programs.

73.    As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include: (i) improved programming of public investment over a medium term
horizon; and (ii) improvement in the system of preparing, prioritizing, selecting, and
monitoring implementation of public investment projects.


PILLAR 2: IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET

74.     The overall objective of reforms under this pillar is to continue to improve the
effectiveness of the social safety net to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that the
benefits of sustained growth in the medium term are broadly shared. Georgia has taken
important steps toward developing a social safety net by putting in place a social assistance
program targeted to the extreme poor and a medical insurance program targeted to the poor.
Georgia also has significant other social transfers, including pensions and assistance to
internally displaced persons (IDPs), which together with targeted social assistance (TSA),
accounted for 6.3 percent of GDP in 2010. This is up from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2007, as a
result of increased coverage and benefit amounts to mitigate the impact of the economic
downturn. In the medium term, improved access of the poor to the social safety net is
expected to come from improved targeting effectiveness and coverage.

75.     In the area of health care, the challenge for Georgia has been to identify fiscally
sustainable measures to improve access to health care and enhance financial protection
against out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments. Coverage of the Medical Insurance
Program (MIP) targeted to the poor has been scaled up over the course of the crisis, a drug
benefit has been added to the package, and a new publicly co-financed voluntary insurance
program was introduced. The MIP, which currently covers more than 20 percent of the
population (about 900,000 beneficiaries), has improved access to health care for those
covered and is the most effective instrument in providing financial protection against health
payments for the poor. Although a share of the poor are still not covered, the priority at the
moment is to safeguard the higher coverage, improve program effectiveness, and address
structural issues in the health care system. Public health expenditures accounted for 2.0
percent of GDP in 2010, up from 1.4 percent in 2007.

76.     In order to address the challenges outlined above under this pillar, the DPO
proposes to support reforms in the areas of: (i) continuing to improve effectiveness of
social transfers, including the targeted social assistance program; and (ii) improving access to
health care through fiscally sustainable strengthening of the health care financing system.


                                              26
Continue to improve effectiveness of social transfers, including the targeted social
assistance program

77.     Georgia’s system of social transfers reaches about two-thirds of the population
and is important for poverty reduction. Social transfers include pensions, IDP assistance,
targeted social assistance (TSA), and some smaller cash transfer programs. Pensions are by
far the largest (almost 75 percent) of social transfers, followed by targeted social assistance
(14 percent) and assistance to IDPs. Simulations indicate that poverty would be much higher
without the transfers: poverty in 2007 would have been 35 percent instead of 23.7 percent
(higher by 50 percent), while extreme poverty would have been 20.3 percent instead of 9.3
percent (higher by more than 100 percent). Pensions, given the large coverage, deliver most
of the poverty reduction impact. Targeted social assistance (TSA) contributes to poverty
reduction as well, but because of the relatively small coverage, the impact is smaller. While
the TSA program is well targeted, its coverage is more limited. In 2007, 65 percent of TSA
beneficiary households were in the (pre-transfer) bottom quintile, indicating a well targeted
program. Yet, TSA only covered about 22 percent of households in the bottom quintile.

78.     In the medium term, improving access of the poor and extreme poor to social
transfers will require improved targeting and effectiveness. This can be achieved through
two means. The first is to further improve targeting effectiveness of the part of social
transfers that is already targeted (i.e. TSA) by implementing various measures (such as the
DPO supported reform actions described below). The second is to ensure that any expansion
of overall social benefits in the medium term give preference to the poorer segments of the
population—this is particularly relevant in the context of the fiscal adjustment program.

79.     In order to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn, DPO-1 supported an
increase in both the coverage of the TSA program and the amount of the TSA benefit.
Coverage of the TSA program increased from 131,182 households (370,901 individuals) in
December 2008 to 155,497 households (about 425,000 individuals) in April 2009. In
addition, the Government increased the amount of the TSA benefit: the base benefit has
remained at GEL 30 per month but the top-up per family member was doubled from GEL 12
to GEL 24 per month as of January 1, 2009. As a result, the budget allocation for the TSA
increased from GEL 126 mln in 2008 to GEL 160 mln in 2009 and was maintained at this
level in 2010.

80.     In addition, both DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported a number of measures to improve
the targeting effectiveness of social transfers. These include consolidating administration
of all social transfers to reduce leakages; adjusting the proxy-means testing formula based on
the findings of a monitoring report; improving business processes related to TSA
administration; implementing an information campaign to raise awareness; and restarting
periodic recertification of beneficiaries.

81.       The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
         Improved the effectiveness of targeted social assistance (TSA) by: (a) linking the
          Social Services Agency (SSA) database with government databases for income tax
          and property in order to review the eligibility status of all beneficiaries; and (b)
          reinforcing newly linked database through recertification of TSA beneficiaries.



                                               27
82.      The measures to further improve the targeting effectiveness of the TSA program
by linking the SSA database to review eligibility of beneficiaries have been successfully
implemented. Since mid-2010, the government started to review the eligibility status of TSA
beneficiaries on a monthly basis by cross-checking responses to SSA interviewers with the
data of other government agencies related to income tax, property, vehicle registration, etc.
This has helped identify a significant number of ineligible beneficiaries, who have been
denied further benefits as a result, thus further improving the targeting effectiveness of the
program. Furthermore, the recertification process of beneficiaries has continued on a
systematic basis, to ensure that households who achieved beneficiary status over two years
ago are still eligible. These measures to remove ineligible individuals and further improve the
program’s targeting effectiveness also free up resources that can be used to expand coverage
to legitimate beneficiaries. This should allow the program to reach out to those in the lowest
two deciles of the population who are not yet receiving TSA. As of March 2011, the number
of TSA beneficiaries was 151,880 households (442,367 individuals).

83.     The BDD 2011-2014 strategy document reiterates that the government’s priority
for social and health programs is to emphasize support for poor and vulnerable
segments of the population, consistent with fiscal realities. The authorities are providing a
summary of their strategy for social and health programs in the Letter of Development Policy.
The 2011 budget provides for TSA coverage to remain at about 400K beneficiaries. Although
fiscal realities have not allowed a further increase in overall coverage of the targeted social
assistance (TSA) program in 2011, the measures to improve effectiveness should allow more
of those in the lowest two deciles to be reached. Under the DPO3 outcome indicator on TSA
coverage (see Annex 3—Matrix of Outcomes / Monitorable Indicators), the share of the
bottom decile receiving TSA is targeted to rise to 45% by 2011. The latest available figure
for 2009 is about 39%, meaning that over 60% of the bottom decile does not receive TSA.
Thus, while the TSA program in Georgia performs well in international comparisons on
targeting effectiveness and adequacy, there is room for expanding coverage of the lowest
decile and quintile.

84.     As a result of the reforms supported under this pillar, the medium-term
outcomes expected include: (i) an increase in percent of poor and in particular, extreme poor
population receiving targeted social assistance (increased coverage of the poor); and (ii) no
significant increase in percent of non-poor population among targeted social assistance
recipients (i.e. no significant loss in targeting effectiveness). The figures based on latest
available household survey for 2009 suggest that the target outcomes are on track to being
achieved.

Improving access to health care through fiscally sustainable strengthening of health care
financing system

85.    Improving access to health care and reducing the impoverishing impact of out-of-
pocket (OOP) health spending have been important challenges in improving Georgia’s
overall social safety net. Although public health expenditures have increased in recent years
(from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.0 percent in 2010), this remains low compared to other
ECA countries. Georgia also had the second highest share of total health expenditure funded
through out-of-pocket payments in the ECA region in 2008, and nearly twice as high as the



                                              28
average among even its CIS comparators.7 Household survey data reveal that both the
incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and the impoverishing impact of out-of-pocket
health spending in Georgia have been at levels that are among the highest in the world.8
According to the Life in Transition Survey (2006 and 2010), Georgian households, including
poor households, identified the health sector among the top priorities for government
investment.

86.      The Medical Insurance Program (MIP) targeted to the poor represents a
significant improvement in access and reduces OOPs for the poorest households. The
MIP offers a free, extensive benefit package financed through general tax revenues. The target
group is identified by the same proxy means test as the TSA program but the eligibility score
for MIP is higher, so that more than double (over 900,000 beneficiaries) receive MIP.
Evidence from an impact evaluation supported by the World Bank suggests that while
utilization has not yet increased, the program leads to a 50 percent decrease in OOPs among
beneficiaries. Furthermore, the evidence shows that MIP leads to a decrease in catastrophic
health expenditures. In 2009, the program accounted for nearly half the total health budget
(the remainder going to disease-specific health programs). Along with the TSA, this program
represents better targeted spending than the majority of the MoLHSA budget.

87.     Georgia also faces challenges in terms of fulfilling its public stewardship role with
respect to the growing private health insurance industry. The MIP entails a transfer of
GEL 159m (in 2010) from the public budget to private insurers in exchange for their services
as purchasers of health care for the poor. This comes with certain stipulations, such as the
prohibition of risk selection (no eligible applicant can be turned away) and a pledge to
reimburse care covered by the government-defined benefit package. However, in the early
years of program implementation, there was not a formalized mechanism for monitoring
fulfillment of these obligations. In addition, international experience indicates that other
coordination functions could usefully be undertaken by the government in order to, for
example, promote the application of common information systems that would help avoid the
pitfall of high administrative costs that frequently arise in a system with multiple private
insurers (e.g., US, Chile).

88.     In order to help confront these dual challenges, DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported a
two-pronged approach comprised of expanding insurance coverage and strengthening
public stewardship. First, MIP coverage was increased from 750,000 to 900,000
beneficiaries in 2009 and an outpatient drug benefit was added to the package in 2010. The
MIP budget increased by about 50 percent in 2009. Second, the government introduced and
subsequently expanded coverage of a publicly co-financed voluntary health insurance
program for the population not covered by MIP. This program (also known as the 5-Lari
program) offered a subsidized minimum benefit package covering primary care and urgent
hospital care. Third, the government strengthened its public stewardship role vis-à-vis the
growing private insurance sector by: establishing a stakeholder forum to oversee private
health insurance companies; developing a standardized classification system for reporting
claims; initiating public support for the health insurance mediation service; and introducing an
electronic system for beneficiary identification.

  According to Georgian and WHO Health for All figures, the OOP share in 2008 was 66.3 percent for Georgia
and 37.4 for CIS countries.

89.       The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
         Protected overall coverage of the Medical Insurance Program (MIP) targeted to the
          poor at about 900,000 beneficiaries, while improving targeting of the poor.
         Strengthened public stewardship of health sector by enforcing internationally
          recognized coding system and completing data architecture required for harmonized
          medical claims processing.

90.      Insurance coverage for the poor has been protected in the face of considerable
fiscal adjustment, with the MIP covering about 904,000 beneficiaries (more than 20
percent of the population) in March 2011. Safeguarding expenditures on priority social and
health programs in an environment of considerable fiscal adjustment is an important objective
for the Georgian authorities. The MIP provides the overwhelming bulk of health insurance
coverage for the poor and is the most effective instrument of financial protection against
impoverishing health payments in Georgia. Although some share of the poor and vulnerable
are still not covered by MIP, the priority at the moment in light of fiscal constraints is to
safeguard the significantly higher coverage achieved in recent years, improve program
effectiveness, and address structural issues in the health care system. The cross-referencing of
the SSA database with other government databases for income tax and property is helping to
further improve MIP targeting of the poor. In 2010, the authorities also renegotiated MIP
premiums with private insurance companies and moved from one-year to three-year contracts,
thus generating savings and allowing the MIP budget to decline from GEL 160 million in
2010 to GEL 130 million in 2011. Furthermore, the publicly co-financed (5-Lari) program,
which provided limited benefits for only about 125,000 beneficiaries in 2010, is being phased
out in 2011 due to limited uptake by the population for this voluntary package.

91.    The authorities are addressing a number of structural issues in the health care
system, including the quality of care and high OOP payments on pharmaceuticals. First,
an ambitious hospital construction initiative is directed at improving the quality of care across
Georgia. Second, drug spending is the single largest category of OOPs in Georgia,
accounting for about half the total. Analytical work shows that pharmaceutical prices and
markups in Georgia are very high (about two to three times the European average) and that
the availability of generics is limited. The authorities are, therefore, trying to enhance
competition in the sector. A law on pharmaceuticals was passed in October 2009 to liberalize
market access by lowering barriers to registering and importing drugs and easing
requirements for retailers to sell drugs. This initiative is showing some signs of a positive
impact by exerting downward pressure on pharmaceutical prices in certain locations. A
survey is being undertaken to measure more systematically the impact of the law on prices,
and will serve to inform policy dialogue going forward.

92.     The measures to put in place the coding system and data architecture for
harmonized medical claims processing have been successfully implemented. These
measures have been supported by the World Bank’s Health Sector Development Project
(HSDP). A decree has been issued which requires all insurers and providers to use
internationally recognized coding systems (these vary for inpatient, outpatient,
pharmaceuticals, etc.) for all medical claims. In addition, a significant milestone was
achieved towards the launch of an IT platform for all medical claims processing with the
finalization of the data architecture required for software and hardware configuration. The
aim is to integrate MoLHSA’s population data repositories with insurers, providers, and

                                               30
pharmaceutical modules. This will help manage the flow of information between the
MoLHSA, health insurance companies, and providers concerning registry and eligibility of
beneficiaries and processing of medical insurance vouchers under MIP and other targeted
social programs. These measures are essential for the smooth functioning of a multiple payer
health insurance model, and will generate the information flows needed to administer the
system efficiently and ensure maximum value for the government’s health expenditures.

93.      As a result of the reforms supported under this pillar, the medium-term
outcomes expected include: (i) an increase in share of bottom two quintiles of population
with access to publicly subsidized health insurance; (ii) an increase in share of population
with access to health insurance; and (iii) an increase accountability and efficiency of the
institutional framework for state-funded health programs. Latest available figures for 2010
suggest that the outcome targets are on track to being met.

PILLAR 3: IMPROVING EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS

94.     Improving competitiveness of the tradable sector is a key challenge for Georgia
to sustain post-crisis growth. The objective is to ensure that a vibrant and competitive
private sector serves as the engine of post-crisis growth in the medium term. Rapid economic
growth during 2004 through mid-2008 was not associated with rapid growth of exports, with
the export share of GDP remaining relatively stable at about 31-34 percent and GDP growth
driven primarily by nontradables.9 Unlike several East Asian economies, strong inflows of
foreign direct investment (FDI) in Georgia were not associated with rapid export growth.
While this is not uncommon in a transition economy beginning a period of sustained
economic growth, in order for growth and employment generation to be sustained over the
medium to long run, Georgia needs to improve the competitiveness of its tradable sector and
expand its export capacity. This is particularly true in a post-crisis environment where FDI
and other capital inflows are expected to remain relatively scarce.

95.     Improving external competitiveness requires addressing a number of relevant
policy constraints. First, trade and exchange rate policy which do not impart any anti-export
or anti-tradable bias are important. Second, improved external competitiveness requires
improved access to transport, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Third,
upgrading skills of the labor force to compete effectively in world markets is important to
support development of tradable sectors and export capacity in particular. Fourth,
strengthening property rights and adopting international standards can play an important role.
Fifth, a key lever of improving external competitiveness is further improvement of the
business environment, which remains among the top priorities for the Georgian authorities.
The status of reforms and progress achieved in each of these areas in Georgia is discussed in
greater detail in the Program Documents for DPO-1 and DPO-2.

96.     In this broad reform agenda, the Georgian authorities have requested the
support of the proposed DPO program in the areas of: (i) reducing the burden of tax
payment and tax compliance on the private sector; (ii) improving customs administration
infrastructure and further streamlining customs procedures to enhance integration with world
markets; (iii) enhancing the export enabling environment by improving access of Georgian

 At the same time, the growth of exports of goods and services during this period, despite trade restrictions on
exports to Russia, is notable.

                                                      31
products to European and international markets; (iv) reform of the statistics system to provide
reliable and timely information to investors and policy makers.

97.    While the business environment in Georgia improved impressively in the four
years leading up to the August 2008 conflict, the costs of tax compliance and
transactions across borders affected business activity. At the outset of the DPO program,
the dimensions of the business environment where relative weakness was found for Georgia,
according to the Doing Business 2009 report, were “Paying Taxes” and “Trading across
Borders”. Along these two dimensions, Georgia lagged its overall high ranking of 15, with
the “Paying Taxes” rank at 110 and the “Trading across Borders” rank at 81.10 At the same
time, BEEPS 2008 reported that one in every four firms finds tax compliance a real constraint
to operating a business and one in every five firms finds customs administration time another
area where improvement is needed. Thus, reducing the costs associated with paying taxes and
importing and exporting are key levers in improving competitiveness of the tradable sector in
Georgia. The capacity building needs in these areas have been supported by the EC
programs, USAID, SIDA and other development partners.

98.    The most recent Doing Business reports indicate that progress has been made
along both the “Paying Taxes” and “Trading Across Borders” dimensions during
2009-2010. Along the taxes dimension, Georgia’s ranking improved from 110th place to 61st
place, indicating that room for progress remains. Along the trade dimension, although
Georgia’s ranking improved from 81st place to 35th place, the costs of exporting and importing
remain high. With Georgia not geographically contiguous with a large external market and
given the importance of developing export capacity for sustained growth and employment
generation going forward, the authorities consider further improvement along both the tax
compliance and customs dimensions a key priority.




10
   While Georgia also significantly lags its overall ranking along the “Closing a Business” dimension, it has
recently adopted a new insolvency law that shortens timelines for reorganization of a distressed company or
disposition of a debtor's assets, which is expected to result in improvement along this dimension going forward.
In addition, the authorities have recently introduced a range of measures directed at simplifying liquidation
procedures, which are expected to significantly reduce the time required to close a business.

                                                      32
Reduce the tax burden on the private sector

99.      In order to minimize tax compliance costs, DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported a
number of successful reform measures. First, intensive work by the authorities on a
number of reform initiatives resulted in a sharp increase in the number of e-filers. These
initiatives include improvements to the IT platform and extensive public outreach. As a
result, the number of e-filing declarations increased from 1,196 (2 percent) in July 2009 to
70,524 (83 percent) in July 2010, far exceeding the modest targets set at the outset of the
program of 2000 e-filers by the end of 2009 and 5000 e-filers by the end of 2010. Second,
following development of selection criteria and testing of software for a risk-based tax audit
system, the system was introduced to make actual rather than simply pilot selections. The
target was for at least half of the planned number of on-site tax audits to be selected by the
system. In fact, information from the Revenue Service indicates that all planned on-site tax
audits between January and April 2010 were selected by the risk-based system.

100.   The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
      Issued comprehensive procedural guidelines for use by tax officers in providing the
       entire menu of necessary services to taxpayers, as part of a program to streamline the
       tax payment system.
      Enhanced the risk-based tax audit system so that all planned on-site tax audits are
       selected by the system; increased the number of planned on-site audits by at least 50
       percent; and reduced the share of control checks to less than 40 percent of total
       (planned on-site audits plus control checks).

101. In order to improve the quality of taxpayer services and standardize procedures
for service delivery, the Revenue Service has developed, approved, and issued
procedural manuals covering a wide range of topics for use by tax officers. Since August
2010, twenty seven manuals have been issued on topics ranging from control purchase, VAT,
profit reinvestment, partnerships, liquidation, and tax accounting. Each manual describes a
number of different scenarios and specifies guidelines for how tax officers should deal with
such scenarios. The objective is to further improve interaction between taxpayers and tax
authorities, so that a uniform set of guidelines are in place for all cases.

102. The targets to increase the number of risk-based planned on-site tax audits and
reduce the share of control checks have been exceeded. Since January 2011, no control
checks have been performed and all planned on-site tax audits have been selected through the
risk-based selection system. As a result, the share of control checks (as a percent of total
planned on-site audits and control checks) has been reduced to zero, which far exceeds the
target of reducing it to less than 40 percent. Earlier, the share of control checks declined from
70% in 2009 overall to 66 percent during the first half of 2010 to 35 percent during the second
half of 2010. The increase in the number of planned on-site audits has also far exceeded the
target. The number of planned on-site audits increased by more than 800% to 890 during July
2010 - April 2011 from 104 during July 2009 – April 2010, which far exceeds the target of a
50 percent increase. The Revenue Service is also working with technical support from the
IFC to further improve the risk-based selection system, including revisions to the risk criteria
to further improve efficiency of the system. In addition, progress made been made on a
procedural manual on tax audit covering 254 scenarios, which is expected to be issued before
the summer. The team has noted the importance of ensuring separation between selection and

                                               33
audit; good international practice is to conduct onsite audit operations in regional offices and
large taxpayer units, with the central unit responsible for audit planning, monitoring,
developing methodologies, and quality control.

103. In addition to the planned reforms to reduce the burden of tax compliance, a
number of tax reforms during 2005-10 have resulted in improved revenue collection and
reduced tax burden. A new tax code was enacted in 2005 and the authorities have improved
the tax regime in terms of tax policy and administration. The tax burden has been
substantially reduced on firms and individuals through a reduced number of taxes, lower and
flat tax rates, and a broader tax base. Restructuring of the tax and customs institutional
framework and measures to eliminate widespread corruption in those systems led to
substantial improvements in tax administration and increased tax collection from 14.6 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 25.8 percent in 2007. The Revenue Service established under the Ministry
of Finance has made voluntary compliance the cornerstone of its modernization strategy.
Taxpayer service centers have been designed and established to make interaction with
taxpayers more efficient and professional and to provide taxpayers with instructions and
guidance.

104. A comprehensive tax amendment was approved in December 2008 (and became
effective as of January 1, 2009) to reduce the tax burden and streamline tax
administration procedures.           The specific measures being implemented under the
amendment include, inter alia: (i) reduction of the personal income tax rate from 25% to 20%
in 2009 and further planned reduction to 18% in 2011 and to 15% in 2012; (ii) reduction of
the tax rate on dividends to 5% in 2009, and planned further to 3% in 2011 and to 0% in 2012;
(iii) granting enterprises the right to submit invoice for VAT refund within 90 days instead of
45 days after transaction; and (iv) payment of VAT refund within 3 months instead of 6
months.

105. As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium term outcomes
expected include: (i) reduced tax burden; (ii) reduced time required for tax compliance; and
(iii) stable budget revenue performance. The baseline time required for tax compliance was
387 hours in 2008 (according to Doing Business), with a target to reduce this by about 15
percent by the end of the DPO program. The Revenue Service estimates that once the latest
data are incorporated, the time for tax compliance should fall to less than 210 hours, which
would amount to a 45 percent reduction. These figures have been shared with the Doing
Business team.

Improve customs management infrastructure and further streamline customs
procedures to enhance integration with world markets

106. While Georgia had substantially liberalized its trade regime by 2007, trade
facilitation through streamlined customs procedures has been an important priority for
the government in recent years. Georgia began actively implementing trade reforms,
including liberalizing trade restrictions and reforming custom services following the Rose
Revolution. These efforts materialized in a new customs code consistent with international
standards adopted in mid-2006. Under this code, Georgia implemented a major trade
liberalization reform, with the number of import tariff rates reduced from sixteen to three: 0,
5, and 12 percent. In parallel, customs administrative arrangements were reformed and
changes in management and staffing were implemented to eradicate corruption, eliminate

                                              34
overlapping functions, and streamline procedures. In recent years, the focus of the authorities
has moved to further streamlining customs procedures in order to reduce the time require to
trade across borders.

107. In order to streamline customs procedures, DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported
measures to introduce and subsequently improve the Risk Management System at
customs. The risk management system was introduced in the first half of 2009 and initially
included yellow and red corridors for all declarations and green and blue corridors for firms
on the Gold List.11 The overall objective of the system is to provide different degrees of
customs inspections for those with different records of compliance. The red corridor requires
documentation and physical examination, the yellow corridor requires documentation only,
and the blue corridor provides streamlined clearance, subject to post-clearance examination of
documents. Subsequently, the risk management system was improved by allowing access to
all corridors for all customs declarations and reducing the number of declarations passing
through the red corridor. As a result, the share of total declarations assigned to the red
corridor was to 8 percent for imports and 1.7 percent for exports by April 2010, compared to
12-15 percent in June 2009.

108.     The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
        Further improved the risk management system at customs by increasing the share of
         declarations passing through the blue corridor above 15 percent and reducing the share
         passing through the yellow corridor below 30 percent.

109. The measures to further improve the risk management at customs have been
successfully implemented. Since July 2010, the share of declarations through the blue
corridor has increased while the share of declarations through the yellow has declined.
Specifically, the share through the blue corridor increased from 8% in July 2010 to 30% in
April 2011; and the share through the yellow corridor declined from 60% in July 2010 to 20%
in April 2011. This exceeds the targets of raising the blue corridor share above 15 percent
and reducing the yellow corridor share below 30 percent. Furthermore, the share through the
green corridor has increased significantly from 28% in July 2010 to 45% in April 2011, while
the share through the red corridor has remained essentially unchanged at about 4-5%. These
trends are in line with the objectives supported by the program to further streamline customs
clearance procedures by moving away from documentary and physical checks toward post-
clearance examination and audit of documents. Important for the success of risk management
is the use of post-control audit. During Jan-Sept 2010, 221 post-clearance audits were
conducted. After a brief interregnum during October-December, 99 post-clearance audits
were performed during the first quarter of 2011. This function has been transferred to the
central audit unit because of better expertise in conducting audit.

110. Comprehensive new customs clearance procedures have been introduced since
January 2011, with the objective of reducing the time to finalize import and export
procedures. The MOF Ministerial Order # 993 (dated December 31, 2010) approves
comprehensive new procedures on the movement and declaration of goods on the economic
territory of Georgia. One of the main initiatives has been to provide a streamlined one stop

11
  Green, blue, yellow, and red corridors provide different degrees of streamlined customs procedures for
importing entities. The Gold List includes importing entities with a sound established track record of customs
compliance.

                                                     35
facility for customs clearance through three newly opened Customs Clearance Zones (CCZs)
or “GEZIs”. At the same time, importers and exporters also have the option of using private
brokers and warehouses for clearance, although the costs are estimated to be greater. The new
procedures have been responsible in part for the sharp reduction in the number of declarations
through the yellow corridor, since declarations at the CCZs are not subject to subsequent
documentary checks. The new procedures also provide for advance declaration of goods,
which would allow the goods to be released from the border crossing point.

111. As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium term outcomes
expected include a reduction in time and cost required to import and export. The baseline
times required to export and import were 12 days and 14 days in 2008. In 2009, the costs
declined to 10 days for export and 13 days for import, respectively. By the end of the DPO
program, these costs are expected to decline by about 20 percent relative to the baseline as a
result of the reforms supported by the DPO.

Enhance export enabling environment by improving access to European and
international markets

112. Access of Georgian products and services to European and international markets
depends on an array of factors. These include tariffs, quantitative restrictions, and other
non-tariff barriers in destination markets. As a result of Georgia’s free trade areas with
several countries and GSP status in several markets, tariffs and quantitative restrictions do not
significantly limit access of Georgian products to those markets. Georgia has free trade
agreements with the CIS countries and has recently signed an FTA with Turkey. Georgian
products have benefited from GSP status in the markets of the EU, the USA, Canada,
Switzerland, Japan, and Turkey.12 Under the EU’s GSP, Georgia has qualified for the special
arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) which offers it
enhanced access to the EU market. At the same time, access of Georgian products to
European and international markets can be impeded by a range of non-tariff barriers including
quality and regulatory requirements in destination markets. Reforms in trade-related areas in
Georgia can play an important role in overcoming non-tariff barriers in destination markets
and thereby improving access of Georgian products to those markets.

113. Progress was made at a brisk pace on identifying trade-related reforms to
facilitate access under the support of DPO-2. Specifically, Georgia identified and started to
implement reforms in trade related areas by submitting draft strategies to the European
Commission on food safety, technical barriers to trade, and competition policy. Following an
EU Deep and Comprehensive FTA (DCFTA) feasibility study in summer 2008, a Central
Task Force on DCFTA Preparation (led by the Advisor to the Prime Minister and with
representation from all relevant agencies of government) was set up by government decree in
February 2009. Detailed specific recommendations from the EC were received in April 2009
and Working Groups on key thematic areas (technical barriers to trade, food safety, and
competition) submitted draft strategies (including operational programs and timetables) to the
EC (DG Trade) in September 2009. In May 2010, the EC obtained a mandate from member
states to initiate negotiations at an appropriate date. Technical assistance from the EC is being
used by the authorities and the Bank is also providing technical assistance to build capacity.

12
 In the United States, GSP expired in December 2010 for all countries, including Georgia. It is not yet clear
when it may be renewed, possibly by end-2011.

                                                      36
114.   The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
      Amended Law on Food Safety and Quality to enable application of food safety official
       control on all food business operators as part of reforms in trade-related areas to
       facilitate access to European and international markets.

115. The Law on Food Safety and Quality was amended by Parliament on December
17, 2010 and enacted on January 3, 2011. This amendment to the Law enables application
of food safety official control on all food business operators, and is a key policy action
implemented as part of reforms in the four trade-related areas. The authorities have shared
with the team an Implementation Report on Steps undertaken by Georgia for DCFTA
Preparedness. The authorities are also preparing a comprehensive draft legislative package
(DCFTA package) covering legislative acts on TBT, SPS, and competition. This is expected
to be submitted by the GoG to Parliament before the summer recess. Earlier, the strategies in
the areas of SPS, TBT, and Competition were agreed with the EC and adopted by the
Government during the summer and fall of 2010. An Independent Study on Piracy and
Counterfeiting in Georgia was also completed. The focus of the authorities is now on specific
implementation steps in these four areas.

116. As a result of reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include laying the basis to create improved conditions for access of Georgian
products to European and international markets.

Reform of the Statistics System

117. Reliable and timely statistics on economic and social conditions are important for
investors and for policy makers. Foreign investors depend on statistics on trade,
investment, and economic conditions to track opportunity and make investment decisions. As
such, the availability of timely and reliable statistics serves to reduce uncertainty and bolster
investor confidence. Not only should statistical indicators be of good quality, but the public
and investors must also have confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the statistics. The
task of producing credible statistics should rest with a public institution that is professionally
and technically competent, free of political influence, and responsive to public needs.
Fulfilling these requirements is the objective of reforms of Georgia’s statistics system.

118. The previous Department of Statistics of Georgia faced significant challenges,
including the need to improve technical capacity and structural efficiency, ensure that official
statistics are of high quality, and enhance public confidence in the integrity of statistics. In
order to meet these challenges, a Commission was appointed by the Prime Minister in
December 2008 to recommend measures for the reform of the statistics system of Georgia.
The objective of the reforms is to ensure that the new statistical system will produce credible,
high-quality, and reliable statistics that are prepared in a manner consistent with international
best practices.

119. In order to address the challenges, DPO-1 and DPO-2 supported adoption of a
concept of reform of the statistics system and subsequent adoption of a new law on state
statistics establishing the statistics office as an independent entity. The Concept on
Reform of the Statistics System was prepared by the Commission and adopted by Cabinet.
The Concept recommended reforms to strengthen the independence of the statistics agency,
adopt internationally recognized statistical methods, and improve institutional structures.

                                               37
Subsequently, a new Law of Georgia on Official Statistics was adopted in December 2009
and the new statistics agency, GeoStat, was established as an independent entity on February
2010. A key priority for the new statistical agency is the implementation of international
best-practice methods in collecting and compiling statistics. Following a request from
GeoStat, the Bank has been providing support to assist in designing the national strategy for
statistical development as well as a master plan to operationalize the strategy. The agency is
also receiving technical assistance from the EU.

120.   The proposed DPO-3 supports the following policy actions in this area:
      Established monitoring department of GeoStat to ensure more effective
       implementation of internationally recognized statistical methods and trained all
       Geostat staff in the use of statistical packages.

121. The Monitoring Department of GeoStat was established as of January 2011 to
ensure more accurate and effective implementation of internationally recognized
statistical methods. As a result of improvements to the monitoring system, the quality of
field work on the different surveys is improving, which was a key constraint facing the
statistics system in Georgia. More than 100 underperforming interviewers were replaced with
more competent personnel. Earlier, the monitoring function was carried out by the
departments in charge of the respective surveys, which was less effective. Geostat is also
training all technical staff in the use of statistical packages. This training was initiated in
November 2010 and completed in April 2011.

122. More generally, GeoStat is moving forward with its ongoing reform of the
statistics system on several fronts. Work has progressed to develop a Strategic Master Plan
(with support from the Bank’s Trust Fund on Statistical Capacity Building), which includes a
three year action plan. The draft strategy was presented by GeoStat to the government,
donors, and civil society in May. After a process of consultation, the strategy is expected to
be finalized and adopted during the summer. Other reforms include improving information
dissemination, with the website making available user-friendly summaries of the main
methodologies and improving presentation of the data and public outreach. Georgia became a
member of IMF SDDS as of May 2010. The time lag in releasing key quarterly and monthly
indicators is being reduced as of Q1, 2011 (GDP from 85 to 80 days, FDI from 75 to 70 days,
business statistics from 70 to 65 days, and monthly CPI from 5 to 3 days).

123. As a result of reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include: (i) increased reliability and independence of statistics; (ii) streamlined
institutional structures; and (iii) improved human capacity and public outreach.


                       VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
124. The Ministry of Finance will act as the main coordinator for managing the
overall implementation of the DPO program. The Ministry also actively participates in
implementing the overall strategic goals of the Government’s annual Basic Data and
Directions reform program based on the “United Georgia without Poverty” strategy
document. The primary implementing line agencies for the DPO program are: the Ministry of

                                              38
Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development, and the Ministry of Labor, Health, and
Social Affairs.

125. The monitoring of the reform program will be carried out through regular
reviews and in the context of the supervision of this operation. Progress in the
implementation of policy measures will be further monitored through other Bank financed
projects, including those that complement actions supported under the DPO program. The
monitoring of public sector reforms as well as public expenditures in social sectors is of
particular importance to the Government.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
126. The DPO series has been designed to mitigate the impact of the economic
downturn on the poor and to improve living standards in Georgia over the medium
term. First, the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework has included significant
reallocation of expenditures, which has created fiscal space for increased social protection and
health expenditures. Second, reforms to scale up and strengthen the social safety net while
maintaining targeting efficiency have had the greatest effect in supporting incomes of the poor
over the course of the economic downturn. Third, in the medium term, reforms to sustain
economic recovery and post-crisis growth are expected to be the driving force behind
improved living standards. Finally, it should be noted that the prior actions supported under
the public finance and external competitiveness pillars are expected to be neutral with regard
to the impact on income distribution.

127. Under DPO-3, expenditures on the TSA and MIP programs are being protected
in the face of significant fiscal adjustment during 2010-11 and additional expenditures
are going toward mitigating the impact of the recent global food and energy price
shocks. As the authorities are implementing fiscal adjustment in 2010-11, the share of the
budget going to health and social expenditures is increasing from about 26.2 percent in 2010
to 27.6 percent in 2011. The TSA, pension, and MIP programs constitute the bulk of these
social expenditures. Furthermore, estimates indicate that Georgia is one of the more
vulnerable countries in the ECA region to the recent global and energy price shocks. In
response, during the first quarter of 2011, the Government issued one-time food and
electricity vouchers worth GEL 57 million to all households in Georgia, which must be
redeemed before July 1. Although untargeted, these initiatives represent a rapid response to
the price shock and the approach ensures full coverage of the poor as well. The authorities
have also announced a 25 percent increase in pensions from September 2011. Again,
although this is untargeted, it should contribute to cushioning the impact of the higher food
and energy prices.

128. The TSA and MIP programs, which are a central focus of the DPO-3 reforms,
contribute significantly to reducing poverty in Georgia. According to survey data for
2009 (most recent available), the poverty headcount in 2009 without TSA would have been
almost two percentage points higher (27.5% versus 25.7%), while the poverty gap would have
been more than two percentage points higher (9.6 versus 7.5). The pensions program is larger
in value and reaches a much wider population. Thus, poverty levels would have been much
higher without pensions, with the headcount and gap reaching 39.1 and 18.6, respectively. In
addition, both TSA and pensions reach a proportionally larger share of the rural population,
and thus have a relatively greater poverty impact in rural areas (thereby also reducing spatial
inequality). These estimates of poverty impact depend, of course, on the poverty line that is

                                              39
chosen. A figure showing the cumulative distribution of consumption, or poverty incidence
curve, for Georgia in 2009 shows that the impact of TSA is well targeted to the poorest
households, while the impact of pensions is felt across the spectrum. Evidence from an
impact evaluation indicating that the Medical Insurance Program has significantly reduced
out-of-pocket spending among beneficiaries is also indicative of its poverty-reducing impact.

        Figure 8. Cumulative distribution of consumption with and without pensions and TSA




129. In addition to budgetary allocations, a number of DPO-3 prior actions are also
helping to strengthen the safety net. These include the linking of the SSA database with
government databases for income tax and property and the recertification of beneficiaries.
These measures are serving to improve targeting effectiveness of the TSA and MIP programs
by identifying households who should not be receiving benefits and by facilitating the
validation of eligibility. This frees up resources for expanded coverage to additional
legitimately eligible households. As a result of these improvements during 2010-11, errors of
inclusion in the TSA and MIP programs have been reduced, thereby improving targeting and
creating space for additional legitimate beneficiaries through improved outreach and coverage
of those who have not yet applied. Household survey data for 2010 expected to become
available during the second half of 2011 will make it possible to shed greater light on the
impact of these measures in strengthening the social safety net and mitigating poverty.

130. Reforms to facilitate economic recovery and post-crisis growth are expected to be
the driving force behind improved living standards in the medium term. Strong growth
during 2004-07 was associated with significant improvements in non-income dimensions of
well-being for the bottom 30 percent of the population, including significantly improved
access to electricity, natural gas, safe water, health, and higher education. As recovery and
post-crisis growth take hold in the restructured Georgian economy in the medium term,
poverty is expected to continue its decline over time. Further work can also elaborate upon
the poverty and social impacts of medium term growth in Georgia.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
131. The policy actions supported by this DPO series are not likely to cause significant
effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources of Georgia. The one
policy area that required careful screening was business environment reforms. The reforms to

                                               40
the business environment supported by the DPO program focus on further streamlining tax
administration to reduce the burden on the economy and improving customs administration
infrastructure and hence do not weaken the institutions and regulations with respect to
environmental protection. In general, experts observe that while the regulatory framework on
the environment in Georgia is broadly aligned with international standards for the level of
economic development of Georgia, the implementation of this framework can be
strengthened. Strategic priorities in environmental protection for a three year period are
explicitly stated in the Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document of the Government of
Georgia comprising strategic objectives and budgeted activities for all sectors.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
132. Public financial management system. The findings and conclusions of various
assessments of the Georgian public financial management system have been incorporated
within and indeed are integral to the design of the DPO. These assessments include: the
World Bank’s 2007 Draft Country Procurement Assessment (CPA),13 the 2003 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),14 the IMF’s 2003 Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes - Fiscal Transparency Module,15 the World Bank’s 2002 Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR),16 the World Bank’s 2003 Public Expenditure
Review (PER),17 and the 2008 Joint World Bank-European Commission PEFA.18 The salient
public financial management issues of these assessments, as well as issues arising since the
publication of these assessments, have been summarized, and progress has been discussed and
addressed as appropriate elsewhere in this Program Document.

133. As discussed in the PEFA report, significant progress was made in reforming the
PFM system since the Rose revolution and a number of areas were identified as
priorities for further reform. The Budget System Law approved in January 2004 set in
place principles of comprehensiveness, transparency and accountability for the budget system,
and rules and procedures for preparation, approval, execution, reporting, and audit of the
budget. The new Budget Code approved in December 2009 further improves the legal
framework in these areas. All extra-budgetary funds were closed and all State financial
transactions were unified within a Treasury Single Account. Legislation defines the division
of power between the Government, external control, and Parliament. The public sector
accounting reform strategy, as well as the financial and performance requirements for Legal
Entities of Public Law (LEPLs) have strengthened the Treasury system and its financial
accounting and reporting framework. The law on local self government finances has defined
the budget and financial control procedures for local self governments and established rules
for formulation, control, audit, evaluation and execution of local government budgets. The
State Procurement Agency has developed regulations for efficient procurement procedures
and continues to improve transparency in public procurement processes by adopting
international standards. The Law on State Procurement was enacted in 2009 that provides a

procurement system.

134. Georgia systematically publishes its approved budget, as well as budget execution
reports. Each approved budget (as well as all approved amendments) is systematically
published on an external website accessible to all. These can be found at the following
location (in Georgian): http://www.mof.ge/budget/by_year. Monthly, quarterly, and annual
budget execution reports are also systematically published at the following website accessible
to all: http://www.mof.ge/en/3992.

135. Review of foreign exchange environment. The IMF conducted the latest safeguards
assessment of the NBG in November 2008. According to the latest report (December 10,
2008), the status of earlier safeguards recommendations are the following: three of the
previous recommendations were fully implemented, and one recommendation was superseded
by three new recommendations. Particularly, it was recommended that the composition of the
Audit Committee be modified to include only non-executive members, supported, as needed,
by an expert advisor. In addition, the committee should provide oversight of NBG’s auditing
and financial reporting mechanisms. It was also recommended that the NBG Council adopt
an action plan for strengthening its vault operations, including through addressing external
audit findings, improving access controls, and automating vault records. The third
recommendation was on coordination of the monitoring and mitigation of existing and
emerging risks, possibly via a new committee.

136. The NBG received an unqualified audit opinions on its latest published financial
statements from its auditors, Deloitte & Touche, in respect of the year ended December 31,
2006, from KPMG for the year ended December 31, 2007, and from Ernst & Young for the
year ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. Overall fiduciary risks are judged to be moderate,
taking into account the arrangements in place.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
137. The proposed Operation is an IDA Credit of SDR 25.0 million (US$40 million
equivalent). The proceeds of the IDA Credit will be released in a single tranche upon
effectiveness. The Operation will be subject to ratification by Parliament before it becomes
effective. The expected closing date of the proposed third DPO is March 31, 2012.

138. The proposed third DPO will be disbursed in US dollars into the Ministry of
Finance Treasury’s Foreign Currency Account maintained at the National Bank of
Georgia (NBG) that forms part of the budget management system. The Recipient shall
ensure that upon deposit of the Credit proceeds into the said account, an equivalent amount in
GEL at the official exchange rate will be deposited within 30 days of disbursement in the
Treasury Single Account in the NBG and accounted for in the Recipient’s budget
management system. The proceeds of the Credit deposited at the Treasury Single Account
with NBG will be available to finance budget expenditures. The foreign exchange proceeds
of the proposed third DPO will be sold by the NBG or held in reserves, in accordance with the
objectives of monetary policy.

139. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the Operation’s administration,
for preparing the withdrawal application, and for maintaining the Treasury Foreign
Currency Account at the NBG. The Ministry, with the assistance of the NBG, will maintain

                                             42
records of all transactions under the Operation in accordance with sound accounting practices.
The MoF will provide to IDA/IBRD a confirmation that the amount of the Operation has been
credited to an account acceptable to the Association (the format of the confirmation letter
should be acceptable to IDA/IBRD). This confirmation letter is required within 30 days of
receipt of the amount.

140. Auditing. Audits of the First and Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation
(PRSO) were unqualified and revealed no issues of concern. Given the progress in fiduciary
reforms, the improvements recorded in the IMF safeguard assessments, the unqualified audit
opinions provided in the NBG’s recent audited financial statements (FY 2006, FY 2007,
FY 2008, and FY 2009) and on PRSO I and II, and no audit requirement under PRSO III and
IV, and DPO-1 and DPO-2, no additional fiduciary arrangements including audit are required
for the third DPO.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
141. This operation faces several macroeconomic risks which could affect reform
implementation and outcomes. First, risks related to the global recovery could result in a
renewed deterioration in the external environment for Georgia, which would negatively
impact exports, remittances, FDI, and other private capital inflows. Second, renewed
domestic and regional tensions or other factors could have a further adverse impact on
investor and consumer confidence, which would constrain further private investment and
growth of credit to the private sector. These scenarios would affect the outlook for growth in
Georgia and affect operation outcomes even if the reform program is implemented as planned.
The fall out would require further external adjustment, possibly including further realignment
of the real exchange rate, faster fiscal adjustment, and additional official financing, preferably
on concessional terms to safeguard debt sustainability. Such a scenario would also add to the
public debt burden and increase the ratio of nonperforming loans of the banking sector.

142. Further risks arise from the recent increases in food and energy prices and from
the upcoming 2012-13 elections. Increases in food and fuel prices could intensify or result
in second-round effects onto the prices of other products, which would raise pressures on the
NBG to further tighten monetary policy and also increase fiscal costs for assistance to the
vulnerable. Finally, the 2012-13 elections carry the risk of adding to fiscal pressures.

143. The macroeconomic risks are mitigated to some extent by a number of factors.
First, the authorities’ macroeconomic framework is supported by an IMF SBA program,
which provides strong backing for the country’s reserve position (presently, the SBA provides
exceptional financing at 500 percent of quota). The Bank and the IMF have intensified their
macroeconomic monitoring and are holding a continuous policy dialogue with the authorities
on macroeconomic developments and policy responses. Second, the authorities have affirmed
their commitment to the envisaged fiscal adjustment and flexible exchange rate policy, which
provide key anchors for external and debt sustainability. Third, Georgia’s debt burden
indicators remain within relevant prudential thresholds, with the successful refinancing of the
Eurobond in April 2011 providing a strong vote of confidence from capital markets. Fourth,
on price pressures, the NBG has already preemptively tightened policy, which should help
stabilize inflation to about 8 percent by end-2011. Finally, on fiscal pressures from the
2012-12 elections, the authorities have front-loaded a good part of fiscal adjustment and are
committed to financing additional necessary expenditures through savings in other areas or
through improvements in revenue collection.

                                               43
144. Domestic and regional tensions are also subject to a number of mitigating factors.
On regional tensions, mediation efforts are ongoing with support from the international
community and bilateral partners. Domestically, political conditions remain stable following
local and municipal elections at end-May 2010, with parliamentary and presidential elections
scheduled for 2012 and 2013 respectively. The Government’s efforts to expand outreach and
communication with civil society and business groups, as well as its countercyclical policies
and financial relief to vulnerable groups, have helped to mitigate some of the political
tensions.

145. The operation also faces program-specific risks, including the risk of reform
implementation. The reform program supported by the DPO includes an array of reforms
considered important for meeting the Government’s development objectives. Progress in
implementation of the reform program is dependent upon effort and capacity of the
authorities, as well as support from relevant stakeholders. For example, the reforms in the
areas of program budgeting and capital budgeting involve coordination among different line
ministries, as well as parallel capacity building. The reforms to the social safety net have
important implications for the distribution of income and therefore require support from key
stakeholders. Finally, the success in the trade-related reforms to enhance access for Georgian
products in European and international markets depend not only on policy progress on the
Georgian side, but are also affected by decisions taken by trading partners. These risks are
mitigated to some extent by strong Government ownership of the reform program and broad-
based donor support on capacity building and technical assistance for different components of
the reform program.

PRIME MINISTER
 OIFGEORGIA



               GEORGIA: THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION (DPO-3)
                          LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY



      Mr. Robert Zoellick
      President of the World Bank
      Washington, DC


      Dear President Zoellick,

      1. Since 2004, Georgia has implemented broad and deep economic and governance reforms
         to maintain macroeconomic stability, streamline its business environment, strengthen its
         public finances, upgrade its infrastructure including enhanced energy sustainability. and
         improve education, health, and SOCIal services. More specifically, the range of reforms
         include deep deregulation through limiting state intervention, dramatically simplified
         licensing, simplified tax and customs codes, improved tax administration and reduced tax
         rates and number of taxes, and 2417 electric,ty service. Largely as a re&ult of these
         reforms, Georgia'" real GDP growth was 9.6% in 2005, 9.4% in 2006, and 12.3% in 2007.
         This strong economic performance was driven by rapidly rising foreign direct investment
         (FDI) flows, attracted by Georgia'S credible privatization program and dramatically
         improved busineas environment. Net I'D! inflows more than tripled between 2005 and
         2007 as Georgia',. rank in the World Bank's Doing Business report improved from 112th
         place in 2005 to 12th place in 2011.

      2. Broad institutional and systemic reforms that Georgia has implemented over the last
         seven years have centered on anticorruption measures. We have established strong
         mechanisms of accountability and transparency in the government. Our reforms have
         emphasized the competitive private sector as the main engine of growth, with the state
         playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services --_._- as seen in
         improvements in education and health care delivery and the introduction of a well·
         targeted social safety net to protect the extreme poor. Major reforms in public fmancial
         and fiscal management enabled significant and rapid improvements in tax collection.
         Consolidated budget revenues which in 2003 amounted to 1,368 million GEL increased to
         5,866 million GEL in 2010, while consolidated budget revenue as a percent of GDP
         increased from 16.0% in 2003 to 28.2% in 2010, all this against the backdrop of
         drastically reduced number of taxes and of tax rates. Improved fiscal policy and
         administration enabled us to increase public expenditures in education and health
         services, to start addressing infrastructure development needs, to provide tm'geted social
         assistance for the poor and the most vulnerable.

      3. The August 2008 war with Russia compounded by the effects of the global financial crisis
         resulted in shocks to our economy. The cumulative impact of these shocks triggered
         negative economic and social repercussions for Georgia. As a result of the shock to
     investor confidence and substantially increased global risk aversion, both FDI and
     private international lending inflows decreased in the short run. The global economic
     slowdown also impacted on the amount of incoming remittances. These circumstances
     affected the major components of aggregate demand in our economy and led to a
     downturn in economic growth. Real GDP grew at only 2.3% in 2008 and contracted by
     3.8% in 2009.

4. The Government responded swiftly to mitigate the impact of the global economic
   downturn and to facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth. With its
   solid track-record of fiscal discipline, proper fiscal-monetary interaction, and improved
   external debt sustainability, the Government implemented a sizable, well-timed and
   well-designed countercyclical fiscal stimulus package aimed at averting a protracted
   economic slowdown and at minimizing social costs. This countercyclical stance was
   accompanied by measures to further optimize our budget and prioritize spending.
   Specifically, social and infrastructure expenditures were increased and spending was cut
   back in some other areas. Social benefits for the vulnerable were scaled up. The
   effectiveness and size of our countercyclical fiscal effort benefited from external
   assistance from key development partners like the World Bank. This is particularly true
   in the case of budget support operations which make it possible for public expenditures to
   respond flexibly, swiftly, and effectively to economic circumstances.

5. We worked closely with all partners, including the World Bank, to mobilize resources,
   and we plan and execute our countercyclical stimulus within the framework of the multi-
   year, multi-donor platform aligned with the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) for Georgia
   prepared in October 2008 by the United Nations and the World Bank. Our analysis
   suggests that the donor assistance in the form of budget support is significantly
   correlated with our capacity to promptly and adequately implement the public
   expenditure policy measures devised by the Government.

6. As a result of the Government's swift countercyclical response to the downturn, of the
   strengthening investor confidence, and the improving external environment, our
   economy has rebounded strongly. Real GDP growth was 6.4 percent in 2010 and
   available data indicates that growth has continued at a robust pace in the first quarter of
   2011. Exports and tourism have been major drivers of the post-crisis recovery and
   growth. Merchandise exports expanded by 39.7% in 2010 and 35.8% in the first quarter
   of 2011, while tourism receipts increased by 38.5% in 2010. Imports increased by 37.3%
   in the first quarter of 2011 and tax revenues increased by 33.8 percent, providing further
   indication of continued robust expansion of economic activity. FDI in 2010 continued to
   be affected by lower global FDI flows.

7.   CPI inflation increased to 13.9 percent in March 2011 as a result of higher global food
     and fuel prices. In order to mitigate the social impact of higher prices we distributed food
     and electricity vouchers worth GEL 57 million since February 2011. Meanwhile, work is
     in progress to prepare a more permanent adjustment in pension and social assistance
     benefits .. Based on the expected stabilization of global commodity prices, we project CPI
     inflation to moderate to around 8.5 percent by year end.

8. As economic recovery has taken hold, the Government has been winding down the
   countercyclical stimulus and implementing quality fiscal adjustment. The overall fiscal
   deficit was reduced from 9.2% of GDP in 2009 to 6.6% of GDP in 2010. We are strongly
   committed to preserving and reinforcing Georgia's sustainable macroeconomic
   framework. Our medium-term macro-fiscal framework projects a further reduction of the
   overall fiscal deficit to 3.6% of GDP in 201l. In implementing the fiscal adjustment, we
    are committed to further enhancing expenditure efficiency by safeguarding key social
    and infrastructure expenditures and by moving forward with our program and capital
    budgeting reforms, as required by our new Budget Code.

9. Although we have had to weather a sharp economic downturn, our macroeconomic
   framework remains strong and adequate. The Seventh and Eighth Reviews under the
   IMF Stand-by-Arrangement (SBA) approved in September 2008 were completed in
   January 2011 and the completion of the Ninth and final Review is scheduled for June.
   Our macroeconomic policies are guided by our commitment to gearing our fiscal,
   monetary, and exchange rate policies towards supporting macroeconomic stability,
   protecting our economy from shocks, and facilitating the process of macroeconomic
   adjustment. We are committed to a flexible exchange rate to safeguard external
   sustainability, export competitiveness, and growth prospects. Flexible management of
   the exchange rate contributed to the correction of the current account deficit (from 23
   percent of GDP in 2008 to less than 10 percent of GDP in 2010) and to a rebound in
   international reserves, which are now back to pre-crisis levels.

10. International investors' confidence in Georgia's strong economic recovery and credibility
    of our economic policies allowed Georgia to tap international capital markets in April
    2011, with a highly successful lO-year benchmark Eurobond transaction (500 million
    USD, yield to maturity 7.125%) allowing to buy back a previously issued 5-year
    Eurobond coming due in 2013 and thus to significantly reduce the 2013 debt service
    spike.

11. The Government of Georgia is also committed to persevering with its ambitious medium-
    term structural reform agenda. The strategic directions of the Government's medium-
    term structural reform agenda are Articulated in the annual Basic Data and Directions
    strategic document. We are committed to outcome· maximizing actions which are
    economically sound, technically feasible, and are designed to trigger lasting positive
    impact. Budget support is very important to further reinforce our capacity to effectively
    deliver on this commitment while at the same time sustaining the momentum of
    institutional and systemic reforms that are underway in Georgia.

12. Support from the World Bank is critical to the success of our ambitious recovery and
    reform agenda. The proposed Third Development Policy Operation (DPO-3) is the third
    of a programmatic series of three operations designed to support key elements of our
    policy reform agenda to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in the short-term
    and facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium-term.
    The proposed DPO-3 shifts emphasis toward measures directed at sustaining the
    economic recovery and preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term. In
    addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework, the main policy areas
    supported by the DPO series are: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public
    finances; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving
    external competitiveness.

13. Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Public Finances. In this policy
    area, we are focusing on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances to
    ensure that public expenditures are most effectively sustaining economic recovery and
    creating the conditions for rapid post-crisis growth. Greater efficiency will also allow
    retaining public expenditures within sustainable economically-sound limits, thereby
    freeing up resources for private investment to again become the primary engine of
    economic growth in the medium term.
14. Specifically, in this area, we are developing a new methodological framework for program
    and capital budgeting as part of implementation of our new Budget Code. The draft
    methodology, endorsed by Cabinet in October 2010, systematically lays out the
    definitions, concepts, and methodological framework for program budgeting, including
    instructions for capital budgeting. Work has progressed to further improve the
    methodology; following a period of consultation with line ministries, parliament, and the
    chamber of control, the methodology is expected to be approved by ministerial decree by
    end-June. This will form the basis for government-wide program and capital budgeting
    for 2012. In addition, we believe that a phased approach to strengthening our broader
    capital budgeting systems is an important priority and a potential key instrument of
    medium term fiscal adjustment.

15. Second, we are moving forward with a multi-year, stepwise process to enhance the
    results-orientation of the budget to increase the focus on outputs generated beyond a
    mere focus on inputs or resources allocated. Specifically, we submitted to Parliament
    program budgets for 2011 with a new program/subprogram structure and corresponding
    hierarchy of specific and measurable performance indicators for six ministries.
    Furthermore, for the three ministries which submitted program budgets for 2010, we
    have reported on actual performance against the indicators of the prior year. These
    measures are creating embedded incentives to improve efficiency in the use of resources
    and delivery of public services.

16. Third, we are improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment by
    strengthening the multi-year public investment program where project priorities and
    funding requirements are elaborated in a single document. Specifically, we submitted to
    the Parliament a public investment program for 2011 including the complete time profile
    of project financial information, summary project justifications, and physical monitoring
    indicators covering a majority of public investment. Furthermore, we reported on actual
    versus planned project implementation for the 2010 public investment program. These
    measures are increasing transparency and accountability of public investment
    programming over a medium term horizon and they will help to progressively strengthen
    the system of preparing, selecting, and monitoring implementation of public investment
    projects.

17. Improving the Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net. In this policy area, our key
    objectives have been to continue to improve the effectiveness of the social safety net to
    protect the vulnerable and to ensure that the benefits of growth in the medium term are
    broadly shared.

18. Our strategy for social and health programs, as described in the 2011-2014 Basic Data
    and Directions document, is to emphasize support for poor and vulnerable segments of
    the population, consistent with fiscal realities. Our main social and health programs
    include targeted social assistance (TSA), the medical insurance program (MIP) targeted
    to the poor, the pensions program for the elderly and disabled, and assistance to
    internally displaced persons (lOPs). In recent years, we have significantly increased
    coverage and benefits under these programs to provide improved benefits to a greater
    share of the poor and vulnerable. The share of the poorest population decile receiving
    TSA increased from 31.6% in 2007 to 39% in 2009, while the share of the poorest two
    quintiles receiving publicly subsidized health insurance increased from 20.7% in 2007 to
    36.9% in 2010. Measures to improve targeting effectiveness are helping to progressively
    reach even greater numbers of the poor. Our pensions program for the elderly and
    disabled has also been shown to have a large poverty mitigating impact. We have also
    announced a 25% increase in pensions from September 2011 and we are exploring
    options to further increase pensions by 2013.

19. Over the last year, we have improved the targeting effectiveness of TSA by linking the
    social services agency (SSA) database with government databases for income tax and
    property and by reinforcing the newly linked database through recertification of
    beneficiaries. These measures have helped identify a significant number of ineligible
    beneficiaries, thus freeing up resources to expand coverage to greater numbers of the
    poor. As a result of our reforms in this area, we expect the share of the bottom
    population decile receiving TSA to rise to 45% by the end of 2011.

20. In the area of health care financing, we have protected coverage of the targeted medical
    insurance program (MIP) at about 900,000 beneficiaries (more than 20 percent of the
    population) in an environment of considerable fiscal adjustment. The MIP has been
    shown to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditures for beneficiaries by 50 percent and is
    thus a highly effective instrument of financial protection against impoverishing health
    payments for the poor in Georgia. The publicly co-financed voluntary "5-Lari" program
    has been phased out due to limited uptake by the population. We are moving forward
    with initiatives to address a number of structural issues in the health care system,
    including facilitating an ambitious hospital construction initiative to improve the quality
    of care and lowering barriers to importing, registering, and retailing drugs to reduce high
    pharmaceutical prices.

2l. In order to strengthen public stewardship of the health sector, we have enforced an
    internationally recognized coding system and completed the data architecture required
    for harmonized medical claims processing. These measures, which will help manage the
    flow of information between all involved parties concerning medical claims processing,
    are essential for the smooth functioning of a multiple payer health insurance model and
    will contribute to greater efficiency of the system.

22. JW..I!!"Qying Extesnal Competitiveness. We believe that a vibrant and competitive
    private sector is essential for sustaining economic recovery and driving post-crisis
    growth. A key priority for us is to improve external competiveness as a means to
    restoring rapid and sustained economic growth. In this sphere, the DPO has supported
    our reforms in three crucial areas: (i) reducing the costs of tax compliance for the private
    sector; (ii) improving customs infrastructure and further streamlining customs
    procedures to enhance integration with world markets; and (iii) enhancing the export
    enabling environment by improving access of Georgian products to European and
    international markets.

23. As part of streamlining the tax payment system, we have issued comprehensive
    procedural manuals for use by tax officers in providing the entire menu of necessary
    services to taxpayers. Since August 2010, twenty seven manuals have been issued on a
    wide range of tax topics to ensure that uniform guidelines are in place for all cases. The
    goal is to further improve interaction between taxpayers and tax authorities and improve
    the quality of taxpayer services by standardizing procedures for service delivery. We
    have also enhanced the risk-based tax audit system by markedly increasing the number
    of planned on-site audits and reducing the share of control checks (in 2011 control checks
    were eliminated), as well as ensuring that all planned on-site audits are selected by the
    risk-based system.

24. In order to continue to streamline customs procedures, we have further improved the
    customs risk management system by markedly increasing the share of declarations
    through the blue corridor and reducing the share passing through the yellow corridor. As
    a result, customs clearance is relying less on documentary and physical checks and more
    on post-clearance examination and audit. In addition, comprehensive new customs
    clearance procedures have been introduced since January 2011, under which a
    streamlined one stop facility has been made available through three newly opened
    Customs Clearance Zones and a provision for advance declaration of goods has been
    introduced.

25. The Government is committed to enhancing the export enabling environment by
    improving access of Georgian products to European and international markets. As part
    of this, we are implementing trade· related reforms in four priority areas, including
    sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT),
    competition policy, and intellectual property rights. Specifically, we have amended the
    Law on Food Safety and Quality to enable application of food safety official control on all
    food business operators. We are also preparing a comprehensive legislative package
    covering the TBT, SPS, and competition areas for submission to Parliament.

26. The Government has also embarked on a major reform of the official statistics system,
    the benefits of which cut across each of the reform pillars supported by the DPO.
    Following the establishment of an independent statistics office (GeoStat) with
    streamlined institutional structures, it is now focused on measures to ensure more
    effective implementation of internationally recognized statistical methods and improve
    the human capacity of staff. Specifically, a separate monitoring department has been
    established and all GeoStat staff have been trained in the use of statistical packages.

27. I wish to take this opportunity to assure you of our strong commitment to the principles
    of accountability and transparency in the context of public finance management and
    donor coordination. In recent years, we have successfully implemented far· reaching
    reforms aimed at improving our planning, budgeting, and internal control systems, at
    ensuring fiscal transparency and at streamlining related processes and structures. We
    remain strongly eommitted to applying these principles of full accountabIlity and
    transparency, including in relation to all donor support.

28. We have worked closely and productively with our World Bank colleagues in designing
    and monitoring implementation of the reform program supported by the DPO and in
    identifying the key actions supported by this series of programmatic operations. We
    have made important progress in implementing the key components of our reform
    program supported by this operation. The Government's reform program supported by
    the DPO series has already produced a number of important outcomes. The economic
    downturn was contained in 2009 and the economy rebounded strongly in 20lO, with
    fiscal policy moving swiftly from effective stimulus in 2009 to quality adjustment during
    20lO·11. On public finances, important steps were taken toward further improving
    efficiency by enacting the new Budget Code. Our program and capital budgeting reforms
    have subjected a greater share of public expenditures to improved performance indicators
    and enhanced transparency and accountability for public investment programming. On
    the social safety net, benefits have been scaled up and the share of the poor receiving
    publicly subsidized health care and targeted social assistance has increased markedly
    while maintaining targeting effectiveness. On external competitiveness, improvements
    were achieved in reducing the time required for tax compliance and for trading across
    borders; progress has been made in identifying and implementing trade· related reforms
    for improved access of Georgian products to international markets; and the independence
    of the statistics agency with streamlined institutional structures has been established.
29. We are encouraged by these results. In the coming year, we are committed to
    maintaining the reforms momentum, while ensuring both the quality and the intended
    impact of these reforms.

The Press Release for the Ninth Review of the IMF’s Standby Arrangement completed on

IMF Executive Board Completes Ninth and Final Review Under Stand-By Arrangement
for Georgia
Press Release No. 11/224
June 9, 2011

On June 8, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed
the ninth and final review of Georgia’s performance under the economic program supported
by a Stand-By Arrangement.

Georgia’s Stand-By Arrangement was approved by the Board on September 15, 2008 (see
Press Release No. 08/208) for an amount equivalent to SDR 477.1 million (about
US$ 770 million1). On August 6, 2009, the Executive Board approved an augmentation of
access under the SBA to an amount equivalent to SDR 747.1 million (about US$ 1.2 billion)
and an extension of the SBA until June 14, 2011 (see Press Release No. 09/277). Between
2008 and July 2010, an amount equivalent to SDR 577.1 million (about US$ 930 million)
was disbursed under the SBA. Since then, the authorities have treated the arrangement as
precautionary. The arrangement expires June 14, 2011.

In completing the review, the Board approved a waiver for the nonobservance of the
performance criterion related to government expenditure.

Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Georgia, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:

“The Georgian authorities are to be commended for successfully implementing the SBA-
supported program. The program objectives have been largely achieved, evidenced by the
rebound in economic activity, improved market confidence, and the recovery of international
reserves to their pre-crisis level. At the same time, the external adjustment process is not yet
complete; public debt should be reduced further; and growth needs to be sustained to reduce
unemployment. It will be important for the authorities’ medium-term policy framework to
address decisively these challenges.

“The authorities are firmly committed to fiscal consolidation. It will be important to preserve
sufficient flexibility to introduce revenue-enhancing measures, should the need arise.
Moreover, the planned increase in pensions should be structured and financed in a way that
does not compromise the fiscal objectives.

“The authorities’ current monetary policy stance is appropriate in the absence of second-
round effects from the food and fuel price hikes. The authorities stand ready to adjust this
stance promptly if signs of more persistent inflation emerge. The enhanced exchange rate
flexibility achieved over the course of the program is commendable and should remain an
anchor of the authorities’ economic strategy.

                                               62
“The banking sector has largely overcome the stress from the 2008 conflict and global
financial crisis. Close monitoring for any signs of emerging new vulnerabilities in the sector
will be important. The steps taken by the supervisory authority to strengthen its internal
analytical capacity and responsiveness to risks are welcome.”
