    World Bank’s DPO Series Supports Economic Recovery and Helps
    Mitigate Crisis Impact


Synopsis
Supported by a series of three IDA/IBRD development policy operations (DPOs) during 2009–
11, Georgia’s economy rebounded strongly by 6.3 percent in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011. The
social safety net was strengthened to help cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor:
coverage under the targeted medical insurance and social assistance programs expanded to
900,000 (a fifth of the population) and 440,000 people, respectively, by 2011. Tax, customs,
and trade-related reforms helped bolster investor confidence and competitiveness, with the
share of electronic tax filings leaping from 1 percent in January 2009 to over 85 percent by
end-2010. The results orientation of the budget was enhanced and capital budgeting
strengthened to produce more effective public expenditures and fiscal policy.




Challenge                                           MULTIMEDIA
In 2008–09, Georgia was hit with the dual
shocks of the August 2008 conflict with Russia
and the global financial crisis. Investor and
consumer confidence deteriorated and foreign
direct investment, exports, remittances, and bank
lending contracted. Economic growth fell sharply
to 2.3 percent in 2008 and a contraction of 3.8
percent in 2009, from growth in excess of 9
percent between 2004 and mid-2008. Georgia
found itself with thousands of new internally
displaced persons (IDPs) and thousands more
hurting from the loss of jobs and income. The       MORE
authorities were faced with the dual challenges
                                                     Support for Georgia and its Economy
of mitigating the impact of the economic
downturn in the short term, and facilitating
recovery and preparing Georgia for post-crisis
growth in the medium term.                                       More Results
Approach
The Bank responded in 2009–11 with a series of three
DPOs amounting to US$175 million in highly concessional
budget support to back key objectives of the government’s
                                                                    900,000
policy reform agenda. The DPO series supported a                    people received targeted
                                                                    medical insurance in 2011, up

fiscal stimulus to restore confidence and mitigate the
downturn in 2009, followed by quality fiscal adjustment to
safeguard sustainability as economic recovery took hold in
2010–11. The structural policy reforms supported included
improvements in: (i) the efficiency and effectiveness of public
finances to better target public expenditures on mitigating
                                                                    85%
                                                                    of tax filings were submitted

vulnerable; and (iii) external competitiveness to ensure that a
vibrant and competitive private sector sustains economic
recovery and serves as the engine of post-crisis growth.            MORE INFORMATION

members. Similarly, roughly 900,000 people received
targeted medical insurance in 2011 (compared to 750,000 at
the end of 2008), and an outpatient drug benefit was added
to the insurance package.
DPO-backed tax, customs, and trade-related reforms helped strengthen competitiveness and
bolster investor confidence. The share of electronic tax filings increased markedly (from 1
percent in January 2009 to more than 85 percent by end-2010), reducing tax compliance costs
for businesses. Improved risk management helped lower the costs of customs clearance and
trading across borders, with the share of customs declarations subject to physical inspection
(red corridor) down from 13 percent in January 2009 to 5 percent in January 2011. As a result
of progress in identifying and implementing select trade-related reforms to improve access of
Georgian products to international markets, the European Union (EU) decided to begin Deep
and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) negotiations with Georgia in early 2012.
As economic recovery took hold, fiscal adjustment was implemented in 2010 and 2011 to
safeguard macroeconomic stability. Public expenditure efficiency benefited from the enactment
of a new Budget Code, enhanced results orientation of the budget, and strengthened capital
budgeting. A greater share of public expenditures is being covered by improved performance
indicators, and the transparency and accountability of public investment are being
strengthened.
The reforms backed by the DPO series have helped Georgia pull itself out of economic crisis
and build a foundation for growth in the post-crisis period.

Bank Contribution
The DPO series amounted to US$175 million in total of IDA credits ($165 million) and IBRD
loans ($10 million). DPO-1 for the amount of $85 million IDA was approved by the Board in
July 2009. DPO-2, including an IDA credit of $40 million and an IBRD loan of $10 million, was
approved by the Board in July 2010. DPO-3, amounting to $40 million IDA, was approved by
the Board in July 2011.

Partners
The Government of the Netherlands provided cofinancing of €2.5 million for DPO-1 and €2
million for DPO-2. The design and implementation of the DPO program benefitted from close
coordination with several partners, including the Netherlands Embassy, the International
Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Agency f
or International Development, and the United Nations Development Programme, as well as
other development partners, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.

Moving Forward
The DPO series is expected to close in March 2012. The Government of Georgia has
requested that the World Bank support its post-crisis reform agenda to sustain growth and
employment generation through a new DPO series. The Bank is also responding to the
government’s request for analytical and advisory services to better understand the sources of
and prospects for growth and public expenditure efficiency in Georgia.

Beneficiaries
The DPO-supported reforms provided financial and medical aid to thousands of poor and
vulnerable Georgians while the economy regained its footing. Grigol Beruchashvili and Medea
Darchia are a poor, elderly couple suffering from multiple health problems. The government’s
DPO-backed targeted social assistance and medical insurance programs offered critical help.
“ The voucher prolonged my life. I am alive today only thanks to this voucher ,” said Grigol
Beruchashvili, who recently had to undergo expensive surgery.
The reforms have also bolstered investor confidence and improved competitiveness by
reducing business costs and making it faster and easier to move goods in and out of Georgia.
“ The Customs people treat us well. I don’t even have to leave the truck. The papers are
processed in 5 minutes. Everything is done in an orderly fashion,” said truck driver Otar
Mdivnishvili at the newly reconstructed Sarpi Customs checkpoint on the border with Turkey.
