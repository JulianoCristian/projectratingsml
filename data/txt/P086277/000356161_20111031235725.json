increase Roads Department of the Ministry of Regional\n            Development and Infrastructure's (RDMRDI's) and\n            local governments' capacity to manage the road network\n            in a

Due to an 8 month delay in the\n            rehabilitation of two road sections under the project, a\n            closing date extension will be needed from its current\n            October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. This closing date\n            extension will allow the full achievement of the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO)."}, "docdt": "2011-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
