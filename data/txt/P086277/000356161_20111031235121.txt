SUMMARY
The Government of Georgia has requested the World Bank assistance to restructure the
Secondary and Local Roads Project. The proposed changes would enable Georgia to
complete the rehabilitation of two road sections under the project. For this, an extension
of the closing date of the Loan from October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 is requested. In
addition, the Government would like to increase its financing share given that the total
cost of the project, due to an appreciation of the GEL against the US dollar, has turned
out to be greater than estimated in approximately GEL4.5 million (US$2.7 million). The
Government proposes that the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the Loan be
reduced from 70 percent to 50 percent.


PROJECT STATUS
The progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) is
satisfactory. Project implementation progress is moderately satisfactory (MS) as it is
anticipated that all contracts with the exception of two will be completed by the current
closing date. All other project ratings are satisfactory except safeguard compliance which
is rated MS. The safeguards rating of MS relates to an instance of unanticipated land
acquisition. Because it appears to have been a single incident and involved a small area
(approximately 4,000 sq. meters), it was agreed that the Involuntary Resettlement policy
would not be triggered pending a determination as to whether the procedures followed
were consistent with the principles of OP 4.12 and whether any retroactive remediation
measures would be required. The Bank is in the process of reviewing documentation
received from the Government and will follow up as necessary. The safeguards rating
will be reconsidered either once it has been determined that no retroactive measures are
needed, or when any such required measures have been completed.

Credit IDA-39380-GE for SDR 13.8 million, approved on June 24, 2004, has been fully
disbursed and will be closed on the current closing date. To finance road rehabilitation of
about 450 km of priority secondary and local roads, an Additional Financing Loan IBRD-
76710-GE for US$70 million was approved on March 19, 2009 and is 97 percent
disbursed, with US$1.9 million undisbursed. All procurement under the project is
complete and respective contracts signed. Forty nine contracts have been signed under
the project and 37 have been completed. The remaining 12 contracts are in progress. The
latest project audit report has been received on time and it is satisfactory to the Bank.

PROPOSED CHANGES
Financing

The percentage of expenditures to be financed by the Loan (inclusive of taxes), as
indicated in the table Eligible Expenditures in Section IV. Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds
of the Loan Agreement, will be modified. This will allow the Government to cover
approximately $US2.7 million of the cost of road rehabilitation works which is larger
than originally estimated. It is proposed to decrease the percentage of expenditures to be
financed by the Loan from 70 percent to 50 percent as per the table that follows.

Closing date

Due to an 8 month delay in the rehabilitation of two road sections under the project, a
closing date extension will be needed from its current October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.
This proposed closing date extension will allow the full achievement of the PDO.
