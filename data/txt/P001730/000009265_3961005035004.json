parastatals; c) to\n            modify the regulatory and institutional framework in order\n            to promote increased private sector participation in the\n            provision of services and the execution of works; d) to\n            rehabilitate and maintain a priority network of transport\n            infrastructure; and e) to improve the transport\n            operation's efficiency, and reduce transport costs. The\n            project has four components: 1) a capacity building and\n            training component to support the reorganization of\n            transport services, and to implement sector policy measures;\n            2) a road component focusing on road maintenance, the\n            improvement of rural and urban roads, technical studies and\n            supervision, and the purchase of equipment for routine road\n            maintenance; 3) a railway component focusing on the\n            execution of the first tranche of a 10-year track\n            rehabilitation program and the construction of a freight\n            terminal, the improvement of the telecommunication system,\n            the purchase of three medium capacity locomotives and\n            rehabilitation of equipment, logistical equipment and\n            studies to implement the railway restructuring policy; and\n            4) an investment component for airports to finance both\n            safety equipment for the Timbuktu and Bamako-Senou airports\n            and technical studies."}, "docdt": "1994-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
