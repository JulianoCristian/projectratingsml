A transport project, such as the Fifth Highway\n            Project, has both direct and indirect consequences on the\n            environment. An environmental analysis of such a project is,\n            therefore, a way of introducing (and teaching about) the\n            environmental issues in the transport administrations. It\n            can also serve as a reference for future projects. This\n            environmental analysis is the result of a mission realized\n            to study the environmental impact of the Fifth Highway\n            Project. The objectives of the mission were the following:\n            1) to identify the existing documentation and competence\n            necessary for the environmental analysis of transport\n            projects in Mali, and, most importantly, to put on record\n            the deficiencies; 2) to establish a first diagnosis on the\n            environmental impact of the Fifth Highway Project and to\n            make some recommendations for future projects; and 3) to\n            immediately create a dynamic involving information sharing\n            and teamwork between the different partners of these\n            national and international projects."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
