This Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP)\n            specifically looks at the legislation concerning the\n            approach to indigenous peoples' education, its\n            diagnosis, directives, objectives, and goals. Within this\n            framework of new dynamics and concepts of education,\n            legislation incorporates the inclusion of indigenous\n            populations to the national official system of education,\n            bearing due respect to their culture, and traditions. This\n            IPP addresses in particular the curricula for indigenous\n            schools, and identifies the study areas, and main themes as\n            follows: a) curricula will consider indigenous pedagogy, the\n            history of education, psychology of education, as well as\n            educational management; 2) regarding society, nature, and\n            culture, the themes will address socio-anthropological\n            aspects, and historic, geographic, and natural science\n            aspects, taking into account the time-space factors,\n            biodiversity, and territorial knowledge; 3) regarding\n            language, bilingual education will emphasize both maternal,\n            and national languages, in addition to including education\n            in the arts of varied societies - music, crafts, etc.; 4)\n            mathematics will initially focus on the native systems of\n            measures, and numerals. Courses will be available for\n            indigenous teachers training, and would include a spectrum\n            of themes, from past, present, and future earth and land\n            aspects, to productive systems, health and education,\n            biodiversity and culture, within both theoretical and\n            practical levels."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
