Phase Bahia\n            Education Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: Addressing the needs of marginalized populations.\n            By the inclusion of the indigenous education sub-component\n            in the Project was a learning opportunity for both the\n            Secretariat of Education and Culture (SEC) and the Bank. The\n            results of this component are considered very positive, both\n            for the indigenous communities involved, as well as in the\n            perceptions of local officials of improvements in\n            relationships between these communities and local\n            government. The impact study found that having a certified\n            principal in a school was positively correlated with higher\n            achievement. The idea of certification was also positively\n            received by all groups interviewed as part of the\n            beneficiary study. Providing ongoing certification\n            opportunities for new principals and other education\n            specialists may be an effective way to improve education\n            quality. Accelerated classes. Given Bahia's staggering\n            rates of age-grade distortion, the inclusion of accelerated\n            classes in the Project could not have been more relevant. As\n            demonstrated in the impact studies, these classes also made\n            a significant contribution towards improvement in this\n            regard. With age-grade distortion in the fundamental cycle\n            now estimated as standing at 45.6 percent, continuing with\n            accelerated classes deserves serious consideration."}, "docdt": "2007-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
