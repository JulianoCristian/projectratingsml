This environmental assessment (EA)\n            first considers the site selection criteria, and the\n            technical specifications for each architectural project, to\n            comply with the country's environmental regulations,\n            and the Bank's operational directive on the\n            environment. Considerations include adversity on critical\n            natural habitats, the potential for land flooding, adversity\n            to local populations as a result of construction and damage\n            to existing infrastructure - electricity, water supply,\n            access roads - as well as surface, and groundwater\n            contamination. The criteria for environmental mitigation,\n            outline measures as follows. Sites selection would avoid\n            flood prone areas, and as possible natural habitats, in an\n            effort to preserve biodiversity, and natural water flows.\n            The standard school designs will address sanitation in\n            particular, to include toilets, and adequate sanitary\n            measures. Protective barriers will be installed to contain\n            soil erosion, and divert water flows which might potentially\n            endanger construction, based on hydrological studies, and\n            geological data conducted for the implementation of each\n            specific project. Drainage systems will be surveyed to\n            monitor rainwater, surface, and groundwater to contain\n            erosion, and in addition, as sanitary control, and hygiene\n            monitoring to prevent water contamination, while septic\n            tanks will also be installed. Construction contracts would\n            include precautionary clauses to ensure adequate disposal of\n            debris, including toxic residues, oil spillage, and\n            hazardous chemicals. Vegetation propagation will be\n            practiced following construction, to maintain and increase\n            the local flora and fauna, and to control erosion, and air\n            pollution, but in accordance with strict selection of native\n            species, adequate to local soil nutrients. Finally,\n            architectural choices will respect cultural heritage sites,\n            and, contractors should inform the archaeological\n            authorities, should discoveries of historical or cultural\n            value occur."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T22:23:05Z"}
