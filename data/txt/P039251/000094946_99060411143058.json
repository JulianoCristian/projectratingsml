Project aims to enhance the private sector's role\n            in the economy through the transfer of state-owned assets,\n            the placement of state-owned banks on a sound financial\n            footing, and the creation of an environment conducive to\n            private sector growth and development. The project has three\n            main components and will establish a project management unit\n            to implement the program. 1) Under the privatization\n            services component, technical assistance will be provided to\n            support large state-owned enterprise divestiture through\n            case-by-case privatizations, work-outs and liquidations, and\n            privatizations through pools. 2) Under the financial sector\n            services component, technical assistance to the financial\n            sector will cover advisory services for bank restructuring\n            plus the establishment and operation of the Asset Resolution\n            Agency. 3) Under the business environment component,\n            technical assistance will cover support for implementing the\n            new accounting and audit laws; long term institutional\n            capacity-building in the bankruptcy courts; advisory\n            services for tax reform, and various studies on business environment."}, "docdt": "1999-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
