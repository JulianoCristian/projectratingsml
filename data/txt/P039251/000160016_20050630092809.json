sustainability is highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Among the lessons gleaned from this project:\n            1) Given a sustained high degree of borrower's\n            ownership of, and commitment to, the program, even a very\n            complex and ambitious program can be implemented\n            successfully. 2) A true assessment of the supervision\n            quality of a TA project that supports an adjustment\n            operation cannot be done as a stand-alone project; the\n            entire program (the TA as well as the adjustment operation)\n            should be assessed as one activity. 3) The Bank and the\n            Borrower worked closely to be flexible on the design and\n            approaches to implement best practice solutions. During the\n            implementation phase, where donor grant funding was\n            available, the Borrower, in consultation with the Bank,\n            opted to use grant financing. The savings that accrued as a\n            result of such donor intervention, was used by the Borrower\n            (in consultation with the Bank) to fund new activities, that\n            further enhanced the reform program. 4) A well-functioning\n            project management unit, staffed with competent and\n            committed people, trained and fairly remunerated is\n            essential for a successful implementation of a\n            multi-component and complex project such as this one. As a\n            result of the efficient implementation arrangements that\n            were in place for the project, the Bank and the Government\n            were able to attract substantial donor financing. 5) The\n            Bank team that prepared this project supervised it through\n            to completion. This continuity also contributed to the\n            success of the project. 6) Complex technical assistance\n            projects tend to disburse slowly. Overall, the\n            project's assumptions were realistic, but the time\n            frame assumed (three years) for the implementation was\n            short. A complex project like this requires a longer period\n            for implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
