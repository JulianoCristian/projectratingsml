"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Legal Reform Project\n            for Kazakhstan was unsatisfactory, the sustainability was\n            unlikely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. The loan was cancelled on\n            March 2002 at the borrower's request. The lessons\n            learned during the course of preparing, implementing,\n            amending, and bringing to closure this project required\n            significantly more time and care in its design and\n            implementation than more targeted legal/judicial\n            strengthening operations. The depth and sustainability of\n            legal reforms may require more than four years, therefore an\n            Adjustable Program Loan (APL) structure may be more\n            appropriate. It is important to have one or two\n            \"key\" ministries or agencies taking responsibility\n            for the overall project direction. The Bank should continue\n            to refine and improve its project monitoring and evaluation techniques."}, "docdt": "2003-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
