To\n            achieve these objectives, the project comprises:  (a)\n            replacement of 1,346 STWs in Punjab and 380 STWs in Sindh,\n            through installation of 14,800 PTWs by farmers in both\n            provinces; (b) improvement of about 500 watercourses in\n            Punjab to facilitate interfarm distribution and sharing of\n            pumped groundwater by PTWs jointly owned by small farmers;\n            (c) provision of consultants to assist project\n            implementation, in the preparation of hydrogeological and\n            impact evaluation studies, and future SCARP transition\n            projects; and (d) training."}, "docdt": "1991-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
