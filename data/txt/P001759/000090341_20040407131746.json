The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            created a platform for tourism development and regional\n            integration by using an innovative approach to biodiversity\n            conservation. In some ways, the potential of this project -\n            for achieving regional integration and creating a platform\n            for tourism development - was under exploited by the Bank.\n            Land demarcations are the first step in ensuring that\n            communities are not overwhelmed by private sector operators\n            and marginalized during the development process. The\n            importance of tourism was not sufficiently recognized until\n            the Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCA) Unit was\n            somewhat fortuitously established. The project created\n            institutional capacity within the Ministry of tourism\n            (MITUR); however, it took four years for its implementation\n            (and five years of preparation). Sensitive issues such as\n            communities living in National Parks need to be dealt with\n            all stakeholders and to be resolved before approval.\n            Inclusion and strengthening of provincial and district\n            governments is needed to improve sustainability. Creating an\n            enabling environment for the private sector and encouraging\n            high quality investors is a difficult and complex challenge.\n            In similar projects, an advisor dealing with private sector\n            issues should be appointed. In order for a pilot project to\n            produce results with new methodologies, an Monitoring &\n            Evaluation (M&E) system must be in place. A concerted\n            effort is required by Government of Mozambique (GOM), with\n            support from the donors, to ensure that communities are not\n            marginalized by land allocations and that the true real\n            estate values of land are attained through auctions or tenders."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
