equipment; rural transmission and frequency conversion studies;
and technical assistance for management and training.
III.   Benefits would comprise:  (a)  satisfaction of power demand in the
LEC system until 1985 and its positive impact on economic, indus-
trial and commercial activities; (b) improvement of LEC's management,
staffing and finances; and (c) supply of electric power to about
5,000 low-income families in the Monrovia area.
IV.   Risks:  The risks involved in the physical implementation
of the project are not greater than normal for projects of
this type. However, there may be risks with respect to the
implementation of the non-physical aspects of the project (e.g.,
management, training and financial viability of LEC), although
measures have been included in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
to minimize them.

INTERNATIONAL BjANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE LIBERIA ELECTRICITY CORPORATION WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA FOR A
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) with the guarantee of
the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$10 million to help finance
a fourth power project. The loan would have a term of 20 years including
5 years of grace with interest at 7.5 percent per annum. The balance of
the foreign cost totaling US$19.4 million would be financed by the following:
a loan of $4.7 million equivalent from the European Investment Bank (EIB),
a loan of $3.7 million equivalent from the Arab Bank for Economic Develop-
ment in Africa (BADEA), and a loan of $11 million equivalent from the Saudi
Fund. 1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic report "Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic
Economic Report" (No. 426a--LBR dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the
Executive Directors. An economic mission visited Liberia in November/December
1976 and its report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia"
(No. 1642a-LBR) dated Februmary 28, 1978 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings. Iron ore mining is by far the largest
single activity in the encLave sector, accounting for about one third of
gross domestic product at Eactor cost.  There are only limited linkages be-
tween the enclaves and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits
of economic growth have been unevenly distributed.
4.        Another dimension of structural imbalance is the disparity between
traditional agriculture and the (monetized) modern sector. Traditional agri-
culture has minimal interaction with the rest of the economy; however, it
supports the majority of the population - as much as 60 percent - who live at
or near subsistence level. With a population of about 1.6 million, average
per capita GNP in 1976 was US$450. While the enclave sector yields a per
capita GDP of about US$2,500 compared to US$550 for the rest of the monetized
1/   The precise terms of the loans from the cofinancing agencies have not
yet been confirmed pending final approval by their respective Boards.



- 2 -
economy th~ 7reat majority of the population who live in the traditional non-
monetized sector have a per capita income of about US$100 per annum. To help
redress these imbalances the Government is trying to increase its earnings
from the concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with
increased participation by Liberians.
Development Plan
5.        The Government has prepared a Four-Year Development Plan covering
the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan the Govern-
ment was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference: President's Memorandum to
the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The Plan identi-
fies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic development
as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustainable socio-
economic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement of
Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of the
benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living
for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of real GDP
during the Plan period is envisaged at around 6.8 percent. However, because
of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore mining
and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, the Bank
economic mission estimated that real growth during the four-year period
is unlikely to exceed 3-4 percent. Total development expenditure is projected
at US$415 million, of which US$251 million would be financed from foreign
sources and US$164 million domestically. Firm commitments accounted at the
start of the Plan for almost 60 percent of the expected foreign financing.
However, the Plan is currently being revised to take account of developments
during the first two years. This review is not yet complete but it is clear
that the cost of the public investment program will increase substantially
largely to reflect increased costs but also the inclusion of additional
projects. Actual development expenditures over the first two years of the
Plan are estimated at about $200 million. Given the financial, manpower and
institutional constraints it is likely that the implementation of a number of
the projects, as revised, will be delayed beyond the Plan period.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to the development of
agriculture and basic infrastructure. The objective is to diversify and
modernize agricultural production, increase productivity, improve associated
rural economic activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social
and physical infrastructure to promote income distribution and improve the
quality of life in the rural as well as urban areas. The Government has
already embarked on two important agricultural development projects in the
Bong and Lofa counties which are being assisted by the Bank Group and USAID.
The rubber development project, recently approved by the Executive Directors,
and the proposed forestry project will help promote export earnings and will
lead to greater participation of Liberians in the development of the country's
principal agricultural resources. At the same time the Government plans to
expand water supply and electric power utilities in both urban and rural areas
and to improve the road network, the inadequacy of which presently constitutes



- 3 -
a constraint to growth. However, the shortage of adequately trained manpower
at all levels is likely to prove the most important constraint to the Govern-
ment's efforts to develop arid diversify the economy. The Government is keenly
aware of this and has adopted a number of policy measures, supported by the
three Bank Group financed education projects, to tackle the problem. However,
by their very nature, these policies are likely to bear fruit only in the
long term; over the short and medium terms, the Government will have to rely
heavily on foreign technical assistance.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries, was
hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong world
demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export commodi-
ties -- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP -- which averaged
about 6.4 percent a year in the 1967-1970 period has slowed down significantly
and is estimated to be about 3.0 percent in 1976. Preliminary estimates
indicate that GDP growth may have declined further during 1977.
8.        Liberia has had aL long history of sound fiscal management, and public
sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in Government revenues averaging about 13.5 percent per
year between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing expendi-
tures. Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10 percent
while development expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However, public
sector finances have recently come under increased pressure which is likely to
continue over the medium term mainly because of an anticipated acceleration in
the rate of growth of government expenditures coupled with a more moderate
rate of growth in revenues. The rate of growth of Government revenues is
likely to be moderate in view of the anticipated lower GDP growth rate as well
as the continued slack in world demand for iron ore. There may be scope for
an increased revenue effort on the part of Government as well as improvements
in the efficiency and pricing policies of the public corporations so as to
ease the pressure on central government finances. In this context, Government
has recently enacted a new Revenue and Finance Law and is also negotiating
with the iron ore companies regarding its share in profits and future dividend
distribution policies. In order to assist the Government in coping with the
increasing financial constraint, it will be necessary for external donors to
finance some local costs in selected projects with a low foreign cost content.
Balance of Payments
9.        During the 1964-*1972 period, merchandise exports grew by 10 percent
and imports by 5.9 percent. annually in current prices. Thereafter, from
1972-74, mostly reflectings accelerated international inflation, imports rose
by 29 percent annually, exceeding the 22 percent annual export growth. Oil
imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. From
1975 onwards the decline in the volume of exports has been partly offset by



- 4 -
favorable movement in the terms of trade but the trade surplus nevertheless
declined from US$110 million in 1974 to US$61 million in 1976, while the
current account deficit, reflecting the substantial remittances of capital and
other factor income from enclave operations, recorded about US$93 million in
1976 as compared with US$30 million in 1974. The rising current account
deficits have been financed mostly by private capital transactions.
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$199 million as of December 1976. Debt service payments
as a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated
at 4.3 percent in 1976 as compared to 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent for 1974
and 1972 respectively. Debt service payments as a percentage of government
revenues have also declined from 24.3 percent in 1972 and 21.1 percent in
1974 to 13.4 percent in 1976. Based on the existing debt, both ratios are
projected to increase gradually in the next few years as export earnings are
expected to level off and public revenues grow more moderately. The Bank
Group share of the public debt outstanding and disbursed is presently about
18 percent. Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is expected to
remain relatively modest (below 10 percent) unless there is an unexpected
deterioration in external conditions. In this context, it should be noted
that Liberia's exports are highly concentrated in a few commodities (mainly
iron ore and rubber) with unstable world market prices. Given the country's
satisfactory economic performance and its modest debt service ratio, Liberia
should be regarded as creditworthy for a significant amount of Bank lending,
blended with some assistance from IDA.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has approved 16 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$98.30 million; there have been 6 IDA credits
totalling US$30 million and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$555,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have been mainly for roads, port expan-
sion, power and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of April 30, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:  (a) to help Liberians
to play a larger role in developing their own resources for the benefit of
their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader
sharing of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in
broadening the economic base and overcoming infrastructural constraints to
growth; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development resources
from other external agencies. In furthering these objectives particular
attention is being paid to the need to expand the supply of trained manpower
so as to relieve this potential constraint to development.



- 5 -
13.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan, the Bank plans to give increasing emphasis in its
lending program over the next few years to the agricultural sector. The
Bank Group is co-financing with USAID two agricultural projects currently
under implementation in Bong and Lofa Counties. These projects are designed
to assist a tot<.; of about 17,000 subsistence peasant farmers to diversify
their production base and to increase their productivity and income through
the provision of an integrated package of support services and infrastruc-
tures. The Bank is discussing with Government further rural development
projects for possible Bank Group financing. A rubber project has recently
been approved which would lead to expanded exports, increased productivity and
incomes for small and medium size farmers, strengthened credit and extension
services and promote greater Liberian participation in the development of this
subsector. A forestry project has been appraised which would strengthen the
Government's forest service, initiate an industrial plantation program and
help Liberia to better manage and exploit its forestry resources.
14.       In infrastructure, a water supply project is under preparation
which would rehabilitate aLnd expand the Monrovia water supply system, extend
water distribution to lower income groups in the metropolitan area, and help
strengthen the management and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewerage
Corporation. A feeder roads project is under preparation which would help
expand Liberia's feeder road network in support of the Government's agricul-
tural and rural development programs. In the power sector, the proposed
fourth power project wouldl expand the Liberia Electricity Corporation's
thermal power generating i-acilities to meet increasing demand until around
1985. The project would include management and training assistance to LEC and
service connections to about 5,000 urban poor households in Monrovia. In the
social sector, three education projects have been financed by the Bank Group.
The first two projects aimed at improving secondary education, education
planning and management, as well as extending the educational system to rural
areas through the provision of secondary schools and 45 village community
schools. The third project which was approved in May 1977 emphasizes voca-
tional and technical training, and would assist in increasing the supply of
trained manpower. The Bank is planning to follow this up with a manpower
sector survey as a basis for preparing a further education project.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Bank Financing in the Sector
15.       The Bank has made three previous loans to the power sector in
Liberia totalling US$16.8 million. The first two loans (Loan 684-LBR of
US$7.4 million in June 1970 and Loan 778-LBR of US$4.7 million in July 1971)
helped finance a project consisting of a 34 MW expansion of the Mt. Coffee
Hydro-electric Project, two 19 MW gas turbines, and associated transmission
and distribution facilities. The Bank made a supplementary loan (Loan 778A-
LBR) of US$2.9 million in 1973 to cover project cost increases caused by



- 6 -
(a) currency fluctuations and (b) an increase in the size of the gas turbines
selected for installation. The physical aspects of the projects were com-
pleted satisfactorily with some minor delays. Subsequently, however, the
two 19 MW gas turbines developed operational problems. LEC has obtained the
cooperation of the manufacturer in dealing with these problems; the manufac-
turers will share the cost of past repair for the turbines, prepare a training
program and provide the services of an engineer to train LEC's technical
staff. The third power loan (Loan 1150-LBR) of US$1.8 million was made in
1975. It provided primarily for technical assistance to improve the corpora-
tion's management, particularly in terms of the development of senior staff,
strengthening financial management, and the formulation of a long-range de-
velopment plan. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) project peformance
audit report (No. 1551 of March 31, 1977) on the first and second projects
concluded that the institution building aspects of these projects fell short
of meeting their objectives while the physical aspects were implemented more
successfully. Despite efforts under the third power project to strengthen
LEC, Liberian staff are still unable to assume senior management responsibi-
lities, energy losses are high and the financial position of LEC has been
weak. This can partly be attributed to the fact that the expatriate managers,
under pressure of day-to-day operations, were not able to devote sufficient
time to training and partly because they did not operate as a team (paragraph
39).
Sector Objectives
16.       The principal sector objectives being pursued at present include:
(a) Increasing firm generating capacity to meet demand
through 1985;
(b) Planning for future expansion of generating, trans-
mission and distribution facilities to meet demand
beyond 1985;
(c) Extending the Monrovia system to nearby rural centers
to the extent feasible;
(d) Extending electricity supply to a wider section of the
population both in Monrovia and the rest of the country;
(e) Improving LEC's management and staffing, including a
program of gradual Liberianization; and
(f) Maintaining LEC financially viable.
Sector Institutions and Background
17.       Responsibility for the public supply of electric power was entrusted
to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) until 1975. PUA was established in
1962 as an autonomous statutory corporation and its responsibilities included
water supply and sewerage as well as electric power. In 1973 PUA became a
public holding corporation with subsidiaries for power, water and sewerage,



telecommunications and broadcasting. The former Power Division of PUA then
became the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC). In 1975 PUA was abolished
and its four subsidiaries, including LEC, became independent corporations.
18.       At present, LEC produces about 37 percent of Liberia's total energy
output. The remaining 63 percent is produced by private sources, mainly
the iron ore mines and rubber companies. LEC's Monrovia system, serving the
coastal area from Robertsport to Buchanan, is the main source of public supply
of power. However, LEC also operates eight secondary centers (branch stations)
as an agent of the Government. The operations of the branch stations, which
have a total capacity of ablout 8 MW, are subsidized by the Government. At
present, LEC has a total of 138 MW of generating capacity, of which 64 MW is
hydro and 74 MW thermal.
19.       The mining and rubber concessions had to generate their own energy
at the time they started operations because PUA's capacity was limited to
the Monrovia area.  Since they have already installed their own facilities,
the companies now appear to be reluctant to depend on a supply outside their
own control.  Nevertheless, LEC sells power to one mining operation (Bong
Mines Corporation) at present; it also sold power to the Liberia Mining
Company (LMC) until the beginning of 1977 when LMC's operations were closed
down. The other companies (e.g., LAMCO in Nimba) are too far to be served
economically by the MonrovLa system. The privately owned facilities have an
installed capacity of about 143 MW.
20.       The country is served with AC at 60 cycles per second.  Liberia
is the only country in West Africa employing this frequency; all other coun-
tries use 50 cycles per second.
21.       Public electricity supply presently serves about 15 towns with
some 400,000 people, (about 25 percent of the total population of Liberia)
only 40 percent of whom live in households with a connection. The degree of
electricity coverage is therefore low, reaching only about 10 percent of the
country's population. The proposed project would provide connections for urban
poor households and studies for extension of service to adjoining rural areas.
Existing Facilities
22.       The Monrovia System - The Monrovia power system consists of:
(a) the Mt. Coffee hydroelectric power plant on St. Paul river, with four
turbines, of which the first two have a capacity of 15 MW each and the other
two 17 MW each; and (b) th,e Bushrod thermal power station with four gas
turbine units (one of 13 MW, one of 14 MW, and two of 19 MW each) and five
diesel electric units (with a total capacity of 9 MW). Mt. Coffee is a
run-of-river plant which operates at full capacity only during the rainy
season lasting from May to November and declines in output to about 10 MW in
the dry season when the flow of the river permits only one of the turbines
to operate. While the 13 MW and 14 MW gas turbines at Bushrod undertaken
earlier by PUA have operated satisfactorily, the two 19 MW units purchased
under the Bank's First Power Loan have not been reliable due to frequent



- 8 -
breakdowns attributable to technical defects. LEC has now obtained the co-
operation of the manufacturers to settle this problem. Assuming that these
two units will be in normal working condition and would supplement output
during the dry season, the present firm capacity of the Monrovia system is
estimated at 65 MW. The big difference between the firm and installed capa-
city of the syst^m is due to the sharp decline in the output of the Mt. Coffee
hydroelectric plant during the dry season. The firm capacity is just suffi-
cient to meet the current peak demand which stands at about 65 MW so that
additional generating capacity needs to be provided to meet the expected load
growth (see para 24 below). This is the justification for the generating
component of the proposed project.
23.       Branch Power Systems - The eight small branch stations operated
by LEC on behalf of the Government are not connected to Monrovia's grid.
They are scattered in different rural areas of the country. Their generat-
ing facilities are all diesel electric, and their total capacity is 8 MW.
The branch stations have been experiencing managerial, financial and tech-
nical difficulties. The proposed project would address these difficulties
(see paragraph 42 below).
Growth Prospects
24.       Electric power demand grew at an annual rate of 12 percent between
1969 and 1973 mainly as a result of increased industrial and commercial activ-
ities in the Monrovia area. Growth declined to an annual rate of about 3
percent in 1974-1976 as a result of steep increases in the price of petroleum
fuel that led to higher tariffs. However, recent studies conducted by LEC's
consultants (Motor Columbus) project that demand will grow at the rate of
about 7 percent a year and will reach a peak of about 112 MW in 1985.
Sector Planning and Development Strategy
25.       Sector planning has been weak, although several studies have been
carried out over the past few years. It is only recently that systematic
investment planning has been seriously undertaken by LEC. Under the Third
Power Project, assisted by the Bank, LEC has created a permanent planning unit
to prepare a power development plan, with the assistance of consultants, to
meet the country's future power requirements.
26.       Liberia's hydropower potential is relatively limited.  Except for
the Mano and Cavalla rivers bordering Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast respec-
tively, suitable sites for storage have not been identified so far. The
national hydroelectric potential located wholly in Liberian territory is
estimated at only 50 MW of firm installed capacity. Together with its pos-
sible share of the Mano and Cavalla rivers potential, Liberia's total hydro-
power potential is estimated at about 175 firm capacity. The possibility
for storage upstream from Mt. Coffee on St. Paul river is being examined by
LEC's consultants, Chas. T. Main, under the Third Power Project. In 1975,
a general survey of the country's hydroelectric resources was conducted by
a Japanese consulting firm, the Electric Power Development Co., Ltd. (EPDC)



under the sponsorship of Japan's International Corporation Agency (JICA).
The study recommended that: pre-feasibility studies be carried out on one site
on the Mano river and two sites on the St. John river. The Government has
approached JICA for assist:ance with respect to the proposed pre-feasibi-
lity studies on the St. John river. Pre-feasibility studies have also been
carried out on the hydropower development potential of the Mano river. The
studies were done in 1976 by Czech consultants called Hydroprojekt (Prague),
with UNDP assistance. The Government will have to decide in the next two
years on the order of precedence of the hydropower additions to the existing
system on the basis of th,s comparative merits of various proposals (St. Paul,
St. John, Mano river, etc.).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The project is 'based on a feasibility study by Motor Columbus with
the assistance of Bank staff pre-appraisal missions. The project was
appraised by a Bank mission which visited Liberia in May 1977. A report
entitled "Appraisal of the Liberia Fourth Power Project," No. 1746a-LBR
and dated June 5, 1978, is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations were held in Paris from May 4 to May 9, 1978. The
Government/LEC delegation was headed by Messrs. Arthur Cooper and Lionel
Keller.
Project Objectives
28.       The project's main objective is to assist the Liberia Electricity
Corporation (LEC) in financing its program for (a) expanding its generating
capacity to meet projected demand until 1985; (b) strengthening its manage-
ment, staffing, and financial position through various measures such as
technical assistance, training, and tariffs; and (c) increasing access to
electric power for low-income urban households.
Project Description
29.       The project would comprise the following components:
(a)  Extension of Bushrod Power Station:  This consists of a
26-MW diesel electric extension of the existing Bushrod
power station ]Located about 8 km north of Monrovia. The
civil works for this extension would be designed to
accommodate three 13 MW units, although only two would be
installed under the proposed project. A third unit will
need to be installed by 1982/83. The generating units will
be low-speed diLesel engines designed to burn heavy fuel
oil.
(b) Service to the Urban Poor: About 5,000 additional low-
income families in the Monrovia area will have access
to electric power under the project. The measures to



- 10 -
provide this access would include (a) exempting low
income households whose consumption of electricity is
not expected to exceed 40 KwH per month from payment of
connection charges, including deposits, and (b) providing
financing by Government to households for minimal interior
wiring installations. These installation costs would be
recovered through monthly installments on the electricity
bills. The costs of connections between the network and
households would be recovered through LEC's tariffs and the
offshore component would be financed under the proposed
loan. LEC and Government have agreed that low-income
families would be exempted from connection charges, in-
cluding deposits, and that arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank would be made not later than June 30, 1979 for the
financing of interior wiring installations (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.08; Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.05).
(c) Provision of Maintenance Vehicles and Tools: This
component would provide vehicles and tools for the
crew dealing with customer service connections and
disconnections and with the control of fraudulent
electricity consumption (see para. 43 below). It
would include about 10 vehicles, tools for distribu-
tion work, testing stands and workshop facilities for
testing and repairing meters and other instruments.
(d) Staff Training: A comprehensive training program
for all levels of LEC's staff would be arranged under
the project. In order to meet its specific needs,
LEC would establish a modest training school on its
premises with three classrooms and three workshops.
A suitable training program has been agreed with LEC
and Government for implementation under the project (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.03). About 12 man-years of expatriate
instructors for staff training are also included under this
component; this would be in addition to the training
mentioned under sub-paragaph (e).
(e) Appointment of Management Support Team: About 25 man-
years of expatriate management assistance are provided under
the project. Half of the time of this management support team
would be devoted to staff training and project execution, and
the remainder to LEC's general operations.
(f) Frequency Conversion Study: About 6 man-months of con-
sultant services are provided under this component to
carry out a study of the cost, timing, and economics
of changing the frequency of Liberia's power system
from 60 cycles to 50 cycles per second. Power inter-
connection with neighboring countries and the development
of the hydroelectric potential of the rivers bordering



- 11 -
Liberia with the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone would be
facilitated if the frequency were standardized at the
50 cycles per second used by all other countries in
West Africa.
(g) Study of Transmission to Gbarnga: This component would
consist of (i) feasibility studies of a possible trans-
mission line from Mt. Coffee power plant to Gbarnga
(about 175 km) and associated rural distribution system
to replace the present high cost diesel generation;
and (ii) engineering design and tender documents if
the results of the feasibility studies are positive.
Project Cost
30.       The estimated total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is about
US$31.6 million, of which about US$29.4 represents foreign costs. The cost
estimates include physical contingencies of 13 percent for civil works and 5
percent for equipment. Price contingencies are also included at the rates of
7 percent (1978), 6.5 percent (1979) and 6 percent (1980) and 7 percent per
annum (1981-82) for equipment, transport, installation and engineering ser-
vices, and at 8 percent (1978) 7.5 percent (1979) and 7 percent (1980) for
civil works. LEC is subject to import duties and taxes on its capital invest-
ments but will be fully reimbursed for these by Government during the period
of the project.
Project Financing
31.       The foreign cost: of the project would be financed by the Bank
($10 million), BADEA ($3.7 million), the Saudi Fund ($11 million), and
the European Investment Bank ($4.7 million). The terms of the loans from the
co-financing agencies have not yet been confirmed pending final approval of
their respective Boards. The local cost of US$2.2 million would be borne by
LEC.
32.       The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million would cover about 34 per-
cent of the project foreign cost, or about 32 percent of total project cost,
and would help finance the foreign costs of the following components: (a)
engineering services for Bushrod expansion; (b) service connections for urban
low income households; (c) maintenance vehicles and tools; (d) staff training,
(e) employment of management support team; (f) frequency conversion study;
(g) study of transmission to Gbarnga rural area; (h) generators and electrical
equipment for Bushrod expansion; and (i) civil works for Bushrod expansion.
33.       EIB would finance items (h) and (i) above on a joint basis with
the Bank. The Arab Agencies (Saudi Fund and BADEA) would jointly finance
the foreign cost of the two diesel engines and associated mechanical equip-
ment for Bushrod extension. The signing of the loan agreements with the
co-financiers will be a condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01).



- 12 -
Procurement
34.       Items to be financed solely by the Bank or jointly by the Bank and
EIB, would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. The exception would be the construction of the
training school (estimated to cost about $250,000), to be financed by the Bank,
which would be procured after local competitive bidding in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Project items to be financed by BADEA and
Saudi Fund would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures approved by these agencies.
Disbursement
35.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:
Amount of the
Loan Allocated       % of Total
Category                                   (US$ million)       Expenditures
(1) Generators and electrical equipment

(2) Civil works for Bushrod power station
expansion                                        2.46                47

Total Bank Loan                      10.00
EIB joint financing will cover 43 percent of the foreign costs of Category 1
and 2. It would be a condition of disbursement of Bank funds for the service
connections for the low-income households that arrangements, satisfactory to
the Bank, had been made to assist such households in financing interior wiring
installations (para. 29 (b) above and Loan Agreement, Schedule I).
36.       In order to ensure commissioning of the first generating unit on
schedule in January 1980, it was necessary to begin work early on design,
specifications and preparation of tender documents. Also, the management
support team was required to replace the expatriate staff hired under the
Third Power Project who have completed their terms. Retroactive financing
totalling about US$600,000 is, therefore, recommended to cover: (a) the cost



- 13 -
of engineering services provided by Motor Columbus from January 1977
(US$500,000); and (b) the cost of management services from June 1978
(US$100,000).
The Borrower
37.       According to the legislative Act that created it, LEC is vested
with the responsibility for the generation, transmission, and distribution
of electric power in Liberia. The formulation of policies and direction
of management of LEC is vested in a Board of Directors whose Chairman is
the Minister of Finance. The operational responsibilities for implementing
the policies and programs of LEC are entrusted to a Managing Director appoint-
ed by the President of Liberia.
38.       Because of management weaknesses in LEC there has been a tendency
for Government and LEC's Board to become involved in the Corporation's day-
to-day operational activiities. This situation should improve as a result of
the management support being provided under the project (see para. 39). Also,
during negotiations Goverinment confirmed that the law establishing LEC provides
for its autonomy and vests upon the Managing Director the overall operational
responsibilities for implementing the programs and policies of the Corporation
along with the related management responsibilities.
39.       LEC has experienced a shortage of qualified and experienced manage-
ment staff. A management assistance team of eight expatriates was recruited
under the Third Power Loan. The team members were recruited individually, and
experience showed that they failed to work effectively as a team. There was
also a failure to define clearly areas of responsibility between the local
Managing Director and the expatriate General Manager which led to conflicts.
All members of the expatriate team have now departed and satisfactory arrange-
ments have been made to replace them by a team provided by a well qualified
foreign public utility. LEC has negotiated a management consultancy agreement,
acceptable to the Bank, with Tata Consulting Engineers of India to supply the
necessary support.
40.       Training was one of the major objectives of the third power project
but the expatriate managers, under pressure of day-to-day work, were not
successful in training L:Lberian staff. The proposed project provides for
*          a comprehensive training program for LEC staff at all levels.  This program
would reinforce and make more systematic the schemes that are currently
being undertaken by LEC on an ad hoc basis. The management team would provide
training adviser who wouLd assist LEC in the preparation and execution of a
suitable training program. The program would: (a) train senior Liberian
staff who are expected to take over full departmental responsibilities within
about one year of loan signing; (b) provide for training of foremen and super-
visors at the Monrovia Vocational and Technical Training Centre, which is
being financed under the Second Education Project; (c) provide skilled
technical training designed to meet LEC's specific needs using the school
facilities (e.g. workshops) to be financed under the project; and (d) provide
required courses for administrative, accounting and financial staff.



- 14 -
41.       LZC has a staff of about 800, i.e. one employee for about 19 con-
sumers, which is high. There is clear over staffing at non-professional
levels, and, therefore, LEC has agreed that the number of non-professional
staff will not be increased during project implementation and that such staff
will be trained for productive purposes (Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
Branch Stations
42.       As noted in paragraph 23 above, the eight small branch stations
which LEC has been operating on behalf of the Government, have been experi-
encing managerial, technical and financial difficulties, e.g. equipment
breakdowns, high system losses, high production costs and excessive trans-
port charges for fuel. In order to tackle these problems Government and
LEC have agreed to the continued separation of branch station finances, pre-
financing of all capital and operating losses by Government, recruitment of
qualified branch managers, and the maintenance of a branch station depart-
ment in LEC headquarters to more closely supervise the branch operations
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.05; Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02).
LEC's Finances
43.       The financial position of LEC has been weak, energy losses are high,
collection of accounts receivable is poor, the rate of return has been low
and the liquidity problem has been serious. Energy losses are high at about
30 percent of gross generation. About one-third of the loss, currently esti-
mated at about US$2 million a year, is energy consumed through illegal con-
nections and errors in meter readings. A program of block mapping (i.e. a
systematic check of customer connections against records) was introduced in
1976 under the Third Power Project to help clear fraudulent consumption and
reduce energy losses. This program is now proving to be effective and would
be supported by the provision of vehicles and equipment under the proposed
project. LEC and Government will make intensified efforts to prosecute
persons suspected of illegal connections and Government is also reviewing the
adequacy of existing legislation to protect LEC against fraud.
44.       Collection of accounts receivable has not been satisfactory.
Receivables, net of provision for bad debts, have increased from US$3.8
million (or 14 weeks of electricity billings) in 1974 to US$6 million (or
20 weeks of billings) in 1976. Private consumers, particularly small com-
mercial and domestic consumers, are responsible for about 78 percent of the
receivables. Government and public corporations are responsible for the
balance. LEC is already pursuing a more vigorous disconnection policy
for persons whose accounts are overdue; this should improve the accounts
receivable position. As regards overdue Government accounts, it has been
agreed with the Government that the accounts will be settled quarterly (i) by
cash or by offsetting against its bills to LEC any debt service payment due
from LEC to Government and (ii) by separate prepayment of capital and oper-
ating expenses of branch stations which LEC operates for Government (Guarantee
Agreement, Sections 3.02 and 3.04).



- 15 -
45.       Improvements in operating efficiency (e.g., energy loss, accounts
receivable by different categories, status of block mapping) and controls
on operating expenses (number of staff, transmission and distribution costs,
other generating expenses, administration, inventories) would be monitored
by a monthly report which LEC will submit to the Bank on a regular basis.
46.       In addition to the foregoing measures, the following steps have
been taken to strengthen LEC's cash position: (a) Government has recently
provided LEC with a loan of US$2.8 million repayable in 20 years, including
5 years of grace, at 2 percent interest per annum; (b) Government has author-
ized the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause granted to LEC in May 1977
in order to protect LEC against the adverse effects of increases in the price
and quantity of fuel (under the fuel adjustment clause, LEC would be allowed
to recover from its customers any additional costs resulting from (i) price
increase per gallon of fuel consumed and (ii) increase in the amount of fuel
required for the generation of additional thermal power necessitated by a
reduction in the production of hydro power because of water shortage in an
unusually dry season); and (c) Government has authorized implementation of a
23 percent tariff on non-m:Lning customers increase effective March 1, 1978,
resulting in a 20 percent Lncrease in average revenue per kWh.
47.       LEC achieved rates of return on historically valued assets of 5.1
percent in 1974, 6.6 percent in 1975, 6.9 percent in 1976 and an estimated
1.9 percent in 1977. Although LEC increased tariffs sharply in 1974 from
40 to 60 percent this was followed by a fall in energy sales and increased
operating costs due to reduced hydro-generation, increasing fuel prices and
general inflation. With the financial measures described above, LEC's rate
of return on historically valued assets would reach 8.2 percent in 1978, as
compared with a 10 percent return on assets, to be revalued from time to time,
provided for under the existing loan agreements. It is estimated that the
return would range between 11 and 13 percent per annum on historically valued
assets in each of the years thereafter through 1982.  These rates of return
might work out at an average of 6 percent when calculated on revalued assets,
which would be low. Therefore it has been agreed that, on completion of
revaluation of its assets in 1978, LEC should earn an annual rate of return
of not less than 8 percent on revalued assets, starting in calendar year 1979
(Loan Agreement, Section 5.06 (b) (ii)). This is likely to require future
increases in tariffs depending on LEC's success in improving its operating
efficiency.
Project Benefits and Risks
48.       LEC's Monrovia system load growth is expected to average about
7 percent per annum over t!he forecast period of 1976 to 1985, reaching a
peak demand of about 112 MW in 1985. Failure to meet this demand could
seriously inhibit industrial and commercial development in the country.
At present, there is no surplus of firm capacity in the Monrovia System;
both firm capacity and present peak demand stand at 65 MW. The project is,
therefore, urgently needed to help meet the projected increase in demand. The
project would also assist in strengthening the management, financial viabil-
ity and staffing of LEC.



- 16 -
49.       The project includes provision of electric power service to about
5,000 low-income families who have not had access to electricity in the
past. The study of a possible transmission line from Mt. Coffee plant to
the Gbarnga rural area is a prerequisite for extension of electricity supply
in the rural areas.
50.       The approach proposed under the project represents the least cost
alternative in meeting the projected demand. The proposed low-speed gener-
ating units are, given the circumstances of Liberia, the most suitable thermal
units, since it is important to have equipment which is easy to operate and
assures reliable and continuous service. The low-speed units have a long
life (40 years) and are easy to maintain and, therefore, do not require highly
skilled experts for maintenance.
51.       The economic rate of return on incremental investment is calculated
at 17 percent. It must be noted, however, that the true economic rate of
return should be higher since the rates which were taken as proxy for benefits
underestimate the full benefits to consumers, particularly those newly acced-
ing to service.
52.       The risks involved in the implementation of the physical aspects of
the project are not greater than normal for projects of this type; all phases
of the work would be supervised by consultants acceptable to the Bank.
However, as in the case of the previous projects, the non-physical aspects of
the project (e.g. management, training, and financial viability) can be
affected by such factors as difficulties related to staffing, management, and
tariff adjustments. Appropriate measures, as indicated above, were agreed
with Government and LEC during negotiations which should minimize the risks.
It must be recognized, however, that despite efforts to anticipate possible
problems and devise measures to control them, the success of the project will
depend to a large extent on the ability of LEC and Government to make and
carry through difficult decisions.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Liberia Electricity
Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Liberia and
the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
54.       In addition to the features of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
which are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III, the
following features are of particular interest: (a) additional conditions of
effectiveness include signing of the loan agreements with the co-financing
agencies; (b) a condition of disbursement of the loan for expenditures for
connection of low income households would be subject to satisfactory arrange-
ments having been made by Government to provide financing for interior wiring.



- 17 -
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that: the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 305-LBR        First Education Prolect:  US$7.2 Million Credit of
May 17, 1972: Effective Date: December 18, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
After initial delays in awarding civil works contracts, project
implementation has progressed satisfactorily, and most project facilities were
in operation by the start of the school year in March 1978. All technical
assistance posts have been filled and the fellowship component has been fullly
implemented. The education, manpower, and university planning components have
been completed satisfactorily.  The project Closing Date has been extended
to December 31, 1979 to allow for full disbursement of technical assistance
funds and retention period for construction. There will be a small cost
overrun that will be met by Government. Project management has been good.
Loan No. 1266T-LBR        Second Education Project:  US$4.0 Million Third
Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effective Date:
July 8, 1976: Closing Date: October 31, 1980
Project implementation is about 15 months behind schedule due to
shortages of construction materials and unusually long rainy season but the
pace of implementation is now increasing. Most of project's technical assist-
ance personnel are in post and candidates for fellowships have been nominated.
Equipment lists are being prepared and furniture and vehicles are being pur-
chased. Construction of 40 of the 100 community school units is underway and
26 units were ready for the start of the school year in March 1978. Extension
of the Zorzor Rural Teacher Training Institute should be completed about five
month's behind schedule in June 1978. The project is expected to be completed
about a year after the original completion date but within appraisal cost
estimates. Project management is good.
Loan No. 1417-LBR         Third Education Project:  US$6.3 Million Loan of
May 26, 1977; Effective Date: July 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily about six months
behind schedule. The Division of Educational Facilities has been established
and is carrying out design work on project and non-project schools. Bidding
for civil works at the VTC, AITB, and science and technology centers is sched-
uled for May and June 1978, about six months behind appraisal forecasts.
The fellowship program is behind schedule but steps are being taken to place
candidates as soon as possible; the technical assistance program is on sche-
dule. The technical assistance and fellowship program for the VTC and AITB
is being revised to take account of changed circumstances since appraisal
concerning the availabiliLty of technical teachers. Project management has
been good.

Credit No. 306-LBR        Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance
Project: US$1.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Implementation of the project suffered during the early stages
due to financial, administrative and managerial problems but the situation
gradually improved and all project objectives, except for the Pilot Rubber
Scheme, were achieved. The replanted acreage under the Pilot Rubber Scheme
is about 35 percent below appraisal estimates but the Scheme will be incor-
porated into the Rubber Development Project. The rice research program has
made good progress and will be continued under the Bong County Agricultural
Development Project.
Credit No. 577-LBR        Agricultural Development (Lofa) Project:  US$6
million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is in its second year of implementation (the Credit
became effective in May 1976, but key technical and managerial staff did not
reach full strength until September-October 1976) and progress to date has
been satisfactory. During the first cropping season, 75 ha of swamp rice,
76 ha of upland rice, 110 ha of coffee and 35 ha of cocoa were developed.
Project proposals for feeder road improvement, training of extension staff and
farmers, input and credit supply, development of rural banking services and
schistosomiasis surveillance are being implemented satisfactorily. Disburse-
ment of IDA credit is behind schedule primarily because of late start of the
project but expected to accelerate as project activities gather momentum.
Government of Liberia has kept the project adequately funded and has given the
required support. There has been a positive response from the project farmers.
Credit No. 700-LBR        Agricultural Development (Bong) Project:  US$7
million Credit of December 29, 1977; Effective Date:
March 15, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Signing of the credit was delayed by several months due to staffing
problems. Most of key project positions have now been filled and the project
implementation has begun. The recruitment of key project staff was financed
under the project preparation facility. Other project start-up activities
(e.g. construction of office buildings and staff houses) are underway.
Loan No. 1544-LBR         Rubber Development Project:  US$7 million Loan and
Credit No. 786-LBR        US$6 million Credit, both of April 21, 1978:  Not
Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Project start up activities (e.g. staff training, nursery prepara-
tion, acquisition of land, building plan) financed by the Government are
making good progress and the project implementation is expected to commence

on schedule. The project manager is in post and the financial controller has
been appointed. The project: is expected to become effective towards the end
of July 1978.
Loan No. 907-LBR          Second Highway Project:  US$3.0 Million Loan of
June 13, 1973; Effective Date: December 28, 1973;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1978;
Credit No. 395-LBR        US!$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective
Date: December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30,
1978
The design and reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass has been com-
pleted with a small cost overrun. The feasibility studies of the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia are now completed; on two of the
roads which are important links in the main highway network, reconstruction
has been demonstrated as amply justified and was included in the Fourth
Highway Project. Technical assistance in the Government's four-year main-
tenance program is already showing benefits in improved running surfaces on
earth and gravel roads and plans are now being made to consolidate the gains
and develop them still further by closer attention to the organization and
planning of road maintenance. A study to determine how best to improve the
efficiency of the local civil engineering construction industry has been
completed.
Loan No. 1156-LBR         Third Highway Project:  US$27.5 Million Loan of
August 28, 1975; Effective Date: October 14, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road (5.4
mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.) has started and is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily although initially somewhat hampered by bad weather
and difficulties in the supply of materials. The feasibility studies about
85 miles of main roads and an urban transport study in Monrovia are making
good progress. A feeder road construction unit became operational in January
1977 and is operating successfully in connection with the Lofa County Agricul-
tural Development Project (577-LBR). Technical assistance in building up
Planning and Programming Division of the Ministry of Public Works is proving
fairly effective. A US$13.8 million loan for the Fourth Highway Project was
approved on May 18, 1978 and is expected to be signed shortly. The Project
includes reconstruction and improvement of the Paynesville-Totota and
Paynesville-Robertsfield road, technical assistance for road maintenance and
pre-investment studies.

Loan No. 1055-LBR  -      Second Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$4 Million Loan of December 3. 1974; Effective Date:
January 3, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR         Third Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective Date:
December 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976 surpassed the
projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements were similarly
above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular, had been faster
than projected. The loan is fully committed and 80 percent disbursed as of
October 31, 1977. The Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976, together with
loans from the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are
expected to cover LBDI's foreign resource gap for the period 1977 and 1979.
Loan No. 1150-LBR         Third Power Project:  US$1.8 Million Loan of
August 1, 1975; Effective Date: October 20, 1975;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a long-
range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for strength-
ening the management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and training
its staff. LEC's management continues to need external support and the train-
ing program needs to be expanded to include practical training for middle-level
staff. The financial performance of the utility has deteriorated and remedial
measures are being taken to improve LEC's financial viability, e.g. tariff
increases, improved financial controls, in connection with the proposed fourth
power project. LEC has recently engaged a foreign electric power utility to
provide a management support team to replace expatriates who have left at the
expiry of their contracts.
