The\n            project would consist of: expansion of generating facilities\n            by about 26 MW; power distribution to urban poor; vehicles\n            and equipment; rural transmission and frequency conversion\n            studies; and technical assistance for management and\n            training. Benefits would comprise: (a) satisfaction of power\n            demand in the LEC system until 1985 and its positive impact\n            on economic, industrial and commercial activities; (b)\n            improvement of LEC's management, staffing and finances;\n            and (c) supply of electric power to about 5,000 low-income\n            families in the Monrovia area. The risks involved in the\n            physical implementation of the project are not greater than\n            normal for projects of this type. However, there may be\n            risks with respect to the implementation of the non-physical\n            aspects of the project (e.g., management, training and\n            financial viability of LEC), although measures have been\n            included in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements to minimize them."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
