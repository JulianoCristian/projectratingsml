Dear  Sirs: 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
- Tanzania:  Power VI Project (Cr. 2489-TA)
 
 
 
The Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) has received a Request for Inspection  (the “Request”) on May 
16, 1995 from Reginald John Nolan, Capt. George Kotsovillis, Emmanuel Marghakis, Mrs. Vumilia 
Mmari, Annette Furtado, and John Nkereduka residents of Tanzania (the “Requesters”) who claim that 
their rights/interests have been adversely affected by acts and omissions of the International Development 
Association (“IDA”) and on June 14, 1995, a supplement to the Request, signed by one of the Requesters, 
providing clarifications to the Request.  The Requesters claim that they have been directly and adversely 
affected by the implementation and amendment of the above-referenced project.  The Requesters claim to 
be affected by alleged violations of  provisions of IDA policies and procedures set forth
 inter alia, 
in the 
following: 
 
• 
Article V Section 1(c), IDA Articles of Agreement 
• 
Article V Section 1(d), IDA Articles of Agreement 
• 
Article V Section 1(g), IDA Articles of Agreement 
• 
OMS NO. 2.36: 
Environmental Aspects of Bank Work 
 
• 
Operational Directive 4.01:  
Environmental Assessment  
 
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the “Operating 
Procedures”), I am notifying  you that I have on June 16, 1995, which is also the date of the dispatch of this 
notice, registered in the Inspection Panel Register, the Request, with the clarifications contained in the  
supplement to the Request referred to above.  The Panel has not accepted the designation of Mr. Reginald 
John Nolan as representative of the Requesters, because no appropriate written evidence of representation 
has been submitted to the Panel. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of IDA Resolution No. 93-6 and paragraph 18(d) of the 
Operating Procedures, Management of IDA is hereby notified that it must provide the Panel no later than 
July 18, 1995 with written evidence that it has complied, or intends to comply with the relevant policies 
and procedures in the implementation and amendment of the above-referenced project.  The essential 
criteria for the response to the Request are set out in paragraph 33 of the Operating Procedures. 
 
The Request has been assigned  IPN Request Number RQ95/2. 
 
  
Sincerely 
yours, 
 
 
 Ernst-Günther 
Bröder
