 11.     The Panel does not review decisions of
the Executive Directors. The Panel did review
Management's actions in providing information
to the Executive Directors. Based on the above
findings the Panel is satisfied that Management
has followed the requirements of Section 1
paragraphs (a), (d)?and        of Article V of
IDA`SArticles of Agreement.

  Alleged Violations of Operational Manual
Statement No. 2.3'6,Environmental Aspects of
      Bank Work, paragraph 9(c) and (h)
 ("OMS') and Operational Directive 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment, paragraphs 2,14-
                     122 ("OD")

12.      Alleged violations of the policies set
forth in the OMS and ODs clearly fall within the
Panel's mandate.

13.      Based on the results of the Inspector's
field visit, the Panel is satisfied that the
Requesters, who reside in Dar es Salaam, could
be affected by any possible adverse
environmental impact of the EPP. However, the
Panel finds that the Requesters failed to
demonstrate that their interests are likely to be
directly and adversely affected in a material way
as a result of any alleged serious violations by
IDA of the OMS or OD with respect to the
preparation and appraisal of the EPP.

14.      In relation i:o allegations concerning the
environmental impact the Panel therefore finds
