The Request, filed by a group\n            from a Tanzanian company, Tannol Holdings, LTC., claimed\n            that restructuring of the loan for the Power VI Project was\n            not necessary as private funding was available and was not\n            considered by the Management.  The Requesters state that the\n            International Development Association (IDA) did not follow\n            policies and procedures and improperly influenced the\n            Tanzanian Government's decision in regards to funding\n            for the project. The Requesters also claim that the\n            Bank's environmental policies were violated in\n            preparation for the project. After reviewing the Request,\n            the Panel is satisfied that Management has followed the\n            required policies and procedures in regards to environmental\n            assessment. The Panel concluded that an investigation into\n            the violations of the IDA policies is not recommended."}, "docdt": "1995-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
