The lessons\n            learned indicate that given two generation options with\n            nearly equal economic benefits, the operating experience of\n            the implementing agency should be given considerable weight\n            relative to other factors in deciding on the most viable\n            generation option. Prepayment metering can be an effective\n            technical solution to power company billing and collection\n            problems but configuration in line with the tariff structure\n            and loopholes for fraud should be given priority attention\n            in the design of the system. The form of institutional\n            development assistance in a power project should depend on\n            the individual country situation as well as a realistic\n            assessment of what can be achieved during the project's\n            implementation period. In general, standard investment loans\n            are not appropriate lending vehicles to pursue privatization\n            objectives, especially the construction of a large\n            hydropower plant. All hydropower projects with dams, by\n            their very nature, are bound to have a deleterious impact on\n            the environment in some way and assessments should reflect a\n            consensus of Bank and Borrower policies on the amount of\n            damage that is acceptable to meet human needs for electric\n            power. The original Environmental Assessment, undertaken in\n            1991 prior to appraisal, was approved by regional management\n            and subsequently by the Bank's board. In retrospect,\n            the supervision of the Power VI project suffered from the\n            lack of a Bank environmental specialist as a permanent\n            member of the supervision team. The failure to define water\n            rights at an earlier stage of project construction, ideally\n            before construction began, left unresolved the differing\n            water requirements of energy generation for the dam and\n            conservation requirements in the downstream area of the\n            Kihansi gorge. Despite the original assessment of minimal\n            environmental impact, Power VI also took note of a lesson\n            learned at appraisal that continued ecological monitoring\n            during project implementation was important."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
