The IDA financed an Emergency Power\n            Project (EEP) in Tanzania and, according to the Requesters,\n            intervened improperly and have caused great financial loss\n            and injury to the Requesters. Since 1992 a consortium of two\n            Canadian companies has been considering a gas field and\n            pipeline project known as the Songo Songo Project. Under the\n            terms of this project, one of the consortium members, Ocelot\n            Energy and Transcanada Pipelines (OTC) would be given 50\n            percent interest in the gas field that is being developed\n            with IDA money. The project was projected to be funded by\n            private funds, but in early 1995 a letter from the Bank to\n            the Tanzania Ministry of Water, Energy and Materials stated\n            that all World Bank aid would be cut off unless the Canadian\n            OTC project with IDA funding was selected. Despite repeated\n            reassurance from the Bank that the matter would be justified\n            or countermanded, the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and Energy\n            announced that the OTC project had been selected. The\n            Requesters claim the IDA failed to follow operational\n            policies and providing funding for a government-owned power\n            plant when a private sector project could have been\n            constructed from private sources. The Requesters also cite\n            the failure to follow environmental assessments used by the\n            Bank because the OTC project will be constructed on an\n            unsound site with no previous environmental assessments and\n            at a cost to public health and safety."}, "docdt": "1995-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
