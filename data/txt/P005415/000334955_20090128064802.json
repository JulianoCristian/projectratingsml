The project was to\n            also help improve project selection and preparation in the\n            public sector. The loan beneficiaries were: (i) the office\n            for vocational training and employment promotion (OFPPT) for\n            the construction and equipment of 22 new Vocational Training\n            Centers (VTC) as well as for other studies related to\n            -training of instructors and curricula development: (ii) the\n            vocational and staff training administration (AFPFC) for the\n            studies dealing with coordination and financing of\n            vocational training and development of future training\n            activities; and (iii) the Ministry of planning for a\n            component aiming at improving project selection and\n            preparation in the public sector. The main project objective\n            of expansion of the vocational training capacity was met.\n            The enrollment capacity increased by 6,630 instead of 4,775\n            planned, and the additional number of graduates per year to\n            3,000 instead of 2,200. However, the project's impact\n            has not been as positive as expected. The vocational\n            training graduates are currently experiencing serious\n            difficulties in finding employment due to a substantial\n            mismatch between their number and the economy's ability\n            to absorb them, as well as between the diplomas they hold\n            and the skills that enterprises need. This result is due to\n            a lack of relevance of training as well as to a slower\n            employment creation than anticipated in the project."}, "docdt": "1993-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
