implementing\n            their own subprojects; 3) providing a safety net for the\n            rural poor during a period of strong fiscal adjustment when\n            the Government's ability to finance essential\n            investments and services is constrained; and 4) leveraging\n            revenue mobilization at the community and municipal levels.\n            The project will ensure that funds are targeted and\n            reliability transferred to the poorest communities, and\n            would promote further decentralization of decision making to\n            State, municipal and local levels. The project comprises the\n            following three components: community subprojects including\n            infrastructure, social and small-scale productive industrial\n            projects; institutional development providing all\n            implementing communities with technical assistance and\n            training for project implementation; and administration,\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
