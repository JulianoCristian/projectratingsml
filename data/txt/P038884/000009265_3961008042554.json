      Alleviation Project is to assist the State in alleviating\n            rural poverty and its consequences by: 1) providing basic\n            social and economic infrastructure, and employment and\n            income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; 2)\n            supporting rural communities in planning and implementing\n            their own subprojects; 3) providing safety net for the rural\n            poor during a period of strong fiscal adjustment when the\n            Government's ability to finance essential investments\n            and services is constrained; and 4) leveraging revenue\n            mobilization at the community and municipal levels. The\n            project will ensure that funds are targeted and reliably\n            transferred to the poorest communities, will promote further\n            decentralization of decision making to State, municipal and\n            local levels. The project comprises three main components:\n            community subprojects, consisting of infrastructure, social\n            and productive or small-scale industrial projects;\n            institutional development providing technical assistance and\n            training in implementing new project schemes; and\n            administration, monitoring, and evaluation.

The objective of\n            the Sergipe Rural Poverty Alleviation project is to assist\n            the State in alleviating rural poverty and its consequences\n            by: 1) providing basic infrastructure and employment and\n            income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; 2)\n            supporting rural community groups in planning and\n            implementing their own subprojects; 3) providing a safety\n            net for the rural poor during a period of strong fiscal\n            adjustment when the Government's ability to finance\n            essential investments and services is constrained; and 4)\n            leveraging revenue mobilization at the community and\n            municipal levels.
