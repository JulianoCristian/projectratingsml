medium-scale irrigation subsector, which has considerable\n            potential for increasing agricultural diversification,\n            yields and production. The project will finance the\n            rehabilitation of three traditional irrigation perimeters\n            covering some 12,500 ha and the development of two new\n            perimeters with a total irrigated surface of about 5,300 ha.\n            The project will also support complementary infrastructure\n            such as road construction, power supply and on-farm\n            development. The investments will be complemented by the\n            introduction of a legal framework ensuring that beneficiary\n            farmers assume responsibility for operation and maintenance\n            of irrigation networks as well as for reimbursing the\n            Government for investment costs to a degree commensurate\n            with their earning capacity. The project will also provide\n            an opportunity for the regional offices of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture to build up experience in planning, implementing\n            and monitoring the development of the subsector."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
