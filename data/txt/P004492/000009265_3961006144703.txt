MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Performance Audit Report on Philippines
Vocational Training Project (Loan 2200-PH)
Attached is the Performance Audit Report on Philippines - Vocational
Training Project (Loan 2200-PH) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department. It
is in broad agreement with the conclusions of the PCR for this project.
The project sought to broaden and strengthen vocational training in the
Philippines by support for the responsible agency, the National Manpower and Youth
Council (NMYC).
Despite profound economic and political changes, the project was
implemented successfully, albeit with a three years' delay and some scaling down of project
size. But since the NMYC system has attained the overall appraisal benchmark for in-
house training, and surpassed the training target for contract training, the project outcome
is satisfactory. With the exception of one covenant (preparation of annual training plans)
for which compliance lapsed in the later years of implementation, the covenants were fully
complied with.
Institutional development has been considerable, and project sustainability
appears likely, given the high priority Government attaches to vocational training. The
Bank is supporting these efforts through a follow-on project (Credit 2392-PH). Apart
from a further strengthening of the NMYC system and of industry-based training,
continued efforts to streamline the multitude of training programs existing in the country
would offer the prospect of significant gains in efficiency.

PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 2200-PH)
PREFACE
This is a Performance Audit Report (PAR) on the Vocational Training Project in
the Philippines. This project was supported by a Bank Loan of US$24 million l which was
approved on September 21, 1982. An amount of US$8 million was cancelled at the request of
the Government in October 1987. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1990, three years after
the date planned at appraisal. The last disbursement took place on July 2, 1991, at which time an
undisbursed balance of US$1.5 million was cancelled.
The PAR is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) (No. 11163) dated
September 18, 1992, the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3750b-PH) dated August 26, 1982, the Loan
Agreement dated October 28, 1982, project files, and government documents including a
Completion Report prepared by the implementing agency, the National Manpower and Youth
Council (NMYC). Additional information was obtained through discussions with Bank staff and
government officials involved in the project, the latter having been contacted during a visit to the
Philippines in November/December 1992 which also included visits to a number of vocational
training centers and employers and their organizations.
OED gratefully acknowledges the assistance of government officials, private sector
representatives and Bank staff who freely gave of their time. The PAR, in broad agreement with
the findings of the PCR, is supported by more recent data and field observations.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PAR were sent to the
Borrower on March 9, 1994. No comments have been received from the Borrower.
1 All refcrences to the Bank's loan amount in the text and tables of this report are in USS equivalent.

PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 2200-PH)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.1         In the 1970s the Philippines manufacturing sector was characterized by two
dichotomies; the first was employment/output related: the "unorganized" sector (defined as
comprising establishments having fewer than ten employees) accounted for about 65 percent of
sectoral employment but for only 5 percent of its output.
1.2         The second distinction was geographic: about two thirds each of national
manufacturing output and employment were concentrated in the Greater Manila area. Only a
few heavily resource-based industries such as food processing and wood products showed a wider
geographic dispersion. This in turn meant a strong demographic pull by the capital on the rest of
the country, with its attendant problems of a strained infrastructure in the former and a heavy
exodus of productive people in the latter.
1.3         On the whole, manufacturing employment had increased only moderately in the
second half of the 1970s, by about 50,000 jobs or 3.1 percent per year--which did not even
amount to one tenth of the simultaneous rise in the labor force.
1.4         The Government's Five-Year Development Plan for the period 1978-82 sought to
give an impetus to industrial development, with emphasis on small- and medium-scale enterprises.
Complementary aims of the Government's industrial development policy were to sustain the rapid
growth of manufacturing exports, increased processing (instead of straightforward export) of
domestic raw materials, and a less lop-sided regional distribution of industrial activities. The
Government hoped to boost employment creation in the manufacturing sector to roughly twice its
previous level (i.e., 100,000 new jobs per year).
1.5         However, when the Government started to implement this decentralized industrial
development policy, it found itself confronted with a general lack (as well as an uneven regional
distribution) of skilled manpower, in addition to remoteness from markets, inadequate infra-
structure, and a host of other difficulties. The response was to plan for a series of industrial
estates to serve as regional growth poles and, in the field of manpower development, to step up
vocational training.
1.6         An expansion of vocational training also recommended itself for another reason:
since about 1975 the Philippines had become increasingly an exporter of skilled manpower, partic-
ularly to the Middle East. By 1980, the number of Philippine workers abroad exceeded 350,000,
of whom three quarters were professional and technical specialists, craftsmen, and production
process workers. Expanding vocational training would thus not only contribute directly to this



2
skill export, but also help replace workers that had left jobs in the Philippines for employment
abroad (given that prospective foreign employers preferred to recruit people with previous work
experience). The contribution of these temporary emigrants to the national economy, especially
in terms of foreign exchange earnings, was considerable: in 1980, almost US$700 million in
remittances flowed back to the Philippines.
1.7          While it was difficult to predict this skill export, the Government expected the
exodus of manpower to stabilize at just under 150,000 per year by the middle of the 1980s. A
skill drain of this size could not be expected to be made good by a slow and haphazard process of
on-the-job training. A concerted effort to train skilled manpower was called for.
1.8          While vocational training in the widest sense was carried out by a large number of
public and private entities, industrial skill training was essentially undertaken by two agencies:
one was the Ministry of Education and Culture, through its formal technical education at second-
ary and post-secondary levels, which was time-consuming and had a strong theoretical leaning.
1.9          The other institution was the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC), a
government agency then operating within the President's Office. It had an overall mandate for
manpower planning and development and more specifically, to establish and operate vocational
training institutions and to oversee the development of manpower and out-of-school youth. To
carry out these functions, it maintained, in 1980, 14 Regional Manpower Development Offices
and 10 Regional Manpower Training Centers (RMTCs) which offered courses varying in length
from several weeks to nine months and which had reached an annual output of roughly 110,000
trainees, one third of whom specialized in industrial skills.
1.10         While NMYC had so far performed creditably in providing vocational training, the
increasing demands to be put on it threatened to give rise to serious bottlenecks. Among its
perceived institutional weaknesses were understaffing, insufficient data handling capacity, and lack
of experience in manpower planning and development. Vocational training itself was hampered
by the insufficient size and uneven coverage of the network of Vocational Training Centers, the
lack of modern equipment and both quantitative and qualitative shortcomings in the instructors
corps.
1.11         The Bank, which had assisted in the creation of the 10 above-mentioned
(para. 1.09) RMTCs through a previous education project (Cr. 349-PH), considered vocational
system as a suitable field for investment, the more so since this would be a logical complement of
its first Structural Adjustment Loan of 1980, Ln. 1903-PH), which supported the Government's
industrial and trade policies.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT
2.1          The resulting project, the Vocational Training Project of 1982, pursued a hierarchy
of objectives. In the broadest sense, it was seen as "an integral component in support of the
Government's industrial development program ... and would address the major policy and manage-
ment issues affecting industrial training" (SAR, para. 3.01). In doing so, "(i)ts main thrust would
be to broaden and strengthen the infrastructure of national industrial training" (ibid.). This meant



3
more specifically, to "(a) strengthen the NMYC management system, enabling it to improve both
manpower planning and the organization of administration of training ...... at the national level;
(b) establish a system of contracting for sector-specific training to serve the needs of employed
workers in seven priority subsectors;' and (c) expand the skill testing and certification system"
(ibid.).
2.2              The project contained the following components (SAR, para. 3.02):
Management of Industrial Training
(a)     Reorganization/Strengthening of NMYC Secretariat;
(b)     Improvement of NMYC manpower planning and evaluation capabilities;
(c)     Creation of a Management Information System  and an Equipment Maintenance
Service.
Strengthening Industrial Training
(a)     A sector-specific industrial training scheme for a total of 76,000 workers;
(b)     Expansion of training facilities.2
Trade Testing and Certification
(a)     Further development of training standards and of a related data bank;
(b)     Establishment of trade testing facilities.
2.3              It was expected that the expanded training system would have slightly under 3,000
training places and be able to instruct in double shift operation about 20,000 trainees per year
(SAR, para. 3.21).
2.4              Total project cost was estimated at US$40.3 million, with the Loan of US$24.4
million covering 60 percent of total cost including the entire foreign exchange component. The
project was expected to be completed over a period of 4 years and 3 months, with Loan closing
scheduled for December 1987.
Metals and engineering; shoes and leather goods; wood products; construction; automotive trades; garments; and hotel and
restaurant trades (SAR, para. 3.05).
2    This component was not mentioned at all in the list of objectives (see para. 2.1 items (a), (b), (c) above) and was treated rather
lightly (2 pages out 11 in the project description), although in terms of foreign exchange requirements and, hence, of Loan
funds, it accounted for over half of the total (and probably motivated the Government more than the various administrative and
management components to seek the Loan). This asymmetrical treatment of project components and activities can be observed
in a number of education projects undertaken in the Region during this period (e.g., Ln 1904-IND or La. 2030-PH). It appears
to have been a presentational device to impress upon readers the innovative nature of the lending operations.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.1          The Loan became effective in February 1983. From the very beginning, inad-
equate and delayed counterpart funds proved to be the most serious obstacle to project imple-
mentation. This eventuality had not been listed among the risks discussed in the SAR, whose
concerns focussed in employers' reluctance to perceive the benefits (and hence, assist in the
financing) of vocational training; the unfamiliarity (and thus, uncertain acceptance by industry) of
the contractual training scheme; the scarcity of competent implementation staff; and the lack of
NMYC experience in the innovative aspects of the project.
3.2          Disbursements, after an initial surge above appraisal expectations in 1984, fell
increasingly behind schedule until by the second half of 1987 they reached a low of 23 percent of
expected levels.
3.3          By that time, the 1986 Revolution had brought in a democratic Government; it was
faced with a severe economic and budgetary situation. As part of a general realignment of its
project portfolio, the Government agreed with the Bank on a restructuring of this project. This
involved a cancellation of Loan funds in the amount of US$8 million (to be followed at Loan
accounts closing in July 1991 by another cancellation of US$1.5 million), a one-year extension of
the Closing Date (with two more to come in late 1988 and 1989) and changes in the scope and
composition of the project.
3.4          The most important changes in physical project composition are summarized in

3.5               The project faced further adversity through a severe typhoon and an earthquake
which struck parts of Northern Luzon and which led to the cancellation of the RMTC at Baguio
(which had been planned under the project restructuring arrangements of 1987), and which was
replaced by the construction of a Regional Office. In the final stage of project implementation,
price increases in the wake of the Gulf War caused further delays in carrying out the last physical
investments (PCR, para. 5.7).
3.6               Total project cost came to US$23.1 million, 45 percent lower than the appraised
figure. The $14.9 million disbursed from Ln. 2200-PH covered 64.5 percent of total cost, slightly
above the 60 percent share envisaged at appraisal.
3.7               With the exception of one covenant, which was not met for several years (submis-
sion of annual training plans), all covenants were fully complied with.
IV. PROJECT OUTCOMES
4.1               The project, after its scaling back in 1987 and with several years delay, has reached
its most important training and institutional development targets.
4.2               Regional Manpower Training Centers. The 10 original RMTCs (of which one was
converted into a national center) and the four new centers established under the project are at
present training close to 20,000 young people a year (see Table 4.1). Together with a network of
10 Provincial Manpower Training Centers (PMTCs) which have come on stream since 1987, they
produced in 1991 close to 23,000 skilled workers.

4.3           The centers offer two main types of courses, a long (600 hours) basic course and
short (120 hours) upgrading and instructors' courses. The balance between the two categories of
training changes from one Region to another; the nationwide ratio between long and short
courses was about 1:1.6 (6,500 vs. 10,800).
4.4           Cost per trainee, adjusted for length of course, varied from about 12 700 to F2 2,900
averaging 1R 2,066 (or $82), the considerable regional differences being probably due to variations
in trainee composition by trade, class sizes, and local cost variations. The average cost per
trainee/hour of about 12 3.5 is low (Table 4.2).

4.5           NMYC also undertook monitoring of the trainees after course completion. In the
second semester of 1990, 45 percent of that year's RMTC trainees had found a job, 47 percent of
those not employed prior to training had found work, and of those who had found employment,
87 percent had found work related to their training. For PMTC trainees the relevant proportions



7
were somewhat lower (27, 23 and 83 percent, respectively), possible because of the location of the
PMTCs in somewhat smaller and more remote cities.3
4.6           Training Contract Scheme (sector specific training scheme). After a slow start,
these training courses expanded to an annual level of about 20,000 trainees. By 1988, the original
target of about 76,000 trainees (SAR, Table 3.1) had been exceeded and by 1990, over 126,000
workers had been trained.
4.7           These courses were important in that they pioneered a new approach in
Philippines manpower training, in which NMYC played a facilitating role, contracting a training
agent and agreeing to cover 70 percent of the cost of training, the rest being contributed by the
private sector (usually small or medium sized firms). The original list of seven industries
(para. 2.1, FNI) was later augmented by six more (utilities, land transport, coal mining, printing,
communications, and agro-industries).
4.8           Training courses comprised basic training (a total of 23,600 trainees in the period
1982-90); upgrading (nearly 47,000); supervisors' training (30,750); instructors' training (22,100);
and special technical courses (2,600).
4.9           The Garment Industry Training Program (GITP) was perhaps the most successful
of these contracted programs. Between 1988 and 1991, almost 12,000 unskilled young people
took part in so-called zero-skill courses which gave them through a 120-hour course sewing
machine skills sufficient for subsequent employment in garment factories.
4.10          Trade skill standards and skill testing. Among the other programs undertaken,
the development of trade skill standards and skill testing merit special mention. The SAR had
anticipated that the number of National Trade Skill Standards would be increased from 13 to 55.
Similarly, trade testing was to be expanded from 14,700 workers in 1982 to 30,000 in 1985 (SAR,
para. 3.25).
4.11          These targets were surpassed by large margins: the list of 42 additional skill
standards was increased to 200, and subsequently to 266. At the end of the decade, 200 standards
were already developed, nearly all of them in the four years 1986-89.
4.12          Trade testing was given to 27,000 workers in 1985, or 90 percent of the target.
After suffering a brief setback in 1986, it grew at a very fast pace since, reaching almost 60,000 in
1991. The certification rate grew from 42 percent in 1992 to 49 percent in 1991.4
3   Private sector employers outside Manila interviewed during the field visits appreciated the skills and knowledge of trainees but
emphasized the small size of local labor markets.

V. FINDINGS AND ISSUES
5.1           Overall results. The PAR is in broad agreement with the findings of the PCR;
more recent statistics confirm the trends becoming visible at project completion. Given the
difficult circumstances under which the project had to be implemented, the outcome has been
satisfactory. The development of a broad array of training programs catering to specific needs,
the expansion of occupational standards and of skill testing, to name only a few examples, point to
a significant amount of institution building.5 More important, the project initiated a move of
vocational training towards the place of work, i.e., as close to the enterprises as possible, which is
advocated by most vocational training experts as the most efficient and responsive arrangement.
5.2          This change in emphasis, together with the Government's continuing commitment
to vocational training, bodes well for the sustainability of the project's achievements. Putting the
country's vocational training efforts on a broader physical and financial basis will also facilitate
future expansion and diversification. The Bank's Second Vocational Training Project of 1991
aims at supporting this process.
5.3          Issues. While an increasing portion of vocational training will become the
responsibility of the enterprises, the RMTC/PMTC network will retain at least two important
functions (apart from serving as location for future ad hoc courses in response to new types of
needs). One is to provide a basis for vocational training in a given geographic area for industries
which are weak and fragmented and thus not in a position to organize their own training. The
second is to provide young people in regions with strong out-migration with marketable skills that
make them in principle more employable, prior to their departure from their homes.
5.4           With this continuing role for the RMTCs and PMTCs in mind, the appropriate
equipping of the centers deserves continued attention. In some of the centers visited, the OED
staff noticed very old and outmoded equipment (e.g., ancient manual typewriters or lathes that
were approaching the end of their useful life). A question to this effect drew the answer that
such a mixing in of old equipment would serve a useful purpose by simulating rather closely the
workplace condition in the small or medium-sized Philippine factory. While this argument may
have some merit, it becomes increasingly tenuous as older equipment breaks down more often
and the necessary spare parts become harder to find. The replacement and upgrading of
equipment in the RMTCs and PMTCs planned under the Second Vocational Training Project is
no doubt a desirable and necessary investment.
5.5          A more serious concern evolves from the very large number of vocational training
programs undertaken in the Philippines. A recent list comprises 261 different programs under-
taken by nine different government agencies.
In the light of these achievements, the criticism of the SAR for the Second Vocational Training Project directed toward the
NMYC (SAR, para. 22.3) appears somewhat harsh.

5.6          With the exception of the programs of the two last mentioned agencies, these
programs are nearly all directed at specific outside clienteles, with a good deal of program
overlap.6 In a number of trade groups, training was offered by three or more government agen-
cies, with widely varying unit cost.' This points to the existence of wide differences in quality or
cost-efficiency which would make a streamlining effort worthwhile. A continuation of the stock-
taking and analysis undertaken so far (see FN 6), and a tighter coordination of vocational training
efforts would promise substantial gains in efficiency.
5.7          However, when all is said and done, it must be realized (as the NMYC manage-
ment does) that no matter the degree of fine-tuning and responsiveness, no vocational training
system can create employment per se (with the obvious exception of its own staff), and that the
absorption of the labor force in general and out-of-school youth in particular into gainful
employment will ultimately depend on overall economic and fiscal policies, with education and
training as indispensable but ultimately subordinate instruments.
