integral\n            component of Bank assistance in support of the\n            Government's industrial development program. It would\n            support the regional diversification strategy, address the\n            needs of medium- and small-sale industries and broaden and\n            strengthen the infrastructure of the national industrial\n            training system. In particular, it would reorganize the\n            structure and procedures and expand the staff of the\n            National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) and establish a\n            system of contracting for sector specific training in seven\n            priority industrial and service subsectors, for 76,000\n            employees. This would include apprentice training, training\n            adult workers, and supervisor upgrading. Employers would\n            participate in the organization, financing and management of\n            training, and a strategy of on-the-job training would be\n            promoted. In addition, the trade testing and certification\n            system would be expanded on a national level."}, "docdt": "1982-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
