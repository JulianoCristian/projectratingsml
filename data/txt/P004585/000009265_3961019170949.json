(ICR) for the Industrial Restructuring Project in the\n            Philippines (IRP). Project objectives were to: (a) support\n            the revival and the strengthening of the industrial sector;\n            (b) support sound industrial investment in subsectors free\n            from major distortions resulting from inappropriate trade\n            and regulatory policies; (c) help make the cement, pulp and\n            paper, textiles, shipping and ship repairs subsectors more\n            competitive through reforms of subsector-specific policies,\n            training and technical assistance, and institutional\n            straightening; (d) strengthen the institutional framework\n            for environmental protection; and (e) strengthpn Development\n            Bank of the Philippines (DBP) capacity to play a more active\n            role in the development of the capital market and to act as\n            a wholesale bank channeling term funds to retail financial\n            institutions. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (b) the availability of\n            cofinancing funds does not imply that these funds will be\n            utilized, unless they are offered with attractive terms; (c)\n            a Government-owned Financial Institution (GFI) can be an\n            efficient and cost effective vehicle to bolster private\n            sector and human resource development; (d) a proactive and\n            farsighted financial institution such as DBP can succeed in\n            lending and institutional strenthening for environmental\n            protection; and (e) while it may be desirable for the\n            institutional development progress of a GFI to maintain a\n            tight time schedule, due allowance should be given to the\n            socio-political and external factors that can warrant\n            changes in government priorities and in a GFI's IDP."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
