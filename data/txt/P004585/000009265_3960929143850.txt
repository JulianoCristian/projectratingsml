MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a rroposed Bank loan
of US$175 million equivalent to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
is submitted for approval. The loan would help finance modernization,
expansion and new facilities of private sector medium and large enterprises in
the Philippines. The loan to DBP would be guaranteed by the Republic of the
Philippines. It would carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate and
would have a fixed amortization schedule of 20 years including a grace period
of 5 years. The proposed Project would help mobilize US$75 million equivalent
in export credits through the Export Credit Enhanced Leverage (EXCEL) program
and US$15.0 million from bilateral sources for financing technical assistance
and training programs for selected industrial subsectors.
2.       Background.  The Philippines has gone through a period of major
economic restructuring since 1986, as the Government made concerted efforts to
revive the economy and correct distortions. A substantial economic recovery
has taken place since 1987 based on a more efficient allocation of resources
than in the past inspite of the heavy burden of external debts. This economic
recovery has been largely led by the industrial sector which accounts for 33X
of GDP, 421 of total merchandise exports and 15% of total employment. The
industrial sector, which is predominantly private, has benefitted from
comprehensive structural reforms implemented by the Government, including a
major trade liberalization program and the reform of investment incentives.
The Philippine economy is now more open and transparent in its regulatory and
incentive structure than at any time since 1950.
3.       However, recent developments suggest that the substantial structural
adjustment efforts undertaken since 1986 have proved insufficient in improving
the country's relative competitiveness. GDP growth, which averaged 6.1%
during 1988 and 1989, is expected to slow down to about 3.5% in 1990. The
growth rate in investment is expected to decrease to about 7X of GDP in 1990
from the average of 161 achieved during the 1988-89 period. Export growth has
also slackened. This decline has occurred not because of inadequate commit-
ment of the Government to policy reforms, but because its competitors (notably
other ASEAN countries) have adjusted their economies and industries at more
rapid speed. For the economy to remain internationally competitive, the
Government will need to continue to reduce policy distortions in the
industrial sector. It will need to accelerate trade reforms by further
reducing effective protection and eliminating quantitative restrictions on
imports.
4.       The Government will also need to address certain trade and regulatory
policies which are subsector-specific and are adversely affecting the ability
of key industrial subsectors (cement, pulp and paper, textiles, and shipping
and ship repair) to restructure and improve their international competitive-
ness. Detailed studies of these subsectors, carried out under the bank-
financed Industrial Investment Credit (IIC) Project (Loan 3123-PH, 1989),
confirmed that the major problems they face are: high operating cost of
existing facilities; inadequate investment in modernization and expansion of



-2
existing capacity; continued procurement and use of inefficient and obsolete
technology; and industrial pollution. At the root of these problems are
policy distortions and institutional weaknesses which have to be addressed to
ensure efficient utilization of resources in these subsectors. The analysis
in the subsector studies laid the groundwork ior the development of an Action
Program (AP) for restructuring the subsectors. The AP comprises actions aimed
at: (a) improving the enabling environment--i.e., policy and regulatory
reforms, and (b) strengthening the institutional support needed for successful
restructuring, i.e., training and technical assistance (TTA) to the
enterprises, industry associations and government agencies in the subsectors
and for environmental protection. The Government would implement the AP
within an agreed time-frame.
5.       Industrial policy reforms in the Philippines have been accompanied by
financial sector reforms. Following the 1983-85 recession and the resulting
distress in the financial system, the Government successfully undertook
measures for rehabilitating the Philippine National Bank and DBP, in the
context of the Bank-financed Economic Recovery Loan (ERL; Loan No. 2787-PH,
1987). Since 1989 the Government has embarked on a comprehensive program of
financial sector reforms to strengthen further the banking system and make it
more competitive and responsive to the needs of the real sectors. These
reforms are being supported by a Bank Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL;
Loan No. 3049-PH, 1989). The main objectives of the reform program are to:
(a) strengthen the supervision and regulatory framework for commercial banks;
(b) improve the institutional arrangement for depositor protection; (c) reduce
intermediation costs in the banking system; and (d) improve the institutional
framework for the mobilization and delivery of long-term credit through a
strategic reorientation of DBP into a wholesale bank that would mobilize and
channel funds to the private sector through retail financial institutions.
The implementation of these reforms is proceeding satisfactorily.
6.       Given the distress in the financial system during 1983-85, commercial
banks are still reluctant to assume the liquidity risk inherent in long-term
lending. Their present liability structure, which consists mainly of short-
term deposits, also does not enable them to lend for long maturities. The
local stock exchanges have become more active during the last three years but
are not likely to become major sources of funds for private investment in the
near future. The demand for term funds, however, is expected to be
substantial over the coming years.  The Philippine industrial sector is
projected to grow at an annual rate of at least 4.5X during the 1990-1992
period, assuming good fiscal management and a favorable external environment.
Investment requirements of private industry over the 1991-93 period are
estimated at about US$1.75 billion (US$583 million p.a.) consisting of US$1.05
billion in new investment and US$700 million for restructuring of the
subsectors mentioned earlier. Taking into account other source of funds,
there would be a potential gap of about US$1.0 billion. Financing such an
investment would be a major challenge for the financial system. The proposed
Bank loan of US$175 million would help finance about 10 of the expected
needs.
7.       DBP's financial restructuring and reorganization under the ERL,
implemented during 1987-89, have now been completed. Its new Policy Statement
provides for DBP to have: (a) a private sector orientation with autonomy in



decision-making; (b) an interest rate and fees policy that is consistent with
prevalent market rates and that ensures full recovery of all its direct and
indirect costs, including provisions as required, plus an adequate profit
margin; (c) prudent interest rate and maturity match between its assets and
liabilities; and (d) a debt-equity ratio not exceeding 5:1. The institution
now has a good management team. Its financial indicators (capital adequacy,
liquidity, return on equity, return on assets) are healthy and in line with
the leading private financial institutions in the Philippines. In 1989, DBP
implemented the IIC project, acting as the apex organization channelling
investment funds to private industry through accredited participating
financial institutions (PFIs). Its implementation of the project has been
excellent. As of August 1, 1990, DBP through the PFIs has committed US$63.8
million out of US$65 million, for 29 subprojects. Under the IIC project, an
agreement was reached with DBP on an Institutional Development Plan (IDP) that
defines and makes operational DBP's wholesale banking strategy. In connection
with the proposed Project, DBP will continue to implement the IDP, including
the market-oriented policies underlying its operations and the privatization
of its retail operations.
8.       Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed Project are to:
(a) support the revival and the strengthening of the industrial sector;
(b) support sound industrial investment in subsectors free from major dis-
tortions resulting from inappropriate trade and regulatory policies; (c) help
make the cement, textiles, pulp and paper, and shipping and ship repair sub-
sectors more competitive through reforms of subsector specific policies, tech-
nical assistance and training; (d) strengthen DBP's capabilities to act as a
vholesale bank and to play more actively in the capital market development;
and (e) strengthen the institutional framework for environmental protection.
9.       Pxoiect Description.  The proposed Project would provide term funds
both in loans and lease finance for private sector enterprises to modernize,
restructure and expand productive capacity. Project funds would also be made
available to finance investments in energy conservation and pollution control
devices. The credit component will be supplemented by training and technical
assistance (TTA). The proposed Project would comprise: (a) a credit compo-
nent of US$175 million.  In addition, export credits amounting to about US$75
million would be sought from a number of countries to supplement the project
funds; and (b) a TTA component of US$15 million to be financed by bilateral
agencies. The Bank loan and EXCEL facility will be made available to DBP
which will relend the funds to the PFIs. DBP would relend the loan funds to
the accredited PFIs in Peso or foreign currency at the prevailing market
rates. For loan funds relent in domestic currency, the Government would
assume the foreign exchange risk for a market-based variable fee payable by
DIP. In the case of lending in foreign exchange, DBP would relend the Bank
funds to the PFIs at the prevailing six month US$ LIBOR plus a spread such
that the resulting total will not be less than the borrowing cost of the PFIs
from the markets. The Government will charge a guarantee fee of 11 p.a. to
DBP for converting the IBRD currency pool sub-loans into US dollar sub-loans.
PFIs will be free to charge the going market rates in local and foreign
currencies based on the creditworthiness of the sub-borrower.
10.      TTA to the selected subsectors will involve strengthening existing
institutions and training facilities that serve them and assisting enterprises



-4-
in the identification, analysis and appraisal of restructuring investments.
TTA for environmental protection will comprise a two-pronged approach: on the
one hand, assistance, through DBP's Industrial Restructuring Unit (IRU), to
industrial enterprises on the design of least-cost pollution control compo-
nents compatible with prevailing standards, as part of their subprojects; on
the other hand, support to the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) in
building up its capabilities to carry out industrial environmental audits and
develop generic Environmental Impact Assessments for subsectors classified as
environmentally critical.
11.      The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$541 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$265 million (49X). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. All goods
and works contracts costing $5 million or more will be awarded after
International Competitive Bidding. Limited international bidding and direct
contracting will be allowed when justified on technical or economic grounds.
Other goods services and works under $5 million will be procured through
established commercial channels. A disbursement schedule is presented in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8989-PH, dated November 15,
1990, is being distributed separately.
12.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have been the two major sources of fore"gn exchange for term
lending in the Philippines, and the Bank's continued involvement is crucial
for private industrial investment. The Bank's financial assistance under the
proposed !'roject will (a) help the industrial sector exploit the opportunities
aT!d aet the challenges provided by the liberalized policy environment; and
(b) build upon the subsector studies carried out under the IIC Project, by
enabling the implementation of Action Programs that would assist in the
restructuring of the selected subsectors. Moreover, the institutional
strengthening program of EMB and DBP to ensure more effective environmental
protection fits into the Bank's strategy for an improved environment. The
Bank's presence would also make it possible to mobilize long term funds from
export credit agencies under the EXCEL program and bilateral funds for TTA to
the selected subsectors.
13.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements and understandings
were reached on the following: (i) implementation of the Action Program for
the selected subsectors; (ii) TTA programs and funding sources;
(iii) implementation of DBP's Institutional Development Plan; (iv) amendment
of DBP's Policy Statement to reflect the objective of supporting efficient and
sound investments and not financing sectors that suffer from major policy
distortions; (v) Operating Policy Guidelines for the Project; (vi) relending
terms and conditions from DBP to the PFIs; (vii) onlending terms and
conditions from the PFIs to the subborrowers; (viii) mechanism for assumption
of the foreign exchange risk by the Government; (ix) appointment of a project
manager for the TTA component of the Project; and (x) DBP's privatization
schedule.
14.      Benefits and Risks. The main benefit of the proposed Project is that
it would enable the Philippines to improve the efficiency of its industries by



making investment funds and technical assistance available for modernization
and expansion of existing facilities and new investment. This restructuring
would help increase the international competitiveness of the industrial sector
and thus revive economic growth. The Project would also make a positive
contribution tu reducing environmental pollution. The main risk is that the
demand for credit may be less than estimated if there is a marked downturn in
the economy and the implementation of the subsector action programs is unduly
delayed. Another risk relates to the limited absorptive capacity of the
agencies involved in implementing technical assistance programs. However,
these risks have been minimized by keeping the loan size in the lower range of
estimated credit demand; assurance has also been received from the Government
that it will implement the subsector Action Program expeditiously. As for the
TTA, active involvement of the industry associations in its design is expected
to help ensure effective implementation.
15.      Recommend&tion.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
