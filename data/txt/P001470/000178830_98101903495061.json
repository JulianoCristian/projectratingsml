Construction of the project would be carried out\n            over a period of three years (1969-1971). Awarding of\n            construction contracts would be on the basis of\n            international competitive bidding and the use of engineering\n            consultants for the supervision of the construction works\n            would be under terms and conditions satisfactory to Bank/IDA."}, "docdt": "1968-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
