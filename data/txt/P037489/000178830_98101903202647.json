To cope\n            with the extreme shortage of competent agricultural research\n            talent in Spain, the project was developed along two major\n            lines: (a) mission oriented research to handle key\n            agricultural problems, and (b) upgrading of local research\n            staff through a fellowship training program and on-the-job\n            training with research specialists recruited abroad. The\n            project would establish within INIA six national research\n            centers, each specialized in one agricultural commodity or a\n            group of related agricultural commodities of national\n            significance, as opposed to the previous practice of\n            multipurpose research centers which each provided a complete\n            coverage of the agricultural research field."}, "docdt": "1971-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
