INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIVIENDATION OF THE PRESIDNIT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SPAIN
FOR Ai AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$12.7 million
for an agricultural research project in Spain.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's seventh operation in
Spain and the first financing of the Bank Group for agricultural
research. The project stems from a joint Bank/FAO Mission which
surveyed Spanish agriculture in late 1965. This and subsequent missions
recommended that high priority be given to strengthening agricultural
research, education and extension as a means to introducing modern tech-
nology and increasing productivity.
3.        The Spanish Government agreed with these recommendations and
requested Bank assistance in August 1967. A project prepared with the
help of the IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program was submitted to the Bank in
October 1969. Agricultural education and training were excluded in a
subsequent revision of this project because they were being considered
in the general reform of the education system which is currently being
carried out. No restructuring of extension services has been attempted
at this stage because this requires further planning, but liaison
arrangements between research and extension have been incorporated in
the project. The revised project was submitted to the Bank in May 1970
and appraised in November-December. Negotiations took place in
Washington from March 26 to 31, 1971 .  The negotiators for the Bor-
rower were led by Sr. Don Jaime Nosti Nava, General Director of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Sr. Don Ricardo Tellez Molina, President
of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agronomicas (INIA), and
included representatives of the Ministry of Finance.
4.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Spain
as at March 31, 1971:

Total   (less cancellations)    224.2
of which has been re-
paid to Bank and others   14.0
Total now outstanding            210.2
Amount sold                3.3
of which has been repaid  2.9      0.4
Total now held by Bank           209.8
Total undisbursed                              58.0
5.        Disbursements on several loans are proceeding at a slower
pace than scheduled. Construction under the Ports Project (Loan 429-SP)
was affected by time-consuming procedures for placing contracts and
changes primarily in respect of traffic and technical aspects which
created difficulties in design. These problems have now been solved
and the final contracts are under execution. The closing date for
this loan had to be postponed from March 31, 1971 to March 31, 1972.
On the Second Railway Project (Loan 507-SP to Red Nacional de los
Ferrocarriles Espanioles - RENFE), progress in physical works and
improvements in management have been satisfactory. However, utiliza-
tion of the proceeds of the loan will not be completed by the closing
date, July 31, 1971, and a postponement by one year has been requested.
As of iiarch 31,, 1971, US.$14.3 million remained undisbursed, mostly
for freight cars and locomotives. Investment in rolling stock normally
takes place after all infrastructure has been installed; contracts



-3-
have now been placed and disbursements for about US$14 million are
expected to take place before the end of the calendar year. No
disbursements have yet been made in respect of the loans for Livestock
Development (Loan 633-SP) and Education (Loan 699-SP). In the case
of the former, administrative delays occurred in the creation of the
project unit (Agency for Livestock Development) and also in
the processing of sub-loans; the situation has now improved and
disbursements should start soon since sub-loans eligible for reimburse-
ment out of the proceeds of the Bank loan have already been made.
Difficulties in establishing the project unit have also affected the
Education Project. Disbursements are expected to start in the third
quarter of 1 971.
6.        IFC has made two investments in Spain totalling US$4 million.
The first was in three different transactions in 1962, 1965 and 1967
totalling US$3.4 million in Fabrica Espafiola i4agnetos S.A. (FEMSA), an
automotive electrical equipment manufacturer, of which US$2.5 million
was as a loan and the remainder in equity; as a result of sales of
equity and repayments, IFC held US$600,000 of the loan and US$575,000
in equity as of H4arch 31, 1971. The other investment is a US$0.6
million equity participation in Banco de Desarrollo Economico Espafiol
S.A. (BANDESCO), a privately owned development finance company. A
proposal for an investment in a liner-board project by INPACSA (Indus-
trias del Papel y de la Celulosa) is in an advanced stage of prepara-
tion.
7.        A third loan to the Spanish railways is likely to be pre-
sented to the Executive Directors before the end of the current fiscal
year. In earlier stages of preparation are ports and education
projects.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled "Spain - Agricultural Research Project"
(PA-714a) is attached.
10.       Although agriculture still retains more importance in the
economy of Spain than in most other European countries, its contribu-
tion to GDP declined from 23 percent in 1960 to 14 percent in 1969.
Similarly, agricultural exports, once the mainstay of Spanish export
trade, have been reduced from well over 50 percent to about 30 percent
of total exports in 1960-69. However, agriculture still employs about
one third of total manpower. Yields and productivity per worker are
low and crop patterns have not adapted to changing consumption habits
resulting from higher standards of living. In the 1960's, the growth
in agricultural output averaged 3.5 percent per year, lagging far
behind an overall economic growth rate of 7.5 percent. As a result,



imports of food products increased steeply, generating a chronic
deficit in agricultural trade which reached about US$300 million in
1969. However, the application of appropriate technology would permit
Spain to utilize its substantial agricultural potential to replace
major imports on an economic basis.
11.       Up to now, much needed modernization in agricultural methods
and equipment has been hampered by lack of technological information.
Improvement in this field requires reorganization of research. Annual
national expenditure for agricultural research in Spain is low in
comparison to more advanced countries. Applied research is fragmented
between too many organizations, operating in an uncoordinated way
under different sponsors, and inadequate in terms of research programs
and training of research workers. Basic research, however, is gener-
ally of much higher standards. Under the project, adaptive applied
research, designed to meet the specific needs and conditions of Spanish
agriculture and livestock production, would be emphasized.
12.       The proposed project aims at raising the standards of agri-
cultural research through the restructuring of the key official research
organization, INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agronomicas),
and reorienting its research activity on a commodity-oriented basis.
To cope with the extreme shortage of competent agricultural research
talent in Spain, the project was developed along two major lines:
a) "mission oriented" research to handle key agricultural problems,
and b) upgrading of local research staff through a fellowship training
program and on-the-job training with research specialists recruited
abroad.
13.       The project would establish within INIA six national research
centers, each specialized in one agricultural commodity or a group of
related agricultural commodities of national significance, as opposed
to the previous practice of multipurpose research centers which each pro-
vided a complete coverage of the agricultural research field. Alto-
gether, the commodities covered represent 85 percent of total agri-
cultural output and 70 percent of agricultural exports and imports.
Each center would carry out research programs designed to meet prior-
ities laid down in the national development plan.
14.       To ensure the success of the new approach to agricultural
research, the technical assistance included in the project provides
for the recruitment of about 20 research specialists of international
standard for service within the project on a long-term contract basis,



- 6 -
for about 30 short-term specialist consultants and about 200 training
fellowships abroad. The research specialists would be assigned to the
various centers to assist in developing research programs, train local
personnel and advise on the fellowship program. A national research
coordinator, of high international repute, would be appointed to assist
INIA management in the formulation of research policies and programs.
The project also provides for cooperation with other government agen-
cies conducting basic research and for liaison with extension ser-
vices. The Government is in discussion with the International Research
Institute (IRI), an experienced research organization, which would
employ the research personnel required under terms of reference and
contract conditions acceptable to the Bank. These discussions are
well advanced, and the proposed loan would be signed after the contract
with this organization has been concluded.
15.       Total project cost is estimated at US$28.2 million, in-
cluding US$2.2 million for the purchase of land. The proposed loan
would finance the foreign exchange cost of the project estimated at
US$12.7 million, i.e. 45 percent of the total cost. About 45 percent
of the loan (US$5.7 million) would help finance the capital cost of
the centers and another 40 percent (US$5 million) would cover the
cost of technical assistance. The remainder has been allowed for
contingencies. In addition to the local currency cost of the project,
equivalent to US$15.5 million, the borrower would have to bear the
annual operating expenses of the research organization which are
estimated at about US$7 million equivalent at full development after
five years.
16.       The economic rate of return is difficult to quantify for
this kind of project, but has been estimated in the range of 15 per-
cent to 30 percent.
17.       All contracts for the erection of buildings and the supply
of furnishings, services and utilities would be awarded under inter-
national competitive bidding. Since international competitive bidding
would not be appropriate for scientific equipment, this will be pro-
cured on specification of the center directors and research coordi-
nators. The Loan Agreement contains provisions for bulk purchase of
research equipment to make procurement more efficient whenever this
is practicable. Because of limited numbers, it would also be im-
practicable to group procurement of farm and transport equipment for
international competitive bidding. It will,therefore, be obtained
under standard government procurement procedures from domestic and
locally established foreign firms.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between Spain and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
19.       It should be noted that Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement prescribe the following conditions of effec-
tiveness: a) appointment by INIA of a senior agricultural scientist
of international repute, approved by the Bank, to serve as National
Research Coordinator at INIA headquarters, and b) necessary action
by INIA to acquire the additional land required to establish the
National Research Centers at Zaragoza, Cordoba, Valencia, and La
Corunia in areas and locations satisfactory to the Bank. Other
provisions of the draft Loan Agreement generally conform to the
standard pattern of Bank loans.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Spain"
(ENA-172) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 7,
1969. The report of a Bank mission which visited Spain in November-
December 1970 is expected to be distributed to the Executive Directcrs
shortly. The following summarizes the major findings of the mission.
A basic data sheet is annexed.
21.       The 1959-60 stabilization program and economic policies
in the 1960's brought about a gradual relaxation of government controls
over Spain's internal and external economic relations. The economy
was opened to foreign goods, technology and capital, while the private
sector was encouraged to increase output and investment. Sustained
by the inflow of foreign technology and capital and by rising foreign
exchange earnings from tourism and from remittances of Spanish workers
employed abroad, total output grew by 7.5 percent per year in real
terms during 1961-70. Because of the low net population growth (less
than 1 percent p.a.), GIMP per head, expressed in current dollars,
rose from US$374 in 1960 to almost US$850 in 1970.
22.       Growth in the 1960's was mainly in industry and the service
sectors. Industrial production increased on the average by 10 percent



per year in 1960-69, while services expanded by 7 percent annually.
There was large-scale migration of labor from the land to employment
in urban areas in Spain and to other European countries. Despite this
rural exodus, open unemployment in the non-agricultural sector is at
a very low level, currently less than 2 percent of the active popula-
tion. Regional inequalities in income distribution are still consid-
erable. Income per head in the highest income regions (Madrid,
Barcelona, Basques) is probably about 2.5 times that of the lowest
income regions (Inner Galicia, Extremadura and Western Andalucia).
23.       Economic growth was rather uneven in the second half of the
1960's, mainly because of stop-go policies in the monetary and fiscal
fields. After a period of sustained expansion following the 1967
devaluation, restrictive measures were introduced in 1969 to cope with
the rising balance of payments deficit. Growth slowed down while the
balance of payments improved. In January 1971 monetary policies were
relaxed somewhat by lowering the central bank discount rate and easing
credit. There is, however, a danger that inflationary pressures may
again become too strong. Consumer price increases accelerated from 3.5
percent in 1969 to 6.8 percent in 1970, due to a relaxation of price
controls and the elimination of subsidies introduced with the 1967
devaluation of the peseta, as well as rising wage rates.
24.       Investment in education and in research has to be increased
considerably to meet the needs of future economic growth and to reduce
Spain's heavy reliance on foreign technology. Also, structural weak-
nesses persist in manufacturing and agriculture. The preferential
trade agreement with the EEC, which went into effect in October 1970,
makes it all the more necessary that such weaknesses be removed.
While Spain has been relatively successful in mobilizing resources, it
continues to have a major problem in their allocation and administra-
tion. This is why institutional improvements at the sector level
and proper fiscal and financial policies are important.
25.       Because of the need to increase the allocation of resources
to education and other social fields and of structural reforms in key
economic sectors, the growth of the Spanish economy during the next
five years may be somewhat lower than in the 19601s.
26.       Spain's balance of payments has been marked since 1965 by
high commodity trade deficits averaging US$1.8 billion a year, largely
covered by income from services and transfers, mainly tourism and
remittances by workers abroad. Deficits on current account averaged
US$0.4 billion. However, the need for imports is likely to remain high



in the future while earnings from tourism and workers' remittances
are not expected to continue to increase at the high rates of the
1960's. It is therefore important to promote commodity exports,
particularly of manufactures.
27.       The net inflow of long-term capital averaged US$365 million
per annum during 1965-70. The major part of external capital has
been private; given continuing confidence in the private sector, this
should continue. During 1965-70 long-term borrowing by the Government
averaged some US$30 million a year. However, the need for capital from
official sources can be expected to increase, because of the envisaged
higher outlays on social infrastructure (mainly in education) and
structural reforms in various sectors.
28.       Spain is creditworthy for substantial amounts of additional
lending on conventional terms. The debt servicing record is good
and debt service is moderate. Total external public debt outstanding
at the end of 1969 was US$1,454 million, of which US$400 million was
undisbursed. In 1970, some US$140 million of external public debt was
newly comzmitted against repayments of US$92 million in the same year.
Service on outstanding debt as of the end of 1969, including service
on the undisbursed portion, would amount to US$276 million in 1971 or
equal about 5.6 percent of total foreign exchange receipts in 1970.
Debt service as projected remains moderate, approximately 5 percent
in 1976.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PLIT VII - RECOIOENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
