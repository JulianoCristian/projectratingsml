to continue efforts started under earlier Bank\n            Group operations to strengthen the Directorate of Roads and\n            Bridges (DRP), particularly by improving its capacity to\n            carry out effective routine and periodic road maintenance.\n            Specifically, the project is designed to: (i) continue the\n            program for rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads; (ii)\n            improve the organization and administrative procedures of\n            DRP; (iii) train field, workshop, and office staff at\n            different levels to carry out road maintenance tasks; and\n            (iv) institute axle-load control and road safety programs. A\n            major benefit of the project will be its\n            institution-building impact. The most tangible benefit,\n            however, will be derived from the road rehabilitation\n            program in the form of vehicle operating cost savings which\n            will be passed on to users. There are about 400,000\n            inhabitants in the direct areas of influence of the roads.\n            There is no major risk associated with the project, as it is\n            mainly a continuation of efforts under the Third Highway\n            Project which is progressing satisfactorily."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
