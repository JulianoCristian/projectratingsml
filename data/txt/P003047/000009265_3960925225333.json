Seeds Project aimed to increase food production by\n            improving the supply of seeds and cassava cuttings. On\n            balance, the project is rated unsatisfactory. Institutional\n            objectives were achieved only partially and sustainability\n            appears unlikely. Project results were a mixture of success\n            and failure. The project's main achievement consisted\n            in setting up a seed industry, which was its primary goal.\n            It was, however, Government's lack of commitment to\n            support this achievement, Combined with the inability of\n            seed farms to become self-financing through seed sales, as a\n            result of Government interference and over-extension, which\n            undermined further progress. Even before the current\n            political events, Government failed to provide adequate\n            commitment to the success of the project, and internal\n            management discipline was slipping. The project in its\n            actual design proved to be unsustainable without donor\n            financing. The following are the main lessons learned from\n            the project: (i) There is a need for more focused and\n            simpler projects, commensurate with available management\n            capabilities. (ii) Project experience confirms that the\n            adequate status and advance of varietal improvement is\n            critical for the success of seed multiplication efforts.\n            (iii) The performance of the Borrower illustrates the need\n            to apply credit conditionality more explicitly and\n            consistently. (iv) Experience with project supervision\n            suggests that more resources for supervision should be made\n            available for critical projects of this kind in country\n            circumstances which are complex, such as Zaire. (v) Adoption\n            of a satisfactory legal framework for the seeds supply\n            sub-sector should be a condition for any future Bank support\n            to the seed industry."}, "docdt": "1993-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
