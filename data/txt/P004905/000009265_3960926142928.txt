MEMORANDLTM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$143 MILLION
TO THE SOCIETE NATIONALE DES TRANSPORTS FERROVIAIRES (SNTF)
WITR THE GUARANIEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC 0F ALGERIA
FOR A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Société Nationale
des Transports Ferroviaires (SNTF) in the amount of US$143 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable
over 15 years with five years of grace at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would assist SNTF in rehabilitating key sections of the
main rai]way network to meet demand at reasonable efficiency, improving the
financial viability of the railway and strengthening managerial, organiza-
tional and operational staff.
2.       Background.  Algeria has a 3,700 km rail network which ie operated
by the Société Nationale des Transports Ferroviaires (SNTF) -- a public
enterprise  under  the  authority  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport.   With
increasing domestie production of basic commodities such as steel products,
fertilizers and cereals, the railway is expected to play an important role
in the interregional movement of buLk traffic and in supporting the
development of  the economy.   The  railway also  plays  a key  role  in  the
movemeuit of iron ore and phosphates  iu the eastern part.  In 1986, total
rail traffic amounted to about 3 billion ton-km of freight (minerals,
phosphates, coal, cereals and cil) and 2 billion passenger-km (50 percent
suburban).  Much of the track on the main lines is about 35 years old and
in poor condition and consequently there is an urgent need for track
renewai.   Although assistance  was  provided  for a  track  renewal  program
under the First Railway Project (Loan 996-AL, FY74), the momentum was not
maintained. Current plans call for the rehabilitation and renewal of about
600 km of main line track during the period 1987-90.  SNTF also proposes to
modernize its signalling and telecommunications equipment as well as to
improve  its  operational   efficiency  and  financial  viability.   SNTF's
financial situation has deteriorated over the years and its operating
deficit  in  1986  amounted  to  about  US$100  million  (US$200  million  if
allowances are made for depreciation).  The Government recently implemented
a  financial  restructuring  of  SNTF  which  will  allow  the  enterprise  to
gradually  achieve   financial   equilibrium.    A  new  railway   convention
(contract plan has also been prepared which includes a definition of the
role and responsibilities of Government vis-à-vis  the railway.   The terms
of this convention have been approved by the Council of Ministers and are
included in the Project Action Plan.   Confirmation has been received from
Government  that  the  Convention  will  be  signed  shortly.   Among  other
mneasures,  the  financial  restructuring  included  a  general  20%  tariff
increase which was made effective in May 1988.  The proposed project is in
line with the current Government subsector strategy which focuses on the
financial, institutional and operational rehabilitation of the rail svstem.
2.       Proiect Objectives.  The prooosed project forms part of a broader
more comprehensive approach to Zank Lending in Xhe transport sector.  Among
the najcr pclicy objectives to be o rsued under the proposed project is the



-2 
need to rationalize the railway investment program and to give adequate
priority to rehabilitation of the network. tn addition, high priority is
being given to the implementation of the financial restructuring of the
railway as well as the n'e  railway convention which sets out the objectives
and actions agreed between the Government and the railway, particularly in
relation to pricing, compensation, responsibilities for investment, and
depreciation charges for railway infrastructure. Finally, the project
would help in achieving improvements in managerial, organizational and
operational staff capabilities.
4.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would include financing
of the following high priority components: (a) about 602 of the
Government's three-7ear program (mid 1928-mid 1991) for track rehabilita-
tion and renewal covering 370 km of main line track; (b) support for a
program of modernization of signalling and telecommunications including the
installation of interlocking systems on selected sections of the main line;
(c) provision of equipment to establish a capacity for mechanized track
maintenance; and (d) technical assistance and training to support routine
track maintenance activities, for the establishment of a cost-accounting
system and for improving the planning, management and operation of the
railway system. The project would cover about 70% of the core investment
program for signalling and telecommunications.  The remainder of the
rehabilitation and signalling programs would be financed from local
resources.
,.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project with
contingencies is estimated at US$431 million with a foreign exchange cost
of US$190 million. The Bank loan of US$143 million would cover about
one-third of total project costs and 75Z of the foreigr ex:hange cost.  The
balance of the foreign exchange cost - US$47 million - will be provided by
a loan fromr the Japan Ex-Im Bank under a joint co-fi!jancing arrangement.
Local costs in the amnount of US$241 million would be financed from the
investment budget. A breakdown of project costs arid the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procuroment and the disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 7027-AL dated May 26, 1988 is being distributed separately.
S.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The recent decline in hydrocarbon
revenues has brought a sense of urgency in dealing with many of the
problems in the sector.  Among the main issues which the Government is now
addressing are the need to: (i) improve operational efficiency and reduce
operating costs in the road transport industry, in the ports and in the
railways; (ii) rationalize the transport investment plan by concencrating
on high priority rehabilitation programs and by deferring scme major
investments in new infrastructure; (iii) establish a sound pricing and
.fiscal policy in the sector in order to improve domestic resource mobil_za-
:-on; and (iv) streng:hen planr-ng, project preparation and overail
coordination in the sector both a: the central and local levels.  :hese
.ssues are being discassed wi :- the Governr.ent as part of an  nr.going
prO3grai' of economic and sector work which includes an econcmy-wide review
of the 1985-89 _evelopment Plan and a 'ransport Sector Strategy ?aper



-3-
prepared  in October 1987.  The proposed project would be part of this
overall effort to improve the institutional framework.  In particular, bank
assistance under the proposed project would help Government in its efforts
to restructure the railway financially, institutionally and operationally.
Our involvement should help lower the burden on the Government's budget by
increasing operational efficiency, improving the railway's finances and
rationalizing the railway investment program.   Moreover, our involvement
would help in clarifying the respective responsibilities (and their
eventual implications, e.g., operational subsidies) of tie rail authority
vis-à-vis  Government.   Lastly,  the  Bank  project  would  assist  in  the
preparation of sound, well-tailored programa for investment, action plans
to improve operational efficiency, accounting, tariffs and staff training.
As improvements in railway operations can only be achieved over a
relatively long period, the project would set the trend for a longer term
cooperation with the Bank.
7.       Aareed  Actions.   A comprehensive  Project  Action  Plan has been
discussed and agreed covering a core subsector investment program,
including providing for presentation of the annual investment budgets to
the  Bank,  and  a  timetable  for  the  implementation  of  financial  and
operational  targets.   Specific  measures  for  improving  the  finarcial
performance of the railway are included in the Action Plan, reflecting the
terms of the new railway convention which are acceptable to the Bank.  At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower and the Guarantor
on the following actions and matters of particular significance: (a) to
execute the project in accordance with the provisions of the Project Action
Plan; (b) to present the draft annual railway investment budgets for Bank
review and (c) to achieve a working ratio of 3:4 by 1991.  In addition, the
Government provided the Bank with a Letter of Intent stating its policy
with regard to revaluation of fixed assets and the appropriate depreciatic>n
of infrastructure costs in the transport sector.
8.       Justification.  The proposed  investments under the project will
enable the railway to continue to provide essential bulk traff;c services
over two of its most important routes.  In the absence of such programs,
the condition of the infrastructure would continue to deteriorate and
eventually  traffic might have to be handled at higher cost by road or
economic activity would be disrupted.  Economic benefits from the proposed
project  are  mainly  in  the  form  of  substantial  savings  in  deferred
maintenance expenditures, which would be necessary in order to keep the
lines open to traffic, as well as savings in train operating costs through
higher  operating  speeds  and  savings  in  derailments  through  improved
safety.  The modernization of signalling and telecommunications will also
*         provide savings in operating costs, a reduction in accidents as well as
capacity benefits on suburban lines near Algiers.  The economic rate of
return (ER) of sub-projects ranges from 18% to 27% for the track rehabili-
tation and renewal components and at least 15% for the signalling and tele-
communications investments.  The overall ER for the Bank-financed part of
the  investment  program  is about  22%.   In addition,  the  project  would
support the Government's efforts to introduce institutional improvements
and to improve the firnancial position of the railway.



-4-
9.       Riik!!    The min risk la that the railway te slow to implemnt the
rehabilitation and inatitutional atrengthening prograu.  Hovever,  given
that the project finances the highest priority item. of the invest_ nt
progra. and that the project action plan would closely monitor investuent
allocation, the riaki are mnageable. In addition, the key iteom in the
financial restructuring have already taken place vhile apecific financial
targets *nd the masures required to reacb the are included in the loan
documents.
10.      Recoo_endation.   I au  satisfied  that  the  propo.sd  lo n  vould
comply with the Articles of Agreem_nt of the Bank and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
