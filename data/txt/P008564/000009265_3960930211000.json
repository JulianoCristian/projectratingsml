Project is\n            designed to support private farmers and promote other\n            private sector activities in rural areas, primarily through\n            the restructuring of high-priority rural cooperatives (e.g.,\n            cooperative banks and marketing, dairy and horticulture\n            cooperatives).  More specifically, the project will: start\n            transforming existing rural cooperatives from social sector\n            organizations to member-controlled, market-oriented business\n            enterprises; help develop rural commercial enterprises by\n            improving access to credit; and provide investment funds for\n            business and institutional development in rural communities.\n            The project comprises:  (i) institution-building activities\n            for about 2,400 rural cooperatives and cooperative banks\n            through:  (a) technical assistance aimed at strengthening\n            individual agricultural cooperatives and primary cooperative\n            banks and creating a suitable apex structure at regional and\n            national levels, and (b) establishment of a Capital Fund for\n            cooperative banks; and (ii) a credit program to provide\n            medium- and long-term credit for investments in agriculture,\n            agroindustry and other rural productive sectors. Farmers,\n            individual entrepreneurs, private cooperatives, private\n            enterprises as well as former state enterprises which have\n            been privatized will be eligible for borrowing."}, "docdt": "1991-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
