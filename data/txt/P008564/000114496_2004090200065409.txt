Excellency:
     Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated July 10, 1991,
between the Republic of Poland (the Borrower) and the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), and your letter,
dated January 15, 1992, requesting the conversion of the condition
of effectiveness relating to the establishment of the capital fund
set forth in Section 6.01 (d) of the Loan Agreement into a dated
covenant.  We are pleased to inform you that the Bank accepts your
proposal and the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
     Section 6.01 (d) is deleted.
     A new Section is added at the end of Article IV to read as
follows:
     "Section 4.02. By June 30, 1992 the Borrower shall establish
     and, thereafter, operate the capital fund referred to under
     Part A.3 of the Project under arrangements and with resources,
     legal personality, organizational structure, and terms of
     reference satisfactory to the Bank."
     This amendment is effective as of the date of this letter.
Please confirm receipt of this letter.
                                      Very truly yours,
