F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objective is for poor villagers in the northern mountains to
use a variety of improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services, and to
increase the institutional capacity of upland communes and districts. Progress towards
meeting this objective will be measured by: increased access to, and use of transport,
market, water, health and education services; sustained improvement in the quality of
services; adequate maintenance of new infrastructure and establishment of operations and
maintenance systems; increased district and commune management capacity and
sustained improvements in agricultural livelihoods.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (2002 to 2007) was one of the two
World Bank financed projects in Vietnam that adopted a Community Driven
Development (CDD) approach with aims to achieve accelerated rural development and
targeted poverty reduction in some of the poorest rural areas of the country2. The project
was designed and introduced to support the Government's efforts to maintain growth
with equity, and to help address widening differences in the rate of economic
development between urban and rural areas. The project was an integral part of the
Government's overall program for poverty reduction in the remote and difficult
mountainous areas, which included the majority of Vietnam's poorest rural communes3.

The project has drawn on the experiences of decentralized and participatory projects in
Vietnam, such as UNDP/IFAD/UNCDF projects, as well as projects in the other
countries in the region such as the First and Second Village Infrastructure Projects in
Indonesia and the Southwest and Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Projects in China.

The development objective was consistent with the priorities of the Country Assistance
Strategy (1998) and the CAS Progress Report in place at the project appraisal in 2000 and
the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in 2001 which included accelerated rural
development and targeted rural poverty reduction as one of the main goals. The project
concept was built upon the Government's ongoing policy initiatives and targeted poverty
reduction programs that explicitly encouraged a decentralized development process and
Decree 29 on Grassroots Democracy which provided a well-defined framework for
consultation, participation, and transparency concerning public works at the commune
level.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project's development objectives were for poor villagers in the northern mountains to
use a variety of improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services, and to
increase the institutional capacity of upland communes and districts. Progress towards
meeting these objectives were to measured by: (a) access to, and use of, transport,
markets, water, health and education infrastructure and services; (b) changes in service
quality as assessed by villages and groups; (c) the sustainability of operation and
maintenance systems; (d) changes in districts and communes management capacity; and
(e) improvements in agricultural livelihoods as assessed by villages and groups.




2The other project being the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP) that operates in 13 provinces of the central
regions of the country.
3Such as Socio-economic Development of Communes with Greatest Difficulties in Mountainous and Ethnic Minority Areas -P135,
phase 1 and 2-, P136, border area program, etc



                                                                                                                               1

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

No formal revision of the project development objectives (PDO) was required during
project implementation. Although no targets were set at appraisal for the PDO indicators,
the key indicators were recalibrated in 2004 when the baseline was established. The
PDO indicators on the sustainability of operation and maintenance systems were
substituted by the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system development through a series
of targeted studies and participatory supervisions4.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The project adopted a multilevel targeting strategy for poverty reduction for
disadvantaged remote communes with specific interventions to benefit poor groups and
households. The project area included 356 rural communes (and some 3,500 villages) in
44 districts in 6 provinces of the Northern Mountains Region of Vietnam ­ Lao Cai, Son
La, Yen Bai, Hoa Binh, Phu Tho and Bac Giang provinces5. According to the 1999
Population Census, the project area had a population of just over one million, including
approximately 980,000 ethnic minority people that made up 86% of the project
beneficiaries.

The project area is characterized by a high degree of ethnic diversity. Six groups
comprise 90% of the ethnic minority population including the H'Mong, Muong, Thai,
Tay, Dzao and Nung. These ethnic groups are distributed throughout the six provinces
and co-exist side-by-side within a commune or village. The topography of the project
area is highly dissected mountainous terrain, with many isolated valleys in which rural
communities are located. A majority of communes included in the project were classified
as communes facing special difficulties in mountainous and ethnic minority areas (Zone
III Communes) according to the Government classification employed at the time of
project preparation6.

During preparation, guidelines for project design and planning were issued to pay special
attention to ensure that women were adequately represented in the identification and
prioritization of project activities and provided with equal opportunity. During
implementation, its progress was monitored and recorded which indeed showed that
women were included and well represented throughout the process.




4See section 2.5 on M&E for more information.

  The project originally covered 368 communes with the inclusion of 12 communes in Than Uyen District in Lao Cai. In 2004 Than
Uyen District joined Lai Chau Province and project activities were discontinued.
6
  Decision No.42/UB-QD (dated 23 / 05 / 1997) of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas on the Identification
of Three Zones in Upland and Mountain Areas. The criteria used in this classification included: (i) remote, isolated or upland
communes (>20km from growth areas); (ii) temporary or weak infrastructure (lack of roads, irrigation, health and education services);
(iii) poor social conditions (poor health, illiteracy, limited schooling); (iv) difficult agricultural production conditions (lack of paddy
land, lack of inputs); and (v) household poverty rates (>40% of the population below the old poverty line according to MOLISA).



                                                                                                                                           2

1.5 Original Components

The project included six components. First three components constituted 66.5% of the
total original project costs which was financed by over 70% of the IDA Credit.

· Component 1: Rural Roads and Markets. This component supported construction
    and upgrading of district-to-commune, commune-to-village and inter-village roads
    and pathways; bridges and road drainage structures; and commune markets. In the
    project design it was specified that no more than 30% of the total project costs should
    be allocated to this component (original cost: US$ 34 million).
· Component 2: Agriculture, Irrigation and Domestic Water Supply. This included
    sub-components in construction and upgrading of small-scale irrigation schemes;
    construction and up-grading of domestic water supply schemes; applied agriculture
    demonstration models; the provision of extension training; and an `on-site' research
    program on upland agriculture (original cost: US$ 36 million).
· Component 3: Health and Education. This included construction and upgrading of
    commune and village primary school classrooms, kindergartens and teacher
    accommodation; construction and upgrading of commune health stations; the
    provision of furniture and basic equipment for the schools and commune health
    stations; community health awareness campaigns; and upgrading teacher and health
    worker qualifications (original cost: US$ 18 million).
· Component 4: Commune Development Budget Component (CDBC). This
    component was designed to support small-scale sub-projects and activities that were
    identified and implemented by local communities themselves. Eligible sub-projects
    for funding using the CDBC comprised 15% of the province project and commune
    budget allocations (original cost: US$ 17 million).
· Component 5: Institutional Capacity Building. This included sub-components in
    commune and village cadre training and capacity building; province and district
    training and capacity building; project monitoring and evaluation; public information
    and communications; and Technical Assistance inputs. This component was co-
    financed through the DFID Grant and was managed by the Central Project
    Management Unit (original cost: US$ 10.5 million).
· Component 6: Project Management. This component included incremental
    operating and transport costs for the central, provincial and district Project
    Management Units and for the Commune Development Boards; the supply of office
    equipment, training and transport for the central, provincial and district PMUs; and
    the provision of consultancy services for project monitoring, supervision and
    reporting (original cost: US$ 8 million).

1.6 Revised Components

The structure of the project components was not revised during implementation, however
three significant changes were made during project implementation as discussed in
section 1.7.




                                                                                         3

1.7 Other significant changes

The number of communes supported under the project was decreased from 368
communes to 356 communes. This is because in 2004, Than Uyen district of Lao Cai
province was moved to the newly set-up Lai Cai province under administrative boundary
changes. Having had considered all options, it was decided then that twelve (12)
communes in Than Uyen district were removed from the project all together.

Two amendments to the Development Credit Agreement were approved in December
2004 and April 2007 to allow for an adjustment in fund allocation between expenditure
categories. These amendments did not alter the overall allocation of resources to the
different project components. For a majority of civil works under Components 1-3, the
cost estimates made during project preparation as contained in the Feasibility Reports had
to be revised. This was largely due to the inflation in construction costs between the time
cost-estimates were made during project preparation and the time they were implemented
several years later. These shortfalls in funding were largely covered by the increased IDA
Credit amount resulting from changes in the SDR / US$ exchange rate.

One amendment was made to the Grant Agreement in September 2005 to allow all
activities and investments to support the Management Information System (MIS) to be
financed by a DFID Grant up to 100% rather than 75% as envisioned during preparation.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The soundness of the background analysis was satisfactory. The preparation of the
project took long from November 1998-2001 mainly because of the high degree of
institutional complexity and the novelty of the new approach being introduced in
Vietnam. This detailed preparation allowed a strong background analysis and government
ownership in the project design which was particularly important given the complexity of
the integrated approach and logistical challenges created by the geographical dispersion
of the project area.

Second, the project design - objectives, components and organization- were appropriate
for the context of rural Vietnam. The principal strengths of project design were: (a)
strong country involvement in project designing and preparation; (b) the decentralized
management and procurement institutional arrangements; and (c) the use of pilot which
allowed identification of risks early to allow modification of the project design.

The Government Commitment was strong, which was imperative to be able to coordinate
the implementation of the complex and innovative approaches. From the outset, the
Government led the preparation process with support from the Bank and partners. This


                                                                                         4

ensured a strong ownership and understanding of the project by the central and local
Government authorities. Project preparation involved an intensive planning process
undertaken together with the province, district and commune authorities. This included
participatory community assessment and sub-project identification exercises including
determining the level of fund allocation to each commune and to each project component.

 Decentralized management and procurement institutional arrangements: Both the
Government and the Bank agreed to decentralize the responsibilities for decision-making,
project planning and implementation to district and commune levels. The NMPRP
adopted a `decentralized' model of direct disbursement to province level. The IDA funds
were disbursed to seven Special Accounts: one under the CPMU and to six Province
Special Accounts managed by the PPMUs (with an additional SA under CPMU for the
DFID Grant). Fund flow from the Province Special Accounts was made to District
`Second-generation' Project Accounts and ultimately to separate Commune sub-accounts
for the CDBC, held in the district branch of Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.
While this was complex and elaborate scheme and necessitated intensive capacity
building, these fund flow arrangements allowed decentralization which was matched by
designated levels of Investment Ownership under the project7. In addition, during the
preparation and start-up period of NMPRP, project management and implementation
guidelines and legislative documents were prepared to formulate a framework for
decentralization such as the promulgation of Circulars guiding project financial
management by the Ministry of Finance. This is a particular advantage of NMPRP, since
regulations providing a basis for decentralization have not been as fully developed under
some comparable projects.

Given decentralization was a new concept to Vietnam, the project start-up was expected
and was indeed slow but the pace picked up significantly in subsequent years. A Pilot
Commune Program8 was included in the designed to accelerate and gain implementation
experience. The pilot communes (two in each province) in remote and less remote areas
enabled testing of the project approaches and procedures before scaling it up to full
implementation.

One shortcoming for the quality at entry has been that no targets for the PDO indicators
were set at appraisal. This resulted in a recalibrating of the PDO indicators and target
values during development of the baseline in 20049.




7
  The districts are the investment owners for the majority of small-scale infrastructure works, while the communes are investment
owners for the CDBC, and the PPMUs for a limited number of larger works and service contracts. The involvement of a large number
of implementing agencies due to the project scope and nature also added to the complexity in design and created some difficulties for
the implementation at the beginning but was solved later during the MTR.
8
  There were 10 pilot communes in 5 provinces, 2 funded by DANIDA in Son La (TF-21338); 6 by Japan in Bac Giang, Phu Tho and
Hoa Binh (TF-26559) and 2 by DFID in Lao Cai (TF-50001).

2.2 Implementation

The factors contributing to the successful implementation of the project have been the
good quality of the supervision missions, including the timely and effective mid-term
review (MTR), and the strength of the institutional partnership. The project had a slow
start and was considered "unsatisfactory" until 2003 due to the complex management
responsibilities, complicated procurement procedures, and weak institutional capacity.
The decisions taken during the MTR and frequent supervision from October to April
2004 helped improve the overall progress in terms of financial disbursement and the
implementation of investment activities to a satisfactory status. Key changes introduced
at the MTR which contributed to improving the performance the project10 are discussed
below:

Clarifying management responsibilities: An underlying issue affecting project
implementation up until the MTR was the differing interpretations of `decentralized
management'. The role of CPMU in processing and approving provincial withdrawal
applications and the Procurement Plans was not fully understood. This lack of clarity
impacted on the initial project performance and contributed to the slow implementation
of the DFID co-financed Capacity Building Plan11. The MTR also identified staffing
deficiencies (a lack of full time staff working on the project, and a lack of staff in some
technical areas) particularly at CPMU and district level (DPMUs). Following the MTR,
the National Project Steering Committee with the support of the Bank clarified
management responsibilities between the CPMU (coordination and supervision) and
PPMUs (implementation and coordination with DPMUs).

Streamlining implementation and procurement procedures: The MTR streamlined the
implementation procedures by allowing provinces (PPMUs) to manage matters relating to
procurement and prior approval. This helped simplify the overall project management
system and enabled CPMU to concentrate more on its coordinating functions12, and most
responsibilities for managing civil works procurement was transferred from Provinces to
Districts. The MTR also restructured the Technical Assistance by promoting more short-
tem, local advisers, and concentrating on practical hands-on training, focused studies etc.

Following these changes, the implementation progress improved considerably including
the disbursement rates from IDA. The completion of the project at the original scheduled
Closing Date of December 31, 2007 reconfirms the effectiveness of the changes and
significant achievement made since the MTR. .



10See annex 7 for more details.
11
  Component 5: Institutional Capacity Building was co-financed by a DFID Grant which was provided through a Trust Fund (Trust
Fund No. TF 050050) that was administered by the International Development Association and managed and implemented by the
Central Project Management Unit under MPI.
12
  Such as the implementation of the Capacity Building Plan for the PPMU, DPMU and communes, the implementation of M&E, the
coordination of communications, lesson-learning, the promotion of horizontal exchange of information among project implementing
agencies, etc.



                                                                                                                              6

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) The M&E system design is moderately satisfactory. M&E was challenging given the
large geographical area of the project and the decentralized management in multiple
provinces, districts and communes. The large number of sub-projects also posed
challenges for maintaining accurate and up-to-date information on implementation
progress and results.

The M&E system suffered some initial shortcomings due to insufficient design: (a) no
targets for the PDO indicators were set at appraisal; (b) the baseline survey was not
implemented until late 200413; (c) Some PDO indicators were output indicators instead
of outcome indicators, which made the project impact and the achievement of the
outcomes difficult to evaluate; and (d) the MIS was ready until 2004 and was probably
too ambitious at the outset, especially given DPMU's capacity to maintain and use the
system and the large range and volume of data required.

In the end, the project provided considerable attention to M&E. Over US$ 4 million
DFID grant was provided to strengthen capacity of province, district and commune
authorities, project management units and improve M&E systems, and also to carry out
special studies. This represented around 3% of the total project costs, which aimed to
undertake lesson-learned and document project results for replication in similar programs
in Vietnam in the future.

(b) M&E implementation has been successful. Despite the shortcomings identified at the
quality at entry, M&E as implemented was effective. In most of the cases, data was
collected in time following appropriate methods, and CPMU benefitted from progress
report prepared by the PPMUs on a regular basis.                                        During the last two years of
implementation CPMU adapted a flexible draw-down contract system to commission
independent monitoring studies with a consultant company and supervised M&E support
services. In parallel, MPI has conducted numerous case studies and researches and
results were included in the Progress Reports, and again reflected in the provincial
Completion Reports.

(c) Overall, application and utilization of the M&E at completion has been highly
satisfactory. The result based M&E system under the project has significantly helped the
project implementation and monitoring, allowing rapid informed decision and timely
resource allocation. It also contributed in shifting the focus within the Government
concerning basic infrastructure investments in poor, ethnic minority communes away
from measuring inputs and outputs towards measuring outcomes. The M&E of the



13
   The baseline was constituted from different sources over time such as the Commune Standard documents or MPI's feasibility
studies done in1999/2000 and which served as a baseline for basic infrastructure, but also of data from the Vietnam Household Living
Standard Surveys rounds between 2002-2004 carried out by the General Statistic Office (GSO) and were finally consolidated into a
proper baseline survey done by the contracted firm in charge the MIS design (Mekong Economics)



                                                                                                                                  7

NMPRP is considered an example of good practice and has been used at several training
workshop on M&E, and helped strengthen the capacity of national staff at all level.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Compliance with OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples was satisfactory. Ethnic minority people
comprised the majority of the project's beneficiaries. As part of the project preparation a
socio-economic study was commissioned to assess the project design and proposed
strategy with regards to Indigenous Peoples. During project preparation a Strategy Action
Plan for Ethnic Groups was prepared as a part of the Project Implementation Manual
(PIM). The Action Plan emphasized the importance of ensuring the participation of
different ethnic minority communities in all aspects of project planning and
implementation, and that project interventions should be culturally appropriate.                           This
principle underlined all aspects of project design to ensure that ethnic minorities equally
benefit from the development subprojects and avoid or mitigate potentially adverse
effects on ethnic minorities. Specific actions were incorporated into the project planning,
information dissemination, community participation and implementation processes such
as documentary films for screening on national television, radio programs, manuals,
leaflets etc, in main ethnic minorities languages (Hmong, Thai, Tay, Dao).

Compliance with the Bank's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement was satisfactory. A
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy were prepared for the project. Project affected
persons as a result of minor land acquisitions were compensated for the losses at
replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures. Land acquisition was
minimized, public disclosure was carried out and grievance procedure was established.
In order to comply with the Bank's policy, the Government granted necessary waivers of
legislation and authorized the provinces to provide compensate and resettlement
assistance to all affected persons.               Compensation was paid before the civil work was
commenced.

Compliance with the Environment Safeguards (OP4.01, BP4.01, and GP4.01) was
satisfactory. The project's physical investments were mostly small-scale in cost and
scope, and the negative environmental impacts were insignificant, localized and
manageable. The inadequate attention to environmental safeguards noted during the
early stages of the project implementation was resolved by the MTR. An Environment
Management Plan (EMP) was prepared proposing specific mitigation measures for each
type of the sub-projects. Environmental training for district project officers was also
conducted as part of the project's capacity building support.

Financial management was generally of good quality14. Capacity was built through the
development of standardized written procedures and by intensive training. Issues
detected by the supervision process was promptly resolved and audit reports were timely
and of acceptable quality. In general, the project procurement performance was found to
be consistent with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and the Legal Agreements. The


14Some minor financial management weaknesses were note in particular district in Phu Tho and Bac Giang.



                                                                                                             8

Bank's post reviews have found a number of procedural deviations and non-compliance.
However, these issues have been adequately rectified and/or followed up. Among these
issues, collusion was the most serious one with tens of cases detected by the Bank or by
the Project itself. The Project has investigated these cases and sanctioned more than one
hundred bidders. The strict enforcement of the fiduciary guidelines have allowed the
project to complete both the procurement and financial management satisfactorily.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Satisfactory transition arrangements to post-completion operation of investment have
been adopted. CPMU had issued guidance to the PPMUs on the project assets handover
and overall project liquidation. All activities in 2008 are financed by counterpart funds.
An impact evaluation of the project is expected to be finalized by June 2008.

Lessons learnt from NMPRP are likely to support the design and implementation of the
Program 135 second phase (P135-2)                      15  and scale up institutional innovations at the policy
level, in particular in reference to (a) improved poverty targeting of program resource
allocation         (pro-poor        criteria       for      villages        selection,       pro-poor       orientation          of
production/livelihood support, resource allocation for operation and maintenance of
small-scale infrastructure, etc); (b) deepening and scaling-up of community-driven
approaches for planning, managing, operating and maintaining basic rural infrastructure
(including informed public participation in program planning, devolution of investment
ownership, local institutional capacity building support); (c) enhanced fiduciary
transparency and accountability in program implementation through wider use of social
audit approaches (including procurement of small-scale infrastructure, improved public
financial management and community contribution); and (d) process monitoring and
impact evaluation.

At the mid-term Consultative Group meeting 2008, organized in Sa Pa, Lao Cai province,
the Minister of Planning and Investment of Vietnam and the Vice President of the World
Bank have agreed in principle on the necessity to invest more in the northern mountain
provinces. The government has officially requested IDA management on June 13, 2008
to provide additional financing and/or continue the next phase of this project. Discussions
have taken place amongst line ministries on necessary procedures to implement this
request. Per the successful implementation of this project, World Bank management is
considering to provide additional financing.

   The re-designed Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and
Mountainous Areas (2006-2010), known more familiarly in Vietnam as Program 135, Phase 2 (P135-2), one of Vietnam's principal
National Target Programs (NTP) for poverty reduction., will be reinforced by a first credit in a programmatic series of three which
would support policy and institutional actions. Critical aspects of this reform agenda have already been demonstrated at scale under
ongoing IDA- and other ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam covering at least a half of all the provinces, districts and communes
targeted for inclusion in P135.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of NMPRP have been highly relevant to both
the Government and the Bank's strategies. The development objectives were consistent
with the CAS and the Government priorities for poverty reduction and decentralized rural
development. In terms of operational modalities of decentralized rural development, the
formation and support of CDBs was consistent with Government policies. Besides, the
subprojects investments supported by NMPRP were consistent with the priorities
identified by beneficiary communes themselves and projects implemented by other
government and donor-funded development initiatives.

The NMPRP was designed and implemented to support the Government's efforts to
maintain growth with equity, and to help address the widening differences in the rates of
economic development between urban and rural areas. It was part of the Government's
overall program for poverty reduction in the remote and difficult mountainous areas,
which includes the majority of Vietnam's poorest rural communes by enhancing the
provision of public infrastructure and basic social services and boosting local incomes. In
addition, the NMPRP has introduced a participatory approach that was strongly in line
with the steps in the Grassroots Democracy legislation of the Government and which
supported the decentralized implementation arrangements of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project has fully achieved its two development objectives.

(i) The first objective that poor villagers in the northern mountains use a variety of
improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services has been fully achieved.

The project provided increased access to and use of transport, market and water services.
The NMPRP directly improved all year access to 356 communes and around 61,000
households. 80 % of communes benefited from improved irrigation system (18,925 ha of
land)16 and commune health stations were built and provide improved commune health
stations for 75,000 households while 47,000 households were benefiting from improved
village primary school classrooms. All health and education infrastructures seemed to be
properly staffed and likely to be maintained in service17. The NMPRP has successfully
concentrated investments on the smaller commune-to-village and inter-village roads, thus
providing improved access for many remote communities in the project area. This is in
addition to the considerable number of village paths and roads and small bridges that

have been upgraded through the CDBC sub-projects. The project has added value to the
overall program to improve access to and the quality of education for the beneficiaries by
concentrating investments on smaller schools infrastructure, including village primary
classrooms, kindergartens and teacher accommodation and thus successfully
complemented other projects and programs investing in schools infrastructure in the
project area (such as the Concretization of Schools Program and Program 135).

The changes in service quality as assessed by villagers and user-groups is also
significant and the objective fully achieved. According to the beneficiary opinion survey,
100% of beneficiaries were either "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with the quality of
school and teaching, and the quality of health stations. t is hard however to attribute these
changes to the project alone since in several places visited, other programs (P135, ) and
projects (Chia Se- SIDA, PEDC ­ WB, etc) were doing similar investments or financed
infrastructure which had also an impact on the quality of services (schools, electrification,
roads, water work...)

Improvements in agricultural livelihoods as assessed by villagers are significant.
Although it is hard to solely attribute this achievement to the project alone, this objective
has been fully achieved. According to the project data, the average income per household
in the project area has progressed from VND 4,300,000 in 2001 to VND 10,600,000 in
2007 along with an increase of average food income per person from 272 kg/person in
2001 against 364kg/person in 2006. About 80% of the project participants rated the
Agriculture Applied Demonstration satisfactory (3,481 AADs with 54 different types of
models, total beneficiaries are about 86,000 households, in which 83% are poor
households). Five of six provinces carried out on-site research activities which focused
on practical topics such as maize, rice, and chicken variety, etc. Through research, the
crops and animal varieties suitable for the local conditions are more widely adopted. It is
expected that the follow up of those models will be continued under P13518.

(ii) The second objective of increasing the institutional capacity of upland communes and
districts has been achieved.

Decentralized, participatory poverty-focused rural development approaches were
successfully introduced to enable poor villagers in the northern mountains to use a variety
of improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services. 6 cycles of sub-projects
under the Community Development Budget were successfully implemented in 356
communes which contributed to build up the institutional capacity of upland communes
and districts. MPI (at all levels: central, province and district) gained a strong experience
in managing such program for formulating and carrying out participatory local
development activities, which were systematically documented and disseminated. 16,980
commune and district cadres were trained and 100% of project communes implemented
CDBC (356 communes), and become Investments Owners.100% Survey at the end of
project showed that 46% of communes can implement CDBC as Investment Owners

effectively by themselves, 28 % can do that with minimal support, and the rest need
higher level of support from district and Community Facilitator.

3.3 Efficiency

Net present value/economic rate of return: No economic analysis of the project or any
of its components or activities was attempted during appraisal and no economic analysis
was done as part of the ICR since there was not an adequate baseline available. An
impact assessment study is currently being carried out but final results were not available
for the ICR. Based on the preliminary findings of the impact assessment which
recognizes the difficulty of evaluating the overall impact of NMPRP due to the fungible
nature of the supported investments (how to "extract" NMPRP direct and indirect
impacts on the improvements of household living standard and commune development
and how to attribute them to NMPRP solely), "the econometric results from the impact
evaluation show that there are clear signals of improvements in livelihood of households
in the NMPRP communes after implementation of NMPRP" .19

The scope of investment cover small infrastructure, agriculture related training and health
and education. The subprojects chosen by villagers were local infrastructure projects,
including rehabilitation of rural roads, foot paths and related infrastructures (bridges,
culverts), construction of markets and rehabilitation of irrigation schemes. The principal
economic benefits of the projects resulted from: (i) the rehabilitation/construction of rural
transportation infrastructure and the subsequent savings in vehicle operating costs, travel
time and travel costs, increased access to employment (higher wages and earnings) and
business opportunities (higher prices for crops and increased total revenues); (ii) the
rehabilitation and construction of communal irrigation schemes that increased yields,
irrigated area and cropping intensity; (iii) improvements in the supply of potable waters
and sanitation, resulting in time savings from water collection and reduced incidence of
water borne illnesses, (iv) training in new models and agriculture technology to provide
livelihood support services that are more market oriented, pro-poor and sustainable and
(v) higher school enrollment and better basic health care (through information and village
health worker) providing better employment opportunities and improving livelihood
resilience and diversification. In addition, investments to support local communities
other institutional capacity building, as well as to strengthen decentralized and
community based decision making should facilitate better implementation of rural
development programs ( P135, etc), help foster creation of social capital and strengthen
the staff skills of implementing agencies at the local level.

At the time of the ICR and as part of project M&E no economic analysis was done to
quantify or value these impacts. However, information on subprojects beneficiaries'
perception of benefits was collected and systematically presented.                                               Subproject
beneficiaries recognized these important and visible benefits. Evidence of these good

ratings of subprojects benefits are found in the subprojects M&E reports, draft impact
evaluation and were confirmed to the ICR team in random visits and group discussion..

Financial rate of return: No financial analysis of the projects or any of its components
or activities was carried out during appraisal. As the menu of subprojects was large and
there was no support under the project given to micro-enterprise or other income
generating activities, a financial analysis was deemed not applicable.

Cost effectiveness: Engineering and participation surveys20 conducted on a sample of
completed infrastructure subprojects under NMPRP (with a small number of P135 Phase
1 subprojects for purposes of comparison) found slightly higher cost effectiveness under
NMPRP subprojects compared to P135 subproject, primarily owing to higher levels of
participation to supervision and more transparent procurement. The same study also
assessed "value for money" by comparing construction costs against planned budgets and
quantities, as well as comparing NMPRP structures against other projects. The study
found that costs are acceptable and in line with other projects although there was a
tendency to cap the contract values at amounts below the engineer's estimates to secure
the approval of province and district treasuries because feasibility studies were
sometimes interpreted as "cost ceiling", even if schemes were implemented several years
after the feasibility studies and construction costs had risen.21

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: satisfactory.

The project achieved its primary objectives by enabling poor villagers in the northern
mountains to use a variety of improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services,
and increasing the institutional capacity of upland communes and districts.

NMPRP has been successful in delivering a large number of small-scale commune and
village civil works that contributed substantially and significantly to the overall provision
of economic an social infrastructure across the 3,516 villages in the project area. 4,320
civil works on roads and bridges (45%), irrigation (24%), schools (18%), water supply
(9%) and commune health stations & markets (4%) were delivered by PPMUs and
DPMUs, reinforced by 20,500 sub-projects under the CDBC (80% community
infrastructure and the rest consisting mainly of production and house living conditions
supports). This was combined with a series of improved social services and training
(such as the 3,481 Agriculture Applied Demonstrations benefiting 86,000 households).

The decentralized implementation approach with the preparation of multi-year
development plans involved an intensive participatory planning process which has

increased local capacity for investment ownership and management by putting resources
and decision-making responsibilities into the hands of local government authorities and
local communities22. The Commune Investment plans have been largely implemented.
This participatory approach extended across the full `project and investment cycle' from
planning and selection of sub-projects, community supervision of investment activities,
community participation in implementing sub-projects, and in management, operations
and maintenance.

NMPRP had quality at entry problems (M&E and PDO indicators) and implementation
delays during the first 2 years. However, the project was pro-active in managing those
issues. Following the MTR in 2004, the M&E was greatly improved and management
responsibilities and procurement procedures clarified and streamlined while weak
institutional capacity was addressed through an improved capacity building plan and
better coordination.

The one areas of shortcoming was still weak current operations and maintenance systems
of public works. Although subprojects were completed in satisfactory technical standard
in most villages and O&M mechanisms were organized in participatory communes and
villages before the subproject investments, several subprojects visited by the ICR mission
were receiving limited maintenance by communities and only through additional labor
contribution. This situation is still wide spread in Vietnam beyond this project mainly due
to a shortage of local government finance for the O&M. Lessons from NMPRP in this
respect have positively influenced the design of P135-2 support which is addressing this
issue at the broader policy level. The Ministry of Finance is expected to increase
earmarked budget allocations for O&M to poor communes as a result of the project and
P135-2.     23



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

At the beginning of the project the national poverty rate was about 39% and the per capita
annual GDP of only US$ 360. The northern mountains were and remain the poorest
section of the country. It was decided that the project would focus on about 400 poorest
communes in the 6 provinces. A Social and economic assessment24 "was prepared to
inform the project design and recommended the implementation of specific poverty
targeting and resource allocation mechanisms to ensure that remote villages and the
poorest groups within them were reached by project investments.                          Community
assessments and development plans were prepared in that respect. All reports show that
the targeting was satisfactory.                   83.7% of the beneficiaries of Applied Agricultural
Demonstrations were below the national poverty line and 98% of villages in the project
areas have received sub-projects through the CDBC.



22
   The average fund allocation per commune was about VND 3.274 billion (US$ 205,000).

It is difficult yet to link the achievements to broader sector indicators such as poverty
rates reduction for project areas and ethnic groups given the integrated nature of the
investments25. The PDO had deliberately not included reference to `poverty reduction',
since this was considered a higher-order, CAS-level goal.

The 2003-06 CAS completion Report assesses the bank assistance to Vietnam to have
achieved solid impact on poverty across the program. It is recognized in the CAS and
also through various reports produced by the PPMUs and CPMUs that NMPRP has made
an important contribution to poverty reduction in Vietnam northern mountains areas (and
wider, owing to the demonstration effect of a number of its innovations)26.

Poverty in the North East Region (which includes Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Phu Tho and Bac
Giang provinces) has been steadily reducing over the last decade from 86% in 1993 to
25% in 2006. The North West Region (including Son La and Hoa Binh provinces) has
seen a slower overall rate of reduction (from 81% in 1993 to 49% in 2006) and this
remains the poorest region in the country. Although there significant variations in poverty
within these regions and provinces according to both location and ethnic characteristics,
evidence of poverty reduction can be found below:

Distribution of benefits by gender seems satisfactory although limited data was available
to disaggregate by gender the beneficiaries of the investments or their participation paid
labor opportunities provided to local people by the civil works constructions. Women
were the main beneficiaries of the rural health component, which focused on basic health
training and lowering maternal mortality rates. Most of the investments benefited equally
men and women and that participation to village meetings seemed to be gender balanced
(the rate of attendance by women in village meetings was between 45-67%). However,
despite those results and several supervision missions' recommendations, women

   The likely impact of the project on poverty has been made more difficult to assess also because of (a) the change in 2005 of the
official Poverty Line used by the Government of Vietnam during the project period to more accurately reflect international standards;
and (b) the influence of Vietnam broad based growth from 2001-06 which has largely contributed to Vietnam's remarkable record in
poverty reduction (although these impressive achievements were much slower for ethnic minorities and remote regions).


26
   This was confirmed in the draft impact study done by the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) in May 2008.

remained underrepresented in decision making bodies such as the Commune
Development Boards and Commune Supervision Boards.28

Finally, the project closely monitored management and implementation capacity to link
the experience gained under the project to national policy forums such as the
Government/Donor/NGO Poverty Working Group to help improve the Government's
ability to measure poverty objectively and consistently.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The objective of increasing the institutional capacity at the province, district and
commune level has been fully achieved.

The province, district and commune management capacity was greatly improved because
of project mechanisms (decentralization of management and financing) and capacity
building activities.               While the decentralized approach has improved the level of
ownership and commitment by enhancing the efficiency of the service delivery to
communes and communities, substantial progress was made in developing province,
district and commune staff's capacity using training curricula which were fully integrated
into Province Training Schools curricula. Over a period of 5 years, the project provided
training for more than 16,900 commune and village staff, in which 76% were ethnic
minority people, 14.5% were women, and on average, about 47 people were trained per
commune.

A key factor which contributed to the effectiveness and high level of ownership from
beneficiaries of NMPRP has been the creation of well defined guidelines for capacity
building at commune level while paying close attention to strengthening district and
provincial authorities and provincial training institutions. This helped to develop a
mechanism for systematic and comprehensive training at local levels through appropriate
communication media and in ethnic minority languages (Hmong, Thai, Tay and Dao).29

Overall, NMPRP reinforced the institutional capacity of the government agencies. MPI
has been a strong partner for the project, committed and well placed to coordinate the
various components between the different levels of local governments and agencies.
During the preparation period, project management, implementation guidelines and
legislative documents were actively prepared to formulate a framework for
decentralization.30.



28There are several reasons for this: firstly, the project decided to reinforce existing institutions and the village leaders and the
commune authorities which composed the CDB and CSB were largely male (with only the Women's Union representative and in
some cases the commune accountant being women); secondly, given the high number of villages in the communes of the northern
mountain area, enforcing gender parity for village representatives in CDB would have created too large and unmanageable decision
bodies; and finally language barriers continue to prevent many ethnic minority women in particular from attending and fully
benefiting from training courses related to CDBC. However, despite those difficulties, it is notable that the proportion of female
trainees has increased in recent courses on the CBDC in 2006 (26.5% women) and on state management in 2007 (24% women).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Although this is a "core" as opposed to an "intensive learning" ICR, significant fieldwork
and consultations were conducted for the ICR mission. A summary of the findings is
presented in the Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: moderate.

The 3 main identified risks for the development outcomes were: (a) the scope of the
operation and maintenance needed for the infrastructure built by the project; (b) the
discontinuation of the budgetary support and the articulation with the fiscal
decentralization framework; and (c) the level and quality of the knowledge transfer
between Government agencies.

Operations and Maintenance: The scope of necessary O&M for the investment remains a
challenge. NMPRP has integrated O&M procedures in the design of all the investments
supported by the project (infrastructure and CDBC) by which villagers and communes
are responsible for sections of the investments maintenance. Routine maintenance is
being done in places where districts have sufficient funds and local people can afford to
contribute, but poorer and more remote districts faces greater challenges. Local
communities are expected to contribute considerable labor input to maintain roads but
this is rarely sufficient to ensure routine maintenance. This issue is reinforced by the lack
of periodic maintenance finance to fund re-gravelling and other extensive repairs that are
beyond the capacity of local communities and commune staff.                                      Since most of the
communes are located in very remote areas, O&M cost associated to some local
investments are often beyond the capacity of local communities and authorities alone.
This situation had some regressive consequences when poorer areas and communities
have to pay larger amounts given the higher costs of basic infrastructure provision and
maintenance in remote mountainous areas.                          The key constraint to the provision of
maintenance funding is the lack of recurrent transport budgets. This is a policy issue
shared by different CDD projects in Vietnam and has implications on how the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) establishes levels of intergovernmental budgetary transfer.




People's Committees have also issued decisions and more detailed guidelines as a basis for management decentralization in their
locality.




                                                                                                                           17

Discontinuation of budgetary support for communes and decentralization: The strategy
to address those issues are being followed by this project by a policy based (DPL)
operation (P135-2 Support Operation, Credit 4274-VN, approved on March 21, 2007)
which is more likely to take these agendas in the appropriate broader programmatic
context. Some delays are seen between the NMPRP closing and the launch of commune
budgetary support through the P 135. It is still challenging for communes to fully utilize
their newly acquired skills and replicate the mechanisms and procedures promoted by the
NMPRP under P 135, which would lead broader policy decision on decentralization.
This is likely to take several years to unfold and therefore it is difficult to assess the full
extend of the policy outcome at this stage as the process of the fiscal decentralization
(budget transfer to commune and local resource mobilization by commune) is still on-
going.   To contribute to this policy reforms, the project consciously tested approaches
demonstrating the need for such changes through constant institutional dialogue,
documentation of lessons learnt and close coordination for the follow-up program. About
98% of the NMPRP communes were included in the first phase of Program 135 (1998 to
2005) while 72% are included in the second phase of this Program 135-2 (from 2006 to
2010). Some of the NMPRP's communes have become investment owner under P135
and more are expected to become in the near future. The Government procurement laws
and procedures under P135, benefitted from the lessons from NMPRP such as
competitive bidding and community procurement. Since, the current capacity of
commune to generate local resources is still low and it is likely that communes will
remain dependent on central budgetary transfers in the medium term.

Institutional knowledge transfer: The NMPRP has generated many lessons for poverty
reduction investments through community empowerment and participation. These lessons,
as detailed under Section 6 below, include good practices of capacity building, tailored
public information and awareness, transparent community participation procurement
methods, limited operations and maintenance mechanism, functioning monitoring and
evaluation system, and strong institutional reforms and decentralization. These lessons
have strong impacts on the process of re-designing the Program 135-2. This operation
now includes an more substantial component on pro-poor production support and rural
livelihoods, a nationwide capacity building component for local cadres and people, more
competitive and transparent procurement mechanism, better coordinated M&E system.
The Policy Reform Framework for P135-2 has factored these concrete contributions from
NMRPP and other similar practices in the Program's policy actions. The sustainability
aspect of NMPRP's impacts has therefore been firmly set on and mainstreamed into one
of the biggest national targeted programs of the Government.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rated: Satisfactory

The project design provided a suitable response to the complexity of development
problems to be addressed in the contest of Northern Mountain Areas of rural Vietnam in


                                                                                            18

the early 2000's. Decentralized participatory planning and implementation process
piloted also proved to be effective. However, some design aspects such as technical
assistance, decentralized funds flow arrangements and clear procurement procedures
should have been in place before the Credit effectiveness. The bank performance for the
fiduciary and safeguard aspects as well as the risks assessment were satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rated: Satisfactory

The Bank team gave adequate support to project implementation. A total of 10 full
supervision missions were carried out during the 60 month implementation period,
supplemented by other short visits. Supervision included visits to participating provinces
to check on field implementation and included supervision of the fiduciary and safeguard
aspects. Throughout implementation, the Bank Team, together with partners, helped the
implementing agency to overcome the initial delays and other issues and to draw out
lessons learned during implementation by providing a strong focus on M&E and
measuring results/ outcome. The decisions taken during the MTR in 2004 and
implemented in the subsequent supervision mission greatly helped the implementation of
the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rated: Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rated: Satisfactory

The MPI worked closely with the Bank in the project design. The government made
available sufficient counterpart funds for the project on time. The MPI has demonstrated
a strong ownership and leadership during the entire project cycle. Central and local
government made efforts to ensure that CPMU, PPMU and DPMU were financed and
fully staffed and were operating effectively throughout the project. They have also played
an important role in coordination of critical issues to allow the project successfully
implemented.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rated: Satisfactory.

This was the first project in Vietnam with a decentralized project management units in all
the project provinces and districts. The project managers and staffs were dedicated and
hard working and performed very well in the decentralized institutional arrangement.
They showed strong commitment and dedication to poverty alleviation and their initiative,
determination and hard work as well as their flexibility and ability to learn from
experience were critical for steering the project.        The procurement and financial
management aspects of the project were very well implemented. The CPMU provided
project management reports, audit reports and necessary project information on a timely



                                                                                       19

basis. MPI has implemented adequate transition arrangement for regular operation of
supported activities.

6. Lessons Learned

NMPRP provides a number of lessons on how to foster informed participation and local
development at community level in targeted public investment project:

    · Adequate institutional capacity building and tailored assistance for effective
       local organizations at commune level are key factors for strong ownership
       and the quality of the service delivery. Local institutions such as commune
       Development Boards and Community Supervision Boards when properly trained
       and staffed are important catalyst of local intervention. Support capacity from the
       district level is critical factor in facilitating the effective transfer of investment
       ownership to communes. NMPRP has reinforced in an integrated manner the
       capacity of those institutional sublevels (commune, district, and province) at local
       level which has been critical for delivering pro-poor outcomes from development
       intervention. Targeted practical and systematic training at commune level (CDB
       and CSB members) provided a capacity growth path for the local stakeholders.
       The Commune Facilitator played a key role in reinforcing the institutional
       linkages and information dissemination between villages, communes and district
       while providing some technical support to CDB. After few subprojects cycles,
       reinforced communes and districts seem to be confident of their gained capacity.
    · Tailored public information and awareness rising are essential for
       community participation, accountability and investments ownership:
       NMPRP managed to develop an effective communication strategy up to the
       commune level. Efforts were made to reach vulnerable groups including non
       literate people at village's levels but results seemed to vary between communes.
       Information must be tailored as appropriate to diverse target groups and audiences
       with different backgrounds in terms of ethnicity, age, gender and social status. A
       variety of communication media should be employed.
    · Transparent, competitive and decentralized procurement methods are most
       likely to provide assurance of cost effectiveness and efficiency for small scale
       infrastructure component at local levels. This includes social audit function of
       community level oversight over procurement decisions, etc. For very small, labor
       intensive works at village level for which locally available materials and skills are
       required, community participation in procurement helps build local capacity,
       creates employment and reduces costs.



                                                                                          20

    · Operation and maintenance financing at local levels could be more
       challenging than anticipated. Careful consideration of the required level of
       central contribution to O&M is essential since the cost of O&M in remote areas
       can easily be beyond the local capacity of local governments and communities
       alone. Local contributions can increase the ownership of infrastructure by local
       people however mobilization of contributions from local communities had a
       significant negative influence in terms of delaying construction progress. The
       NMPRP communes were all poor communes, and the requirement for community
       contributions also placed a heavy burden on these communities. In addition, poor
       commune authorities and local communities cannot realistically cover all the costs
       for O&M. Sustainable financing for O&M requires also increased resources from
       central budget transfers earmarked for this purpose to provinces (who will pass
       down to districts and communes) for public infrastructure to complement
       commune resources and local contributions.
    · Financial management mechanisms, M&E and reporting lines and
       responsibilities should be defined prior to start up of implementation for all
       local development projects when they involve multi sectors and multi-
       agencies. To help reduce the risk of resource leakage, a system of regular
       reconciliation of project expenditure accounts between spending units and both
       MOF and state treasury systems are critical is critical for financial management.
       M&E should be integrated in Government`s regular M&E and reporting
       mechanisms to reinforce the institutional capacity and contribute to policy
       dialogue.
    · Strong institutional reform and leadership of the coordinating agency is
       essential to project success and sustainability. The strong ownership and
       coordinating leadership of the MPI has enabled a series of institutional and
       regular reforms (circulars, staff commitment and capacity building) which greatly
       influenced the project performance. Coordination between institutional actors,
       information dissemination and program management capacity is a key factor for
       the success of integrated, sustainable local development programs.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
No issues were raised by the borrower and implementing agencies.

(b) Co-financiers

NMPRP broadly supported DFID's Country Assistant Program (CAP) objectives.
According to DFID's own independent assessment, the capacity-building efforts and
good coordination at all levels were effective as demonstrated by a high quality of
progress reports. Although, good results were noticed on physical implementation and
capacity building, the assessment highlighted the issue of insufficient O&M as a broader
issue for all infrastructures in Vietnam. Lessons from NMPRP have contributed to
DFID's broader sectors work which led to co-financing under the Rural Transport 3 and
P135-2 operations. The quality of civil works under CDBC has made positive impacts on



                                                                                      21

community capacity and work quality. Overall, CDBC proved to be successful pilot in
empowering and decentralization of decision making and accountability to communes.

DFID noted that despite the weak inter ministerial coordination and cooperation between
the MPI and CEM, the project was able to institutionalize good practices and generate
innovations of the project, and donor partners have been very proactive in making this
happen both formally and informally. DFID acknowledged that NMPRP directly
contributed to the development outcomes of CAP objective 2 "to improve the quality and
inclusiveness of services for the poor and vulnerable" by supporting key institutional and
policies improvements for better targeting, pro-poor resources allocation, decentralization
of investment ownership to communes, livelihoods development, and encouraging
competitive community participation in procurement and M&E.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g., NGOs/private sector/civil society)

From 2005 to 2007, M&E support services were provided under a `draw-down' contract
basis with a consultant company (Mekong Economics) providing support for the M&E,
helping to trouble shoot problems in the MIS such as identifying critical data gaps and
reviewing data consistency, piloting and demonstrating new methods for M&E such as
participatory assessment methods, data analysis and visualization, undertaking
preliminary impact studies in 6 communes etc. One of the most important inputs from
Mekong Economics has been assisting the CPMU in preparing guidelines for the
Province Progress Reports and the Province Project Completion Reports and facilitating a
series of province training workshops was held on M&E methods and province progress
report guidelines. No major issues were raised by Mekong Economics which underlined
the difficulty in the launch of the initial baseline, the success of the M&E support and the
high complexity of the MIS.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

No survey was done in a systematic manner however the ICR mission met with

                                                                                  32

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The mission spent 10 days in the field, travelled to Lao Cai, Son La and Hoa Binh
provinces to visit a sample of 6 districts and 12 communes. Several workshops with
PPMUs and DPMUs were conducted to discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of the
capacity building, implementation mechanisms, ownership and participation, targeting
and benefits, management and sustainability of the project.

Based on those consultations, the project is seen to have many strengths, including: the
strong focus on poverty reduction and community participation; the wide geographical
coverage and its comprehensive nature (including infrastructure and software
components); NMPR provided opportunities for province and district staff to improve
their management skills; the transparent procurement and bidding regulations that
contributed to higher quality civil works; the decentralized management system was
highly appreciated; and the funds to finance the activities were available timely.

Set against this, however, some critical perceived weaknesses of the project and
difficulties encountered by local management staff in implementing activities were
identified especially at project's start such as: the complicated and administratively time-
consuming project procedures especially for procurement and disbursement; the slow
implementation of the Capacity Building Plan and a lack of training in some critical
topics at project start; a lack of clear guidelines and slow introduction of some
components; staffing constraints including limited incentives for either government or
contract staff to work on the project; delayed procurement of vehicles; slow screening
and approval of plans by higher authorities; and issues related to counterpart fund
allocations. Several interviewees regretted the interruption of the project now their
capacity is built to deliver services through the mechanisms designed by the project and
are looking forward for the continuation of their newly acquired skills under P135.2.

1. Project Context, Development Objective and Design
The Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (2002 to 2007) is one of two World Bank
financed projects in Vietnam that adopt a Community Driven Development (CDD) approach and
which aim to achieve accelerated rural development and targeted poverty reduction in some of the
poorest rural areas of the country31. These projects were designed and introduced to support the
Government's overall program for poverty reduction in the remote and difficult mountainous
areas, which include the majority of Vietnam's poorest rural communes. This is in order to
enhance the provision of public infrastructure and basic social services and to boost local incomes.
The decentralized implementation approach of the project aims to increase local capacity for
investment ownership and management by putting resources and decision-making responsibilities
into the hands of local government authorities and local communities.

    Project area and main beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries include poor ethnic minority communities as well as local government
authorities that have received capacity building support. The project area includes 356 rural
communes (about 3,500 villages) in 44 districts in 6 provinces ­ Lao Cai, Son La, Yen Bai, Hoa
Binh, Phu Tho and Bac Giang provinces, with a population of just over one million, including
approximately 980,000 ethnic minority people (86% of the project beneficiaries). The project area
is characterized by a high degree of ethnic diversity. A majority of communes included in the
NMPRP were classified as communes facing special difficulties in mountainous and ethnic
minority areas . Of the 356 communes in the NMPRP, 98% were also included in Phase One of
                   32

Program 135 (1998 to 2005) while 72% are included in the second phase of this program (from



31The other project being the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP) that works in 13 provinces of the
central regions of the country.

32Decision No.42/UB-QD (dated 23 / 05 / 1997) of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas on the
Identification of Three Zones in Upland and Mountain Areas.




                                                                                                                34

2006 to 2010). It is intended that lessons and experience from NMPRP should be of particular
relevance to on-going implementation of the Government poverty reduction programs in these
mountainous and ethnic minority areas.

     Project Development Objective and key performance indicators
The Development Objective of NMPRP is that poor villagers in the northern mountains use a
variety of improved and sustainable infrastructure and social services and the institutional
capacity of upland communes and districts is increased. Key Outcome and Performance
Indicators related to the development objective are:
1. Access to and use of transport, market, water, health & education infrastructure and services;
2. Changes in service quality as assessed by villagers and user-groups;
3. Sustainability of operations and maintenance systems;
4. Improvements in district and commune management capacity;
5. Improvements in agricultural livelihoods as assessed by villagers;
6. Selected indicators of agricultural production and health and education attainment.

     Project Components
The project includes six Components, as follows:
Component 1: Rural Roads and Markets.
Component 2: Agriculture, Irrigation and Domestic Water Supply.
Component 3: Health and Education.
Component 4: Commune Development Budget Component (CDBC).
Component 5: Institutional Capacity Building.
Component 6: Project Management.

The structure of the project components was not revised during implementation. The overall fund
allocation to each commune was based on community assessment and sub-project identification
exercises carried out in all project communes during project preparation (Commune Standard
Documents). This included preparation of multi-year development plans with indicative
investment activities and amounts for the Main Project Components. The actual commune
investment was from VND 652 million (US$ 40,750) to VND 13.277 billion (US$ 829,813) with
an average of VND 5.559 billion (US$ 347,348).

     Significant changes during implementation
Two amendments to the Development Credit Agreement were approved in December 2004 and
April 2007 to allow for an adjustment in fund allocation between expenditure categories. These
amendments did not alter the overall allocation of resources to the different project components.
For a majority of major civil works, the cost estimates made during project preparation had to be
revised mainly because of the inflation in construction costs between the time cost-estimates were
made (project preparation) and their implementation several years later. The difference was
largely covered by the increased IDA loan availability (resulting from changes in the SDR /
US$ exchange rate) and in some categories by reducing the number of implemented works. The
project originally covered 368 communes33.




33
    Project activities were discontinued(although a number of civil works had been implemented) in 12 communes in Than Uyen
District of Lao Cai when this district joined Lai Chau Province,




                                                                                                                           35

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project preparation and design
Due to the comparatively small size and large number of sub-projects under NMPRP, it was
decided that approval would be given to the overall Province Feasibility Reports. Separate
Investment Reports were not be required for subsequent approval of each sub-project. As project
start-up was expected to be slow, a Pilot Commune Program34 was designed to accelerate and
gain implementation experience.

A fundamental principle of the project design was to decentralize the responsibilities for decision-
making, project planning and implementation through the province to district and commune
levels. The NMPRP is one of two projects in the rural development portfolio of the World Bank
in Vietnam adopting a `decentralized' model of direct disbursement to province level. The IDA
funds are disbursed to seven Special Accounts (SA): one under the CPMU and six Province
Special Accounts managed by the PPMUs (with an additional SA under CPMU for the DFID
Grant). Fund flow from the Province SA is made to District `Second-generation' Project
Accounts and through these to separate Commune sub-accounts for the Commune Development
Budget Component (CDBC), held in the district branch of Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development.          The districts were the investment owners of the majority of small-scale
infrastructure works, the communes for the CDBC, and the PPMUs for a limited number of larger
works and service contracts.

In the preparation and start-up period of NMPRP, project management and implementation
guidelines and legislative documents were actively prepared to formulate a framework for
decentralization. This was successfully realized in the promulgation of Circulars guiding project
financial management for NMPRP and for the CDBC by the Ministry of Finance (Circular No.
52/2002/TT-TTC -28/06/2002- and Circular No. 90/2003/TT-24/09/2003)..

    Project implementation
Overall progress in terms of financial disbursement and the implementation of investment
activities on the ground has been satisfactory. Disbursement from IDA to 30/11/2007 has reached
US$ 122.788 million, representing 112% of the original project costs of US$ 110 million. The
disbursement in SDR has reached SDR 83.012 million by 30/11/2007, representing 94.4% of the
original loan amount (SDR 87.9 million). Disbursement under the DFID Grant has reached
US$ 7.251 million, representing 85.3% of the original grant amount of US$ 8.5 million. The total
disbursement including the IDA credit and DFID Grant is US$ 130.039 million.

The progress was slow at the beginning and met with some difficulties in Project Year 1 and 2
(2002 to 2003). By the 4th World Bank's Supervision Mission in November 2003, disbursement
from IDA had only reached 7.45% (US$ 8.2 million). The slow initial disbursement was
primarily due to the learning curve difficulty met by all PMUs regarding the procedures for the
preparation of procurement plans and regulations, prior review and reporting requirements etc.

In response, actions were taken by the National Project Steering Committee to clarify
management responsibilities and to streamline the implementation procedures. It included:



34
  There were 10 pilot communes in 5 provinces, 2 funded by DANIDA in Son La (TF-21338); 6 by Japan in Bac Giang, Phu Tho
and Hoa Binh (TF-26559) and 2 by DFID in Lao Cai (TF-50001).




                                                                                                                       36

· Clarifying the respective responsibilities of the CPMU, the PPMUs and the World Bank in
    processing Procurement Plans under the Province Special Accounts..
· Resolving bottlenecks in the procurement process for design and construction contracts for
    civil works. The delays in the civil works procurement process were due to: (i) the large
    number of planned civil works, limitations on PMU staff time and a lack of experience in the
    procurement procedures; (ii) difficulties in the coordination and synchronization between
    government procedures and project procedures; (iii) insufficient allocation or delays in
    counterpart funds in some provinces (Son La and Phu Tho). Quicker delegation of
    responsibilities for managing civil works procurement to the DPMUs; provision of more
    intensive training for PPMU & DPMU staff in procurement procedures and sufficient and
    timely allocation of counterpart funds helped to resolve this situation.
· Improving the effectiveness and speeding-up implementation of the Institutional Capacity
    Building Plan (with DFID co-financing). A detailed Training Plan was prepared by the
    CPMU and this was approved by the World Bank and DFID in October 2003..
· Bringing forward the Mid-Term Review from the planned date (October 2005) to April 2004.

From 2004 onwards progress improved considerably and the annual disbursement from IDA has
matched or exceeded the expected annual amount. The completion of the project according to the
scheduled Closing Date of 31 December 2007 is a significant achievement ­ especially given the
strongly decentralized management and implementation arrangements. The NMPRP has 407
active management and disbursement units (the CPMU, 6 PPMUs, 44 DPMUs and 356
communes for the CDBC).

    Key lessons learnt from NMPRP implementation
Decentralization: Strongly decentralized management responsibilities and powers to province,
district and commune levels has increased their accountability, ownership and creativity.
Commune level investment ownership based on rational assessments of local capacity building
needs and proper mentoring (facilitation staff for "weaker" communes) was the right step towards
the decentralization goal. The `decentralised' Special Account system down to district level had
a positive impact on the disbursement process. The appropriate levels at which different types of
procurement should be best managed according to the scale of investment activity had to be
clearly defined. Competitive procurement procedures applied to all investment activities
including civil works, goods, consultancies, training, CDBC (no appointed bidding), have assured
the quality of construction schemes and provided some investments' savings ( 7.3% savings rate -
126 billion VND- from 2400 bidding packages) .

Participation: Effective awareness raising and public information and dissemination through
different communication channels given to relevant agencies and local people, especially ethnic
minorities have reinforced the democratic planning processes carried out from village level and
have encouraged participation.        Community supervision of construction and O&M of
infrastructure works have been carried out for all individual village schemes to ensure their
sustained quality and increase local awareness of their ownership rights over the investments.

Strong coordination and commitment: Good directions and coordination between authorities
and agencies at all levels and the availability of adequate and committed staff (full time and
capable cadres) have been essential to the project's success. Institutionalized guidelines and
regulations on financial management and procurement were successfully harmonized between
Government and World Bank procedures and bi-annual joint supervision missions for NMPRP
were organised by World Bank and DFID to give opportunities for discussion between donors
and PMUs at all levels which facilitated prompt improvements in the project implementation.



                                                                                              37

Capacity building: The provision of one-step-in-advance training for different levels (PMUs and
CDB) in procurement, financial management and liquidation procedures, was followed by
refresher training and review workshops involving other agencies playing a critical role in
approval procedures and financial management(province & district state treasury, financial and
technical departments) greatly helped the project implementation. Sufficient time and funds must
also be given at the end of the project for lesson learning, documentation and dissemination.

Procurement
The NMPRP has included a large number of procurement contracts for civil works, consultant
services, training and goods under the main project components (in addition to thousands of sub-
projects under the CDBC). Under the main project components, of the total of 2,878 planned
contracts between 2002 and 31/10/2007, 91.7% were completed, 6.3% were signed and 2% have
been rejected. By the project closure date, a majority of outstanding contracts will be completed.
The DPMUs were responsible for the majority of the major civil works procurement, utilizing
both Small Works (SW) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurement methods. The
DPMUs have been responsible for around 85.5% of the civil works contracts, while some of the
larger contracts have been managed by the PPMUs (particularly NCB packages for roads). The
relatively small contract values were appropriate for the capacity of the provinces and private
sector contractors bidding for work. The implementation progress for the civil works was
consistently better than other World Bank projects in Vietnam. The experience from NMPRP
supported the wider introduction of more competitive procurement methods and confirmed that
there are a sufficient number of qualified design and construction companies now operating in
these areas. Provided that adequate training was given in the full range of necessary management
tasks, the districts were fully capable of handling a large and diverse investment portfolio.

Monitoring and evaluation
The project has given considerable attention to introducing the M&E system and this has been
one of the successful aspects of the project. The main lessons and experience from the M&E
system are summarized as follows:

Management Information System (MIS). The computerized MIS was introduced at an early
stage of the project which was a distinct advantage. Work on designing the system began in 2002
and the system was introduced in 2003 and updated in 2004. The computerized MIS linked the
CPMU with the 6 PPMUs and 44 DPMUs. Repeated training for MIS officers was conducted. In
general, the MIS has worked effectively although there have been some difficulties in
maintaining the system and utilizing the data. The MIS was perhaps too ambitious at the outset,
given the DPMU capacity to maintain and use the system and the large range and volume of data
required. Insufficient attention was given at the design stage to what types of data were required
for regular Government reporting purposes and how the MIS could be integrated with the existing
systems. Finally getting the computerized MIS fully operational and functional was very costly.

Independent Monitoring Studies. Those studies were procured from independent consulting
agencies and were designed to assist the project in implementation of different project
components and safeguards policies. The studies focused on tracking `process' and `progress'
monitoring indicators, lesson-learning from the field, identifying constraints and weaknesses and
solutions in the implementation of activities. These repeated studies have proved to be one of the
most useful monitoring instruments in the overall M&E system. A regular system of review
workshops helped to ensure the M&E results and recommendations were fully validated &
accepted and promoted horizontal learning.

M&E support services. During 2006 to 2007, close cooperation has been maintained between
the CPMU and a consultant company (Mekong Economics) for the provision of M&E support
services on a flexible draw-down contract basis. These inputs have been focused on strengthening
capacity for M&E particularly at province level. Procuring M&E support services on a flexible
draw-down contract basis provides more consistent/regular TA over the life of a project.

Impact Evaluation. The base-line survey for the NMPRP Impact Evaluation was conducted in
2004. The project intended to carry-out the Final Impact Evaluation in 2007 to 2008. However,
due to the non availability of project funding after 31/12/2007, the CPMU sent a letter requesting
the World Bank and DFID for an extension to the DFID Grant co-financing to complete this
study but this request was not accepted. The CPMU strongly recommended that an Impact
Evaluation should be conducted to assess the impacts of the capacity building

Community supervision. According to Grassroots Democracy legislation, community
supervision of investment activities is an important element of people's participation to help
ensure transparency and accountability at the local level. Early experience showed that often
these CSB existed on paper but were limited in practice. NMPRP addressed this situation by
providing more intensive training for the Supervision Boards. The training included
organizational aspects, roles and responsibilities, and simple technical skills required to monitor
investments. The CSB members were not only responsible for NMPRP and their training also
benefited other programs investments. Developing and introducing practical participatory
approaches has contributed to new guidelines on community investment supervision35.

3   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Social and economic infrastructure
The project has been successful in delivering a large number of small-scale commune and village
civil works that have contributed substantially to the provision of economic and social
infrastructure. As of 31/10/07, a total of 4,272 civil works have been contracted, representing an
investment of around US$ 96.77 million (VND 1,584 billion). The overall proportion of this
investment in the works categories is the following: roads and bridges (45%), markets (2%),
irrigation (24%), water supply (9%), schools (18%), and commune health stations (2%).

3.1.1 Rural roads, bridges and markets
For roads, the NMPRP has successfully concentrated investments on the smaller commune-to-
village roads (48.5% of the investment / 328 works), inter-village roads (41.5% of investment/
398 works) and district-to-commune road sections (10% of investment/47 works) thus improving
access for many remote communities. 88% of project communes have received investment in
improved rural roads. The project has constructed 95 commune markets, benefiting a population
of 61,000 households. The combined investment in roads, bridges and markets (US$ 44.97
million) represented 132% of the original costs (US$ 34 million including the IDA loan and
GOVERNMENT counterpart funds) and 34.6% of the adjusted IDA loan amount (US$ 130
million).

3.1.2 Irrigation and domestic clean water supply
For irrigation, the project has largely achieved the planned number of works (93% / 1064 works)
and the target for the irrigated area expanded or with improved efficiency (103% / 18,925 ha).
80% of project communes have benefited from improved irrigation under this component (not
including CDBC sub-projects). For water supply, the project has reached around 70% of the
expected target of beneficiary households (32,200 households) including 4,181 wells and 369
piped/gravity fed systems. 61% of project communes have benefited from improved water supply
under this component (not including CDBC sub-projects). The combined investment in irrigation
and water supply (US$ 32.35 million) represented 89.8% of the original indicative costs of the
Agriculture Component (US$ 36 million) and 24.9% of the adjusted loan amount.

3.1.3 Health and education infrastructure
For education, the project has concentrated investments on smaller schools infrastructure,
including village primary classrooms (57% of the investment / 858 works), kindergartens (20.4%
of investment / 428 works), and teacher's accommodation (7.7% of investment / 319 works) with
the remaining 14.9% of investment in commune primary and secondary school classrooms. 95%
of project communes have received investment in schools under this component. Around 47,000
households benefited from improved village primary classrooms. The NMPRP has also added
value to the overall program by successfully complementing other projects and programs
investing in larger commune primary and secondary schools infrastructure. The project has
upgraded 128 Commune Health Stations in 36% of project communes, benefiting a population of
around 75,000 households. The combined investment in schools and health infrastructure
(US$ 19.45 million) represented 108% of the original indicative costs for the Education and
Health Component (US$ 18 million) and 15% of the of the adjusted IDA loan amount.

3.1.4 Operations and maintenance
The project has given particular attention to Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the civil
works. Two rounds of O&M training courses have been provided for commune and village
representatives (in 2004 and 2007) including 76 courses and 3,675 trainees. An O&M Training
Manual for communes has been published, together with oral translations into 4 ethnic minority
languages and a construction management training film. Despite those successes, there are
shortfalls in O&M financing for all infrastructure categories. Funding gaps were most
pronounced for roads and education. The poor commune authorities and local communities could
not realistically cover all the costs for O&M (particularly for schools infrastructure). Sustainable
financing for O&M will require increased resources from the province and district budgets for
public infrastructure to complement commune resources and local contributions. The project has
done much to ensure that appropriate institutional arrangements for O&M are established and
functioning but this is a broader and longer-term issue that the NMPRP cannot solve alone.

3.2 Commune development budget component
The objectives of the Commune Development Budget Component (CDBC) were (i) To support
the Government's efforts to promote decentralized management by building the capacity of the
poor communes to work as Investment Owners and to manage their own development
budgets;(ii) To enable local communities to identify and implement a range of small-scale sub-
projects that provide material, social and economic benefits to the local communities; (iii) To
target the particular needs of the most remote village and vulnerable groups including ethnic
minorities, poor households and women.

The CBDC was an innovative component of the project. For the first time, at a large scale, poor
communes worked as investment owners and managers using state budget resources. This
component integrated the principles of Grassroots Democracy All the project communes were


                                                                                                 40

involved in the CDBC, with a commune budget allocation made of 15% of the total IDA loan
fund invested per commune. The commune allocation was from VND 65 million (USD 4,063) up
to VND 1,919 million (USD 119,000) with an average of VND 827 million (USD 51,700).

3.2.1 Overall progress
The CDBC has been implemented for 3 years (6 cycles). Physical progress on contracting and
implementing sub-projects was generally satisfactory. Of the total 20,807 planned sub-projects,
about 20,547 sub-projects were approved (98.75%) and 90% completed. The total approved
amount of IDA investment was of US$ 19.71 million (VND 315 billion), 123% of the original
estimated cost for this component (US$ 16 million)-. Community contributions constituted
around 4.65% of the approved investment and the IDA loan amounts about 95.36%. It is expected
that by the end of the project a majority of the outstanding sub-projects will be completed.
Overall progress has been good and the completion of CDBC has been a significant achievement.

3.2.2 Diversity of sub-projects
Regarding the different types of CDBC sub-projects, community infrastructure were the majority
of sub-projects (79%), with the remaining 21% consisting mainly of sub-projects in production
support (9%) and support for household living conditions (8%). There was considerable diversity
in the different types of sub-projects selected by villages. This diversity of sub-project suggested
a strong local participation during the selection. In some communes and districts, however, there
was a narrower range of sub-projects (such as village loudspeakers systems or similar
construction projects) which could be interpreted as a sign of a less active participation.

3.2.3 Community participation procurement method
The CDBC guidelines allow for a range of procurement methods according to the type of sub-
project. Community Participation (CP) procurement accounts for 75% (primarily for community
infrastructure sub-projects), with a lesser proportion through local shopping (11%) and direct
contracting (12%) for goods, equipment and services. The development of the Community
Participation procurement methods has been one of the unique features and most innovative
aspects of the NMPRP. Those lessons were directly applicable for P135.

3.2.4 Targeting
The targeting and geographical distribution of sub-projects to villages was a positive outcome of
the project. 98% of villages in the project area have received sub-projects (3,463 villages out of a
total of 3,516 villages). The CDB has made a strong effort to ensure that a majority of villages
were involved in the CDBC, including those in more remote locations. . Previous reports from the
CPMU suggested that in the early CDBC Cycles there was a bias towards the more accessible
villages in the distribution of CDBC resources in many communes. This trend was corrected in
the later CDBC Cycles which focused more resources on the most remote villages. .

3.2.5 Benefits from CDBC
The CDBC resulted in different types of benefits for the local communities: (i) physical benefits
from improvements in small-scale village infrastructure and facilities, which may have secondary
social and/or economic benefits for households; (ii) direct economic benefits in the form of labour
payments to the artisans and production groups implementing sub-projects; (iii) primary and
secondary benefits to the local economy through the purchase of material supplies and goods
from local retailers; (v) social benefits through the promotion of local democracy, community
cohesion through local people working together on sub-projects, increased technical knowledge
and skills, and increased management capacity of commune and village cadres); and (vi)
environmental Benefits through the improvement of the village environment.



                                                                                                 41

3.2.6 Commune capacity
Intensive training for the commune and village cadres and regular review workshops have been
essential to the implementation progress and success of the CDBC. Through training and
`learning-by-doing' the capacity, skills and confidence of the staff of the Commune Development
Boards have been considerably strengthened, in (i) working as the Investment Owner of sub-
projects, mobilizing local participation; (ii) making design and cost estimates for sub-projects
approved by communes; (iii) carrying out procurement of sub-projects; (iv) supervision of works;
(v) organizing O&M of civil works in the locality; (vi) financial management and accounting for
commune investments and (vii) interacting with district sections and with the banking system

3.3 Applied agricultural demonstrations
The aim of the Applied Agricultural Demonstrations (AAD) sub-component was to support
income growth and provide food security for poor households through the demonstration of
appropriate and improved technologies: (i) annual crops (food crops and some cash crops,
including both irrigated and rain-fed systems); (ii) perennial crops (such as fruit tree production,
forestry, agro forestry and home garden systems); (iii) livestock production (including both large
and small ruminants, poultry and aquaculture); and (iv) small-scale processing techniques (for
crop storage and preservation etc.). The approach combined `hands on training' with the
demonstration of improved technologies for groups of participating farmers in each locality. The
selection of the demonstration models was made through a participatory planning process with a
scale of demonstrations applicable and sustainable for poor households.

3.3.1 Number of models and beneficiaries
The overall expenditure (including demonstrations models, on-site research and training) was
around US$ 7.76 million, representing 21.4% of the original indicative costs for the Agriculture
Component (US$ 36 million). The IDA loan amount was US$ 6.03 million, representing 7% of
the original loan (US$ 110 million). To date a total of 3,481 models was established, with a total
investment of US$ 7.71 million (including the IDA loan and local contributions).

According to the Province Project Completion Reports, there have been around 86,000
beneficiary households. This represents around 40% of all households in the project area
(although some households are involved in more than one demonstration) and 148% of the end-
of-project target (58,000 households). Based on data provided in the Province Progress Reports,
around 84% of these were poor households.

3.2.2 Range of technologies
Livestock is the highest investment category (46%) followed by short rotation food and vegetable
crops (29%), fisheries (11%), perennial crop including forestry, fruit trees and other commercial
crops (10%) and processing technology (4%). In total, 50 different types of demonstration model
are listed in the province reports. In all provinces, the highest expenditure has been in livestock
production and short-rotation food crops. The provincial data indicate, however, that the average
investment per model and per household varied quite considerably.

3.2.3 Assessment by the beneficiaries
According to a detailed technical analysis of the diversity of factors influencing the adoption and
replication of the demonstration models, the short-rotation food crops models (e.g. improved rice,
maize and soybean varieties) and associated cultivation techniques were perceived as effective for
providing short-term benefits satisfying the demands for food and cash income of participating
households. The livestock breeding and production models were highly appreciated because of




                                                                                                 42

their potential economic returns (especially the models on breeding cows, calf or sow raising,
piglet production, and intensive pork production36). The fruit tree production and home garden
improvement models were less appreciated due to the long-rotation, the lack of market demand
for new fruits; and the climatic factors that affected newly planted fruit trees in some places. The
vegetable production models were limited but successful and contributed to household nutrition.

3.2.4 Replication rates
A study made in 6 communes suggested that replication rates vary considerably. The most
successful were the goat model (750% replication rate) and the Cow model (605% replication
rate). The AAD models which have the lowest per household expenditure and require the least
expenditure to implement are the ones to be more likely copied.

3.4 Teacher and health worker training

3.4.1 Teacher training
The teacher training and upgrading courses have been carried out in 4 of the 6 provinces (Bac
Giang, Hoa Binh, Phu Tho and Yen Bai) with 75 courses with a combined duration of 338
months. There have been 2971 trainees including 2106 primary school teachers and 865
kindergarten teachers. The total expenditure has been around US$ 592,000 (VND 9.468 billion)
or 3.28% of the indicative costs for the Education and Health Component (US$ 18 million).

Primary teacher training was covered through 54 courses (in 4 provinces), including 2106
primary teachers, 49.5% being women and 63% ethnic minority over a combined period of 250
months. 21 courses were prepared for kindergarten teacher training (combined duration of 88
months) in 3 provinces for 865 kindergarten teachers, 99.5% being women and 67.5% ethnic
minority. Those training were well integrated with the overall teacher training plans of the
provinces and localities. The trainee selection procedure was coordinated between the PMUs, the
provincial Department of Education and Training, the District Education Section and the
commune schools.

The benefits of the education component as a whole (including infrastructure and teacher
training) are (i) reduce the number of temporary and triple-shift classrooms, (ii) improved the
qualifications of kindergarten and primary teaching staff, (iii) provided opportunities for village
level teachers in the remote and poor commune to attend training and upgrading courses.

3.4.2 Health worker training
A considerable amount of commune and village health worker training has been provided by the
project and has contributed substantially and significantly to overall capacity building of the
healthcare network in the poor communes and villages. In total there have been 119 courses with
a combined duration of 917 months in the 6 provinces. There have been 4,383 trainees (43% are
women and 83% ethnic minorities). The total expenditure on health worker training amounts to
US$ 1.16 million (VND 18.718 billion), which represented 6.5% of costs of the Education and
Health Component as a whole (US$ 18 million). The investment ranges from around US$ 49,450
(VND 791 million) in Bac Giang up to US$ 289,000 (VND 4,620 million) in Lao Cai.




36
  However introducing more intensive pig production can pose risks for poor households because of frequent disease incidence,
needs of skills and a higher level of inputs for food and housing to be economically successful.




                                                                                                                             43

88 courses (450 months) for 3,184 trainees (43% are women and 83% ethnic minorities) were
done for Village Health Worker on community health awareness and mid-wife training. In
general, community health awareness training has been linked to the VHW training in several
provinces. The community health awareness activities was not fully implemented as planned by
the project because such campaigns were already carried out quite extensively by other
organizations such as the provincial Centre for Health Education, the Provincial Family Planning
Committee, and the Women's Union etc (in Son La, Hoa Binh and Phu To particularly).

3.5 Capacity building and training

3.5.1 Commune and village cadre training
The project has introduced a program of practically-oriented training courses for the elected
commune officials, appointed commune technical cadres, mass association representatives, and
the village leaders (including CDBs and CSBs members). These training concentrated on `core
skills' and practical topics necessary for project implementation but also relevant and applicable
for all types of decentralized management programs: Community supervision of infrastructure
works & applied agricultural demonstrations, operations and maintenance of commune and
village infrastructure, CDBC ­ planning and community participation procurement methods &
financial management and liquidation procedures;        state management for commune cadres;
Environmental management planning; Computer skills training for commune cadres.

A challenge faced by the project has been to ensure both a large scale coverage (356 communes
and 3,500 villages) and the effectiveness of the training. NMPRP's approach was different from
many other projects in Vietnam by integrating project training activities into the province training
systems, by collaborating with the Province Training Schools mandated to and experienced in
providing training to commune and village cadres. In total, 339 courses (each lasting 3 to 5 days)
for 16,980 trainees were conducted representing over US$ 1.2 million (co-financed by DFID).
47.7 persons have been trained per commune, with an average cost of US$ 70 per trainee.

NMPRP implemented repeated short training (3-5 days sessions) combined with review
workshops to share experience and effective follow-up from district staff. Although, a large
number of commune cadres have been trained, the project has been less successful in reaching
women (mainly because the village leaders and staff of the commune authorities, the primary
training targets were largely male and because of language barriers). However, the proportion of
female trainees has increased over time: 26.5% women in CDBC courses in 2006 and 24% on
state management in 2007.

Finally, the additional support through the deployment of the Community Facilitators (CFs) has
been important for the Capacity building of the communes, particularly in helping the CDB in the
implementation of the CDBC. A total of 165 CFs (22% women and 28.5% ethnic minorities)
have worked in the communes for 30 months from 2005 to 2007.

3.5.2 District and province training
The second major element of the Capacity Building Plan has been the provision of training for
province and district staff, including staff of the PPMUs, DPMUs, and staff from other concerned
province and districts departments. A series of Training Workshops, Review Workshops and
Short Training Courses were conducted and contributed to create a forum for central, province
and district staff to meet on a regular basis and to share their project implementation results and
experiences. Between 2003 and 12/2007 a total of 48 events (122 days) including 4,429
participants (24% women) for a total expenditure of US$ 333,851 were organized by the CPMU
(1/3 of the events were held in the provinces).


                                                                                                 44

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


DFID Viet Nam did not provide a separate comment on this ICR. They have completed
their independent assessment of the project in their Project Completion Report (PCR)
dated November 2007 (DFID system required a PCR before the project closed), which
rated NMPRP as largely achieved the project objectives, and they were satisfied with the
project performance and results. Section 7.b. presents overall DFID's view on the
NMPRP.
