the project is to\n            assist the Government of Costa Rica in its efforts to assess\n            and develop the country's petroleum potential, prepare\n            specialized energy sector studies, and address issues in the\n            refining subsector. The project would complement ongoing\n            exploration efforts being carried out with the assistance of\n            Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). It would comprise: (i)\n            complementary survey work, including marine seismic and\n            airborne magnetometer (airmag) surveys, required for a\n            complete review of the country's petroleum potential;\n            (ii) about 10 man-months of exploration consultant services,\n            to help review and interpret data and prepare an exploration\n            strategy; (iii) about 15 man-months of short term\n            consultancies to undertake specialized geological studies;\n            (iv) about 30 man-months of consultant services to help\n            develop a national energy data base and prepare a national\n            energy plan; (v) about 20 man-months of consultant services\n            to help prepare a study of options in the refining\n            subsector; and (vi) staff training and purchase of library\n            materials and specialized office equipment. The project has\n            no major risks."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
