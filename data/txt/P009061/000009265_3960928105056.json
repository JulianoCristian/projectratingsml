sewerage service to almost 850,000 persons and\n            improving the present sewerage service to low income people,\n            and 3) reducing flooding in parts of the city that flood\n            heavily in rainstorms. In addition, technical assistance and\n            training would be provided to ASKI to strengthen the\n            institution's capability to carry out its expanding operations."}, "docdt": "1989-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
