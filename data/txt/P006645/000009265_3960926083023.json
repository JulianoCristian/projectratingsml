expanded transmission capacity for the power\n            generated in new power plants in the South, including the\n            Pehuenche Project, to the load centers in Santiago and the\n            North. The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, to be executed\n            over a seven-year period, will include (i) the construction\n            of the 500 MW Pehuenche Hydroelectric Power Plant; (ii) a\n            training program for the professional staff of Empresa\n            Electrica Pehuenche S.A. (PEHUENCHE S.A.); and (iii) the\n            execution of a national environmental program. In addition,\n            the Government will undertake executing studies and\n            implementing recommendations on protection of the\n            environment, design of medium size hydroelectric projects\n            and reduction of illicit use of electricity. The Alto\n            Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission project, also to be executed\n            over a seven-year period, will include (i) the construction\n            of 80 km of transmission lines and four substations; and\n            (ii) a training program for the professional staff of\n            Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA). The two\n            projects included in this loan will meet the growing demand\n            for electricity and will provide expanded transmission\n            capacity for the power generated in new power plants in the\n            South, including the Pehuenche Project, to the load centers\n            in Santiago and the North.
