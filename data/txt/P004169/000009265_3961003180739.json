The project will\n            reduce pollution in two major rivers the Yongsan and the\n            Han, by expanding wastewater treatment facilities in\n            Kwangju, the nation's fifth largest city.  It will also\n            support institutional development for wastewater management\n            in the two cities and promote innovative technological and\n            policy initiatives to conserve water.
