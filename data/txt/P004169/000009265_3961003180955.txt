MEMORaNDUM AND R3OOIY NDATION O THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDUD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE R$PUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A MKIaNGU AND SEOUL SENUERaE PROECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following emorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$110 million to
help finance a project for saewerage in Kwangju and Seoul. The loan would be at
the Banks standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years including
five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the Kwangju
City Government in the amount of US$30 million and to the Seoul City Government
in the amount of US$80 million at the same terms as the Bank loan, including
foreign exchange and interest risks, plus a 0.05% p.a. administrative charge on
amounts withdrawn and outstanding.
2.    Backaround   ndustrial and municipal water demand in Korea has increased
to the point where it now equals the annual rainfall runoff and is expect,d to
exceed runoff by 50% by the year 2001. The geological structure does not offer
suffLcient groundwater to supply concentrated population centers; rather, rivers
are the principal source. However, while these have been dammed extensively to
collect runoff, there is little scope for further impoundment (which now equals
about 7% of total water resources). As the amount available for consumption
cannot be substantially increased, water resources must be conserved. Also,
because river water must now be reused, pollution must be subject to stringent
controls.
3.     In 1989, untreated municipal wastewater accounted for 70% of the pollution
in Korean rivers. The Government decided to reverse the declining environmental
status by treating wastewater and bringing the river water quality up to Class
1II, which is suitable for recreation, fishing and as a source of water supply.
it created the National Water Improvement Program that directed over 70 muni-
cipalities to complete sewerage systems and treatment plants by 1996. The Water
Quality Master Plan identified the type of proposed treatment plants in relation
to the projected quality of river water and, on that basis, the program was
estimated at Won 4.1 trillion.
4.   Sewerage services are provided by local governments which are supported by
the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MOAM). XOC
produces guidelines for the planning and design of municipal sewer systems and
setting of tariffs. MONA advises municipalities on organizational and financial
planning. The Ministry of Environment (NOE) prepares guidelines for implementing
environmental regulations and monitors compliance. Construction of treatment
facilities is financed by municipalities with Government contributions varying
from 60% - 80%, depending on the city's self-financing capacity. The six largest
cities with populations over one million finance all their investments.
5.   Lessons Learned from Previous Dank Involvement. The Bank has assisted the
sector through a sewerage sector study, a sewerage project and five water supply
projects of which four were successfully eompleted; the last water supply project
and the swerage project are under implementatLon. Evaluations indlcate that the
completed projects substantlally contributed to institutional development



- 2 -
(PCR No. 10833) and that all project goals were achieved or surpassed (Report No.
11062 - Annual Review on Evaluation Results 1991 - OED, August 1992); they also
indicate that adequate preparation, well defined key objectives with regard to
project targets and commitment of responsible agencies contributed to that
success. Drawing upon these lessons, the project objectives are clearly spelled
out and focus on key physical and institutional goals. The proposed project is
at an advanced stage of preparation and the actions it promotes enjoy solid
support from the implmenting agencies. Also, recent Government actions in
planning and constructing facilities indicate strong commitment to sewerage
sector development.
6.   Rationale for Bank -Involvement. Against a background of higher incomes and
increased urbanization, the Government has been pressured to address social and
environmental concerns while continuing to upgrade infrastructure facilities and
manufacturing technology. As agreed between the Bank and the Government, any
assistance from the former would be provided in the context of the graduation
plan. An important feature of that plan is that until new lending ends in FY95,
priority areas will be those in which the Bank, as the only official source of
external assistance, can provide value in addition to transferring financial
resources. Therefore, Bank operational work now focuses on specific areas of
high-priority  infrastructure  investment  with  technology  transfer  and
institutional development (including privatization of public enterprises),
intensifying the liberalization of the financial sector, and addressing social
objectives and environmental issues.
7.   The proposed project fits into this strategy.  It is a logical extension
of the Bank's long involvement in the water and sewerage sector of Rorea and
represents an appropriate final project for the sector prior to the planned
graduation. While the primary role for the Bank has been to assist Rorea in
adopting appropriate technology and practices for planning, design, construction
and operation of water and wastewater facilities, the projects have also directed
attention to financing, accounting, cost recovery and institutional reform. In
this project, Bank involvement would focus on both technological and institu-
tional improvements and would also incorporate an important component linking
pollution preventi-~n efforts with the need to conserve water and thereby reduce
wastewater. The results would have important implications for Korea as well as
for other countries.
8.    In selecting the two cities for the project, priority was given to Kwangju,
which is seriously polluting the Yongsan River and its tributaries and is the
poorest of the six largest cities, and to Seoul, which provides leadership in
developing the country and wants to maintain acceptable water quality in the Ran
River.
9.   Projeet Obiectives.  The proposed project is intended to: (a) assist in
cleaning the Yongsan and Ran Rivers in order to reduce health hazards and attain
the water quality needed for recreation and the well-being of the cities'
residents as well as for those using water downstream; (b) focus attention on
water conservatioci to reduce water demand and the wastewater generated;
(c) encourage cities to develop self-financing wastewater activities; and
(d) support technological and institutional iprovement in the sector.



- 3 -
10.   Descriptio.   The project would expand wastewater treatment plants,
doubling their capacity to 600,000 m3/d in Kwangju (21% of the total cost) and
2.0 million m3/d in Seoul (72% of the total Cost). The Kwangju component would
also construct about 36 km of interceptor sewers and a wastewater pumping station
(4% of the total cost). At both plants, the extensions would provide primary and
secondary treatment through a conventional activated sludge procese as is used
in the existing facilities. The implementation support (3% of the total cost)
would include (a) studies to identify measures to conserve water and reduce
wastewater and (b) engineering services to assist in supervising construction.
The total cost is estimated at US$508.1 million equivalent, with a foreign
component of US$190.7 million. The total financing required, including interest
during construction, is US$530.7 million with a foreign exchange requirement of
US$207.6 million. The proposed Bank loan (US$110 million) would finance about
22% of the total cost or 58% of the foreign component excluding interest during
construction. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are presented in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable for key project processing steps and a summary
of current Bank Group operations in Korea are presented in Schedules C and D.
Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11408-KO, dated February
26, 1993, is being distributed separately.
11.   Im lementation. The project would be carried out over a five-year period
by the Kwangju Sewerage and Seoul Treatment Divisions, assisted by consultants.
Both agencies recently implemented similar projects and are considered capable
of carrying out the proposed project. The facilities to be constructed are
expected to begin operating in 1997. The implementing agencies would operate and
maintain the facilities provided through their staff and contractors would be
hired to collect and haul raw and digested sludge, repair and maintain equipment
and instruments and clean the drainage and wastewater networks.
12.  Proiect Sustainability.  The implementing agencies, both experienced and
capable institutions, would operate facilities provided by the project. Measures
to be adopted with regard to accounting and pricing would further strengthen
their efficiency and ensure sustainability. The water conservation studies,
aimed at promoting efficient water use, would contribute to decreasing the growth
of wastewater and related O&M expenditures.
13. Aareed Actions. The Bank loan would require Subsidiary Loan Agreements
between the Government and the two project cities. Assurances were obtained from
the Kwangju and Seoul governments that they woulds (a) complete the water
conservation studies by July 1996; (b) implement environmental monitoring
programs to evaluate the impact of the facilities; (c) charge sewerage tariffs
as of July 1993, to achieve a rate of return on revalued fixed assets of not less
than 3% p.a. and 2% p.a. in Kwangju and Seoul, respectively.
14. jnvironmental Akects. The overall environmental impact of the project
would be highly visible and positive.   The treatment plants would remove
pollution equivalent to about 260 ton/day of BOD and 300 t/d of suspended solids
in Kwangju and Seoul together. Without treatment, pollution would transform the
Yongsan and Han rivers into hygienically dangerous open sewers with obnoxious
odors and a repulsive gray color. Conversely, treatment would return the rivers



to their natural character, appropriate for recreation and fishing and suitable
an a source of water supply.
15.  Proaram Obiective a-gd Cateaories. The project would particularly benefit
the health of low-income farmers who use the Yonguan and Han Rivers for
irrigation, since they tend to have the greatest exposure to rivers now
contaminated by raw sewage.
16.  Iaefits.  The proposed project would (a) directly improve the Yongsan
River and the lower reacbes of the Han River, and would significantly reduce
health hazards now posed for downstream agriculture, for the municipal and
industrial water supply, and for recreations and (b) maximise benefits from
previous investments in interceptor sewers in Kwangju and Seoul.  The most
apparent environmental benefit would be removing wastewater from inner city
rivers and improving living standards, especially for those residing and working
near the water courses now polluted by raw wastewater. It would also improve the
efficiency of the wastewater agencies involved. Recommendations arising from the
water conservation studies would help reduce the rate of growth in water demand
and resulting wastewater, related future construction and O&3 expensos.
17.  Risk. There are no unusual risks involved. Virtually identical treatmaent
plants were constructed on adjacent sites with similar ground conditions and the
construction of interceptor sewers in Kwangju does not present any unusual
difficulties.  Operationally, the treatment to be provided is already used
successfully in both cities.   The main risk will be in implementing the
recommendatioLs of the water conservation studies since the range of possible
actions (including pricing and tochnological Literventions) could be politically
unpopular.   Past experience in Korea and the seriousness with which water
pollution issues are viewed, however, reinforce the potential for success,
possibly over an extended period of time.
.  Recommendaton. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

k/    IDC is computed on the basis of the cities' commitments plus borrowing for
the project from the Bank and the Reglonal Development Fund (for 10 years,
including 2 years of grace and 8% interest). The aggregate amount of IDC
is based on the cities' paying an average interest rate of 7 81% on
borrowing of up to US$142.5 million to support the proposed project. The
portion corresponding to the Bank's interest (on borrowing of up to US$110
million) is allocated as foreign cost, while the remainder is allocated as
local cost. Cities would finance the IDC from internal resources.
