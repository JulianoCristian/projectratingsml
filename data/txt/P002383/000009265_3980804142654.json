Abatement Project in Seychelles. The objectives of\n            the GEF Project as defined in the Staff Appraisal Report\n            were to protect biodiversity and limit pollution of\n            international waters around Seychelles. The project\n            comprised three main components: Restoration and\n            preservation of the Aldabra ecosystem, Conservation of\n            biodiversity and Actions to limit pollution of international\n            waters. Overall, the outcome of the project is highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are In countries with\n            limited human capacity, a focal Government-appointed\n            projectcoordinator, in this case the EMPS Coordinator, with\n            experience in project managementand a good understanding of\n            the sectoral issues is key to timely implementation of the\n            project and can ensure smooth linkages between the\n            implementing agencies and the donor community. A high staff\n            turnover during project implementation can be detrimental to\n            the successful implementation of projects with a large\n            number of technically different components.For project\n            components involving strong socio-economic elements, such as\n            eliminating industries based on endangered turtles, a\n            socio-economist or environmental economist should be\n            involved in project design and implementation. For complex\n            natural resources projects, adequate resources should be in\n            place to ensure close supervision of the project by a\n            multi-disciplinary team. For projects which will be\n            implemented in isolated areas, such as Aldabra, project\n            design should include measures (e.g. improved communication\n            links, frequent staff turnaround) to alleviate human and\n            environmental pressures on the project staff."}, "docdt": "1998-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
