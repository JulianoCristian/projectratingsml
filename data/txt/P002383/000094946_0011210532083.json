Most of the lessons\n            learned relate to the specific conditions of Seychelles: 1)\n            projects involving islands other than the main island of\n            Mahe, suffered from insufficient inter-linkages between\n            project design, availability of material, supervision and\n            project management, which should have relied on a more\n            detailed planning; 2) given the small size of the economy,\n            and its financial difficulties, individual studies - other\n            than those being part of projects with physical objectives -\n            should not form part of an expensive financing scheme, such\n            as a Bank loan; 3) additionally, given the limited human\n            capacity, an experienced project coordinator, with strong\n            understanding of sectoral issues is paramount to the success\n            of projects, unfortunately, the high turn-over of this\n            position was a source of difficulty; 4) components involving\n            strong socioeconomic elements - i.e., eliminating industries\n            based on endangered turtles - called for the involvement of\n            a socio-economist, or environmental economist in the project\n            design, and implementation. Regrettably, the Bank has yet to\n            specify appropriate mechanisms to deal with Small Island\n            States in far away locations, where mobilizing\n            multi-disciplinary expertise is difficult, though complex\n            natural resources, and infrastructure projects so require."}, "docdt": "2000-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
