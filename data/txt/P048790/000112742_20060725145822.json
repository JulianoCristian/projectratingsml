The\n            institutional development impact was negligible with\n            unsatisfactory performance by the Bank and highly\n            unsatisfactory by the Borrower.  Project start-up was\n            significantly delayed and subsequent implementation was slow\n            due to the prevailing combination of obstacles. The project\n            was cancelled by the Bank when it became apparent that the\n            development objective would not be achieved.  The key\n            lessons learned are divided into four themes: a) project\n            implementation arrangements including governmental oversight\n            and implementation capacity; b) project processing and\n            readiness for implementation, including timely availability\n            of counterpart co-financing, and planning for\n            implementation; c) sector operational context including\n            stakeholder support at the regional level, and local\n            technical capacity; and d) cross-cutting portfolio issues,\n            including project ownership and authorizing environment; and\n            linking GEF resources to other investment operations."}, "docdt": "2006-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
