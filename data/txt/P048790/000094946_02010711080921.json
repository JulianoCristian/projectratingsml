There are four main project components.\n            The first implements management measures at priority marine\n            and terrestrial protected areas in the corridor by 1)\n            creating or expanding protected areas at two national parks;\n            2) preparing and implementing management plans for these\n            protected areas and three existing protected areas; and 3)\n            providing professional development for park staff in\n            protected areas administration and management planning,\n            wetland and waterbird ecology, and managmeent, warden\n            skills, and visitor management. The second component\n            develops and implements a corridor conservation strategy for\n            maintaining the corridor's ecological function by 1)\n            identifying and prioritizing key natural areas and\n            ecological functions and their managmeent requirements using\n            remote-sensing assisted inventories of natural habitats; 2)\n            establishing a monitoring system; 3) finalizing the coastal\n            protected area plan; and 4) preparing land use plans in\n            selected raions. The third component builds awareness and\n            support for wetlands conservation through an environmental\n            education program and implements a competitive small grants\n            program. This projet will work together with the Rural Land\n            Titling Project to assess the environmental management needs\n            of lands within the former collective farm as the fourth component."}, "docdt": "2001-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
