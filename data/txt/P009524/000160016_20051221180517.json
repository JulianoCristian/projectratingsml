sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            Among the lessons cited were the following: 1) Complex\n            project design should be avoided in a weak implementation\n            environment. 2) Project objectives and components with TA\n            requirements must be clearly aligned. 3) Borrower's\n            high ownership and clear leadership are essential to ensure\n            progress on significant policy and institutional reform. 4)\n            Line of authorities for project management should be clearly\n            defined. 5) The independent \"Engineer\" role should\n            be separated from the \"Employer\" in a complex\n            project with weak borrower implementation capacity. That is,\n            for agencies with weak contract administration capacity, it\n            is important to strongly insist on moving the\n            \"Engineer\" role to an international (definitely\n            not local) consulting firm. 6) Clear incentives or penalty\n            mechanisms must be enhanced for better consultancy\n            services.7) The maximum number of consultant firms forming a\n            joint venture must be capped. 8) Wider civil society\n            consultation, parallel implementation of social mitigation\n            measures and higher quality impact assessment studies are\n            essential for potentially controversial measures, such as\n            non-motorized transport-free conversion. 9) Car parking\n            strategy should be prepared for converted non-motorized\n            transport -free streets. 10) Public relations and\n            comprehensive communication strategy are particularly\n            important for urban transport projects."}, "docdt": "2005-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
