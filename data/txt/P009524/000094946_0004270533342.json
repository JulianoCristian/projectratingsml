improve transport infrastructure, and services in the\n            city's metropolitan area, including road improvement,\n            traffic management, and construction of terminals. During\n            the construction phase, major environmental impacts include\n            air, and noise pollution, and, traffic disruption. Soil\n            contamination is expected to rise during construction, and\n            sludge discharges will occur. Mitigating measures include:\n            regulation of roadsides, and systems to control oil\n            spillage, as well as dissipation structures, and settlement\n            basins to control drainage, and erosion. The Air Pollution\n            Advisory Committee of stakeholders, will establish action\n            plans, to control vehicular gas emissions, regulate testing\n            in academic laboratories, and ensure effectiveness of air\n            control programs, in addition to public awareness campaigns,\n            and training. Noise barriers will be established at\n            congested locations, and trees/shrubs will be planted as a\n            practical effect to reduce traffic noise nuisances. Surface\n            and groundwater pollution control, include the provision of\n            dustbins, and the establishment of waste disposal locations.\n            Legislative requirements should address the protection of\n            flood zones, and those where discharges may disturb the\n            quality of surface, or ground water. Project design would\n            avoid sensitive areas to prevent adversity on flora, and\n            fauna, and in open spaces and parks."}, "docdt": "1998-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
