Area\n            (DMA), and b) to strengthen institutional and policy\n            framework and address long-term transport planning and\n            coordination issues in the DMA. The project consists of five\n            components. 1) Infrastructure development will include\n            traffic management measures and system improvements, road\n            improvements, rehabilitation of existing bus terminals,\n            pedestrian facilities improvements, non-motorized transport\n            network improvements, grade-separated interchange\n            facilities, feasibility studies for flyover schemes at\n            Mohahkali and Jatrabari, and flood damage rehabilitation of\n            roads and drainage. 2) Equipment support will provide\n            responsible agencies with necessary equipment, computers,\n            accessories, and vehicles. 3) Institutional strengthening\n            and capacity building will strengthen traffic management,\n            project supervision and management, financial management,\n            environmental management, and performance monitoring to\n            implementing agencies through training, consultant services,\n            and equipment. 4) Policy support and future studies will\n            support the preparation of a long-term transport strategic\n            plan. 5) Land acquisition and resettlement will prepare a\n            policy framework for addressing negative impacts, and a\n            Resettlement Action Plan to assist affected people."}, "docdt": "1998-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
