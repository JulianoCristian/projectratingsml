This\n            resettlement action plan aims to minimize involuntary\n            resettlement, through viable alternative project design\n            options, and, where displacement is unavoidable, vulnerable\n            groups will be assisted in order to, at minimum, regain\n            their standard of living, at no cost to themselves. Despite\n            the fact that project works will be implemented within the\n            right of way, many squatter, and vendor encroachers will\n            have to be displaced. While squatters, and vendor\n            encroachers are not entitled to legal compensation, the\n            project will support targeted populations to maintain their\n            livelihoods, through assistance in replacing structures, and\n            assets lost. Project affected populations will receive\n            compensation for land losses, at an inclusive fifty percent\n            land premium, or the value of equivalent replacement land.\n            Losses of usufruct rights through mortgage, or leased\n            property, will be compensated at twenty five percent of one\n            year's net income, while, income losses from business\n            activity, will be compensated based on current average\n            annual net income, pro-rated for sixty days. However,\n            considerable uncertainty on the compensation budget exist,\n            thus, flexible budgetary planning will be required."}, "docdt": "1998-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
