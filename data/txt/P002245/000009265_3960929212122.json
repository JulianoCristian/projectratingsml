economic\n            growth.  The project has two major components: institutional\n            reform and training, leading to autonomy in the postal\n            sector and eventual privatization of telecommuncations\n            operations; and an investment program to improve the Posts\n            and Telecommunications services.  The IDA credit proceeds\n            will support:  (a) technical assistance to implement the\n            institutional reform by setting up an appropriate legal\n            framework and putting in place commercial management\n            capabilities for the sectors; (b) training for posts and\n            telecommunications staff, rehabilitation of the training\n            center and scholarships; (c) complementary items of the\n            telecommunications investment program, to secure the long\n            distance network, create public telephones and improve\n            maintenance; and (d) the postal sector investment program\n            consisting of construction of a mail sorting center, and\n            extension of retail and of rural delivery services."}, "docdt": "1990-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
