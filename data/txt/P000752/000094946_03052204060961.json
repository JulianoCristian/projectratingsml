World Bank\n            performance is evaluated as unsatisfactory, while Borrower\n            performance is judged as satisfactory. These were some of\n            the lessons learned: 1) Successfully creating a market-based\n            seed production and distribution system in place of a\n            centrally-based system requires the gradual involvement of\n            the private sector. 2) see production should be based on a\n            thorough assessment of farmer demand and market for improved\n            varieties, not just focusing on supply. 3) Substantial\n            changes to the project design should not be made without\n            fully analyzing the proposed design in terms of economic,\n            financial, and social impacts and ensuring that the new\n            approach is sustainable. 4) to ensure better implementation,\n            arrangements for monitoring and evaluation need to be in\n            place before the project starts. 5) To ensure continuity and\n            sustainability, planning and initiating transitional\n            arrangements well in advance of project closure (some 18\n            months) is necessary. 6) Single factor projects are unlikely\n            to have a major impact on agricultural production. 7)\n            Government commitment is critical for the timely\n            finalization of project preparation. 8) Assess the impact of\n            an evolving situation and act quickly: the project failed to\n            assess the impact of a rapidly expanding approach which\n            relied on a single market outlet under the national\n            extension intervention program on the project. It also\n            failed to act decisively in response to these changes."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
