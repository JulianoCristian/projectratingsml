The project\n            supports Seed Policy Reform, through each of its two\n            components. The components are : (a) Seed Enterprise\n            Development; and (b) Capacity Building. The first component\n            supports (i) the development of the informal seed sector;\n            (ii) encourages private sector entry into the formal\n            business; and supports (iii) the restructuring of the\n            Ethiopian Seed Enterprise from a centrally managed\n            parastatal to a decentralized and commercially oriented\n            enterprise.
