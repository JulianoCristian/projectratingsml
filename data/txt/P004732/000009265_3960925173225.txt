SECOND PROVINCIAL ROADS PRWECT
(LOAN 2311-THI
Preface
This is the Project Conpletion Report (PCR) for the Second Provincial
Roads Project in Thailaxd, for which Loan 2311-TB in the amount of US$100 million
was approved on June 9, 1983. The loan was closed on June 30, 1990, two years
behind schedule.   A total of US$5,705,623.93 was canelled.   The  last
disbursement was made on Uiovember 20, 1990.
Portions of the PCR wc_ prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the Country Department II, Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Sumary,
Parts I and III); Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
Preparation of the PCR was initiated subsequent to the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in June 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision reports; project progress
reports of the Ministry of Transport ane Communication (MOTC); correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

Evaluation S
Obi ectLvA
1.          The principal objectives of this project were to upgrade the rural
transport infrastructure and to preseve or rebabilitate deteriorated trunk
roads. An additional objective was to stre-j&hen institutions responsible for
highways and road tranzport through technical assistance and special studies.
The project aimed at improving about 1,000 km of provincial roads and
stre ghenizg or rehabilitating about 1,000 km of paved national and
provincial roads.
T=emSn;atavion ExDerience
2.         She loan became effective on  muary 26, 1984 and was scheduled to
be completed by December 31, 1987. F'  everal reasons, the project was not
completed until June 30, 1990: First, che Cabinet frequently was uniale to
provide timely approval of civil works contracts. Second, Department of
Highways (DOE) in many cases took time to negotiate reductions in prices of
low bidders for civil works. Third, streughening rehabilitatLon works
started 3 months later tbnn planned. Fourth, the improvements of provincial
roads in terms of kilometers, was expanded 7% b¢y)nd the planned length.
Finally, the technical assistance vas extended beyond the plan period for this
component. The principal procurement under the project was contractor
services for civil works with contracts awarded after international
competitive bidding. In a nuaber of cases, DON, takLng the view that lowest
bids exceeded cost estimates by substantial amounts as required by the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines, negotiated reductions in prices with low bidders.
However, in doing so, DOE caused sometimes significant delays in project
implementation. The Bank worked with DOB to limit this practice to
exceptional cases. Studies and detailed engiteering financed by the project
were carried out by consultants satisfactorily. The actual cost of the
project was about US$154.26 million, approximately 7.9% below the appraisal
cost estimate of US$166.60 million. This cost reduction is largely explained
by the strong competition among bidders for civil works contracts, a number of
cases of negotiations of reduetions in prices of low bidders and the
devaluation of the Baht of about f1%. Disbursements were slower than
appraisal targets mainly because of implementation delays. At the time of
final disbursement on November 20, 1990, disbursements totaled about US$94.29
million; US$5.71 million of the US$100 million loan was cancelled.

3.          Overall, the project was successful in meeting the principal
objectives of upgrading rural transport infrastructure and preserving or
rehabilitating deteriorated truck roads. The original target for improving
about 1,000 km of provincial roads was exceeded (1,073 k3m) by 7.3% while the
target of strength eing/rebilitating about 1,000 km of paved roads was not
quite achieved (977 k) but, if account is taken of the magnitude of the works
involved in some paved road sections, the accomplisbaents were greater than
bad been anticipated at appraisal. At time of appraisal, the estimated ERRs
of all sections of provincial roads included in the project were at least 12%
and ranged from  13% to 50% for the iuitial group; in the case of
strengthening/rehabilitation of paved roads, all sections included in the
project had at least a 15% ERR and some bad rates above 20%. On reevaluation,
nearly all the provincial roads included in the project had lower construction
costs and many had higher traffic levels., and therefore higher economic rates
of returns, than estimated at appraisal. Project roads for
strengthening/rehabilitation had higher -construction costs and many had higher
traffic levels than estimated at appraisal; re-evaluated economic rates of
return ware generally above appraisal estimates.
SUstainabilitv
4.          The benefits from the project are likely to be sustained during
the economic life of the various road works provided the Department of
Highways adequately maintains these facilities. The principal risk to
sustanability of benefits is that future road maintenance budgets may not be
adequate. It is noted, however, that the Govermment's compliance with loan
requirements concerning minimum road maintenance budgets has been relatively
good in recent years. Furthermore, the ongoing highway sector loans place
heavy emphasis on road maintenance.
Findings and Lessons_Learned
5.          The Second Provincial Roads Project was clearly successful.  Civil
works targets vere exceeded and the project studies and technical assistance
contributed significantly to the improvement and rehabilitation of the highway
system at both provincial and national road levels and strengthened the insti-
tutions responsible for highway administration. Rark performance on the
project was satisfactory. Borrower performance and borrower compliance with
special covenants in the Loan Agreement were generally satisfactory. The
principal lesson learned is that f0H is a iature organization capable of
completing projects within budgets. Therefore, sector lending in Thailand is
well justified.

B. Backrro_nd
1.1       Among the various mnodes of transport in Thailand, road trarsport
bas become predominant because of its inherent advantages and a vigorous
program of development in this subsector. The public road network totals
about 158,000 kam, consisting of about 16,00D km of national roads, 32,000 1m
of provincial roads and about 110,000 km of rural (tertiary) roads. The
national (or primary) road system connects the principal towns and regional
centers tfiroughout the country aiile the provincial (or secondary) road system
cormects the provincial centers and other towns with the national road system
and also interconnects rural roads.
1.2       The Bank's irmolvement in the transport sector began in 1950 with
loans for railway and port projects. In 1963, the Bank made its first loan
for highways in Thailand (Loan 341-TB, US$36 million); and several loans in
the subsector have followed that initial assistance.
1.3       Provincial roads were the particular focus of a Bank loan of US$35
million, approved by the Board in July 1981 (Loan No. 2035-TB). Under this
Provincial Roads Project, a total of 859 km of roads were built or improved,
some 43% more than had been planned at appraisal. Despite this achievement,
US$6.2 million of the loan was cancelled. (Project Performance Audit Report,
No. 8447, March 16, 1990).
1.4       The Sixth Development Plan (1987-1991) outlines the principal goals
for the transport sector: increased utilization of assets, improved
efficiency, increased self-reliance of state enterprises, and privatization.
Specific highway subsecroral goals include a proper balance between investment
and maintenance expenditures, including rehabilitation of highr"vs, reducing
traffic congestion and providing a higher level of road safety.

1.5      Preiat ObiectiMe. The ain objectives of the project wre to (1)
upgrade the rural transport infrastruce; and (2) preserve or rehabilitate
dateriorated trunk roads. An additional objective was to strengthen
Lustitttions responible for highways and road transport through technical
assistance and special studies.
1.6      2roject Desr X1tigM. The project comprises:
(a)  costruction nd improvemt, includin  supervision by consultants,
ok' about 1,000 km of provincial roads;
(b)  strenzthening and rehabilitation, including supervision by
consultants, of about 1,000 km of paved national and provincial
roads;
(c)  sector and project preparation studies, including engineering, for
future road projects, by conslatants; and
(d) teachical assvstance, by consultants, to the Department of Eighway
(DOB) to help improve the programming and implementation of road
mainten*ce, and to the Ministry of Transport and Comications
(MOTC) to assist in transport sector and policy studies.
D.      aeos  ad OrZarA:ation
1.7      The extent of Thailandes provincial roads requiring improvement in
the early eighties was clearly greater than could be accomcodated by the
Provincial. Roads Project (Loan 2035-TH). Therefore, there was need for a new
project that would address the same basic problem. Implementation of the
Provincial Roads Project was vell advanced and proceeding satisfactorily in
January 1983 when the second project ,as appraised.
1.8      Preparation for the Second Provincial Roads Project included
feasibility studies amd detailed engineering (financed under the Sixth Road
Project, Loan 1519-TE) for a substantial group (770 km) of provincial roads;
this was a sufficient basis for the initial improvement program. The project
provided for additional feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the
remaining improvement works. With regard to the strengthening and rehabilita-
tion of paved roads (also financed by Loan 1519-TB), the preparation was less
substantial, e.g. cost estimates were based on prelinisary engineering and the
general experience of DOE.  Under the project, further preparation was
accomplished prior to undertaking the remaining civil works.
1.9      The scale of the project was realistic as indicated by the
accomplishment of DOB in iplemeuting the project and exceeding project
targets.
1.10     In the early stage of designizLg the project, the intent was to
provide for Bank financing of 50% of total project cost. Upon the urging of



the Goverment, the partcipation of the Bazk was nereased to 60%. The
reson for the increse was that, because if a recession, the Goverment was
experiencing a critical shortfall of revenues which necessitated a curilm
of transort nves"tmts unmlss alternative financing beeme available.  In
retrospect, the adoption of the 60% basis of disbur,euent was sound.
E. Project Imolnentgation
1.11      L_=- Effectvenegs and _  e_t-e Stag=. Loen 2311-TN was approved
on June 9, 1983, and siped on Sejteubar 28, 1983. It became effective on
Janur 26, 1984. The project was thus brought from project identification to
loan effectiveness in a comparatively short periud of 18 months.
1.12        leeMntation Schedule. AMoording to the Loan Agreewent, the
project was scheduled to be completed by December 31, 19C  but the project was
not completed until June 30, 1990 although physical construction works were
substantially completed by aid-1989. The main reasons for the delays are:
(a) Cabinet frequently was unable -to provide timely approval of civil
works contracts prepared by DOE;
(b)  DOR in many cases took time to negotiate reductions in prices of
low bidders for civil works;
(C)  Improvez..zts on provincial roads, in terms of km, expanded 7%
beyond plan; and
(d) Technical as;istance extended to June 1990.
1.13      As to point (a), the Bank on a nmber of occasions urged the
Covermnent to expedite Cabinet approvals but the problem continued over a
period of many months. Concerning point (b), the Bank strongly advised DOE in
several conmunications to discontinue the practice of negotiating reduced
prices with low bidders (para. 1.15). Finally, point (c) and (d) reflect the
fact that sufficient funds remained in the project to enable Goverment to
expand its activities in these categories. Some reallocation of the loan was
accordingly accomplished on October 16, 1987.
1.14      ProcMuement.  The principal procurement under the project was
contractor services for civil works under international competitive bidding by
prequalLfied firms. Invitation of bids, and their evaluation, for the initial
group of civil works contracts was accomplished soon after board approval.
Ninety two firms were prequalified. In July 1983, the firms were invited to
bid on 350 km of roads. The first notices to proceed with construction were
issued in April 1984.
1.15      The main pr    as that arose in the procurement process have
already been noted above (para. 1.12): (a) considerable delays occurred in
DOB obtaining Cabinet approval of contracts; and (b) delays were incurred
because DOE, in many cases, taking the view that lowest bids exceeded cost
estimates by substantial amounts as required by the Bank's Procurement



-4-
G'udIne&s, neoptiated reductLos in prices vith loost bidders.  In Septmber
1984, the Bank urpd that the practLce of negotiatng price redctions be
dsconr4med, stating that it was not only coutrary to Bak procedures but
also not In the 'Long ter  interest of DOE. In April 1986, DO  explained the
ifficulty DCO end other  overmet organizations were experiencing in
resolving this issue vitbin goverent but it assured the Bank that "no
further deviation froc the Bank's GuLdelines vii further exist.'
Subsequently, the practice was limited to exceptionl cases.
1.16      Procureme t of coxultant services for stwdies, detailed
engieering a   technical assistance was carried out In accordance vith Bank
Guidelines. For thfe fsibLity studies and        neering the Goverment
selected consulta;s vbo had previously doe similar vork for DOE. For the
Intercity and Rural Bus Transport study, consultants were selected on the
basis of competitive technical proposals. The Bank had ample opportunity to
review consultant terms of reference, study proposals and consultant reports
during project implementation.
1.17      Proiect Costs. The estimated cost of the Second Provincial Roads
Project at appraisal was US$166.60 million. The final cost is about US$154.26
million, as shown in Table E5 in Part III. The 7.9% decrease in total project
cost Ls due to the strong competition among bidders for civil works contracts,
a number of cases of negotiations of reductions in prices of low bidders and
the devaluation of the Baht of about 11%. Also, the Baht was devalued by
about 11% during project execution from B 23.0 per US dollar in mid-1983 to
B 25.8 in early 1990; thus same project cost savings were realized. While the
1,073 km of provincial roads iz roveueats exceeded the 1,000 km estimAte, thb
977 km of paved roads strenr-;aened cad rehabilitated was somewhat less than
the 1,000 km estimate. The actual cost of the improvement of provincial roads
represented only 68% of the appraisal estimate for this component while the
actual costs of and rehabilitation of paved roads constituted 133% of the
appraisal estimate for this project component, largely as a result of
increased standards due to higher than expected traffic increases.
..18      Disbursements.  The loan was disbursed over si% years (1984-
November 1990), or two years longer than expected at appraisal. On October
16, 1987, pursuant to governmentvs request, the Bank cancelled US$4.75 million
of the loan. By the original closing date of June 30, 1988, 89% of the loan
was disbursed. The closing date was extended two tiznes to June 3D, 1990.
Disbursements against commitments made prior to this date continued umtil
November 21, 1990 and the undisbursed amount of US$0.96 mLllion Was cancelled
and the loan account was closed. The estimated and actual rates of
disbursements are shown in Table 3a of Part III of this report, and the
original and final allocarions of the loan are in Table 3b.
F.  Prolect Results
1.19      Objectives Met. Overall, the project vas successful in meetng its
principal objectives of upgrading the rural transport infrastructure and
preserving or rehabilitating deteriorated trunk roads. In addition, the



project strengthend istitutions responsiblo for higwas and road transport
through technical assistane and spcial studies,
1.20      Physical Results. 7h. project improved 38 sections of provincial
roads with a total length of 1,073 ka and 35 sections of national and
provincial paved roads with a total length of 977 ka. In tem of road
length, the origial estimate of paving 1,000 km of provincial roads was
exceeded by 7.30 while the 1,000 km estimte for the other component wa not
quite reached--a shortfall of 2.3%--but road length is not always a good
measure of physical results, particularly for rehabilitation of nationl paved
roads; sae project sections of tho latter category were mti-lane
facilitis    terchges or had major bridge structures while other sections
of roa were relatively modest dual-lane facilities. In fact, when account is
taken of the magpitde of the works involved In some paved road section, the
accomplishments for this component were greater than had been anticipated at
appraisal.
1.21      Siidv Results. A two-phased study of the trucking industry was
carried out by consultants with the finl report completed in 1988.
Similarly, consultants carried out tw- phased study of intercity and rural bus
transport, the finAl report was submitted in July 1990. These studies found
that the truck and Lntercity bus industries were quite efficient in many ways
but particular improvements were needed. A nwuber of specific improvenents,
liberalization of certain regulation and adjustment of road user charges for
truCk.s, were..reCmcerded in the reports. Because of gover5mmnt's central role
in the regulation of these industries and its fandam       role in implementing
the required improvenentt, it is reviewing the recommendations.
1.22      Eon_omLe Rate of Return. Under the criteria used in selecting
provincial road sections for improvement, only those roads having an economic
return of at least 12%, based on firm cost estimates (detailed engineering
costs), were eligible for funding under the projeet.  The initial group of
roads included in the project had economic returns at appraisal of 13% to 50%.
In selecting additional provincial roads for the project, DOE used the same
criterion of 12  minimum economic return.  The actual costs of improvements in
provincial rosds were, in nearly all cases, lower than the appraisal
estimates. Actual traffic levels on the provincial road sections have in some
cases been higher and in other cases lower than appraisal forerasts. Based on
cost and traffic considerations, the weighted average (by road construction
costs) of the re-evaluated economic rates of return for the provincial road
sections, was found to be 23%, the same as the comparable average of appraisal
estimates.
1.23      With regard to the streugthening and rehabilitation of national and
provincial roads, a minimum economic rate of return of 15% was established at
appraisal as the basic criterion for eligibility. Some eligible project roads
were then found to have prelidminary economic returns  over 20%.  Actual costS,
however, were generally about 33% higher than the preliminary appraisal costs,
due to increased standards (para. 1.17), a factor which tends to lower the
economic returns. A favorable factor, hovever, influencing the economic
returns is the actual traffic experienced since construction was completed;



traffic levels have been generally higber than apaisal estimtes.  Based on
actual cost and traffic data, the weighted avere (by road constrtion cost)
of the re-evaluated economic rates of return for the reoabilitation roads was
fomd to be 57%, which is higher than the 48% weighted average estimated at
appraisal.
1.24     Proieect Imawt. The project has enabled motor vehicle operators to
operate at higher aeage speeds on the roads which were Improved or
rehabilitated. Also, the costs of vehcle operation on these roads have been
reduced. Comercial truckers and bus operators, oerati  in a highly
capetitive   vironmenc, bhae passed on to farmers, busines  fizas and
consumrs much of the benfits realized from the road works. Accordingly, the
project has stimlated genral economic development in al regions of the
coumtzy.
G.  ProLject Sustaitailitv
1.25     The benefits from the project, in ter=s of savings in vehicle
operating costs and general stimlation -of devlopmnat, are likely to be
s-Astaisaed during the economic life of the various road sections improved or
rehabilitated, provided DOB maintailn these roads in an appropriate and timely
aaner. The principal risk to sustainaility of benefits is that future road
mairnteance budgets may not be adequate to provide the level of maintenance
required. It is importat to recognize, however, that the provision of
adequate funds for road  aintenance has been a requirement in a ==ber of
highway projects and in recent years the Goverment bas generally complied
with these requirements.
E.   snk -Performance
1.26     The Bank made a significant contribution, through the project, to
the physical and institutional development of the transport sector. Bank
staff brought the well-designed project from identification to appraisal in a
remarkably short period of time. Moreover, supervision of the project by Bank
staff was efficient and effective.
I.   Borrower Performanee
1.27     Execution of the project by the borrower was, in general,
satisfactory. One problem, beyond the control of DOB, was the long delays
ez'erienced in obtaining Cabinet approval of a considerable number of civil
works contracts, as discussed elsewhere in this report. The other problem was
the practice, in a number of cases, of DOE negotiating with low bidders to
reduce prices, contrary to Bank Guidelines on procurement; after some time,
Ihis practice was substantially reduced.
1.28     A reviev of Borrower performance with regard tn special covenants
in the Loan Agreemnt, as detailed in Part III, Item G, indicate that
compliance was generally satisfactory. The principal lesson learned from the
project is that DOB is a mature organization capable of completing projects
withii budgets.  Therefore, sector lending in Thailand is well justified.

PROECT CMISff REPORT
SECOD PROVINCIAL ROADS PROJECT
{LOAN 2311-TN)
PART I1.  PROJECT REVU RM(TN! BOU          S  PM==
A.   PerfotMee of the BAn
2.1       The Project was closely monitored by the Bank. During the period
of the loan, the Baak a:tively played a constructive role in many parts of
L2an Project.  Provincial Roads Imrovemet ProLgrm and Highway Reobilitation
Program were successfully completed. The D0O gained benefft' from the studies
for about 2,500 1a of highway rehabilitation vorks as a guidelines in
conducting highway progrmuing as vell as in detailed engineering of feasible
road projects. The Back also achieved other parts of the Project such as a
study of inter-city and rural bus transport and other transport sector
studies, and provision of teocbnical assistance for DOE's "Revolving Fundd
management system for maintenance equipment, DMN's program for road
maintenance and TM's transport sector studies.
2.2       The Bank sent several supervision missions over the Loan period and
the aissions gave wuach useful advice to DOE and its staff. The bank agreed in
expandi-n construction component based on cost savings and extended the loan
clusing date to Juwe 30, 1990 so that inpleaentation could be accomplished and
DOE could utilize the proceeds of the loan to the fullest.
B.  PerfoTuance of Executing AVencv
2.        Mhe Evecuting Agency, DOE, which had significant experience on
previous highway projects financed by the Bank, contributed significantly to
the efficient implementation of the Loan Project. The DON demonstrated
adequate technical capability for pla=ing, design, construction and
maintenance of roads. Although delays occurred during contract negotiations
with the consultants and in disburiement processing, decisions and judgment
made by the DON were generally sound and prompt. Delays in awarding contracts
both for consultants and contractors were caused mainly by the Government's
administrative procedures rather than by the DOH.
2.4       The DOH provided sufficient authoritative and administrative staff
and organizations for the Loan Project in order to complete all project
components efficiently, and from tine to time reviewed and improved their
performance. The Bank was provided with all the required project data,
documentation and reports.
C.  Relationshi_ between the Bank and the EMxecutinF Agenev
2.5       Throughout the loan period, the Lank   d the Executing Agency, DOE,
developed good cooperation. The Bank in many was assisted DOH in



v9g
accomplishing the projects uder the loan, especially  in the procet of
contractors, so that DMH could cope with the schedule. In brief, the
relationshp betwee  the Bak and the DOE ran effectively and eveny during
the evolution and implementation of the project.
2.6       The DOE reviewed Part I and III of the Project Comletion Report
which were prepared by the Bank. There is no cot on the analysis
contained in Part I. The factual io      o    contained in Part IN  is
aAequate and accurate.
D.  Economic Je-evaluation
2.7       The economc evaluation of each project road was carried out for
each road by comparing the costs of constructing and maintaining the road with
the anticipated benefits from the improvement over its assumed life (15
years). The economic costs of the project represent outlays, net of tazes and
duties, for the feasibility study, enginsering design, construction, and
supervision of construction. Also included were costs of routine maintenance
and periodic resurfacing required to maintain the standa rd of the road surface
with and withbot the project.  The benefits taken into account in the economic
analysis were savings in vehicle oper.ting costs. The development benefits
were also considered where appropriate.
2.8      Vehicle operating costs were calculated for the eight types of
vehicles using the road, i.e., motorcycle (MC), ears (PC), light bus (LS),
medium bus (HB), heavy bus (EB), light truck (LT), medium truck (ST), and
heavy truck (ET). Ihe basic running and fixed costs by vehicle type, road
surface and geometric condition, and operating speed were derived.
2.9       For economic reevaluation, it was possible to carry out traffic
counts to determine the actual traffic using the road during ~988-1990.  Also,
as a basis for estimating the travel distance savings accruing 4. this
traffic, the Post Evaluation Section of DOE nidertook, concurrently with
traffic counts, new origin-destination (O-D) surveys for some roads. O-D
survey results were used to prepare trip matrices, showing the nmber of trips
between zones by type of vehicles. From these matrices and questionnaires,
based mainly an reduced travel distances, it was possible to assign traffic to
highway network with and without the project. The comparisons of actual and
forecast traffic in 1990 are shown in Table 11-1 and II-2. Traffic (MADT) in
1990 varied on the project roads from about 200 vehicles per day (vpd) to
3,100 vpd for provincial roads project and from about 800 vpd to 11,000 vpd
for rehabilitation project.
2.10      For provincial roads project, actual traffic volumes in 1990 on
15 roads were less than the projections by between 4% and 51%. However,
actual traffic on the 23 remaining roads exceeded projections by between 7%
and 201%. The reestimated economic internal rates of return (EIRR) are
summarized in Table II-3. The overall economic internal rate of return for
the 38 provincial roads was 22.9%. The estimated economic rates of return for
20 roads were higher than the feasibility study estimates while for the
remaining 18 roads they were less.



- 10 -
2.11     For rehabilitation romas project, actual traffic volumes in 1990 on
20 roads vere less than the projections by between 4% and 76%. Rover,
actual. traffic on the 15 remainin  roads eeceded projectioLs by between 5%
n  95%. The re-estimated economic intermal rates of retumn (Eu) are
suarized in Table IT-4. The overall economic internal rate of return for
the 35 rehabilitation project roads was 57%. The re-estimated economic rates
of reurn for 26 rds were higher than  e feaslbiUty study estimates, while
for the remaining 9 roads they were less.
2.12     The overall economic internal rate of return for the 73 provincial
roads and rehabiLtation project roads was 42.4%.
