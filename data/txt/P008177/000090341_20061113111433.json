Lessons learned from the project: an\n            investment loan is not the appropriate vehicle to achieve or\n            consolidate sector reform. Power sector reform should be\n            based on a realistic assessment of the political economy and\n            prospects for acceptance of this reform. Tariff adjustments\n            reflecting costs of service ensured national power company\n            (UTE's) financial viability. Difficulty of establishing\n            efficiency incentives in the case of profit-making SOEs.\n            Budget restrictions imposed by the Government on UTE\n            hampered investment levels.
