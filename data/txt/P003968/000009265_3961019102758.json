     and demand of, textbooks. This will be achieved through\n            establishing government policies, regulations, procedures,\n            and practices related to school books, and making textbooks\n            available in classrooms in sufficient quantity and in a\n            sustainable way. Specifically, the project will support: 1)\n            provision of textbooks in all required subjects, for all\n            children in primary (SD) and junior secondary (SLTP)\n            schools, public and private, giving priority attention to\n            poor children; 2) procurement of the SLTP textbooks from\n            private publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a transparent\n            and rigorous evaluation and approval process, with the\n            objective of achieving a high quality in the books; 3)\n            greater involvement at the provincial level, through\n            implementing the procurement process for SLTP textbooks at\n            the Kanwil level; 4) giving help to teachers in how to use\n            the books better in the classroom; and 5) the promotion of\n            reading, especially for children."}, "docdt": "1995-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
