The lessons learned indicate that the Bank\n            and Government should have been doubly careful to ensure\n            that procurement procedures, both the technical evaluation\n            of textbooks and the bidding thereafter, were fair, open,\n            and transparent. Universal school-level procedures for the\n            initial distribution of textbooks and mechanisms to monitor\n            and ensure that they are returned at the end of the school\n            year should be developed and widely disseminated at the\n            beginning of the project. These mechanisms should include\n            (i) titles and numbers of copies of books distributed to\n            teachers, (ii) lists of books distributed to each student,\n            (iii) records of whether the students return the books, (iv)\n            transparent penalties for failure to return the books\n            (normally, the student or the parents should pay for the\n            missing book), and (v) widespread information-sharing on\n            these measures at the beginning of the school year, so that\n            parents and students know what is expected. Textbook\n            projects should include carefully designed Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems that attempt to measure the\n            impact of new books on student learning and compare the\n            effectiveness of various textbooks for achieving curricula objectives."}, "docdt": "2004-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
