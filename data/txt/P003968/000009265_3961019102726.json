Specifically, the project will support: 1)\n            provision of textbooks in all required subjects, for all\n            children in primary (SD) and junior secondary (SLTP)\n            schools, public and private, giving priority attention to\n            poor children; 2) procurement of the SLTP textbooks from\n            private publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a transparent\n            and rigorous evaluation and approval process, with the\n            objective of achieving a high quality in the books; 3)\n            greater involvement at the provincial level, through\n            implementing the procurement process for SLTP textbooks at\n            the Kanwil level; 4) giving help to teachers in how to use\n            the books better in the classroom; and 5) the promotion of\n            reading, especially for children."}, "docdt": "1995-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
