basis, the efficiency and impact\n            of rural development efforts. The project will improve the\n            beneficiaries' standards of living, incomes, and\n            employment opportunities. It will support water resource\n            development for both production and consumption, adaptive\n            agricultural research and rural extension, rural investment\n            credit, marketing services, funding for community\n            sub-projects, and state project coordination. The Northeast\n            Rural Development Program-Sergipe Project will also provide\n            support for regional program administration and regional\n            agricultural research and research coordination. The\n            regional activities will assist in the implementation of\n            rural development projects in all ten Northeast states,\n            thereby benefitting an estimated 600,000 farm families\n            expected to be reached during the first five-year phase of\n            the Northeast Rural Development Program."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
