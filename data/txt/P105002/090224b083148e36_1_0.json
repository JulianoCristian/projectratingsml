communities through developing\n            infrastructure services. In 1998, Indonesia faced political\n            upheaval and financial crisis. The country was marred by its\n            graft-ridden political and administrative systems and\n            poverty had increased tremendously. Non-income poverty was a\n            serious problem in terms of high malnutrition and maternal\n            mortality rates, inadequate access to safe water and\n            sanitation, and education outcomes. Furthermore, inequality\n            was increasing and disparities between regions remained\n            high. Poverty alleviation had become a priority for\n            Indonesia. To accelerate government efforts to reduce\n            poverty and to ensure equity and inclusiveness, National\n            Program for Community Empowerment Program named Nasional\n            Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM), was announced by the\n            government. With technical and financial assistance from the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\n            PNPM became a national program covering all villages and\n            cities in the country. PNPM Urban and PNPM Rural  Programs\n            have built or rehabilitated over 62,000 kilometers of roads,\n            11,000 clean water supply units, 11,000 irrigation schemes,\n            6,500 kilometers of drainage, 17,500 village health posts\n            and 10,000 new schools. Community participation in\n            PNPM-Rural and PNPM-Urban is high. Also small\n            poverty-reduction initiatives were be folded into the PNPM\n            to make programming at the community level more streamlined,\n            coordinated and responsive to beneficiaries\u2019 needs."}, "docdt": "2010-04-27T09:21:05Z"}
