The goal of this program is to empower rural and\n            urban communities to proactively participate in development.\n            PNPM will nurture the solidarity and spirit of cooperation\n            within the community for self-help. The PNPM Support\n            Facility (PSF) provides support to the Government of\n            Indonesia's management and technical implementation of\n            the overall PNPM Mandiri program, and harmonizes donor\n            contributions. Through PSF, donors can provide high-quality,\n            coordinated technical assistance, planning advice and\n            dialogue, as well as targeted financial assistance to the\n            Government of Indonesia (GOI) in support of PNPM Mandiri.\n            The overall objective of PSF is to assist the GOI in\n            providing the most effective leadership and management of\n            the PNPM Mandiri. Its specific objectives are to: a) ensure\n            better coordination across grants and amongst donors\n            supporting PNPM Mandiri; b) develop capacity at all levels\n            to plan, manage, and improve poverty reduction programs; c)\n            reduce poverty through government and civil society\n            partnerships; and d) support high quality monitoring and\n            evaluation. The GOI is committed to maximizing management\n            effectiveness during the PNPM Mandiri scale-up and\n            developing capacity at the local government level. Toward\n            this end, General Guidelines were issued to ensure that all\n            involved parties, including all levels of government and\n            PNPM Mandiri implementing staff, have the same understanding\n            of PNPM Mandiri's principles and mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
