Any Other Special Procurement Arrangements:
The Sub-District Grants will finance subprojects/ activities of beneficiary village(s)/ groups  which are demand driven in nature, 
making it difficult to determine 
ex-ante what is to be procured
. Sub-district Grants can be used for services, technical assistance to villages, goods, training, scholarships, sub-loan as 
revolving funds for women groups, except goods or works that are in the negative list. Economic and technical feasibility of village proposals are assessed and 
verified by 
the oversight facilitators and two members of the village and sub-district council
. All funded proposals are attached to an Implementation 
Agreement signed by the member of the subproject proponent and the facilitators.  All the facilitators should have the necessary technical qualification and 
receive proper training in procurement.
Procurement of sub-projects under the Sub-district Grant will be conducted by the Village Activity Implementation Teams (Tim Pelaksana Kegiatan – TPK) and 
will  use Community Participation approach. Communities take ownership of all aspect of the subproject, from planning and decision making to implementation. 
Community participation is emphasized in particular among the poor and women. Participation should be broad based, but and decision is made through village wide meetings.  
 The communities should ensure that procurement of  works/goods/services are purchased with an acceptable quality and reasonable price that warrants the principle of economy and efficiency, competition and transparency.  Procurement packages under the funded sub-projects/ activities will be determined by the village community meeting and the implementation of the procurement process, evaluation, award and obtained price of purchase by the TPKs will be disclosed in regular public accountability meetings in the village and inter village forums. Procurement of works for instance, may use community participation to mobilize and pay local labors and the construction materials may be procured to local ‘home industry’ suppliers at a reasonable price. Goods, such as furniture for school, can be procured by purchasing only the raw materials (wood, tools, etc.) and then pay the cost of labors for the production e.g. pay local carpenters to make the furniture. 
 The community may also opt  to procure the works/ goods  through a competition process with similar arrangements in the ongoing PNPM Rural 1 and 2 project: for procurement with an estimated contract value of less than IDR 15 million (around USD 1,500 equivalent), a price comparison of at least three quotations is conducted prior to awarding the contract to the offer with acceptable quality and lowest in price; for procurement of above IDR 15 million, the TPK invites at least three suppliers to submit written proposals at a certain time and date. A public proposal opening is arranged at the Village Forum or Inter-village Forum at the Kecamatan level. The methods and related forms to be used are described in the project manual.
