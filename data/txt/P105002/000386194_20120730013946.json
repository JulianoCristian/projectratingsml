     Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project for Indonesia\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            adoption and funding by the government: a popular and robust\n            series of Bank-led projects with demonstrated success in\n            rural poverty reduction and improved governance, can lead to\n            a massive national program led and largely funded by the\n            Government. It can also mobilize significantly increased\n            counterpart funding, at national and local levels, to\n            achieve country-wide coverage. The use of a Multi donor\n            Trust Fund improved implementation and successful\n            experimentation: a successful series of projects, thoroughly\n            evaluated, documented and publicized, can attract bilateral\n            donors through linked trust funds and parallel financing\n            operations. Rapid and large scaling up of a program's\n            operation can exceed institutional capacity: in Program\n            Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM)-rural first and\n            second, the major expansion of the scope and scale of the\n            project following its adoption as a national program, put\n            severe stress on the institutional capacities at the\n            national level, especially Directorate General of Village\n            Community Empowerment (PMD) and for the National Management\n            Consultant (NMC). Evaluation studies and use of their\n            findings: well-conceived and targeted evaluations can\n            provide solid evidence of what works and what doesn't\n            work in the implementation of a program such as PNPM.\n            Findings from such studies can provide policy\n            recommendations to make improvements to project design and\n            implementation, and also help to determine the future\n            direction of the program."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
