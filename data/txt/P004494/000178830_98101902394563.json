objectives of the Petroleum\n            Exploration Project are the rekindling of interest of oil\n            companies in exploration for oil and gas in the Philippines,\n            and the extension of exploration activites to relatively\n            unexplored onshore areas; strengthening the exploration\n            capacity and technical capabilities of the two implementing\n            entities is a further important objective. BED's\n            proposed program consists of: (a) an aeromagnetic survey;\n            (b) offshore seismic surveys; and (c) regional basin\n            evaluations over 15 onshore and offshore areas integrating\n            the newly acquired data. The results of this countrywide\n            assessment of the petroleum prospects, which would highlight\n            areas where immediate further exploration was warranted,\n            would be assembled in the form of a promotional package\n            available to any interested oil company. PNOC's\n            proposed program comprises a step-wise exploration program\n            in each of three or more onshore areas and includes: (a)\n            gravity surveys and geological studies; (b) 4,400 line km of\n            land seismic surveys; (c) drilling of 6 wells if warranted;\n            and (d) technical assistance, training and seismic data reprocessing."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
