TUNISIA HOTEL T.RAIN7NG PROJECT
(Loan 1029-TUN)
P R E F A C E
Loan 1029-TUN for the Hotel Training Project was signed on July 17,
1974. The loan, for US$5.6 million, was closed on December 31, 1980;
$0.1 million was cancelled. During implementation, the project's content was
revised and the closing date was postponed.
This report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by
the EMENA Urban Division. The PCR is based on a review of files and
documents, interviews with Bank and Borrower staff, and a visit to Tunisia in
October, 1980.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting°, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion Report
was sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
(Loan 1029-TUN)
H I G H L I G H T S
1.       The Tunisia Hotel Training Project was the only free-standing Bank
project focused on the provision of facilities and programs for training hotel
staff. The objectives of the project were (1) to provide the facilities
necessary for training sufficient hotel staff for a burgeoning tourism
industry; and (2) to prepare a unified training system from the various
systems which had been in force.
2.       Tourism had grown in Tunisia from 53,000 to 1.6 million foreign
visitors between 1962 and 1980 and vied with petroleum as the leading earner
of foreign exchange for the country. In 1980, there were about 29,000 persons
employed in the hotel industry in Tunisia, growing at a rate of 8% per annum.
In this environment, hotel training at the vocational level had lagged behind
the sector's growth all through the 1960's and 70's.
3.       The project is generally considered to have been a turning point in
tourism policy in Tunisia. The success of the project was instrumental in
embarking the Government on a policy course which has resulted in improved
quality of service in hotels; higher income for those entering the field; more
professionalism in the sector; and better management of the industry's plant.
The institutions built under the project are now successful in training staff
and also have proven most useful as meeting places for important national and
international events.
3.       The following points may be of particular interest:
-    the importance of realistic programming required for implementation,
particularly regarding start-up. Nonetheless, including delays in
start-up, the project was prepared, executed and completed in 8 and a
half years (PCR paras. 3.01, 3.11-3.13);
-    originally, it had been planned to operate the schools year-round
with a continuous curriculum. This proved infeasible for a number of
structural reasons (academic year, vacations, etc.). The authorities
have, nonetheless, managed to utilize the facilities on a 12-month
basis by scheduling seminars and conferences;
-    the project was modified from three to two training establishments in
line with revised estimates of demand; and
-    the Tunisian authorities showed resourcefulness in developing a
management approach (creation of a management company) which had not
been foreseen at appraisal.



TUNISIA
HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01          One of the major constraints to development of tourism in
Tunisia in the 1960s and 1970s, was the acute shortage of trained hotel
staff. Funds were therefore included in the Tourism Infrastructure Project
(Loan No. TUN-858; Credit No. TUN-329) to study ways of expanding and
rationalizing the country's tourism training system. The study, entrusted
to ILO, was completed late in 1973.
1.02          The Bank has been closely associated with the development of
tourism in Tunisia. It helped finance tourism investments through lines
of credit to the Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET);
IFC has participated in hotel financing through BDET and Compagnie Financiere
Touristique (COFIT) and was an investor in a large hotel and in the Sousse
North tourism development scheme.
1.03          The Office National du Tourisme Tunisien (ONTT) is the agency
responsible for the tourism sector in Tunisia, and it executed this project.
It is a semi-autonomous agency, under the aegis of the Ministry of the
National Economy, and has a diversified role in the sector. It sets sectoral
policy in cooperation with Ministry of the Plan. ONTT is responsible for:
generic marketing of the Tunisian product for which it maintains a marketing
department in Tunis and 14 offices abroad; hotel training through its 7 hotel
schools; planning tourism development; executing infrastructural works;
administration of tourism investments; collection of tourism statistics;
quality control in hotels, and ensuring that hotels follow reasonable pricing
policies; and relations with tour operators.
Sources of Information
1.04          This Project Completion Report is based on information drawn
from the Project Appraisal Report (No. 411a-TUN of May 23, 1974), and a review
of Bank files which included supervision reports and progress reports prepared
by the Borrower. A mission visited Tunisia in March-April 1981 to obtain
additional information. Discussions were held with the ONTT, government
officials, and project consultants.
The Tourism Sector
1.05          Tourism in Tunisia is mainly beach-oriented, augmented by
excursions to archaeological and historical sites. Local handiscrafts are
also an important aspect of the product. Most of the activity is during
the high season - from April 1 to October 31, although the season is longer
in Djerba and in the south.  From 1962 to 1980, international arrivals increased



from 53,000 to 1.6 million and the number of hotel beds from 4,000 to 71,000.
There were 396,000 international bedrLights recorded in 1962; by 1980, these
had grown to 12.1 million. Occupancy rates were 58.2% in 1962 and 60% in 1980.
Direct employment in tourism has reached 28,675 and indirect employment is
estimated at 75,000. As a result of this major growth, tourism vied with
petroleum to become the single most important source of foreign exchange.
Gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased from TD 53.8 million
(US$130.9 million) or 25.3% of current receipts in 1971 to TD 259.8 million
(US$631.1 million) or 24.5% of all fcreign exchange receipts in 1980 (Table 1).
Employment, Education and Training
for the Hotel Industry
1.06          The Tunisian hotel industry employs about 0.34 persons per bed.
In 1973, there were about 19,500 employees in hotels or 2% of total full-time
employment in Tunisia; indirect employment related to the tourism industry
accounted for an estimated additional 19,000. In 1980, there were 28,675
employees in hotels directly (still about 2% of the work force); in addition
there are about 75,000 employed indirectly.
1.07          Although ONTT is responsible for hotel training, the Office des
Travailleurs Tun:Lsiens a l'Etranger, de l'Emploi et de la Formation
Professionnelle (OTTEEFP), an agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs, is
in charge of a hotel apprenticeship program as a part of the national
apprenticeship program. At the time of appraisal, hotel apprenticeship
courses were offered in eight vocational training centers distributed through-
out the country.
1.08          ONTT is in charge of vocational training for middle and upper
level hotel staff. At the time of appraisal, it operated seven schools
located at Bizerte, La Marsa, Sidi Dhrif, Sousse, Monastir, and Djerba, only
the last of which had been built for the purpose. (The others were located
in former barracks.) It also operated the Institut Superieur de Tourisme et
d'Hotellerie (Institute) at Monastir which provided teacher training and training
for supervisory staff. In the 1960s and 1970s, ONTT adopted two successive
approaches to tourism training. The first, the "polyvalent" method (designed
to train students in several specialties) was dropped in 1968 in favor of a
system which trained students in one specialty only.
1.09          Both programs had a number of weaknesses.  Physical facilities
were inadequate, curricula were inconsistent as a result of numerous, conflict-
ing, bilateral technical assistance programs; and qualified, experienced teachers
too few.  Communications with the private sector were poor.  Diplomas had no
legal recognition, which created dissatisfaction amongst graduates and compli-
cated the hiring process for hotel operators.  As a result of these weaknesses,
training programs failed to respond to the needs of the industry.  The combined
output of these programs totaled 720 in 1972, as against the hotel industry's
annual requirements of 2,500 trained staff. Hotel operators found that the
proficiency of the staff graduated by either program left much to be desired.
1.10          The structure of hotel jobs in Tunisia includes six levels.
Level I covers top management and nornally requires the baccalaureate plus



- 3 -
training in a hotel management school (the Institute or abroad). Level II
covers middle management (e.g., personnel manager) and senior supervisory
staff (e.g., maitre dthotel). The normal entry requirements for Level II
are the baccalaureate followed by courses at the Institute, or alternatively,
a period of training abroad. Levels III and IV cover such personnel as
waiters and cooks and normally require four to seven years of secondary
education for entry. Level V are those who enter the industry by way of
the apprenticeship program, and completed primary education is the normal
entry requirement. Level VI staff are those who require only minor on-the-
job training.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION
2.01          ILO was engaged by the Tunisian Government to prepare the
project with funding provided under the Tourism Infrastructure Project. Super-
vision missions for the infrastructure project initially supervised progress
on preparation of the hotel training project; field work for the project
appraisal was carried out in January 1974; negotiations took place on May 8-14,
1974; and the loan received Board approval on June 11, 1974.
Project Preparation
2.02          The ILO preparation team was resident in Tunisia from February 1976
to October 1977 and worked closely with ONTT's training department. On balance,
the project preparation study was well prepared, clarified ideas on the project
concept, and presented a project which was refined but remained substantially
unchanged through appraisal.
Alternative Components
(Tourism, Mlaintenance Staff)
2.03          The ILO technical assistance team initially suggested the inclusion
of tourism staff, i.e., guides and travel agents, and hotel maintenance workers
in the project. The ONTT and the Bank agreed, however, that tourism staff
training could be satisfactorily carried out by the Institute, and maintenance
training by OTTEEFP. While the Institute is performing its role well, OTTEEFP
has not developed a separate program within its structure for instruction in
hotel maintenance.
Appraisal
2.04          The appraisal mission accepted the major recommendations of the
ILO team that: three training centers be included in the project, each with a
practice hotel; the training period be about one school year; and the curriculum
for the new schools be introduced in all hotel schools in Tunisia; and that
training be given at Level IV (see para. 1.10).
2.05          The appraisal mission agreed that any expansion of the hotel
training program should focus primarily on Level IV for full-time training and
on part-time refresher and upgrading courses to Level III, accounting for almost
two-thirds of hotel staff.



- 4. -
2.06          ONTT's Department of Tourism Training was inadequately staffed
to run the training system. It was to be strengthened by the appointment of
a deputy director in consultation with the Bank. This appointment was a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. The Deputy Director
was to supervise the work of a planning unit, to be created with ONTT's
Department of Tourism Training, with specific responsibility for establishing
the number of teachers required and students to be trained.
Issues
2.07          Issues raised upon the mission's return are contained on the
Issues Paper dated February 19, 1974, and decisions taken in the Decision
Memorandum dated March 7, 1974. It was agreed that funds would be included in
the project for the foreign cost of technical assistance but that, nonetheless,
the Tunisians would be invited to find alternate sources of funding for
technical assistance; that promulgation of decrees on the teacher training
section, and training of maintenance staff would be conditions of effectiveness;
and that drafts of other decrees (status of teachers, students, and diplomas)
should be brought to the negotiations; that local costs would not be financed;
and that funds would be granted, and not on-lent, to ONTT by the Government.
2.08          Additional questions were raised including the choice of a
school with a practice hotel over institutional training (as the Bank had not
financed such undertakings before), manpower projections, and organization and
management. Whereas the solution including a practice hotel has proven to be
reasonable, both the demand projecticons and project organization required
substantial revision; the manpower projections proved optimistic (para. 3.16),
and the institutional arrangements were improved considerably during implement-
ation (paras. 5.01, 5.02).
Targets and Goals
2.09          As shown in Table 2, it. was expected that the stock of employees
at Level IV in Tunisian hotels would increase from 9,400 in 1974 to 25,000 in
1983. During the same period, the flow of new staff requirements was expected
to increase from 2,400 to 3,800 annually. These forecasts were based on the
assumption that 8,000 beds would be added annually over a ten year period and
that each new bed would create 0.208 jobs at Level IV and that the annual staff
attrition rate would be 8%.
Covenants
2.10          Thie Loan and Project Agreements called for certain legislative,
regulatory, and administrative measures which were considered of sufficient
importance to warrant recapitulation in a side letter dated July 17, 1974.
The following actions had to be taker: (i) legal recognition of diplomas
and certificates issued by ONTT's hotel training schools was to be sought;
(ii) internal regulations for the schools were to be prepared; (iii) methods
to ensure student placement according to the level each has achieved were
to be devised, as well as a way to fcllow their subsequent progress; (iv) a
covenant was to be designed to establish the rights, obligations, and status



of teachers; (v) an advisory board was to be created for each of the schools
to guide curriculum development and to assist in job placement; a National
Council for Hotel Training was to be established to advise ONTT on all policy
matters related to the training of tourism staff; (vi) another covenant
called for an agreement between ONTT and OTTEEFP for the latter to set up
and conduct courses in hotel maintenance; and (vii) to fill the gap in
available instructors, a hotel teacher training section was to be established
at the Institute.
Project Description
2.11          The project was to consist of three hotel training centers, each
comprising a hotel school, a 100-bed practice hotel, student dormitories, and
staff housing for administrative staff. About 12.5 man years of technical
assistance were also included for an educational program development and
implementation unit, and for a teacher training unit. Total project cost
was estimated at US$12.3 million equivalent.
2.12          Each school was to include classrooms, a language laboratory,
workshops, a training kitchen, a self-service restaurant, guest dining room
and bar, demonstration guestrooms and bathrooms, pantries and linen rooms, and
training offices for reception and accounting. The practice hotels were to be
open to the public and function commercially with all the departments and
services generally found in Tunisian 3-star hotels.
2.13          The technical assistance component provided for three expatriate
experts to work with Tunisian counterparts on detailed planning of new courses.
Similarly, five other foreign experts were to train teachers. Five Tunisian
staff were to become training inspectors at the end of the technical assistance
program.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Conditions of Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01          The original date of effectiveness was November 18, 1974.  It was
postponed four times to November 19, 1975; the Bank declared the project
effective on November 4, 1975.
3.02          In addition to the legal opinion on the Loan and Project Agree-
ments, other legal documents, and acquisition of project sites, conditions of
effectiveness included: appointment of a deputy director of training at ONTT;
entrusting the Direction des Travaux with additional powers and authority to
carry out the project; appointment of architects acceptable to the Bank for
final design; acquisition of the right of permanent occupancy in project sites;
and use (usufruct) of the land required for construction of the three centers.
3.03          Almost all the conditions were met without any problems.  The
only exception was land acquisition. A minor problem in obtaining one parcel
of land needed to complete the required land package in Hammamet caused a short



- 6 -
delay in beginning construction there. The Tunis site also presented a
problem as there was little suitable land available. Sites in the medina
(former palaces) and on Avenue Mohamed V were considered but were rejected as
being unsuitable, or they were simply unavailable. No suitable site was
found in Tunis proper and eventually a site in the Tunis North tourism zone
was identified and agreed to by the Bank. However, in view of downward
revision in tourist visits projections, analysis of which suggested that the
Tunis school might be unnecessary, the acquisition of the third site was
waived as a condit:ion of effectiveness by cable dated August 5, 1975.
Initial Problems of Project Execution
3.04          Technical Assistance.  Considerable delay was encountered in
starting the techn-ical assistance component. Originally, the project team
was to be in Tunis from April 1975, but did not start to arrive until
February 1976 when the project leader came. The arrival of team members
(Chart 1) was staggered, which affected the efficiency of the unit somewhat
in the early months of execution.
3.05          Aproval Process of Architects' Plans.  Project implementation
was delayed, inter alia, because of the lengthy process that ensued for the
approval of architectural plans. ONTT decided to have a two step design
process including the preparation of a preliminary project at the 1:500/1:200
scale. In retrospect, this was very useful because it allowed a general review
of architectural standards and space requirements before final design. The
Training centers were ultimately built according to the space requirements
defined at appraisal. However, this process proves to be longer than expected.
There were numerous exchanges between the Bank and ONTT about the plans.  The
most important of these was when the budget for the Hammamet center was
exceeded by 150%. Revisions were made accordingly. There was a six month
delay in the Sousse North architectural program due to difficulties in devel-
oping designs which satisfactorily incorporated the school, hotel, and student
housing. This was resolved, however, and the designs themselves were produced
expeditiously.
Revisions to Project
3.06          Third Center.  The major revision to the project was deletion of
the third center. The project had been prepared on the basis of projections
under the Third National Plan (1968-72) which envisaged annual increments to
hotel capacity of 8,000-8,500 beds per year. After the energy crisis starting
in late 1974, ONTT revised its demand projections downward for the Fourth Plan
(1973-76) and consequently its projections of additional capacity to 4,500
beds per annum. A supervision mission in early 1975 recommended deletion of
the third school but since the summer saason turned out to be one of high
tourist growth, a decision to postpone construction of the third school was
taken with the idea of building it after the other two centers were completed.
In 1976 and 1977, however, investment in hotels ground to a halt (see Sector
Review, November 1977 and PCR of Tourism Infrastructure Project) and consequently
the need for new personnel was considerably reduced. When the Government scaled
down its program for the expansion of the sector to 2,500 beds annually in the
Fifth Plan (1977-81), it became clear not only that construction should be
postponed, but also that construction of the third center would not be justified



- 7 -
at all within the life of the project. Since national training capacity,
including the training provided by the two centers that would remain in the
project, was expected to cover the needs of the sector adequately during the
Fifth Plan (Table 3), the Bank agreed to delete the third center and the
Project Agreement was amended in a letter dated July 20, 1979.
3.07          Hotel Management Company.  At appraisal it had been assumed
that each training center would have a director, a hotel school principal and
a hotel manager as the basic management team, and that each would be employed
by ONTT. It quickly became apparent that it would be difficult to attract
good hotel managers within the civil service pay scales and that commercial
practices would be difficult to implement within ONTT's administrative
framework. ONTT therefore created a company, the Societe de Gestion des
Hotels et des Restaurants (SOGHRA), which would manage the practice hotels
(and restaurants) for ONTT. This has proven successful and SOGHRA now manages
the practice hotels at Hammamet, Sousse North, and Sidi Dhrif. SOGHRA
believes that the size of the hotels (50 rooms each) is insufficient for peda-
gogical reasons and is trying to convince ONTT to extend the capacity to at
least 100 rooms in each hotel.
3.08          School Year.  The curriculum and training system as proposed by
ILO in the preparation report was adopted for implementation of the project.
Its basic features were year-round operation of the schools on a nine month
cycle with six sections each starting at staggered intervals. The result
was that there was no "school year" as such - students would arrive and
graduate on a continuous basis; teachers would take vacation at the end of a
cycle and, clearly, the vacation period would change each time since it was a
nine month cycle. This curriculum proved problematic and was not implemented.
Instead a more traditional school year from September to April was adopted
(Table 4). This had the advantage of (i) being simpler administratively, and
(ii)freeing students for employment at the beginning of the high season. At
the same time, the section on inventory control and store management was
integrated into the kitchen section and the basic bookkeeping and accounting
course was dropped as it is being taught in specialized collages.
3.09          Curriculum.  The curriculum of the hotel training system has
evolved since appraisal. There is now a logical educational program permitting
self improvement through a combination of practical experience and formal
education in ONTT's hotel schools (Table 4a). This is an important achieve-
ment of the project. The basic curriculum is a one year program leading to
a Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle (CAP, the basic level IV requirement);
minimal entry requirements for this program are the third year of secondary
education up to the seventh year. A student with the CAP has the option of
working for a year in a hotel and competing for a place in the Brevet
Technique Hotelier (BTH) program (Level III) which requires one additional year
at a specialized hotel school. After an additional year working in a hotel, a
student can, theoretically at least, present himself for the examination for
entry to the Brevet Technique Superieur (BTS) at the Institute of Sidi Dhrif
(Level II and as of 1981, Level I), which normally requires the baccalaureate.



3.10          The change in the curriculum has meant that it is more difficult
to maintain a high rate of utilizat:ion of the boarding and school facilities
under the basic program, especially during the summer when only the practice
hotels are in operation. ONTT was able to attain a rate of utilization of
about 70% in 1980 (Table 3) by offering part-time refresher and upgrading
courses and by sponsoring seminars and other training sessions. It must also
be noted that hotel schools have nol: been working at full capacity in the past
two years because of the slowdown in expansion of hotel capacity.
Implementation Schedule
3.11          Two sets of reasons accounted for the project being implemented
more slowly than expected (Chart 2). First, the whole project was delayed by
about a year because of delays in meeting.the conditions effectiveness
described above. Although the Direction des Travaux was given additional
powers in July 1974, a project director was not appointed until November 1974;
until then nobody was giving full attention to the project. Discussions
started with the architects when the director was appointed but stretched out
for a full six months before contracts were signed. These two factors combined
to push the entire project schedule back by about 18 months.
3.12          Second, although architectural plans were executed more quickly
than planned (9 months actual versus 11 months estimated), the approval of
tender documents between the Bank and ONTT took 9 months instead of the
4 originally forecast; this latter delay being due almost entirely to the slow
communication time between Tunis and Washington as well as some delays by the
Bank in evaluating documents. Conslruction therefore started one-and-a-half
years after the original date forecast.
3.13          Construction itself took 27 months compared to a forecast
21 months period. This six months delay resulted from an underground water
problem at Sousse, which required some minor redesign; the delay related to
acquisition of the Hammamet site; discovery of some Roman ruins which halted
work until permission from the authorities was given to proceed. The con-
struction company itself (which carried out civil works on both sites) was
overcommitted causing delays.
Reporting Requirements
3.14          ONTT was advised during negotiations of reporting requirements.
The quarterly progress reports arrived regularly until 1979 and fully described
the status of all aspects of the project. There was an unexplained lapse in
1979 and it wasn't until October 1980 that a comprehensive progress report
covering project activities from January 1979 to October 1980 was received.
The Borrower had no other difficulty in providing the reports and found the
reporting requirements reasonable.
3.15          CNTT was very slow in providing audit reports.  The Bank received
audits for the years 1977, 1978, 1979 in December 1980. The 1980 audit
is presently under preparation.



- 9 -
Results and Experience with Procurement
3.16          There were no major problems with procurement for civil works.
ONTT preselected a group of construction companies which the Bank approved.
Contracts for both sites were subsequently awarded without significant
difficulties to the same Tunisian company which subcontracted sub-packages for
heating and air conditioning, also to Tunisian firms.
3.17          The remaining equipment was later broken down into laundry,
kitchen, and cold rooms. Kitchen and cold room contracts were awarded through
ICB to a Tunisian supplier; the laundry component was subsequently withdrawn
from the project in view of existing commercial facilities.
3.18          Procurement of furniture and-fittings was carried out mainly
through direct negotiations with Tunisian firms since such firms have monopo-
lies in Tunisia and the use of foreign firms would have been uneconomical.
However, contracts for silverware and audio-visual equipment were awarded
through ICB to foreign firms.
3.19          There were no major problems with procurement as CNTT was already
used to working within the Bank's guidelines.
Project Costs
3.20          The original estimate of total project costs was US$12.3 million
for three centers and related technical assistance. Actual costs, which
included only the two centers, were US$14.4 million, a cost overruni/ of 17%
(Table 5). The breakdown is as follows:
Appraisal'     Actual
Estimate       Costs               Cost
US$000's       US$000's        Differential
Buildings                       5,164.7        10,181.3           1.97
Land and site development       1,168.5           324.3           0.28
Furniture and equipment         4,405.9         2,496.9           0.57
Technical assistance              500.0           551.0           1.10
Project administration            270.0           466.5           1.73
Architectural fees                790.9           413.0           0.52
Total                          12,300.0        14,433.0           1.17
The project was appraised on the basis of 1973 data which were seriously dis-
torted because of the 1973-74 energy crisis which resulted in increased costs.
1/   On the basis of two thirds of estimated costs at appraisal (US$8.2 million),
the cost overrun would be 79%.



- 10 -
Project execution was delayed eighteen months which also affected costs.
The Sousse North school was 50% higher in cost than the Hammamet school
because, due to its location in the center of the new resort of Sousse
North, ONTT decided to have higher construction standards and more expensive
architectural patterns.
Disbursements and Financial Sources
3.21          Disbursements of Bank funds were to have been completed by
the second semester of FY78 but in fact only started in the first semester
of that fiscal year (July 1977) when construction started - that is, no
requests for technical assistance fundls were submitted in the early months
of project execution (Table 6). Between January 1979 and June 1980 disburse-
ments were very slow as ONTT experienced difficulty in paying contractors on
time as its budgetary allocatiornswere released behind schedule during the
period. Apart from this, there were no problems with counterpart funds which
were part of ONTT's annual capital investment budget.
3.22          Since import licenses are controlled, a new disbursement
percentage (80%) for foreign equipment; procured locally was agreed by letter
dated July 20, 1979 to permit disbursement of the full foreign cost of equip-
ment procured by Tunisian suppliers and distributors (kitchen and bar equip-
ment).
Performance of Contractors, Suppliers and Technical Assistance Team
3.23          The execution of civil wrorks was carried out by the same Tunisian
contractor at eaclh site. Besides some initial problems in the storage of
construction materials in Hammamet, the organization of the two site works was
generally satisfactory. Hence, part of the Sousse School was constructed with
prefabricated ele:ments, its work site was rather mechanized, whereas the site
at Hammamet was more labor intensive. The contractor performed reasonably
well on structural work; the quality of finishing on floors and tiled areas,
however, was of lower quality and had to be redone. In some instances the
lower quality work was accepted but af'ter ONTT had agreed with the contractor
on an adequate price reduction. The contractor also tended to play one site
off against the other, advancing one at the expense of the other. Equipment
and fittings were contracted sufficierLtly far in advance that no problems were
encountered with delivery.
3.24          Technical Assistance Team.  The technical assistance team was in
place by July 1976 and Tunisian counterparts were named.  The technical
assistance team was fortunate to be led by a dynamic tourism specialist and
former hotel school director. Under his direction, the team was able to work
effectively with the Tunisian counterparts; in fact, it worked more closely
with the deputy director of training than with the director of the Institute
of Sidi Dhrif (the formal counterpart). The team prepared an overall curri-
culum based on the existing system and the accumulated experience of several
bilateral technical assistance missior,s, and a series of course outlines.
The technical assistance team left Tunisia in October 1977. During the academic



- 11 -
year 1978/79, the course outlines were introduced and tested in the Nabeul
hotel school by the Tunisian counterparts. In September 1979, the courses
were introduced into all hotels schools, including the project institutions
and the system moved over from a two-year to a one-year program. The
program is now accepted by ONTT and its teaching staff alike. There are
presently only three expatriates involved in the hotel training system in
Tunisia.
IV. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
*        4.01           Full time students trained during the period 1975-1980 numbered
4,176 (Table 7) well short of the 8,899 projected at appraisal (Table 1)
largely because of reduced manpower requirements resulting from the low
growth of hotel capacity, and the delays in opening the new schools. In 1974,
435 students received diplomas, compared to 1,369 in 1980. ONTT was able to
give refresher and upgrading courses to 13,536 employees in the period
1974-1980 (Table 7). Although obviously difficult to measure, the quality of
service in Tunisian hotels has improved markedly over the years.
4.02          The cost of hotel training has been reduced in recent years,
suggesting real savings over the execution period and first year of operation
of project institutions (Tables 8, 9 and 10). Thus the average annual cost
per student trained has declined from TD 818 in 1977 to TD 586 in 1980. The
greater efficiency is due to the fact that all training is now done in
purpose-built schools (rather than the barracks of earlier years) following a
uniform training system (of the several systems resulting from various diffe-
rent bilateral technical assistance teams).
4.03          Teacher training was accomplished largely by sending qualified
individuals overseas. Thus over the period 1974-1980, 20 Tunisians completed
teacher training courses in Europe and North America. The teacher training
unit has been created in the Institute of Sidi Dhrif, one class of 10 students,
sufficient to meet existing demand, has been graduated. Teacher/student
ratios are in line with those estimated at appraisal (Table 11).
4.04          The practice hotels have been operating for about a year and
are already generating cash surpluses. A rate of occupancy of 48% at Hammamet
and 52% at Sousse North was attained in the first year which generated
TD 100,000 (Table 10). These funds have been reinvested to correct minor
shortcomings in finishings in the hotels. The hotels, therefore, fully cover
operating costs and can be expected to contribute to reducing the overall cost
of training in future years.
4.05          With a capacity of 1,588 places in the training system, ONTT
has attained an effective rate of utilization of 70% in 1980 (Table 3). It
appears that in terms of overall capacity (i.e., ignoring regional imbalances),
the system should be able to produce over 90% of needed new staff over the
period 1981-1986, even if the most optimistic goals of the Sixth Plan (40,000)
beds are realized. There is a possibility that the hotel school at Monastir



- 12 -
will be closed, as the facilities are being taken over by the Ministry of
Higher Education; it is important to replace this school with another in
order to maintain capacity at about 1,600 places. This school need not have
a practice hotel and could be either in Monastir or in another location with
a demonstrated need to train significant numbers of staff.
V. INSTITUTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT
Performance of Borrower and Modifications to the Structure of ONTT
5.01          ONTT was already a maturing organization at inception of the
project due to its longevity but also to its experience with the Bank on
the tourism infrastructure project. I't was thus able to adapt to conditions
under the project: (i) on its own initiative, ONTT proposed the creation of
SOGHRA to overcome the problems of managing the practice hotels (staffing,
purchasing, etc.); (ii) the Direction d'Amenagement et dela Construction (DAC)
was created when it appeared that the Direction des Travaux was overloaded.
Although the creation of the DAC. permitted ONTT to supervise execution of the
project better, the DAC's staffing should have been strengthened even further.
It had an architect as its head (who also had additional responsibilities for
physical planning and the Presidency of the Agence Foncitre Touristique), and
assistant engineer and a technical assistant at each of the two sites. An
additional architect was needed as well as an additional assistant engineer.
ONTT was unable to recruit these additional staff (low salaries, unavail-
ability of qualified staff) and this certainly had a braking effect on the
project; (iii) the Training Department: (DFC) also matured considerably during
the project and, indeed, it now offers technical assistance to a number of
countries in the Middle East. The DFC has also improved its planning capacity
mainly through the deputy director position and has rationalized its school
system considerably. The fact that there were three deputy directors over the
life of the project somewhat hindered the institution of planning and control
procedures for estimating student and teacher requirements in a systematic
way, and (iv) in addition, ONTT has demonstrated its maturity in responding
to changing market conditions. It collects excellent data on the demand and
supply of touristic services, has market intelligence on tour operators
working in Tunisia and has a dynamic marketing program. It has also shown
considerable sophistication in defining its product, and in managing its
incentives and accommodation construclion policies.
Legal Framework for Hotel Training
5.02          Since there was no general law for hotel training, ONTT proposed
the promulgation of a decret cadre for tourism training to which any necessary
arret's could be added.  The decree was issued on September 4, 1976.  It
greatly facilitated the publication of subsequent arretes, and it provided a
rational legal framework for hotel training. Measures called for in the
Agreements and the side letter have btsen incorporated into the decree as
follows:
(a) Recognition of dipLomas is still awaiting the approval
of the Prime Minister's office. Early requests were



- 13 -
rejected as being unsatisfactorily designed and
not corresponding to Ministry of Education
guidelines. A new submission is currently in
preparation in reply to comments received and
changes requested by the Prime Minister's Office.
(b) The internal operating regulations have been
devised and are being implemented at the schools.
(c) Each training center is responsible for student
placement and this appears to be working well with
all graduates being placed. Currently, the demand
for hotel personnel exceeds the supply so there is
no difficulty in placement.
(d) ONTT's Personnel Statut includes all the necessary
measures to ensure equitable treatment of teachers.
(e) The advisory boards for the school meet periodically
and have been effective. The National Council for
Tourism Training has not met, however; and no prepara-
tions have yet been made for a meeting although the
supervision mission in October 1980 was told this would
be done at the end of the current academic year.
(f) OTTEEFP has not established the hotel maintenance
courses to which it agreed, claiming that the skills
needed can be acquired in existing courses and that
preference is given to hotels for those trained in the
necessary skills. While this is partially true, it is
not a satisfactory arrangement since the shortage of
adequately trained maintenance personnel remains a
severe problem. It would have been far more effective
to include a workshop and maintenance program in at
least one of the hotel schools. Several supervision
missions pursued this point, but renewed effort is
required to reach agreement with OTTEEFP to prepare
such courses; failing this, ONTT should explore the
possibility of introducing maintenance courses in its
own schools.
VI. BANK'S ROLE
6.01          In restrospect, the Bank's interpretation of Tunisia's sectoral
priorities seems reasonable. The hotel sector grew at a very rapid rate in
the 1960's and early 1970's going from a mere 4,000 beds to over 40,000 in a
decade. This implied finding and training about 12,000 staff from a zero
base. Moreover, as Tunisia was determined to build its hotel industry on its



- 14 -
own, there was little reliance on the transfer of management skills from
foreign management companies which made the task of building an industry all
the more difficult. Thus service in hotels was poor and there was no sense
of professionalism in the trade when the project was identified. In fact,
many men considered work in a hotel to be demeaning and, at that time, it
was out of the question for women to undertake such work. The project
helped to focus attention on the qualitative aspects of tourism at a time
when the preoccupation was with construction of hotel capacity.
6.02          The content of the project in terms of facilities provided at
each center appears to have been sound. Whereas the capital and operating
cost of training probably would have been considerably lower without practice
hotels, the concept of the training center is well adapted to Tunisia's needs.
However, at least one practice laboratory could have been eliminated from
each center without deleterious effects as they are now being converted to
other uses.
6.03          Clearly, the Government, ILO, and the Bank were optimistic in
making projections of hotel capacity; although such projections were little
higher than previous experience, it is obvious with hindsight that the
momentum of 8,500 beds a year was not maintainable in terms of absorptive
capacity or development potential of the sector. Doubt over the third school
was a recurring theme during supervision and absorbed much time; a clear
decision in 1975 to cut it would have made execution of the other components
more effective.
6.04          The overall scheduling of the project was optimistic, especially
with regard to start-up and site selection which combined to delay physical
execution by about 18 months. Sites should probably have been selected as a
condition of Board presentation, or even negotiations. Civil works took about
six months more than expected but the Bank was prompt in its treatment of the
main factor causing delay--the underground water in Sousse.  Bank estimates
for equipment procurement were realistic.
6.05          Supervision of the project was adequate both for technical
assistance and execution of the project. Overall, the project was supervised
with an average of eight manweeks per year, which is reasonable given its size
and concept. Relation with ONTT on the project were mostly good, if somewhat
strained after the sector review of November 1977, which contained conclusions
to which the Government took great exception.
6.06          The cost of the project was high compared to appraisal estimates
and is in large measure due to inflationary pressure resulting from delays in
scheduling. Costs took into account (i) comparison in other Bank vocational
training schools in Tunisia and the NA region, (ii) simpler design, minimum
circulation and local building materials. However, ONTT believed that ILO
and Bank baseline cost estimates at appraisal were low given conditions in
Tunisia. But unfortunately, this only surfaced once the director of the
project was appointed, a full year after estimates were made. The appointment
of an experienced project director earlier in the project cycle would have led
to a better understanding of costs in Tunisia.  Incorporation of the design
changes referred to above would also have helped check project cost increases.



- 15 -
6.07          The Bank's most significant impact was to help ONTT focus on
the subsector in a rational way and to develop a coherent system over a
number of years. In 1973, hotel schools in Tunisia were little better than
the barracks which housed them; there was a plethora of foreign technical
assistance teams, perhaps one of which might have been useful. Together,
they created a cacophony of conflicting ideas and methods. Today, the
training department at ONTT has evolved into a much more efficient unit; it
has a single system of training, which it is constantly trying to upgrade;
and it is a system which is run without the need for foreign technical
assistance. Although not all problems are resolved, working in hotels is now
considered much more socially acceptable. There is more professionalism, and
service standards are slowly improving as a result.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01          The project has had the following results:
- it has produced a system which meets needs for trained
manpower;
- it has, together with improvements in the schools,
provided ONTT with the physical facilities it needed to
carry out sound training; the facilities are complete,
although perhaps over designed;
- it has strengthened ONTT as an institution, notably the
Training Department; the creation of SOGHRA was also
important from the institution-building point of view;
- it has produced a unified hotel training system which
defines logical career paths; ONTT's initiative in
preparing the decret cadre was important in this respect
and the need to approve the decree recognizing diplomas
cannot be over-emphasized; an exception is the hotel
maintenance program which was deleted at appraisal; ONTT
should be encouraged to make arrangements for such a
program probably in one of the project institutions;
- although formal training had been viewed with mixed
feelings by the tourism industry, the program has been
accepted by the profession as evidenced by hoteliers'
presence on the Board of each school and their willingness
to teach classes;
- the program has been accepted, too, by students, some of
whom continue beyond the basic CAP to the BTH.
7.02          The project laid the groundwork for an effective system, one
which should evolve and adapt with the sector's growth.
