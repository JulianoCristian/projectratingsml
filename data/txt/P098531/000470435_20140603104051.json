   Bank and borrower. The objectives are to contribute to the\n            sustainable improvement in the quality of electricity\n            services to customers and to the strengthening of the\n            financial and operational performance of the electricity\n            public utility (EDH)\u0094. The PDO formulation in the PAD and in\n            the Legal Agreement5 are slightly different: the PDO stated\n            in the PAD has been selected here because it is the one\n            approved by the Board, used in the results frameworks and\n            monitored throughout project implementation. The Additional\n            Financing (AF) approved by the Board on July 29, 2009 (Grant\n            A-H5100, for $5 million) did not include any change in the\n            PDO formulation; the additional resources were oriented\n            towards: (i) providing management support to EDH as a new\n            project component (new Component 4); (ii) covering cost\n            overruns under Component 1 (implementation of a new\n            commercial approach for EDH) and Component 2 (Improvement in\n            quality of service and increase in revenue collection of EDH\n            through selected groups of customers); and (iii) making\n            additional funds available for Component 3 (Participatory\n            approach, project management, monitoring and impact\n            evaluation, and replication strategy). The institutional\n            framework, procurement and disbursement arrangements\n            remained also unchanged.  Lessons learned were that the\n            preparation of small projects in weak institutional\n            environments requires dedicating as many resources as\n            possible to a careful and detailed planning of what can be\n            expected in order to optimize the use of scarce funds. When\n            addressing the issues of poorly run institutions such as EDH\n            it is necessary to focus not only on the abilities of lower\n            level managers in charge of implementation, but also on the\n            commitment of higher management. Focusing on customer\n            service is the key towards utility rehabilitation, but\n            requires actions at all levels of management, and not only\n            at the operational level. Finally, the main lesson on the\n            M&E is to select realistic indicators and with a direct\n            causality with the project activities, as it can become\n            difficult to differentiate the impact of several factors on\n            the same network infrastructure\u0092 performance."}, "docdt": "2014-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
