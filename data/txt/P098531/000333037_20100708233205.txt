SUMMARY 
 
1. 
This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for a Level 
Two
1
restructuring of both the original Haiti Electricity Loss Reduction Project (Grant 
No. IDA-H2510-HA) and its corresponding Additional Financing (Grant No. IDA-
H5100-HT)
,
henceforth collectively referred to as “the Project”, and to proceed with the 
corresponding amendments to the Project’s legal documents.  The proposed restructuring 
would (i) increase funding to 
Components 1, 2.3, 3.2 
and
 4.1
 for specific items such as 
information systems, remote meters, technical assistance, and operating costs; (ii) 
decrease funding to 
Components 2.2 and 2.3 
for grid rehabilitations works and standard 
meters; (iii) modify outcome indicators accordingly; (iv) postpone the deadline for 
submission of EDH’s audited financial statements; and (v) extend the closing date of the 
Project by one year. 
 
2. 
On January 12, 2010, Haiti was shaken by a 7.0 magnitude (Richter scale) 
earthquake followed by several aftershocks.  The epicenter was located in a highly 
populated area, Leogâne, only 17 km south-west of the capital. Estimates indicate that the 
death toll will be over 220,000 and that at least 3.5 million people have been affected.  
The earthquake caused massive destruction of public and private infrastructure including, 
but not limited to, hospitals, schools, government buildings, houses and roads. The 
electricity sector was particularly hit by the effects of the earthquake because the majority 
of the state owned utility, Electricité d’Haïti, (EDH)’s infrastructure, including its 
headquarters, are located in Port au Prince.  EDH’s dispatch center and many of its 
commercial agencies were destroyed.  The effects of the earthquake have made it 
extremely difficult for EDH to either collect payments for services or to perform its 
normal activities.  
 
II. 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
3. 
The original IDA Electricity Loss Reduction Project, PREPSEL (US$6 million, 
effective on July 31, 2007) and its Additional Financing (US$5 million, effective on 
December 15, 2009) both support the FY09-12 Country Assistance Strategy. 
 
Specifically, the project addresses the goal outlined under the pillar “promoting growth 
and local development”. The combined US$ 11 million original Project sought to achieve 
this objective through the following: 
•
Component 1: Improvement in EDH management systems and practices 
(US$3.68 million) 
1
As a Level Two restructuring, the proposed restructuring would retain the Project’s original Development 
Objective which is, “to contribute to the sustainable improvement in the quality of electricity services to 
customers and to strengthen the financial and operational performance of the public electricity utility, 
Electricité d’Haïti (EDH)”. Thereby, it intends to continue to support the government and the public power 
utility in the rehabilitation of the sector. 
Page  8

•
Component 2: Improvement in quality of service and increase in revenue 
collection of EDH for selected groups of customers (US$3.51 million) 
•
Component 3: Participatory approach, project management, M&E and impact 
evaluation and replication strategy (US$1.08 million) 
•
Component 4: Management support to EDH (US$2.57 million) 
•
Contingency Reserve (US$0.16 million) 
4. 
Key project activities were progressing well and forty-five percent of the original 
Project amount had already been committed by December 2009.   The Project had 
achieved the following milestones: (i) implementation of the CMS and TSMS (38 percent 
of overall budget) began in September 2009, (ii) the Unit in charge of supervising the 
energy sector within the Ministry of Public Works (MTPTC) was created in September 
2009 (it had one coordinator financed by the Project and the selection process for three 
additional staff members had been launched), (iii) two key units of EDH (the Anti-Fraud 
and Large Customers Unit) had been restructured, and (iv) the selection of four deputy 
directors for the utility had been launched.  At the time the earthquake hit the country, 
only fifteen percent of the Project envelope had been disbursed. This is because more 
than forty percent of the envelope had only become effective in December 2009, as a 
result of an Additional Financing which increased the overall budget from US$6 to 
US$11 million. All of the Project’s activities were momentarily suspended in the 
aftermath of the earthquake.  Project activities have now resumed and, in fact, are still 
very relevant in the post-disaster context (see paragraphs 8 and 9 below).  
 
5. 
The Project’s achievement of its Development Objective and Implementation 
Progress is rated moderately satisfactory in its June 6, 2010 ISR. The fiduciary 
management system compliance is rated satisfactory.  The Project is in compliance with 
all of the covenants imposed by the Financing Agreement.  None of the three audit 
reports - 2007, 2008 or 2009 - highlighted any significant issues; they were all submitted 
on time. There are no unresolved environmental, social or other safeguard issues 
affecting the Project’s implementation.  
 
III. 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
6. 
The restructuring proposes to reallocate funds among the various components and 
categories, to modify outcome indicators accordingly, to postpone the deadline for 
submission of EDH’s audited financial statements, and to extend the closing date of the 
Project by one year, from February 28, 2012 to February 28, 2013. The reallocations 
would increase funding for: (i) the installation of billing and grid maintenance systems, 
(ii) the installation of remote metering systems for large customers, (iii) capacity building 
for the energy unit of the MTPTC, (iv) technical assistance for EDH’s management, and 
(v) pre-fabricated offices for EDH and MTPTC.  The restructuring proposes to decrease 
funding for grid works and standard meters for residential customers, to compensate for 
the additional funding needed for the increases listed above; it is envisaged that these two 
activities will be partially funded other donors. In particular, the Inter American 
Development Bank plans to finance grid works and purchase of meters in the capital.

A.  Reallocations Among Components and Categories 
 
7. 
Increase Component 1 by US$0.9 million: 
The budget for Component 1 would 
be increased by US$0.9 million to US$4.6 million.  EDH’s outdated billing system was 
completely destroyed in the earthquake.  The installation of the new billing and grid 
maintenance systems are, therefore, even more critical.  However, implementation of 
these new systems has been delayed because parts of the recently purchased equipment 
were damaged by the earthquake. Furthermore, EDH does not have enough resources to 
finance the associated costs. In fact, following the earthquake, electricity remains largely 
unbilled and the small amounts available are not enough to cover a large part of EDH’s 
recurring expenses.  The scope of the implementation and support for the systems will 
need to be adjusted to account for the population migration and for EDH’s reduced 
capacity level. Additional funding will be allocated to this component to pay for the 
surveys needed to update the client database to reflect the post-earthquake migration.   
 
8. 
Decrease Sub Components 2.2 by US$1.4 million:
 
Bank financing of Sub 
Component 2.2 would decrease by US$1.4 million to US$0.1 million (already expensed).  
Funding for standard and prepayment meters, grid reparation works and miscellaneous 
expenses for the commercial agency in a socio economically mixed zone of Port-au-
Prince will be decreased by US $1.4 million. This pilot zone, located near the National 
Palace, was heavily destroyed, and reconstruction plans in that zone remain unclear.
 
9. 
Decrease Sub Component 2.3 by a net amount of US$190,000: 
 This sub 
component would decrease by a net amount of US$190,000 to US$2.8 million
.
First, an 
additional US$300,000 will be allocated to provide remote meters to all “large 
customers”
2
whose meters were destroyed during the earthquake. The systems will also 
be extended to the provinces that are expected to absorb additional industrial clients with 
the relocation of business activities outside of the capital. EDH’s ‘large customers’ have a 
higher payment capacity and belong to the highest tariff bracket, so this component has 
been modified to focus on receiving payments from this group to help the utility quickly 
generate revenues. By focusing on a specific customer segment, the small number of 
large customers can be more readily regularized post-earthquake, thereby presenting the 
greatest opportunity for returning the utility to solvency. Next, the US$490,000 that was 
originally apportioned for partial grid rehabilitation works will be eliminated because this 
activity is expected to be carried out by other donors as part of the broader recovery 
effort.  This strategy is expected to allow the utility to efficiently improve earnings and 
grow capital to be used to reestablish service to other former customers. 
10. 
Increase Sub Component 3.2 by US$0.4 million: 
 This sub component would 
increase by US$0.4 million to US$1.4 million.  The additional funding will be used for: 
(i) the repairs to the offices of the EDH Anti-Fraud Unit that was destroyed during the 
earthquake; (ii) the purchase and installation of prefabricated offices for the recently-
created energy unit of the MTPTC because the MTPTC’s building was also destroyed 
during the earthquake; (iii) the operations of the Project Coordination Unit during the 
2
“Large customers”, accounted for approximately sixty percent of revenue collections prior to the 
earthquake. 
Page  10
10 
 
proposed one-year extension; and (iv) the additional capacity building efforts dedicated 
to the MTPTC’s energy unit. 
 
11. 
Increase Sub Component 4.1 by US$0.2 million: 
Funding for this activity will 
increase by US$0.2 million to US$2.5 million. The additional funding will be dedicated 
to an increase in compensation for the four experts who will serve as deputy directors to 
the utility.  This incentive is necessary because attracting international expertise into 
Haiti is expected to be extremely difficult. In addition, living costs are significantly 
higher as a result of the disaster. 
 
B.  Change in Outcome Indicators and Values 
 
12. 
Outcome indicators have to be amended, and given the extent of the damage, it is 
difficult to immediately collect baseline data from which to determine targets. Even in 
cases where original outcome indicators will be retained, baseline figures will need to be 
reset due to the effect of the earthquake. For example, many customers have migrated to 
regions outside of Port au Prince, making quantification of the new baseline values and 
indicators related to the number of customers impossible at this stage. The earthquake has 
also destroyed parts of the grid and there remains uncertainty regarding the scope and 
timing of future rehabilitation works.  
13. 
Modifications to the outcome indicators have been proposed with this 
restructuring to reflect the changes in the funding allocation to components as well as 
changes in the physical condition of the system
3
,
but
as baseline information becomes 
available, these assumptions will have to be re-evaluated (see Annex 1).  In general, the 
indicators related to the pilot zone – purchase of meters and grid works - have been 
removed because Component 2 is shifting its focus to large customers. Baseline, 
intermediate, and end-of-project target values will be assessed in the six months 
following the approval of the proposed restructuring. 
C.  Modification of Audit Covenant 
 
14. 
The submission of EDH’s audited financial statements to IDA (as required by Part 
B.3, Section II of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement) would be postponed by one 
year to March 30, 2012. This would account for the delay in contracting the accounting 
firm to support EDH in the preparation of the financial accounts and the overall 
decreased capacity of the utility following the earthquake. 
D.  Extension of Closing Date 
 
15. 
A one-year extension of the closing date to February 28, 2013 is requested for the 
Project to meet its development objectives.  For example, the four experts who are 
expected to provide technical assistance to EDH’s management will need to be in place 
for at least two years in order to achieve the expected outcomes, but their initial selection 
3
For example, the PDO indicator ‘number of interruption per month’ has been replaced by the ‘percentage 
of customers served at least 8 hours a day on average in the zones served by EDH’, because it will not be 
possible, at an aggregate level, to measure service quality in the immediate years to come. 
Page  11
11 
 
process has been delayed as a result of the earthquake. EDH is currently focused on 
restoring basic functions and will need time to recover to its pre-disaster capacity level in 
order to fully implement the Project. 
IV. 
APPRAISAL SUMMARY 
 
A.  Economic and financial analysis 
 
16. 
From a financial point of view, the major benefits to EDH of implementing the 
project remain the same. EDH will benefit from increased revenues due to a progressive 
widening of its customer base, increased billed sales of electricity, and an improvement 
in the collection/billing ratio for electricity.  
17. 
A revised economic and financial analysis will be completed within one year of 
the approval of the restructuring when new baselines would have been established. A 
quantified cost-benefit analysis is not possible at this time because of the inability to 
quantify benefits. On the one hand, if the value of benefits were to remain constant, the 
delay of benefits would have the net effect of decreasing economic and financial NPV 
and IRR. On the other hand, the undiscounted value of benefits is almost certain not to 
remain constant because adjustments to the baseline are necessary. Given the scarce 
information available today, it is difficult to compute the new baseline. 
18. 
Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis, it is already possible to assert that 
from an economic point of view, the customers’ benefits continue to accrue because of 
the consumer surplus created by the additional electricity to be added to the network at a 
price below the consumer’s demand curve. From the societal perspective, the economic 
losses incurred by not serving the corresponding electricity demand are deemed to be far 
higher than the cost of serving that demand. 
B. Risk 
 
19. 
Following the earthquake, the risks that were identified under the original Project 
and its Additional Financing have increased. In particular, EDH’s capacity to implement 
the Project has been negatively affected. However, the Project actually finances a number 
of activities that seek to strengthen EDH operational and financial performance, such as 
technical assistance to its management and the installation of management information 
systems for the commercial and technical operation of the utility.  
20. 
The current political and social situation is volatile, and could worsen in the 
period leading up to the November 2010 elections, which would negatively impact 
implementation of the Project activities. While this risk is largely outside the Bank’s 
control, the interventions of the Bank and other donors, under the guidance of the Interim 
Haiti Recovery Commission will help coordinate the efforts to rebuild the country and 
improve economic opportunities.  
21. 
Political interference or lack of commitment from the authorities could undermine 
the efforts put into place by the experts and the EDH team to improve the utility’s 
performance. However, all stakeholders have a strong incentive to actively support the 
Page  12
12 
 
rehabilitation of EDH, given the importance of the sector for the economic recovery and 
the weight of State transfers to the electricity sector, especially in the current context of 
budgetary constraints. The four high-level experts who will provide TA to EDH 
management will also provide monthly updates on their work and the eventual constraints 
that they face in achieving their objectives.  
22. 
Finally, and specific to this proposed restructuring, the elimination of works could 
negatively affect the quality of service and the financial performance of EDH. The impact 
is expected to be mitigated because other donors intend to finance works on the networks 
serving the large industrial customers. As a result, the overall risk rating of the original 
Project and its Additional Financing remains substantial.
