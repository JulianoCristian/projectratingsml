The restructuring will: (i) increase\n            funding to components 1.1, 3 and 4.1 to strengthen support\n            for specific items such as information systems, remote\n            meters, technical assistance, and implementation units; (ii)\n            decrease funding to components 1.2, 2 and 3 for reallocation\n            of funds in completed activities and categories ; and (iii)\n            extend the closing date of the project by six months. This\n            restructuring proposes to reallocate funds among the various\n            components and categories, to postpone the deadline for\n            submission of EDH's audited financial statements, and\n            to extend the closing date of the project by six months,\n            from February 28, 2013 to August 31, 2013. The reallocations\n            would increase funding for: (i) the sustainable installation\n            of billing system, (ii) the monitoring of installation of\n            remote metering systems for large customers, (iii) capacity\n            building for the EDH technical unit, (iv) technical\n            assistance for EDH's management, and (v) realization of\n            monitoring and evaluation surveys to measure the\n            Project's satisfaction level inside EDH and for\n            EDH's customers. The restructuring proposes to decrease\n            funding for the punctual expertise to support EDH Management\n            and to use remaining funding of completed and activities\n            like capacity building for the Ministry of Public Works,\n            Transport, Communication and Energy (MTPTCE) energy unit and\n            grid works and standard meters for residential customers\n            (activities partially funded by other donors)."}, "docdt": "2013-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
