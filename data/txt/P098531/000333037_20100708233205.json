The restructuring proposes to\n            reallocate funds among the various components and\n            categories, to modify outcome indicators accordingly, to\n            postpone the deadline for submission of EDH's audited\n            financial statements, and to extend the closing date of the\n            project by one year, from February 28, 2012 to February 28,\n            2013. The reallocations will increase funding for: (i) the\n            installation of billing and grid maintenance systems, (ii)\n            the installation of remote metering systems for large\n            customers, (iii) capacity building for the energy unit of\n            the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and Communication\n            (MTPTC), (iv) technical assistance for EDH's\n            management, and (v) pre-fabricated offices for EDH and\n            MTPTC. The restructuring proposes to decrease funding for\n            grid works and standard meters for residential customers, to\n            compensate for the additional funding needed for the\n            increases listed above; it is envisaged that these two\n            activities will be partially funded other donors. In\n            particular, the Inter American Development Bank plans to\n            finance grid works and purchase of meters in the capital."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
