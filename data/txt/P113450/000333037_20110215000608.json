Re-engagement and\n            Reform Support Program Project for Mexico were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in countries with limited capacity for\n            implementation, it is particularly important to select a few\n            focused actions that are deemed essential to supporting the\n            government's broader reform program. In countries where\n            capacity is weak it is necessary to ensure that development\n            policy operations are accompanied by a critical mass of\n            technical assistance. A common assessment framework that is\n            managed by the Government and supported by the donors can be\n            an effective tool for facilitating deeper harmonization of\n            donors support. Identifying good indicators to evaluate\n            progress can be difficult, especially in countries with data\n            and capacity. Also given the short time span covered by the\n            operation, it was difficult to find indicators that could\n            show improvement by the close of the operation. This is\n            particularly important for stand-alone operation where there\n            is no succeeding operation to continue the monitoring of the indicator."}, "docdt": "2010-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
