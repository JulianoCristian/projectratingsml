Second\n            Reengagement and Reform Support Program (RRSP II) for\n            Liberia are to support government-owned ongoing reforms to\n            improve the country's fiduciary environment, rebuild\n            public institutions, and improve the environment for private\n            sector-led growth. More specifically, the RRSP II focuses\n            on: (i) improving the efficiency of budget preparation and\n            execution and increasing the professionalism and improving\n            the human resource management of the civil service; and (ii)\n            improving the investment climate through the reform of the\n            revenue and private investment regimes. The grant is an\n            integral part of International Development Association (IDA)\n            Country Assistance Strategy for the period FY09-12 presented\n            to the Board in April 2009 and is closely coordinated with\n            assistance provided to support the program of\n            Government's reforms through the ongoing Economic\n            Governance and Institutional Reform Project, the Enhanced\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the\n            African Development Bank (AfDB) budget support operation and\n            the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and\n            Growth Facility (PRGF). Since Liberia is at high risk of\n            debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms,\n            per the stipulations of the grant allocation system agreed\n            with IDA donors for the IDA15 period. Liberia is also\n            eligible for annual exceptional post-conflict allocations\n            from IDA."}, "docdt": "2009-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
