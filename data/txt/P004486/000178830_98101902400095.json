development,\n            and to operate, maintain and rehabilitate small national\n            irrigation projects. The project would also finance the\n            construction of communal irrigation works covering about 25\n            percent of the area to be covered under NIA's 1982-86\n            communal irrigation development program, including both new\n            and rehabilitation schemes. Irrigation works to be financed\n            under the project would be implemented through a\n            participatory approach involving the farmer beneficiaries in\n            all phases of project planning, design and construction, and\n            preparing them to carry out more effectively the operation\n            and management of their system after completion of\n            construction. The project includes a component for training\n            of NIA's technical and institutional staff and the\n            farmers in communal irrigation development. It also includes\n            a monitoring and evaluation component. Consultant services\n            would be provided to carry out a study to improve NIA's\n            financial reporting system."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
