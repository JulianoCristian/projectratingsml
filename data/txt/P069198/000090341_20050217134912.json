The\n            lessons learned indicate that a Learning and Innovation Loan\n            (LIL) focuses on experimentation, learning and piloting in\n            search of possible developmental solutions, prior to\n            potential larger-scale operations. For a distance learning\n            center to be effective, the management capacity is one of\n            the most critical factors. The sustainability of the\n            Distance Learning Center (DLC) is to a large extent related\n            to the development of marketing activities. The Borrower\n            felt that the Bank could have made more use of the\n            DLC's facilities by promoting the DLC to its own staff,\n            to the Project Implementation Units, and to the donor community."}, "docdt": "2004-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
