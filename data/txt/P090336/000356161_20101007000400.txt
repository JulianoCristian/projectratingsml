                             Extension of Closing Date
            CHINA -- GEF-NINGBO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
                                   P090336
                                 {TF056692}1

                                       Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for China, GEF-Ningbo Water and Environment Project, [Grant No
   TF056692], P090336 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31,
   2011.

2.      Briefly summarize project implementation progress and confirm whether project
objectives continue to be achievable:

a)     The project is progressing as planned: The Cixi wetlands are substantially
complete, except for the education facility building, which is constructed but still being
decorated. All civil works are expected to be completed and commissioned by September
2010. Total disbursement of the Grant to date is about US$4.29 million (85%).

b)     Considering progress and the high level of borrower commitment, it is likely that
the GEO will be achieved. The GEO is still considered highly relevant and in line with
national and GEF priorities.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to satisfactorily complete consultancy
support for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the wetlands. Under this
component, the C2 Consultant Consortium, financed by the GEF Grant, has provided
valuable advice and guidance for the design of rehabilitation works for the wetlands. Due
to the delayed engagement of the C2 Consultant Consortium and delays in the
construction schedule, the O&M phase was delayed. O&M support by the C2 Consultant
Consortium is just beginning, and the project requires their inputs through to November
2011, which is when the C2 Consultant Consortium's contract expires. This would
require the extension of the GEF Grant closing date by 1 year to December 31, 2011. The
Borrower has in place an action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project.

4.        This will be the first extension of the project.
