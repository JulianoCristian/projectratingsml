RWANDA
ENERGY PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01       Rwanda lies just south of the equator in Eastern Central Africa,
and has to its north, Uganda, on its west, Zaire, on the east, Tanzania and
to the south, Burundi (Map IBRD 17959).   It has an area of about 26,300
km2, and the 1982 estimated population of about 5.5 million results in a
population density, in terms of agricultural land, of about 390 persons per
square kilometer, high in comparison to other African countries.  Between
1978 and 1982 the estimated rate of growth of the population was 3.6
percent, among the highest in the developing world.
1.02       Rwanda's principal energy resource is its forest, which is being
rapidly depleted for firewood and its by-product,  charcoal.   Peat  is
available in  some areas  but  is not widely used.   The potential for
development of hydroelectric power exists but development is costly due to
the sites having low capacity and being widely scattered. The beat hydro
sources are in the Rivers Kagera and Ruzizi. There is no evidence of the
presence of oil in the country but there is a unique potential source of
methane gas in the deep waters of Lake Kivu.   Although coal is found in
neighboring Zaire, none has been located in Rwanda. Hot springs have been
found in the northern part, suggesting the possibility of a geothermal
source of energy, the potential of which is being explored.
1.03        In June, 1981, a UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment mission 1/
identified Rwanda's most pressing energy problems to be: i) the increasing
depletion of fuelwood supplies, which puts reforestation efforts in
competition for land with food and cash crop production; (ii) the high cost
of oil imports (US$90 to US$100 per barrel in 1981), because of Rwanda's
land-locked position, and the lack of security of supply; and (iii) the
need to strengthen institutional arrangements in the electric power
subsector, and to assure medium-term supplies of electricity.   The key
recommendations made by the assessment to alleviate these problems were:
(i) to increase and reorient forestry extension work to assist the rural
population in woodlot preparation and in fuel conservation; (ii) to reduce
woodfuel demand by introducing more efficient firewood and charcoal
cook-stoves and charcoal kilns with higher yields; (iii) to evaluate the
prospects for increased peat production; (iv) to modify oil, import
arrangements by purchasing oil on international markets and bringing it in
across Tanzania once the Rusumo-Isaka road was paved; (v) to develop the
Ruzizi II hydroelectric site and establish a strong planning unit within
Rwanda's utility, Etablissement public de production, de transport et de
distribution d'electricite (Electrogaz); and (vi) to develop the Lake Kivu
methane resource in stages, with continuous monitoring of effects.

1.04        A follow-up mission to the Energy Assessment was made to Rwanda
in August 1983, and found that the Government had taken active interest in
the sector, and was taking action on many of the recommendations as more
fully described in the following paragraphs.
1.05       The Rwandese Bureau national d'etudes de projets (BUNEP) and the
Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL) had been retained by the
Direction de la coop&ration du developpement et de l'aide humanitaire of
Switzerland to make a complete study of the electricity supply in Rwanda.
In May 1983, they published the results of this work, which was expanded to
include an overview of the energy sector as a whole. The study's findings
are similar to those of the UNDP/World Bank assessment report in most
areas, and are serving as the basis for developing a national energy
policy.
1.06       The proposed project addresses the issues of the power subsector
(para. 3.04). Other issues are being addressed under a variety of projects
as discussed throughout this chapter.

1.07        A table showing the demand for commercial energy 1976-1982 may
be found in Annex 1. The table above is a summary of energy consumption by
type and sector for Rwanda in 1979. The total demand for commercial energy
grew by 13% in 1980 and by 23% in 1981, largely because of the Government's
efforts to build up a reserve of petroleum products so that the country
would not be vulnerable to events outside their borders which might hinder

oil deliveries.  The average annual growth in the total demand for energy
during the period 1977-1982 was about 12% for both petroleum products and
electricity.
Energy Resources
1.08        Wood.  About 6% of the land area in Rwanda is covered by trees,
two-thirds of which are protected natural forest.   About 50,000 ha of
forest plantations produce about 375,000 m3 of wood annually.   Biomass
fuels (fuelwood, charcoal, crop and animal residues) account for about 95%
of the total energy consumed.   A rural area survey puts rural average
consumption at about 1 m3 of fuelwood per person annually, implying a total
fuelwood use of about 5 million m3 annually, not including the agricultural
wastes also used for cooking  and heating.    In rural  areas,  schools,
hospitals and other government institutions use wood for fuel.   Rwanda's
capital, Kigali, with a population of about 110,000, consumes about 108 000
m3 in the form of charcoal as the principal cooking fuel and 29,000 m  as
firewood.    The  great  discrepancy  between  consumption  and  production
estimates can to some extent be explained by the weakness of the data and
the inclusion as consumption of gathering from brush and trees outside
areas  defined  as  forests.    However,  there  is no  doubt  that  forest
production is critically below woodfuel consumption and that Rwanda, in
common with other Sub-Saharan African countries, is in a critical state of
imbalance in relation to its major energy resource, with an estimated loss
of forest and woodland of 2,000 ha per year.2/
1.09        It is common for up to 25% of a Kigali family's income to be
spent on charcoal.   Prices have increased dramatically in phase with the
transport distance for charcoal, as trees have been stripped further and
further afield from Kigali - for instance, the price increased from 142
RwF/sack in 1976 to 500 RwF in 1982, occasionally reaching 1,000 RwF/sack,
according to the effect of weather on roads, i.e. the equivalent of US$310
per ton.
1.10         The Directorate of Waters and Forests under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock is responsible for the forestry sector in
Rwanda. The Government has drafted policy statements consisting of draft
forestry regulations, including a system for the use of existing state
plantations and proposals for the creation of a National Forestry Fund and
a Forestry Code.   The main objectives of the Fund would be to finance
small-scale  afforestation  programs  countrywide  and  to  improve  the
protection  of  existing  plantations.        An  association  of  research
institutions made up of government departments and local authorities
involved in forestry, called Groupe forestier du Rwanda, meets about twice
a year to discuss forestry problems.  However, there is a serious lack of
well-trained extension workers and foresters in Rwanda, and these institu-
tional proposals have made little progress.
1.11       Government enterprises, such as some tea plantations provide for
the planting of 200-400 ha to produce wood for their own use; SOM4IRWA, the
tin foundry, has begun planting trees for charcoal production near Kigali.

1.12        IDA is well aware of the problems of forestry in Rwanda and as
such, has included reforestation of about 500 ha in the Bugesera/Gisaka/
Migongo and Mutara rural development projects.   Part of the Integrated
Forestry and Livestock Development Project (Credit 1039-RW) consists of
planting 5,000 ha around Kigali and 3,000 ha near Butare, mostly for
fuelwood.
1.13      In addition to the above, various other countries and organiza-
tions are providing forestry assistance, including Belgium, Germany,
Switzerland, the African Development Bank (AfDB), Fonds europeen de
dgveloppement (FED) and UNDP.   Nevertheless, even their combined efforts
fall short of the need; greater efforts are required to prevent shortages
of fuelwood and resulting higher prices.
1.14             Papyrus  briquettes  offer  the possibility of eventually
substituting for charcoal and a plant is being constructed near Kigali,
with FED financing, to test how practical and economic a fuel it would be.
1.15         Another strategy for addressing the growing household energy
problem is through the improved efficiency of household cooking.  Various
agencies are involved in improved stove programs. The United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) has funded experimental work on
improved woodstoves at Rwanda's Centre d'etudes et d'application de
l'energie au Rwanda (CEAER) which has designed several models and tested
them in the laboratory and among 60 families. Association internationale
de developpement rural (AIDR) has carried out experimental work and
submitted a proposal to the Government for dissemination of woodstoves to
introduce throughout Rwanda; le Service universitaire canadien d'outremer
(SUCO) has an improved cookstove project in Ruhengeri.   The Association
fransaise des volontaires du progras in its  1983-88 work program has
provided for assistance in the dissemination of improved woodstoves.
1.16        The desirable goal of saving wood energy can be partly met by
promoting   cooking   stoves   of   higher   efficiency   for   residential,
institutional and commercial use, but efforts so far are scattered and
little progress  has been made in achieving any widespread impact.   A
concurrent need is the improvement of charcoal kilns. Existing activities
need to be thoroughly reviewed as part of the foundation for further
action. Provision has been made for improving woodstoves for rural needs
as part of the IDA's Integrated Forestry and Livestock Project, which is
overseen by the Director of Water and Forests under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock; activities towards implementing this have lately
revived. Given the emphasis to date of other efforts on woodstoves and the
growing criticality of charcoal supply and costs around the capital, a
component of the Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1217-RW) would be a
charcoal stove program and a program for the improvement of the efficiency
of charcoal production.   The Ministry of Public Works and Energy (MPWE)
will be the institution with responsibility for these two programs and
would give guidance on the organization to carry out the diffusion
processes. CEAER, located in Butare, is an institution which could be used
and further supported for the technological development of improved stoves
and charcoal kilns.

1.17          Hydroelectric Resources.   Rwanda is a high and mountainous
country (maximum elevation 2,700 m) and is crossed by the continental
divide between the headwaters of the Nile River flowing north to the
Mediterranean, and the Zaire River flowing west to the Atlantic.   The
region has two dry seasons; June to September and December and January, and
two wet seasons-heavy rains from February to May, and light rains in
October and November. At the crest of the divide, above elevation 2,000 m,
the average annual rainfall is about 1,500 mm while in the central high
plateau (elevation 1,400 m - 1,800 m) the average annual rainfall is about
1,250 mm.   The combination of mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall
should result in a significant potential for the generation of electricity
by small hydroelectric generating stations in the numerous, steep,
fast-flowing  rivers and streams.   However,  these sites are costly  to
develop because of the small capacity and the topography which prevents the
construction of reservoirs to store water from the high flow seasons for
use during the dry seasons.
1.18         Currently, the electric power activities in Rwanda are being
focused on the development of the Ruzizi II Project on the Zairan border,
and, to a lesser extent, the Rusumo Falls project (80 MW) on the Tanzanian
Border.  Future least cost development would be related to exploration of
such sites on a scale that requires regional cooperation for regional
markets. A list of 32 potential mini-hydroelectric power sites which are
estimated to be capable of providing about 300 MW or about 1600 GWh
annually may be found in Annex 2. Funds to study some of these sites have
not been available.   Nevertheless,  the Government,  believing  that  the
development of these sites may be relatively costly, has not included them
in its development program, although the BUNEP/EPFL study (para. 2.12)
recommended development of some to promote the growth of rural centers.
1.19        As identified by the UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Mission
(para. 1.03) the need for a strong power planning capacity, an appropriate
tariff structure and the need for institutional strengthening are major
power subsector issues, which the First Water Supply project (para. 3.14)
and the proposed project address (para. 3.05).   In line with recommenda-
tions of the BUNEP/EPFL study (para. 1.05), the project gives equal
priority to rehabilitation of existing power facilities and provision of
training in Electrogaz in order to ensure continuous operation and
maintenance in the future.
1.20       Peat.  Peat production in Rwanda is problematic.  There has been
no reliable estimate of the available peat reserves or the extent of the
exploitable resources, and detailed hydrological investigations have yet to
be made.   The development  of peat was under  the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Natural Resources (MIRENA), until January 1984 when it was
incorporated into MPWE.   The preliminary evaluation of MIRENA was that
exploitation of the Rugezi bog (east of Ruhengeri) would require the
lowering of the level of Lake Bulera and therefore reduce the production of
power at the Ntaruka and Mukungwa hydro plants. Peat in the Akanyaru River
Basin in south central Rwanda, was thought to be more promising but this
has been found to be flooded. In Burundi, production of Akanyaru peat from
flooded areas by dredging is now being studied in conjunction with the
Burundi  Nickel  Exploration  Project   (Credit  No.  1154-BU),  and  its



feasibility should be determined by the end of 1984.  However, in Rwanda a
lack of suitable large areas of land for drying the Akanyaru peat may be a
further obstacle to development.   An Akanyaru bog called the Bugesera,
which is situated 30 km south of Kigali, is the subject of a proposed
production study by a Finnish firm. There is a need for evaluation of the
peat resources along the Kagera River.
1.21          Two bogs near Ruhengeri are under small scale production,
fuelling a cement plant which has Belgian assistance, and Rwanda's
principal peat consumer, Office du pyrethre du Rwanda (OPYRRWA), a
pyrethrum flower processing plant, which uses about 2,000 tons of peat per
year.   The Irish government  is currently providing external assistance
(over USS380,000) for peat prospecting countrywide and for pilot production
from the Busoro bog in the Akanyaru Basin.  In 1982 peat production began
from Busoro with use of a semi-automatic macerating machine, and in that
year total output reached about  500 tonnes.   Efforts  to develop peat
progress with difficulty at the technical level, and there are also
problems associated with marketing the product. Testing of Busoro peat for
household cooking and for use in smithies has been unsuccessful.   The
French Fonds d'aide et de cooperation (FAC) is funding coking tests near
Cyangugu.   So far there is little prospect of peat becoming a major fuel
even in the medium term.
1.22         Methane.   Lake Kivu contains large quantities of dissolved
methane gas, estimated to amount to about 2 trillion ft3 (60 billion m3 or
60 million toe), and concentrated in water at depths between 200 to 400
metres. Lake water temperature increases with depth because of increasing
salinity which in turn increases density and prevents normal thermal
convection. This unique condition maintains the gas in solution under high
pressure. The origin of the gas is not clearly understood. It is also not
known whether its supply is being gradually replenished from biological or
geological sources or whether its total quantity is fixed, similar to gas
reserves in conventional deposits.  From 1963 to 1976 a small-scale plant
extracted gas at Cape Rubona for use in the Gisenyi brewery, but the
facility eventually failed due to lack of foreign funds required for
maintenance and repair. The plant has now been rehabilitated under a UNDP
financed project and production is at a level of 6,000 m3 of gas with a 80Z
methane content which is used in the brewery for processing. The latter's
total fuel needs amount to about 10,000 to 12,000 m3 per day, with the
balance presently made up from imported fuel oil.  The extraction process
of methane is relatively straightforward.   Gas-rich, low-level water is
brought to the surface through a pipe, and as it rises to lower pressure
levels, the gas comes out of solution.   However, only about 25Z of the
total gas consists of methane, the remainder being inert C02.  The CO2 is
then removed by washing the gas with surface water which dissolves the CO2
and leaves a methane-rich mixture with a heat content of about 800 Btu/ft
(7,000 kcal/m3).
1.23       Zaire and Rwanda agreed, in a 1975 accord, to share the resource
equally and to establish a joint corporation with a monopoly on its
exploitation, transport and commercializaLion, although the details of how
this joint corporation would function were never formalized.   Rwanda's
initial development was considered to be experimental and all data is
shared equally between the countries.



- 7 -
1.24          Electrogaz retained and funded, at the cost of US$7U,000,
Tractionel and Union Chimique des Belges (both from Belgium) to study the
feasibility of expanding gas production to 15,000 m3 per day and their
report dated March 1984 recommending the expansion has been received. The
Belgian Government is giving consideration to the possibility of funding
this proposed expansion, although to date no firm decisioa has been made.
Other Resources
1.25       Solar and Wind Energy.  Solar radiation is quite high and should
provide an attractive alternative to a small portion of Rwanda's high cost
imported energy. CEAER has done considerable work on solar installations,
and several units have been installed to heat water in homes and hotels.
However, the high investment cost has limited use of this alternative
source of energy. The Federal Republic of Germany and Energie des pays des
grands lacs (EGL) are working together, and compiling area maps of
insolation and wind energy.  Until these data are available, IDA does not
intend to pursue any activities related to these potential energy sources.
1.26       Geothermal.  FAC is financing a geological reconnaissance and a
hydrogeochemical survey of kwanda's geothermal potential, estimated at
about 100 MW3/.   The geological reconnaissance was completed in August
1983, and established the existence of a geothermal potential in the area
around Lake Kivu and the volcanoes in aorthern Rwanda.  No further action
is contemplated at this time, unless the geochemical analysis, expected
later in 1984, suggests otherwise.
Imported Energy: Petroleum
1.27       Rwanda is entirely dependent on foreign sources for its supply
of petroleum products, and due to its landlocked location, it is at a
particular disadvantage to potential suppliers. Until 1977, almost all of
the oil imports crossed Tanzania by rail from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma, were
barged up Lake Tanganyika to Bujumbura, and then transported by truck to
Rwanda.  However, tank car shortages reduced the capacity of the railway,
and as a result since 1981 all of the oil imported to Rwanda is refined in
Mombasa, transported by pipeline to Nairobi, and loaded into tank trucks
for a 1,500 kilometer journey via Uganda. As a result the cost of imported
petroleum products is about US$100 per barrel, including about US$37 for
freight.   A table showing the petroleum products price structure may be
found on the following page. A study of the possibility of obtaining oil
at a lower price by building a pipeline from the Indian Ocean to Burundi
and Rwanda indicated that the project would be uneconomical because of the
low volume of petroleum products used in the region. The delay on paving
the Rusumo-Isaka (Tanzania) road, has resulted in a delay in the purchasing
oil on international markets and bringing it across Tanzania, estimated in
the UNDP/World Bank report (para. 1.03) as saving 20% on present costs.

while the oil import bill for 1982 amounted to US$49 million, an apparent
annual  increase  of 29% from US$23  million in 1979.   The per capita

Rwanda's economy is very vulnerable to interruptions in the transportation
of oil, such as that which occurred during the early part of 1979, when
events in Uganda led to the closure of the road to Kenya. As a result,
Rwanda installed additional oil storage tanks sufficient to store about 10

Energy Sector Organizations
1.29        Until recently three ministries had major responsibility in the
sector: the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock under which falls the
Directorate of Waters and Forests, the Ministry of Natural Resources
(MIRENA) and the Ministry of Public Works, to which Electrogaz reported.
The latter two ministries have recently merged and become the Ministry of
Public Works and Energy (MPWE).   Petrorwanda, a mixed enterprise under
Government control, with six other companies, has responsibility for
importing petroleum products.
1.30           Rwanda is a member of two organizations established to
coordinate energy matters on a regional basis:  the Communaute economique
des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL) and its agency Energie des pays des grands
lacs (EGL) formed by Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire, coordinate energy matters
affecting the three countries; and the Organization for the Management and
Devlopment of the Kagera River Basin (KBO) made up of Burundi, Rwanda,
Uganda and Tanzania. A description of both of these organizations may be
found in Annex 3.
1.31           EGL has its headquarters in Bujumbura, and until Societe
internationale d'electricite des pays des grands lacs (Sinelac) (para.
2.10) was established, EGL was responsible for the development of the
Ruzizi HI (26 MW first phase, 40 MW ultimate) hydroelectric power site
downstream of the existing Ruzizi generating station on the border between
Zaire and Rwanda. EGL has a small staff made up of representatives of the
three countries.
1.32       KBO has its headquarters in Kigali, Rwanda, and, as in the case
of EGL, is made up of a small staff seconded from each country.   Its
principal activity in the energy sector is the study of the proposed
development of the Rusumo Falls site on the Rwanda-Tanzania border
(paras. 2.13 - 2.14).
Energy Sector Strategies
1.33          The Government's Role.   As has been noted, the Government
receives technical assistance in the energy sector from various aid
agencies and voluntary organizations. Until very recently, this assistance
to the energy sector was not well-coordinated by the Government, which
somewhat over-relied on good communication among and within the various
ministries; this will be simplified by the absorption of MIRENA by MPWE.
The Government's commitment to energy development is reflected in the
actions it is taking to respond to the recommendations of the UNDP/World
Bank recommendations (para. 1.03) and those of BUNEP/EPFL report (para.
1.05).   Recently the Government approached the Swiss Government for aid
with overall energy sector planning (para. 3.17). Its interest in fuelwood
conservation has been especially noted.
1.34        IDA's Role.  IDA is addressing, or proposing to address, key
energy issues under three different projects.   (i) Woodfuel issues.  The
Integrated Forestry and Livestock Development Project (Cr. 1039-RW, para.
1.12) is providing for experimental work on improved woodstoves in rural
areas and a study of the transformation into charcoal of the bamboo cleared



- 10 -
from areas in the Gishwati forest zone which are to be afforested.  Under
the Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1217-RW), programs would be prepared
to introduce and disseminate improved charcoal stoves in Kigali and
efficiency improvements in charcoal production (para. 1.16).  (ii) Power
subsector issues.  The Ruzizi II project (approved by the Bank on December
6, 1983) is the next least-cost option for providing additional electricity
to the region and to Rwanda (para. 2.10). A project preparation advance
(PPF No. 249) for the proposed project (para. 3.01), has provided funding
for studies for rehabilitation of the Ntaruka powerhouse and the
transmission line network, construction of new transmission lines, and
revaluation of Electrogaz's assets. In coordination with the related work
to be carried out under the Ruzizi II Project, under the proposed project,
Electrogaz's  training needs would  be assessed and provided for.    In
addition,   technical  assistance  would  be  provided  to  Electrogaz's
electricity department, including the creation of a planning unit within
Electrogaz.  A study of Electrogaz's electricity tariffs is being carried
out as part of the First Water Supply Project (Cr. 1345-RW), which became
efrective February 14, 1984.

CHAPTER II
POWER SECTOR
General
2.01           Until Rwanda became independent in 1964, the Region was
supplied with electrical power from two hydroelectric generating stations
constructed by la Societe des forces hydro-electriques de 1'est du Congo,
i.e. the Ruzizi hydroelectric generating station at the outlet of Lake
Kivu, 12.6 14W in 1958 (subsequently 28.2 MW in 1972), and the Ntaruka
hydroelectric generating station in what is now northern Rwanda, with two
3.75 MW units commissioned in 1958 and another 3.75 MW unit in 1976 (Map
IBRD 17959). The Ruzizi generating station supplied electric power to the
region which eventually became Rwanda, Burundi, and the Kivu province of
Zaire. The availability of electric power to consumers in the region is,
in general, limited to the major cities and towns, and it is estimated that
less than 2% of the total population has access to electricity - one of
the lowest percentages in the East Africa Region.
The Power Supply Company
2.02        A detailed description of Electrogaz which was established in
1976 for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
throughout Rwanda, may be found in Chapter 5.
Historical Demand for Electric Power
2.03          Since 1975, the annual increase in the consumption of low
voltage electricity (primarily for domestic consumers) grew at almost the
same rate as the number of consumers.   That is, the number of consumers
rose from 2,445 in 1975 to 5,798 in 1982, an average annual rate of 13%,
while the consumption rose from 12.4 GWh to 28.0 GWh, an average annual
rate of 12%.   The growth in demand for high voltage energy (basically
industrial) was somewhat slower, with an average annual rate of 9%, raising
consumption from 24.9 GWh to 45.4 GWh in the same period. The number of
high voltage consumers rose from 79 to 113, an average annual rate of 5%.
The total demand on the system during the past seven years grew at an
average annual rate of 10, while the number of new consumers grew at an
average annual rate of 12%. Details of the electricity sales from 1975 to
1982 may be found in Annex 4.
Existing Generating Facilities
2.04       Electrogaz has a total installed generating capacity of 27.4 MW,
of which 24.5 MW is hydro and the remainder diesel.   Details of the
generating facilities may be found in Annex 5. Most of the equipment is
old, failures are frequent, and losses are high (paras. 7.03 - 7.06) due to
a general lack of maintenance and availability of spare parts.   The main
sources of energy have been the Ruzizi hydroelectric generating station,
and the Ntaruka generating station in northern Rwanda (para. 2.01).   At



- 12 -
the time of Zaire's Independence, these stations became the responsibility
of that country's Societe nationale d'electricite (SNEL); the Ntaruka plant
reverted to Rwanda in 1977, and has since been operated by Electrogaz. The
Ntaruka generating station was then the main supply of electricity to
Kigali through a 70 kV transmission line (later 110 kV), while the Ruzizi I
generating station provided energy for industry and mines in southwestern
Rwanda through a  30 kV  transmission  line.   In  late  197a,  a  110 kV
transmission line from Ruzizi to Kigali was completed and provided the main
source of electrical energy for Rwanda (about 45 GWh or 65% in 1981).  With
the completion of the Mukungwa generating station (2 X 6 MW) in January,
1982, the supply of electricity from the Ruzizi generating station has been
reduced so that it provided only about 3% of the country's needs in
October, 1983, and Rwanda's dependency on the importation of electric power
has been temporarily reduced.
2.05        The Gisenyi hydroelectric generating station (2 x 0.56 MW) was
built by the Belgians in 1956, but by 1979 both units had failed because of
erosion of the turbine runner blades due to sand in the water, and to a
general aging and lack of maintenance of the electrical equipment.
Complete rehabilitation of the generating station was financed by the
Federal Republic of Germany through Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW)
and by the end of 1980 the station was capable of producing about 8.5 GWh
annually.
2.06        In addition to the foregoing, Electrogaz has, as standby equip-
ment, two 0.7 MW diesel generating units at Gatsaka, adjacent to Kigali,
one 0.75 MW unit at Kibongo, and has an abandoned 0.5 MW unit at Kibuye.
2.07         There are probably about 60 missions and tea factories which
operate their own diesel generating sets intermittently. The following are
typical installations located in the northeastern region of the country
Musanze (mission) - 3 kW; Jenda (tea) - 16 kW; and Kora (pyrethrum) -
10 kW.
Transmission System
2.08        Most of the system, except for the 110 kV lines and associated
equipment installed in 1978, is old and antiquated by today's standards,
and the design and layouts of the substations does not permit convenient
maintenance and servicing. For example, the Ntaruka generating station was
designed as an isolated plant, and now that power can be fed back to the
plant from other sources, additional disconnecting switches are required to
service the equipment properly. Also, with growth in demand, some circuits
are overloaded.   The lack of adequate over-voltage protection, automatic
switch reclosing equipment, and general deterioration of the facilities has
resulted in a significant reduction in reliable service to consumers, and a
component of this project would address  these deficiencies.   A brief
description of the major components follows.
2.09        (a) Switching Station.   Electrical energy is supplied to the
interconnected system at three main locations:



- 13 -
- at Ntaruka where power from the generators at 6.6 kV is raised
to 70 kV through three 5 MVA transformers.  The station also
contains a 70/30 kV 3.15 MVA transformer for local distribution.
- at Mukungwa where power from the generators at 6.6 kV is raised
to 110 kV through one 15 NVA transformer.   The power from
Ntaruka is tied into the system at this station through a 15 MVA
transformer 70/110 kV.
- at Mururu where power from Ruzizi is raised from 6.6 kV to 110
kV by a 10 MVA transformer. The station also contains a 6.6/30
kV transformer for local distribution.
(b) Transmission Lines.  The interconnected grid is made up of
the following: 200 km of single circuit 110 kV line on steel towers; 79 km
of single circuit 70 kV lines on steel towers; 230 km of single circuit 30
kV on steel towers; and 176 km of 15 kV lines - 78 km on steel tubes, 66 km
on wood poles and 32 km on steel pylons.  In December, 1980, a 6.6 kV
transmission line was completed from Gisenyi to Goma in Zaire, and this
town now enjoys a more reliable service from imported power than was
available from the existing diesel installation.
Cc) Substations.  There are nine main substations where 110 kV
power is reduced to 30 kV or 15 kV, the most important of which supply
Kigali and are located at Jabana, with one 110/70 kV transformer, 10 MVA,
and two 2.5 MVA transformers, 70/15 kV; and at Gikondo which has two 6 MVA
transformers, 100/15 kV. In addition, there are three substations where 70
kV power is reduced to 15 kV for local distribution.
Works in Progress
2.10         Construction of the Ruzizi II (first phase 26 NW) generating
station, based on feasibility studies by Tractionel of Belgium, is
underway. The Ruzizi II project, located on the border between Rwanda and
Zaire, which has been promoted by Rwanda, Zaire and Burundi, through EGL,
is the least-cost method of providing additional energy to the region and
to Rwanda. An international company, Sinelac, owned jointly by the three
countries-Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire-was formed on February 17, 1984, with
its headquarters in Bukavu, to implement, operate and maintain the
facilities,  scheduled  to  be  commissioned  early  in  1988.    IDA  is
participating in the financing of the project (US$45 million), the cost of
which is estimated at US$85 million.
2.11           A feasibility study of the proposed Gihira hydroelectric
generating station (two units of 1 KW) in northwestern Rwanda near Gisenyi
has been completed with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany through
KfW.  Construction began early in 1984, with completion scheduled for the
end of 1986. The only other works in progress in the electric power sector
are the construction of transmission line extensions: 30 kV from Ruhengeri
to Gisenyi and local distribution around Gisenyi, financed with funds
provided by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW, with completion
expected about the end of 1984; and the west transmission extension along
Lake Kivu financed by the Government of Switzerland, with completion in
1984.

Studies
2.12        EPFL and BUNEP were retained ly the Direct:cn de la -ooperation
au developpement et de l'aide humanitaire of Switzerland to produce a
comprehensive technical study of the system stability, protection,
operating  and  maintenance  procedures  for  the  generating  stations,
substations and transmission lines.   This study begun in April 1981 was
completed in December 1982, and concludes that, for reliability and safety,
there is an urgent need for a comprehensive rehabilitation of Electrogaz's
electricity production, transmission and distribution system.
2.13           Planning for development at the Rusumo Falls site is the
responsibility of KBO.  In 1978, KBO requested Tractionel and Electrobel,
Consulting Engineers, of Brussels, to prepare a report on the development
of the Kagera River.
2.14         During the meetings held by KBO in 1981 and attended by the
Presidents of the respective countries, a decision was made to rule out the
high dam alternative at the Rusumo Falls site, due to the extensive
flooding of arable land and the displacement of many thousands of people,
and to opt for a run-of-river scheme. Funds for the study have not been
found, and, because of its magnitude and cost, other projects may be
preferred when additional generating capacity is needed.
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.15        Although there exists at present no formal power development
program for the country, through its participation in the Ruzizi II
Hydroelectric Project, Rwanda has assured for itself an adequate supply of
electric energy. Current demand projections for the interconnected grid of
the Great Lakes Region (which serves Rwanda, Burundi and Eastern Zaire)
indicate that after the first two units of the Ruzizi II project are
commissioned in 1988, and the third in 1990, no new capacity will be needed
until after 1993.
2.16         The Government recognizes that the next major tasks to be
addressed with great urgency are to increase the currently very low
reliability of the existing transmission and distribution system (para.
7.03) and to extend its coverage to new potential consumers (para. 3.10).
The funds provided under this proposed project would be utilized to address
both of these objectives.
IDA Strategy in the Power Sector
2.17      IDA objectives in the power sector are:
(a) to help create a sound and efficient power supply organization
through upgrading substantially its managerial, financial and
technical performance;
(b) to support the expansion of electric generating capacity on a
least-cost basis in order to foster economic development and
growth;



- 15 -
(c) to improve greatly the reliability of the system to reduce the
massive economic losses resulting from frequent power outages and
voltage fluctuations.
2.18       In support of these objectives IDA participated in 1983 in the
financing of the inter-regional Ruzizi II hydro project which will jointly
supply the three countries of the Great Lake Region. The proposed project
would constitute the second IDA credit to the power sector of Rwanda.  It
would supplement the first by greatly increasing the reliability of
service, and improving sector performance and expand the existing
distribution network. The project would also support staff training needs,
system planning, financial and personnel management capabilities.

CHAPTER III
THE PROJECT
Background
3.01        The supply of electrical energy in Rwanda has been unreliable
due primarily to chronic lack of maintenance, and many interruptions have
occurred particularly during the rainy seasons when lightning strikes
affect the transmission system (para. 7.03). During the first nine months
of 1983 there were 89 unplanned power outages which, while inconvenient to
domestic consumers, caused serious loss to the commercial and industrial
sectors. Thus, with the initiation of the Ruzizi II Project (para. 2.10)
and with only 2% of the population having access to electricity, the
Government decided to proceed with the next obvious step, i.e. to improve
the electricity service to consumers and to expand the availability of
electricity to presently unserved markets, based on the additional
generating capacity added by Ruzizi II.   As a result, IDA received and
subsequently approved a request from the Government for a PPF (No. 249) in
the amount of US$440,000 to finance the following:
ci) a study to determine the technical and economic feasibility
of rehabilitating the Ntaruka hydroelectric power project,
built in 1958 (paras. 3.06 - 3.07);
(ii) a study to determine the estimated cost of rehabilitating the
transmission system and carrying out the recommendations
contained  in  a  report  'Etude  du  secteur energetique  au
Rwanda," May, 1983, funded by the Government of Switzerland
(para. 2.11);
(iii) a study of the cost to provide a supply of maintenance
equipment and spare parts for Electrogaz;
(iv) a study to determine the technical and economic feasibility
of enlarging the interconnected grid by extending eight 15 kV
and 30 kV transmission lines to serve an additional 18 towns;
and
(v) a revaluation of the fixed assets of Electrogaz.
3.02         Electrogaz retained the services of consultants (Fichtner of
the Federal Republic of Germany) who completed a report on the first four
items covering the requirements for a safe and reliable supply of
electrical energy to its consumers. Consultants for the revaluation of the
fixed assets of Electrogaz are Fichtner and Societe d'amfinagement urbain et
rural (SAUR, France), who is also carrying out the accounting aspect of the
revaluation.
3.03        On the basis of these reports, the Government requested IDA to
give consideration to providing part of the funds necessary to rehabilitate
and maintain its facilities, and to extend service to new consumers. As a
result, a mission visited Rwanda in October, 1983, to appraise the proposed
project.



- 17 -
Objectives
3.04           The main objective of the proposed project is to provide
improved reliability of production, transmission and distribution of
electrical energy, to serve additional consumers, and to help sustain the
economic growth of the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors of the
country.  The proposed project is the least costly method of meeting this
objective. In addition, by training Electrogaz's staff and with the help
of technical advisers, the project would strengthen the institutional
aspects of Electrogaz in planning and personnel management, organization of
its electricity department, resulting in improvement of operation and
maintenance.
Project Description
3.05       The main features of the project are summarized as follows:
- the rehabilitation of the Ntaruka generating station (two
3.75 KW units constructed in 1958, and a third in 1976);
- the rehabilitation of the transmission network;
- the construction of new transmission lines;
- the supply of an adequate inventory of maintenance equipment
and spare parts;
- the provision of vehicles;
- technical assistance to Electrogaz; and
- consulting engineering services.
Ntaruka Generating Station
3.06      The intake, tunnel, and penstock, carrying water from Lake Bulera
to the powerhouse are in good repair. In several places, minor spalling of
the concrete in the tunnel would require attention, and the interior of the
penstock would require painting.   The seals on the spherical valves that
control the water to three turbines require replacement, and new seals,
wearing rings and wicket gates would be required on all three units. The
runner on Unit 1 was replaced about two years ago, and new runners are
required on the remaining 2 units.   The possibility of obtaining runners
with improved efficiency is being investigated. Unit 3 would require a new
shaft as well, and minor repairs are required on the auxiliary service
equipment.
3.07        While the rotors of the generators appear in good shape, the
stator windings of Units  1 and 2 require replacement as well as all
three voltage regulators.  With regard to electrical controls, the entire
protection system requires replacement, as well as a rearrangement of the
station service supply, and general modifications to allow the units to be
more  easily  synchronized  to  the  system.    New  battery  and  telephone
equipment  is required.   Minor modifications would be required  to the
buildings and other structures to permit completion of some of the
foregoing items.



- 18 -
Transmission System Rehabilitation
3.08       ; considerable number of revisions and replacements are required
in  the  ilterconnected  transmission grid  (para.  2.08).   Most of these
involve the replacement of existing transformers with transformers of
larger capacity, the revision of the switchgear to permit proper
maintenance, the inclusion of automatic reclosing switches, and in some
cases the replacement of control panels, direct current control circuits,
and the station service supply of electricity. The major work would be at
the Jabana substation which has caused many failures in supply to Kigali.
The replacement and resetting of protective relays would reduce many of the
now frequent outages.
3.09           Communications  on  the  system are poor  and  Fichtner  has
recommended new remote telemetering and control equipment be installed
because the existing equipment is outmoded and cannot be expanded.
Additional telephone equipment would also be required.
New Transmission Lines
3.10            Fichtner  has  studied  the  feasibility  of  extending  the
interconnected grid (para. 3.02) to areas established by the Government as
follows (Map IBRD 17959):

Gikongoro - Kigoma           to 10,000
3.11       The selected design was based on the forecast peak demand over a
25 year period 1987-2012, and, in order to reduce the initial capital cost,
the transformer ratings were assumed to carry the load only to 1996, on the
assumption that increased transformer capacity would be added later when
needed.   This established the most economical voltage as shown in the
table. The estimated cost of the 110 kV and 30 kV lines were based on the
use of steel towers while concrete poles were assumed for the 15 kV line.
The routes for the 30 kV and 15 kV lines were selected along existing roads
to minimize the cost of construction and maintenance.
3.12       In general, Fichtner computed the internal rates of return using
methods according to IDA practice. The results indicated that lines No. 3
and 4 had economic rates of return on investment of 10% and 12% respec-
tively, while the remainder were well below acceptable limits because of
the forecast weak demand for electrical energy. Thus, only lines No. 3 and
4 have been included for further consideration (para. 7.12). It should be
noted that the study of a proposed interconnection of the grid from Kigoma,



- 19 -
Rwanda, to the plant under construction at Rwegura, Burundi, while not
needed in the immediate future, would be invaluable in strengthening the
interconnected system and provide an alternate route for the transmission
of power in event of failure, particularly after the demand for electrical
energy in Rwanda and Burundi grows larger.
Maintenance Equipment and Spare Parts
3.13         Many of the failures in the electrical system are due to the
general lack of replacement and spare parts needed in the day-to-day
operation of the system. Thus, this component of the project would provide
about three years supply of such items as conductors, insulators,
distribution transformers, etc. as well as small items such as charts for
recording instruments, lamps for annunciator panels, relays, silica gel to
absorb humidity in equipment, and numerous other items.  Small tools to
augment the existing equipment in the various generating and sub-stations
would also be included, as well as items of safety equipment, such as hard
hats, protective equipment for welding, safety glasses, hot line gloves,
etc. During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government. that in
the future, foreign exchange would be provided to maintain a supply of
maintenance equipment and spare parts at an adequate level for proper
maintenance of the equipment.   IDA has estimated that the equivalent of
about US$500,000 would be required to fulfill this condition annually.
Included in this component is the provision of a computer, which is
urgently needed for technical computations.
Technical Assistance
3.14            Electrogaz's administrative and financial operations are
extremely weak as discussed in detail in paras. 5.08 and 6.01, and in order
to correct this, a component of the Water Supply Project (CR 1345-RWA) is
the provision of a management assistance team from SAUR financed by CCCE,
which is cofinancing the project. SAUR began their two-year assignment in
January 1984, and are concentrating their efforts in the following areas:
accounting and budgeting procedures; billing and receivables; procurement,
stores, and inventory; personnel management; revision of the tariff
structure for water and electricity; and the institution of a new
computerized system of accounts by mid-1985.
3.15       The technical assistance which would be provided by this project
would complement SAUR's program by providing expert assistance in advising
the Manager, planning for the electricity department, and training of
electricity department staff.  In order to accomplish this, agreement was
reached during negotiations that Electrogaz would create three new
positions  as  follows:    Manager  of  Engineering,  Manager  of  Training
(electrical) and an Assistant Manager of Training (electrical), that
competent staff would be assigned to these positions and that competent
specialists would be retained to assist and advise the new appointees. In
March 1984, at the request of IDA, Electrogaz appointed a Personnel Manager
acceptable  to  IDA.    During  negotiations  agreement  was  reached  with
Electrogaz that part of his responsibilities would be to approve all staff
appointments.
3.16        Adviser to the Manager.  In March 1984, the Manager requested
that an adviser be financed under the proposed project to assist him in the



- 20 -
organization of the company and in the preparation and supervision _f day
t_ .L; ;~licy decisions involving the va-!nus departments of the company.
Thus, a component of this project would be the provision of funds from
CCCE to cover the cost of an adviser to the Manager for a period of not
less than three years.   Among other things he and the personnel manager
would design and introduce systems for manpower management, including
planning, recruitment, job analysis, appropriate records, evaluation,
career   development,   including   training   needs,   superannuation   and
termination.   During negotiations, agreement was reached with Electrogaz
that an adviser to the Manager would be appointed and a draft policy paper
on personnel policy and procedures would be issued by June 30, 1985, and
that IDA would be given the opportunity to discuss the details.
3.17        Engineering Adviser.  To date, planning for the electric power
sector has been carried out by the Ministry of Planning, and Electrogaz has
had no  responsibility  in  these  activities.    Receatly  the  Government
requested the Government of Switzerland for assistance in setting up an
energy planning unit under a newly appointed Director General of Energy
within MPWE.   This request is understandable because there is a need for
overall energy coordination, but MPWE wishes to retain the responsibility
for   electricity   planning   and   investment   programming,   relegating
implementation to Electrogaz.   However, Electrogaz should be responsible
for planning because it has the technical and financial responsibility for
the supply of electrical energy.   One of  the  recommendations  of  the
UNDP/Bank energy assessment report was the "establishment of a strong
planning unit within Electrogaz to coordinate the efforts of Electrogaz and
Rwandan participation in EGL and KBO in order to program investments in the
best interests of the country". Thus, funds from CCCE are provided in this
project for an engineer, experienced in planning of electrical utilities,
to work with his Rwandese counterpart for a period of not less than three
years.   During negotiations agreement was reached to hire the engineer,
whose main responsibility would be to assist in the preparation of a
five-year master plan for investments in the electricity sector, to be
issued by June 30, 1985. His duties would also include the setting up of
an engineering unit, assisting in carrying out design and implementation of
projects, and providing advice on operation and maintenance of the system.
He would also have to devise an action program to investigate the high
losses which occur in the system (para. 7.06). This would be addressed in
two  areas:    technical,  such as  poor  connections,  worn  switches,  and
overloaded circuits; and administrative, such as unbilled and unmetered
consumers, and Electrogaz's internal use of electricity in station services
and offices.   This would  be followed  by a program  to correct  these
deficiencies, and the establishment of targets to be achieved during the
rehabilitation program (para. 5.16).
3.18       Training Advisers.  Funds have been provided in the Water Supply
Project (CR 1325-RWA) for the construction of a training centre for
Electrogaz, and during negotiations agreement was reached with Electrogaz
to retain the services of two training specialists (one for protection and
communications, one for electrical and mechanical maintenance) for a period
of three years, funded by CCCE, to train staff in the following specific
topics:
(i)   protection and safety on transmission systems;



- 21 -
(ii)  electronics  and  telecommunications,  as  more  sophisticated
control systems would be introduced in the rehabilitation of the
network and, later, in the construction of the Ruzizi II
facilities;
(iii) maintenance of overhead lines, which is now carried out by
foreign contractors employing imported workers;
(iv)  switchgear  and  transformer  maintenance,  including  preventive
maintenance, dismantling and repair.
3.19        Agreement was reached with Electrogaz during negotiations that
the training specialists and their counterparts would prepare a training
plan by June 30, 1985, which would include but not be limited to, a list of
personnel requiring training, forecasting needs, designing course syllabi,
equipping the electrical laboratories in the training centre, and
recruitment  of  local  trainers.    The  training  needs  of  Electrogaz's
accounting and administrative personnel are covered in CCCE's part of the
water supply project, and therefore there is no need for an administrative
training component in the proposed project.
3.20       It is highly advisable that the four specialists to be financed
under the project be retained from the same utility, so as to minimize the
task of managing the team, and provide greater cooperation amongst them,
and  Electrogaz  agreed  with  this  recommendation.    The  possibility of
twinning Electrogaz with another utility to enable the interchange of
various personnel was recommended. IDA has approved the terms of reference
for the assignments.
Environmental Considerations
3.21          The electrical  components of the project  consist  of  the
rehabilitation of existing facilities and equipment, which have had no
negative environmental effect.  The proposed new transmission lines would
operate at medium and low voltage and there would be minimal negative
impact on the environment.

CHAPTER IV
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
4.01        The total project cost is estimated to be RwF 1,872.1 million
(US$19.3 million equivalent) not including duties and taxes which the
Government has agreed would not be levied on the project and excluding
interest during construction. The foreign exchange component is estimated
to be RwF 1,688.4 million (US$17.2 million equivalent), about 89% of the
total project  cost,  not  including interest during construction.   The
estimated cost of the principal components of the project are shown on the
following page.
Basis for Estimates
4.02          The project cost estimates for the technical assistance and
consulting engineering components were prepared by IDA, and the remaining
items were prepared by Fichtner, on the basis of costs  f December 31,
1983.   The cost estimates were reviewed by IDA and were found to be
reasonable.   Physical contingencies of 20% were added to the cost of
rehabilitation of the Ntaruka generating station and the transmission
system because of the uncertainty about the actual state of equipment until
it is dismantled for repair.  Physical contingencies of 10% were added to
the remaining items.  Price contingencies were added to the base cost plus
physical contingencies on local costs as follows: 1984 and 1985 - 9.5Z;
1986-1988 - 9%; and on foreign costs as follows: 1984 - 3.5%; 1985 - 8.0%;
1986-1988 - 9.0%.
4.03      IDA has estimated that of a total of 200 staf'months which would
be required for the design and supervision of the project, approximately
115 staffmonths would be expended in the home office and 85 staffmonths in
Rwanda.   The cost of the engineering contract is estimated to be US$1.8
million, of which US$1.5 million would be in foreign exchange. The average
cost per staffmonth (cost of services, travel and subsistence) is estimated
to be US$9,000.
Financing Plan
4.04        The proposed IDA Credit of US$9.0 million (RwF 873.0 million)
would finance about 47Z of the estimated project cost, RwF 1,872.1 million
(US$19.3 million), and about 52% of the estimated foreign component of the
project, RwF 1,668.4 million (US$17.2 million), in both cases excluding
interest during construction. It would be used to finance:
a) repayment  of  the  PPF   (US$1,000,000)   for  preliminary
engineering studies, detailed design, preparation of contract
documents and project supervision (para. 4.08); and

Status of Engineering and Implementation Schedule
4.08            The rehabilitation of the Jabana sub-station is required
urgently because of the frequent failure in the supply of electricity to
Kigali. Thus, one of the items to be completed by Fichtner. under the PPF
(para. 3.01) was not only to determine the required remedial works, but
also to prepare tender documents so that the needed repairs may be carried
out without delay.  The project schedule (Annex 7) is based on completion
of  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Ntaruka  generating  station  and  the
transmission system by mid-1987, well before the completion of the Ruzizi
II  generating  station  in  mid-1988.    During  negotiations  Electrogaz
requested the increase of the PPF (No. 249) from US$440,000 to US$1,000,000
to cover the engineering costs until the loan becomes effective for the
following:
(i) the preparation of detailed design and tender documents, and the
call for and analysis of tenders; and
(ii) project supervision.
The provision of these funds will permit an earlier completion of much
needed rehabilitation.  The new transmission lines would be located close
to existing roads, and as no major structures are required, the anticipated
completion by the end of 1987 appears to be reasonable. Although it would
be desirable to have early delivery of the maintenance equipment, spare
parts and vehicles, the proposed schedule is realistic.
Procurement
4.09       Some of the items to be purchased under the proposed IDA Credit
are proprietary in nature and can only be supplied by the original



- 25 -
manufacturer (e.g. the turbine runners).   Thus it would be necessary for
Electrogaz to negotiate directly with the original manufacturer for the
supply, and guarantee for any installation, of these types of equipment,
and the total cost of items to be purchased in this manner is not expected
to exceed US$500,000.  For other items, specifications for materials and
equipment would be assembled into groups of similar items, to be purchased
either under IDA's guidelines for international competitive bidding for
contracts expected to exceed US$100,000 or for international shopping
procedures for items under US$100,000, where several suppliers would be
invited to  submit  proposals.    The  contract  to carry out  the  actual
rehabilitation work in the Ntaruka powerhouse and the new transmission
lines would be let in accordance with IDA's guidelines for international
competitive bidding.   The cons ltants for engineering design and project
supervision and t-chnical assistance would be selected in accordance with
IDA guidelines. During negotiations agreement was reached that Electrogaz
would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to IDA. Procurement for
items of the project financed by CCCE would be purchased in accordance with
the agency's normal practices.

Disbursements
4.10       The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed over four years on
the following basis:   100% of the foreign cost for the rehabilitation of
the Ntaruka generating station, the new transmission lines, the maintenance
equipment and spare parts, vehicles, and consulting engineering services.
The remaining funds would be disbursed from CCCE and Electrogaz.   The
closing date for the credit would be June 30, 1988, and any savings which
may accrue due to lower purchase prices, or if all contingency funds are
not utilized, would be cancelled.   The disbursement schedule in Annex 8
differs from that of an average power project in that a rehabilitation
component does not involve new construction. The majority of the funds for
the consulting engineering would be required in 1984 and 1985. Most of the



- 26 -
funds would be disbursed upon the delivery of the maintenance equipment,
spare parts, and vehicles, during the latter part of 1985 and early 1986,
while funds for the rehabilitation of the Ntaruka powerhouse and the new
transmission lines would be needed more or less uniformly during 1985, 1986
and 1987.

CHAPTER V
THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
5.01       The Borrower would be the Rwandese Republic, which would receive
from IDA SDR 8.5 million (US$9 million) and would onlend the funds to
Electrogaz und3r terms equal to those in effect for Bank loans at the time
of Board apprcval.
Electrogaz - The Implementing Agency
5.02       E'l.ctrogaz is a parastatal commercial organization wholly owned
by the Government of Rwanda, and is responsible for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity and gas throughout the country
and for the treatment and distribution of water in urban areas, and its
monopoly of this responsibility for a period of 99 years-was established by
decree law No. 18/76 in 1976. It currently reports to MPWE.
5.03        Electrogaz is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of
five members including a Chairman, who is also Secretary General of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication.   The law also provides  for a
commissioner of the Government to oversee the activities of Electrogaz and
monitor decisions of the Board.   He is invited to all meetings of the
Board, where he acts in an advisory role. Members are appointed for three
years by the President of the Republic from nominations made by MPWE. The
Board is empowered with complete supervision of the management and
administration of Electrogaz. Statutes and organization of its departments
are proposed by the Board and issued by Presidential Decree.  Day to day
management of operations are delegated by the Board to a Manager appointed
by the President of the Republic. In theory, the power delegated to him is
considerable, but in the area of personnel management, i.e. hiring,
discharging, establishing salary levels and in electricity planning, his
practical authority is limited by MPWE, which closely supervises
Electrogaz.   The Manager is thus deprived of two of his most powerful
management tools, and, as MPWE lacks competent staff, responsibility for
Electrogaz's poor corporate performance is difficult to determine.
Administrative and financial performance is weak as mentioned earlier
(para. 3.14) and technical performance also is poor as shown by the high
losses in system operations (para. 7.06) and the frequent and lengthy power
failures (para. 7.03).   Improvement can only be achieved as a result of
substantial technical assistance including the preparation and control of a
long term electricity investment program (para. 3.17), training (paras.
3.18 through 3.20), and then granting full responsibility for Electrogaz's
performance to its management.
5.04        The decree (para 5.02) also provides for the appointment of two
account controllers (commissaires aux comptes) with the responsibility of
overseeing the accounting and financial operations of Electrogaz. They are
required to report to the Minister on the annual balance sheet and income



- 28 -
statement.   The controllers are untrained (one is the Rwanda consul in
Mombasa) and cannot be accepted in lieu of an independent auditor.   For
this reason IDA required under Credit 1345-RWA that the accounts be
reviewed by acceptable auditors (para. 5.12).
5.05           The presidential decree no.  279/15 of  1978 defines  the
responsibilities of the management and of the three departments of
Electrogaz:
- administrative and financial department;
- electricity department; and
- water and gas department.
An organization chart is shown in Annex 9, and the distribution of the 543
technical staff in the various departments is shown in Annex 10. The three
department  heads  report  to  the  Manager.    Although  the  organization
structure appears acceptable, except for the absence of clear personnel and
planning responsibilities, management is not fully effective, both because
of a shortage of adequately qualified and experienced personnel, and a lack
of clear authority (para. 5.03).
5.06         A study and planning section is provided in each technical
department within Electrogaz, but their scope is limited to day to day
execution.    Long-term planning  for electricity  is  lacking  as  it  is
implemented on an ad hoc basis by MPWE, with insufficient and inexperienced
staff.   Neither MPWE nor Electrogaz has adequately addressed electricity
planning in Rwanda, and one of the objectives of the project is to redress
that situation.
5.07      Furthermore, nroject management and accounting are inadequate as
the cost of works in I agress and of completed projects is unknown.  This,
combined with a totally inadequate recording of long-term debt (para. 5.11)
gives  an  unreliable  picture  of  Electrogaz's  long-term  assets  and
commitments.
5.08        It has been clear for some time that Electrogaz's operational
management required improvement in all areas - technical, financial,
administrative, procurement and planning, thus a management study, financed
by CCCE, was carried out by SAUR, the third largest French water utility,
prior to the May 1982 appraisal of the Rwanda water project.   IDA was
consulted and approved the terms of reference for the provision of a
management assistance team to address the issues of tariff, accounting,
financial management, procurement, inventory and all other administrative
operations of Electrogaz.  This management team of five specialists from
SAUR, a mission leader, a sales expert, an accountant, a computer expert
and a water supply engineer, began their two-year contract in January
1984. SAUR is introducing an accounting package, which should be effective
as the present accounting is very weak. Each SAUR specialist works with an
Electrogaz counterpart, whom he trains.  SAUR's progress will be reviewed
by CCCE at the end of the two year contract, which might be extended if at
that time it appears justified.   It is expected that this assistance,
coupled with the supplemental assistance under the proposed project, should
serve to strengthen management and improve Electrogaz's financial operating
and planning performance.



- 29 -
Management, Personnel and Training
5.09        As part of the technical assistance financed under the proposed
project, dates for the appointment of adequately experienced and trained
persons to key positions, and for preparation and approval of policy papers
and procedures were part of a plan of action agreed upon during
negotiations (paras. 3.16 - 3.20).
5.10        As of mid-October 1983, Electrogaz had a total staff of 1,026,
of  whom  41  were  university  graduates  (Annex  10).    The  Electricity
Department had a staff of 307 and 14 university graduates. All categories
of staff are in need of training.  Standards and organization of work need
to be improved in all the areas of the utility's operations.  Electrogaz
has about 5,200 water customers and 5,900 electricity consumers, which
gives an employee/consumer ratio of about 1/11 on an aggregate basis,
indicating that Electrogaz is overstaffed, 6/ or more significantly that
the number of connections is low. The excess of employees is difficult to
estimate prior to the results of SAUR's work and persolnel organization
(para.  3.15).   It was agreed at negotiations  that there would be no
recruitment of non-professional staff until the enactment of a cost
reduction program acceptable to IDA (para. 6.05).
Accounting and Audit
5.11       Electrogaz has a detailed accounting system which is designed to
produce information on annual operating costs and statistics.   However,
data from branches arrives late, consolidation into the annual summaries is
delayed, and the method of presentation obscures an overview of the
operations.   Furthermore, because of the absence of trained personnel in
the administrative and financial department, the accounting framework is
not used properly and the annual financial statements are grossly
inadequate, as the auditors pointed out in their comments on the 1981 and
1982 accounts. Among others, the auditors' comments were:
Ci)    no accounting system for capital works exists,  the costs of
projects are obtained from often incomplete estimates, and there
is no reliable -works in progress account;
(ii)   there is confusion between subsidies and long-term debt, and
interest on debt is not recorded;
(iii)  billing is incomplete, the general balance of receivables does
not correspond to the number of individual balances;
(iv)  physical inventories are incomplete, and some fixed assets are
computed as inventories;
6/ In Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the ratios
are 1/49, 33, 15, 34, 21, 19, 36 respectively.



- 30 -
(v) old procedures, dating from ELECTROGAZ's inception, have been
gradually discontinued or become ineffective.
Such items from the auditors' analysis indicate the necessity and urgent
need of management assistance.   To improve E-lectrogaz's accounting, SAUR
will thoroughly review Electrogaz's accounts and accounting system and will
propose new procedures that will be submitted to Electrogaz's auditors
before setting up a computerized accounting system.
5.12        There had been no audit of Electrogaz before Credit 1345-RWA;
the audit of the 1981 accounts by auditors acceptable to IDA was a
condition of i-s effectiveness and was completed in mid-1982.   The 1982
accounts have also been audited (report of September 1983) and the auditors
plan only to perform a specifically limited auditing of the 1983 accounts,
as no improvement in accounting can be expected to have taken place between
the auditings, given the lack of trained personnel who would have been
necessary to implement previous recommendations.   However, the appraisal
mission requested that the auditors, Price Waterhouse (PW), comment on the
management assistance team's reports to optimize their contribution
especially in relation to PW's accounting recommendations (para. 5.11).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, as agreed under Credit
1345-RW, Electrogaz would produce separate income statements, funds flow
statements, and balance sheets for electricity, water and gas, annually,
before June 30, 1986, and they would continue to be audited by auditors
acceptable to IDA and that their reports would be available six months
after the closing date of Electrogaz's accounts.
Insurance
5.13       Insurance in the past, apart from statutory insurance, has only
covered freight and transport of goods as Electrogaz has operated on the
Government basis of self insurance without making any provision for
an insurance fund.   It was agreed during the negotiations of the water
project that the management assistance team (para. 5.08) would undertake a
review of this policy with a view to providing a suitable insurance
coverage for the assets.
Assets Revaluation
5.14       The revaluation study of the water assets is financed under the
water supply project (CR 1345-RWA), and the revaluation study of
Electrogaz's electricity and gas fixed assets is financed under PPF P249.
Electrogaz has retained the services of Fichtner and SAUR to proceed with
technical revaluation of electricity, water and gas assets, and SAUR is
coordinating the results and preparing the accounting register of assets.
Fichtner's study containing the evaluation of the electricity assets was
completed by the end of March 1984 and concluded to a 22X revaluation of
Electrogaz net electricity fixed assets over their book value, at the end
of 1983.   SAUR will also provide a method to revaluate the assets with
appropriate indices annually, in such a way that the data on revalued
assets could be ready at the same time as the financial statements.
5.15        It was agreed at negotiations that each year Electrogaz would
update the value of its fixed assets in operation according to the method
proposed in the assets revaluation study (para. 5.14).



- 31 -
Project Monitoring
5.16         During negotiations, agreement was reached with Electrogaz on
the reports and records necessary to monitor the progress of the project.
Proposed guidelines for monitoring may be found in Annex 11. On completion
of the Project Electrogaz would produce a project completion report.  Some
key performance targets are listed below:

next chapter (cost reduction, technical assistance, organizational changes,
improved financial controls, maintenance and plant rehabilitation (paras.
3.18 through 3.20, 6.04, 6.05)) have been designed to achieve the improved
performance targets projected above, and were fully discussed at
negotiations.

CHAPTER VI
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Electrogaz's Financial Position
6.01       Electrogaz's accounts were audited for the years 1981 and 1982,
and the audited income statements and balance sheets are shown for those
two years in Annex 12.  In 1981 Electrogaz suffered a net deficit of RwF
282 (US$3.1) million after charging depreciation based on the historical
value of the assets.   After the increase of tariffs on January 1, 1982,
which tripled for water (from RwF 20.3/m3 to RwF 6b.1/m3) and doubled for
electricity (from RwF 5.1/kWh to RwF 10.5/kWh or US¢11.5/kWh), net
operating income increased to RwF 194 million (US$2.1) million, which still
produced a low rate of return on net fixed assets (2.5%) even though they
and the corresponding depreciation were not revalued.  The rate of return
on non-revalued assets improved markedly between 1981 and 1982 from -4% to
2.5%, and the current ratio from 1.1 to 1.7. As mentioned in para. 5.11,
Electrogaz's accounts are most unreliable and the main comments on some key
items in Electrogaz's accounts are the following:
(i) Receivables at the end of 1982 were at the level of about six
months of revenues, about twelve months for the public sector
and five months for the private sector, which justified the
early arrival of SAUR's sales expert (para. 5.08) who is
reviewing  Electrogaz's  procedures  for  meter  reading  and
inspection, billing, collecting and disconnecting delinquent
customers.
(ii) It is difficult to form a reasonable opinion on the level of
inventory in Electrogaz because of poor inventory control
(preliminary  estimates  following  PW's  supervision  of  the
physical inventory indicate that actual inventory is about twice
s,the recorded inventory), but it appears that a level of 3.5% of
the historical value of net fixed assets or 16 months of
purchases of consumables and spare parts is low for a landlocked
country remote from any port. Fichtner has determined in their
study (para. 3.02) the level of inventory necessary for normal
electricity operations of Electrogaz, and SAUR is reviewing
Electrogaz's procedures for procurement, indexing of items and
inventory management.
(iii) Because no reliable accounting of Electrogaz's long-term debt
and interest due exists, the ratio between gross income (net
income plus depreciation) and debt service which is estimated at
more than 10 is not meaningful, as Electrogaz does not account
for interest due and incorrectly records its long term debts.
(iv) The debt equity ratio of 27:73 in 1982 is fairly low, because
the Government treats its loans as a contribution to investment
to Electrogaz and because the -long term debt- account is
incomplete.



- 33 -
(vj The current ratio of 1.7 in 1982 is satisfactory, but its level
is partly the result of the high level of receivables.
6.02       Electrogaz's financial statements for electricity operations for
the year 1982, and forecast financial statements for the year 1983 through
1991 appear in Annex 13.   The main assumptions for the preparation of
financial forecasts appear in Annex 14, and the main results are discussed
in para. 6.06.  The 1982 accounts have been prepared on the basis of the
information obtained by the appraisal mission, as Electrogaz does not
separate the accounts of its three activities - electricity, water and gas
- except for the revenues and related operational expenses.  SAUR (para.
5.08) produced a rough draft of the electricity financial statements in
October 1983.
Financing Plan
6.03         On the basis of Electrogaz's present unreviewed accounts and
recently revalued assets (para. 5.14), the financing plan for the five-year
period, 1984-1988, is presented in the table on the following page.  The
IDA credit of SDR 8.5 million (US$9 million) would be made available to the
Government of Rwanda. The latter would onlend the IDA credit to Electrogaz
under a subsidiary loan agreement on commercial terms, which would provide
for a period of repayment of twenty years, including a five-year grace
period, at the Bank rate prevalent at the time of Board approval.
Electrogaz would assume the foreign exchange risk. 7/ Execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement and fulfillment of all conditions precedent to
disbursement of cofinanciers' funds would be conditions of effectiveness.
The interest during the grace period would accrue to the onlent loan to
Electrogaz, would thus be financed by Government, and would be amortized
with the principal after the grace period. CCCE has formally indicated its
readiness to finance the transmission system rehabilitation and the
technical assistance components of the proposed project in both local and
foreign funds, for an approximate amount of US$9.2 million equivalent
(para. 4.05). Terms of its loan to Government and of the retroceded loan
to  Electrogaz  are  identical:    period  of  repayment  of  fifteen  years
including a five-year grace period, and interest rate of 5Z.  Electrogaz
would finance about 46% of the capital works program for electricity for
the five years 1984-1988, a percentage that IDA finds satisfactory.   The
main investment expenditures over the period (Annex 13) are the
construction of the Gihira and Gisenyi plants and the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri 30
kV transmission line financed by KfW (para. 2.11) (RwF 1,120 million
equivalent to US$11.5 million), the west transmission extension along Lake
Kivu financed by Swiss aid and the Gisenyi-Kibizondo-Nyabisindo local line
7/ Long term lending rates charged by the Bank of Rwanda are currently 9
to 10%.   In view of the nature of the project and the rates of
inflation in Rwanda (6.5% in 1981, 10% in 1982, 6.5Z in 1983 and
forecasts of 9.5% in 1984 and 9% in 1985 and 1986), the Bank rate seems
appropriate for the project.

financed by KfW (RwF 105 million equivalent to $1.1 million), the 13 local
transmission lines financed by FED/CCCE (RLF 750 million, equivalent to
US$7.7 million) and the Rwandese participation in the Ruzizi II Project
(RwF 106 million, equivalent to US$1.1 million).   Other maintenance works
and projects unidentified by lack of an adequate investment program (para.
3.17) have been estimated at RwF 3,140 million, equivalent to US$32.3
million, mainly for the period 1986-1988 when works should start on new
sources of generation for the country.
Tariffs
6.04        Tariffs were doubled at the beginning of 1982 (para. 6.01) and
should be examined with respect to their present level of US10. 8/kWh,
which is rather high, and to the level of the long run marginal cost of
power in Rwanda estimated at US¢10.9/kWh (RwF10.6/kWh) in 1984 (Annex 15).
Thus, on the basis of present estimate of Electrogaz's financial
performance, and given the inadequacy of its accounting statements, it is
difficult to justify a further increase in tariffs at this stage.   An
electricity tariff increase does not appear warranted before 1986 when the
average tariff would be revised up to the level of long run marginal cost
in real terms, and the following increases could then be yearly. However,
the determination of tariffs should be decided in 1985 on the basis of more
reliable accounts and of the studies then available (revaluation of assets,
tariff structure as required by a covenant of the Water Supply Project,
cost reduction) and it would be agreed at negotiations that this would be
part of a financial recovery plan with covenants related to the level of
receivables, inventory control, cost reduction program and accompanied by
management and technical indicators (para. 5.16 and 6.05). Meanwhile, the
cash flow covenant negotiated for the Water Supply Project (CR 1345-RWA)
should be repeated, that Electrogaz shall from time to time take, or cause
to be taken, all such measures including, without limitation, adjustments
of the structure or levels of its water, electricity and gas tariffs and
shall be required to produce, for each of financial years after the
financial year ending on December 31, 1984, funds from internal sources
equivalent to not less than 25% of its annual average of capital
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, during that year, the
previous year and the following financial year.   In the following table,
electricity tariffs are shown equal to the long-run marginal cost in 1984
terms, for the period 1986-1989. With such electricity tariffs, the ratio
of internally generated funds by electricity to the three year average
electricity construction expenditures would always be well above 25%, as
shown in the table.   During the  1986-1989 period electricity rates of
return on revalued assets would fluctuate at a ±jw level, between 1.4% and
2.4%, because of present uncertainty about the efficiency of the
implementation of the cost reduction program :.o be presented in 1985
(para. 6.05).

Other Financial Covenants
6.05       A plan of financial recovery to improve Electrogaz's management
of operations, as well as targets for management and technical performance
was agreed upon at negotiations as follows:
- reduction of the amount of receivables from its 1983 level of
six months' sales of electricity and water to four months by
the end of 1984, and three months at the end of 1985 and
thereafter;
- issue of an inventory and procurement management guide
acceptable to the Bank on or before March 31, 1985, with
supervision of its implementation by the consultant who would
supervise the implementation of the proposed project;
- issue of a cost reduction program acceptable to IDA on or
before March 31, 1985.
- preparation of separate financial statements for electricity,
gas and water (income statements, funds flow statements and
balance sheets) for the financial year 1984, before June 30,
1986 (para 5.12).
Details of the implementation of this financial recovery plan cannot be
worked out on the basis of presently available information, IDA would
therefore discuss appropriate measures with SAUR's management team (para.
5.08) as its work progresses. Furthermore, it was agreed at negotiations
that Electrogaz would not incur any debt, without IDA's prior approval, if
after the incurrence of such debt Electrogaz's debt service ratio would be
less than 1.5, that Electrogaz would consult with the Association before
committing itself to any capital investment other than the project in
excess of US$10 million, and that any further investment in Electrogaz by
the Government would be, to the extent permitted by the debt limitation
provision, in the form of loans rather than contributions to capital.
Electrogaz's Future Electricity Financial Position
6.06        Sales of Electrogaz are projected to increase from 77 GWh in
1983 to 143 GWh in 1991 at an average annual rate of 8%.  Electricity



- 37 -
revenues would increase during the same period, with the estimated average
tariffs (para. 6.04), from RwF 935 million to RwF 3,000 million at an
average annual rate of 16X.   The operating ratio for electricity would
increase during the period from 80% to 90%, because increases in tariffs
would be kept within reasonable limits and in spite of the fact that the
number of staff would remain constant during the period, as the present
overstaffing would be progressively absorbed by the development of
operations. The debt equity ratio would increase during the period from
12:88 to 33:67, because of a normal increase of the long term debt.  The
debt service coverage would decrease from 8.3 to 2.8, as the present low
indebtedness results from a policy of contribution to investment from the
Government which would not be necessary when Electrogaz's financial
position has improved. The current ratio would remain stable between 2.5
and 3 over the period.

CHAPTER VII
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT
Power Market
7.01       Since 1976 the demand for electrical energy has increased at an
average rate of about 10% annually.   It will be noted from Annex 4 that
much of this growth took place in the domestic sector, with a significant
increase of 39Z in 1979 upon completion of the 110 kV transmission line to
Kigali from the Ruzizi I generation station (para.  2.04).   A somewhat
slower growth (average annual 8%) has taken place in the commercial and
industrial sectors, primarily because of the hostilities which occurred
between Uganda and Tanzania in the 1978-79 period, and also due to the
reduction in demand from the mining sector during 1981 and 1982. Growth in
the public agencies, i.e., government, hospitals, schools, etc., as well as
Electrogaz's own needs has averaged 10% annually for the past 6 years.
7.02        Although some of the suppressed demand has been satisfied with
the completion of the 110 kV line from Ruzizi, much of the country remains
to -be  served,  as  only  about  2%  of  the  population  has  access  to
electricity.    Thus,  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the  generating  and
transmission facilities and the extension of new transmission lines to
serve the country more widely, the assumption based on studies for the
Ruzizi II project and on the BUINEP/EFPL findings (para. 2.12) that
electricity sales would grow at an annual rate 6f 8Z after the completion
of this project, appears to be reasonable (Annex 4).
Requirements for the Project
7.03        The supply of electrical power to consumers has been extremely
unreliable, and during the period January 1, 1983 to October 16, 1983 (date
of the appraisal mission) there were 113 unplanned power outages in the
system, with 27 complete shut-downs of the entire system.   Kigali was
particularly  affected  with  66  power  failures.    Most  of  these  power
interruptions occurred during the rainy seasons when severe lightning in
the frequent storms causes fluctuations in voltage, and because the
equipment is old or not properly serviced to correct these faults
automatically, the circuits must be reclosed manually, thus extending the
length of time without power.

Total              113



- 39 -
7.04        Following is a tabulation of the number of system interruptions
for various durations in minutes:
0-3     3-10     10-30      30-60     60-120      over 120      Total
29      33       23          7         11           10          113
7.05          From the foregoing it is evident that the total number of
outages of the system is far too great, even for a developing country, and,
in particular,   the number of failures that caused the shut-down of the
generating stations is not acceptable. Many of the complete shut-downs of
the 110 kV transmission lines originated at the 15 kV level and, due to
inadequate or insufficient protective equipment in the sub-stations,
were reflected through to the generating units.
7.06        In addition to the foregoing, the losses in the system due to
overloading of circuits, the lack of proper maintenance, and unmetered
demand are significant.   During the past three years, total losses as a
percent of energy generated was about 19%, with about 10% attributable to
the grid alone. Total Losses below about 12% with transmission grid losses
of about 5% to 8% would be considered acceptable for Rwanda.
Project Justification
7.07         (i) Ntaruka Generating Station.   The rehabilitation of the
Ntaruka powerhouse is estimated to have an attractive economic rate of
return.    If  the  existing  deficiencies  are  not  remedied  soon  total
replacement of most of the equipment within a few years would become
inevitable.   If it is assumed that the costs of such major replacements
would amount to roughly $500 per installed kW, or US$5.6 million (in 1984
prices) and the work would have to be undertaken by 1990, the economic rate
of return on the US$3.0 million rehabilitation expenditures proposed under
this project would be about 12%. This does not account for any losses from
increasingly unreliable operations during the intervening period.
7.08       (ii) Transmission System.  The economic benefits resulting from
the rehabilitation of the existing transmission network have been
conservatively estimated to yield an economic rate of return of more than
17%, based on the following main assumptions:
1982 Total outage time of major
systems component                                  98.3 hours
Total costs of rehabilitation                      US$11.5 million
Economic losses per kWh not supplied:
(a) Domestic sector (at average tariff)                US¢14.1
(b) Public sector (at 3 times average tariff)          US¢36.0
(c) Commercial/Industrial Sector (at 75% of
of lost value added)                              USt131.0



- 40 -
Total 1982 net economic losses from outages        US$1.135 million
Project life expectancy                              25 years
Annual growth in energy demand (existing system)    6%
Annual rate of increase in total outage duration
without the project                                 5%
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IRR)               17.3%
However, the IRR could be lower if the resulting levels were not reduced to
an absolute minimum. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the costs were up
by 10%, the IRR would go down to 15.5%; if the expected benefits were down
by 10%, the IRR would decrease to 15.8%, and if both costs were up by 10%
and benefits down by 10%, the IRR would be 14.2%.
7.09       The economic rate of return on a project is normally calculated
as the discount rate at which the present value of the capital and
operating costs of the project equals the present value of incremental
project benefits as measured by the value of energy production, computed
using the existing average tariff and the assumed load growth.   On this
project, however, the actual increase in sales (or reduction in losses)
which  would  arise  from  the  rehabilitation  of  the  powerhouse  and
transmission system, is difficult to estimate and an alternative
determination of the economic rate of return would be obtained by using not
only the rehabilitation costs but, instead, Electrogaz's total capital
works program for electricity (para. 6.03 and Annex 13, page 2). On this
basis the economic rate of return would be 10X.
7.10        The Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of power sales in 1984 is
estimated at RwF 10.6. This is equivalent to the present average tariff of
RwF 10.5. However, as mentioned in para. 6.04, with a tariff increase in
1986 sufficient to yield about a 4% rate of return on total revalued
assets, the tariff would be at the LRMC level.
7.11          (iii) New Transmission Lines.   Electrogaz has retained the
services of Fichtner (para. 3.02) to study the feasibility of extending
transmission lines into areas now not served by the grid (para. 3.10) (Map
17959), which were selected by the Government based on population density,
revenue from agricultural activities and existing private diesel generating
facilities.   In order to ensure that the projects are developed at the
least cost, technical design standards were established for such repetitive
items as poles, distance between poles, conductor size, insulation, etc.,
based on the degree of reliability expected for service of this type, and
on minimizing combined capital costs and operating losses (i.e. trade-off
between  line capacity  and transmission  losses).    The results  of the
computations based in general on the Bank's accepted methodology using the
capital cost of the project versus expected benefits, indicated that only 2
of the 9 projects studied (para. 3.10) warranted consideration as follows:
Economic Rate
No.            Name              Length    Voltage      of Return
3   Ntaruka - Cyanika            15 km     30 kV          10%
4   Gifurwe - Gakenke            24 km      15 kV         12%



- 41 -
7.12       Tae economic rate of return for lines 3 and 4 fall within IDA's
normal criteria of 10% return for projects, and have therefore been
included as a component of the project.
Risks
7.13         The physical risk associated with the project jould be small
because there would be little civil work, which frequently is the source of
significant cost increases.   The main risk would be institutional in
nature, as Electrogaz is a weak organization and may have difficulty in
administering the proposed project. However, this risk would be minimized
in  two ways:    (i)  competent  consultants  would  assist  Electrogaz  in
successfully completing the project; (ii) in parallel with a similar
component in the water project Credit 1345-RWA, the financing of four
specialists in management, engineering, and training by CCCE would
significantly   strengthen   Electrogaz's   ability   to   carry   out   the
implementation of the project.

(j)    Electrogaz  would  agree  to submit reports and records
necessary to monitor the progress of the project (para.
5.16);
(k)    Electrogaz's  average  electricity   tariffs  would  be

and cost reduction studies, as part of a financial
recovery plan (para. 6.04);
(1)    Electrogaz would generate annually from internal sources
funds equivalent to 25% of construction expenditures
averaged over the test, previous and next following years
(para. 6.04);
(m)    Electrogaz outstanding accounts for electricity, gas and
water would not exceed the equivalent of four months
billing at the end of 1984 and three months at the end of
1985 and thereafter (para. 6.05);
(n)    Electrogaz  would  issue  art inventory  and  procurement

investment other than the project in excess of the
equivalent of US$10 million without prior consultation
with the Association (para. 6.05); and
(r)    The Goverment would invest in Electrogaz in the form of
loans rather than contributions to capital (para. 6.05).
8.03        The conditions of effectiveness of the credit would be (a) the
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of Rwanda
and Electrogaz (para. 6.03); and (b) the fulfillment of all conditions
precedent to disbursement of cofinanciers' funds (para. 6.03).
8.04        With the above agreements, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of SDR 8.5 million (USM9 million).

Regional Organizations
Communaute economique des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL)
1.        The Communaute economique des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL), is an
organization which was established in September 1976 to revive the former
cooperation among the three couatries which existed under the  Belgian
administration prior to independence.   CEPGL was formed to promote free
movement of persons and goods within the area, and to cooperate politically
and economically within the region as it relates to other countries in
Africa. The entity is made up of a council of ministers, one from each of
the countries, which meets twice a year and reports to an annual meeting of
the presidents of the three courtries - the highest authority of the
organization.   The day-to-day activities including the preparation and
execution of programs and coordination within the administration of the
three countries is handled by a Secretariat located in Gisenyi, Rwanda.
CEPGL receives assistance from USAID, France, Belgium and FED for the
preparation of feasibility studies.   The Bank is carrying out a study of
CEPGL (to be completed in FY84) which would include a review of proposed
projects, the exploration of potential operations of the regional
development bank (BDEGL), the possibility of expanding trade among the
member countries, and the need for a regional transportation policy.
2.           CEPGL has sponsored a glass bottle manufacturing factory in
Burundi, and in June 1981, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
approved a loan of US$4.0 million and an equity investment of US$0.75
million for its construction. Another activity is exploring the potential
for the production of methane from the deep waters of Lake Kivu.   Several
issues need to be resolved before an investment program for gas development
can be defined; for example, the legal and institutional framework for gas
extraction by Rwanda and Zaire; the safety limitation and the establishment
of the rate at which the gas can be extracted; and the nature and the
extent  of  the  market  and  the  derivative  products.    The  potential
contribution of the development of gas to this area is still in the distant
future.
Energie des pays des grands lacs (EGL)
3.         EGL was set up to ensure the availability of electric power in
the region, and as a result has promoted the construction of the Ruzizi II
hydroelectric power project on the Ruzizi River downstream from the
existing Ruzizi generating station on the border between Zaire and Rwanda
(Map IBRD 17959).   This organization, located in Bujumbura, Burundi, is
staffed with three technical directors - one each seconded from REGIDESO,
Burundi; ELECTROGAZ, Rwanda, and SNEL, Zaire; together with a small support
staff.

Kagera Basin Organization (KBO)
4.         This organization has its headquarters in Kigali, Rwanda, and as
in the case of EGL, is made up of a small staff seconded from each
country. At the request of KBO, several reports have been prepared on the
development of the Kagera River - 1967, Lahmeyer International;  1976,
Norconsult and Electrowatt; 1979, Tractionel and Electrobel.
5.          Little action was taken on the final report until 1981 when,
during meetings held by KBO in Bujumbura in May, which were headed by the
Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania, a decision was made to proceed
with further study of the low-head i.e. a run-of-river scheme, at the
Rusumo Falls site on the Kagera River. However, a source of funds for the
study has not yet been found.  Because of its magnitude and cost, it is
likely that construction on this project may not begin until near the end
of the 1980s.  Nevertheless, Tanzania is interested in the development of
this project because, of the three countries, it has the least potential
for hydro generated power in this region.

Assumptions in Electrogaz's Financial Forecasts
for Electricity Operations
Sales
1.          Sales for the period 1983-1991 were calculated on the basis of
the mission's demand estimates, which were segregated into domestic, public
agencies' and commerce and industry's demand.  The resulting annual rates
of growth are 6% in 1984 and 8% from 1985 through 1991 (Annex 4).
Tariffs
2.         Average electricity tariffs expressed in 1984 prices have been
calculated to be equal to the long run marginal cost from 1986 onwards, so
as to provide sufficient funds for Electrogaz's estimated long term
investment needs.
Operating Expenses
3.         The price of imported electricity has been calculated by taking
into consideration price presently paid to S.N.EL. for the supply of
electricity from the Ruzizi I plant. Forecast prices were estimated on the
basis of calculations made in the Ruzizi II project SAR, to determine
economic prices for the Ruzizi I and Ruzizi II plants, and of Rwanda's
dependence on imported electricity from these two plants.
4.        As Electrogaz is presently overstaffed, it has been assumed that
the staff would remain at its present level for the duration of the
forecast period.
Depreciation
5.         The annual rate of depreciation of 3.7% used until 1983 is the
weighted average of the rates used by Electrogaz:
3.33% for the hydroelectric plants and for office buildings
4% for heavy equipment
6.67% for distribution network, meters, furniture
10% for office and laboratory equipment and tools
20% for vehicles
Following Fichtner's revaluation study, a rate of 3.5% has been used from
1984 on.

Construction expenditures
6.              Construction expenditures  for  the rehabilitation of  the
hydroelectric plant and the transmission and distribution network are as
estimated by the consultant in his feasibility report.
Financing of the Project
7.         Terms of borrowing of the onlent IDA credit are assumed to be a
repayment period of twenty years including a five-year grace period and a
10.5% rate of interest. Terms of borrowing of the CCCE loan are assumed to
be a repayment period of fifteen years including a five-year grace period
and a 5% rate of interest.
Revaluation of assets
8.         Assets are revalued with the international inflation indices and
incorporate Fichtner's new evaluation for the 1983 assets.
Internally generated funds ratio
9.        It is the ratio of the amount of generated funds from operations,
plus consumer's contributions, minus debt service and non-cash variation of
working capital for a financial year, to the three-year average of
construction expenditures for the current year, the previous and the
following years.
