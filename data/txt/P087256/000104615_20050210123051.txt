1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
Tanzania is one of the poorest countries of the world. Per capita income is estimated at about $290 per 
year. Covering an area of 945,000 square kilometers, it has a population of about 35 million growing at 
about 2.4 percent a year. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture (primarily, coffee, cotton, 
tea, cashew nuts, sisal, maize, rice, wheat, cassava, and tobacco), which accounts for about 50 percent of 
GDP, provides 85 percent of exports, and is by far the largest employer.  Industry accounts for some 15 
percent of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light consumer goods. The 
mining sector has been growing rapidly in recent years and Tanzania is now one of the major exporters 
of gold in Africa. Tourism is one of Tanzania's dynamic sectors and has shown significant growth in 
recent years. The service sector and the informal sector are an increasingly important source of 
employment.  
 
Tanzania’s economic performance has remained solid with real GDP growth of 5.6 percent in 2003 and 
inflation of 4.0 percent in September 2004. The slight decrease in real GDP growth to 5.6 percent in 
2003 from 6.2 percent in 2002 was due to a drought which affected the agriculture sector which 
registered 4.0 percent growth in 2003 as compared to 5.5 percent registered a year earlier. Real GDP is 
projected to grow by 6.3 percent in 2004 owing to good performance of the agriculture, construction and 
mining sectors. The overall fiscal deficit after grants increased to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2003 from 1.6 
percent in 2002 due to increased finance of drought related expenditures. In 2004, the overall deficit 
after grants is projected to be 2.9 percent. 
 
Although Tanzania experienced economic difficulties and worsening poverty in the early 1990s the 
benefits of the more recent growth have reversed the trend. During the past decade, food poverty has 
declined from 21.6 percent to 18.7 percent while basic needs poverty is from 38.6 percent to 35.7 
percent.   
 
Tanzania has embarked on comprehensive structural reforms to improve economic governance, enhance 
public service delivery, and create an enabling environment for private sector activities.  Reforms in the 
area of public financial management include the implementation of an integrated financial management 
system, the adoption of an inclusive Public Expenditure Review/Medium Term Expenditure Framework 
process, and the revision of the public finance management and the public procurement acts.  The first 
Page  2
phase of Civil Service Reform involving downsizing of the civil service and bringing the wage bill 
under control has been completed.  Reforms are now entering their second phase and will increasingly 
focus on public sector performance. A Local Government Reform Program aims at strengthening 
capacities of the local authorities which bear the primary responsibility for basic service delivery in 
priority sectors such as basic education, primary health, water, and rural roads.  A national action plan 
for the control of corruption as well as sector specific anti-corruption plans are being implemented.   
 
Government has shown a strong commitment to withdraw from commercial activities and to define its 
role as an enabler of private sector activities.  Key achievements in this area include the privatization of 
a
large number of parastatals.  This includes the privatization of the fixed net telephone operator with a 
parallel liberalization of the wireless telephone market, which resulted in a rapid increase in the number 
of subscribers.  Similarly, government has disinvested its interests in and liberalized the banking sector, 
which has experienced a sharp increase in the number of private sector banks to 23 now operating in the 
country.   
 
A
key government strategy is to improve the investment climate in order to stimulate a more rapid 
expansion of local and foreign private investment.  A notable success in this area is the setup of a policy 
framework for mining activities in the mid 1990s, which has since experienced two-digit growth rates.  
Other important measures include the revision of legislation, including the company law, and the 
liberalization of capital markets.   
 
Tanzania developed through a broad-based participation process including the poor, civil society, 
NGOs, and various other stakeholders a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) in 2000 and progress 
reports in 2001 and 2003.  The poverty reduction strategy (PRS) focuses on three main areas of 
outcomes and actions for realizing them. The first is 
reduction in the breadth and depth of income 
poverty.
 The outcome targets include reduction of basic needs poverty and food poverty with a 
particular focus on rural areas, where poverty is most prevalent. The second area is that of 
improving 
the quality of life and social-well being
.
More specifically this entails improving human capabilities, 
enhanced longevity of survival, social well being (social inclusion and personal security), improved 
nutrition and containing extreme vulnerability (mainly through safety nets). The third broad area is 
sustained conducive development environment.
 The environment encompasses macroeconomic 
stability and good governance. The PRSP has also become an important instrument for coordination 
within government to ensure coherence of the various sectoral and cross sectoral reform efforts in 
support of poverty reduction.  
 
2. Proposed objective(s) 
The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) will su
pport the implementation of Tanzania’s PRS.  The 
financial support provided through the PRSC will close the gap between the cost of implementing key 
elements of the PRS and resources available from government’s own domestic revenue and other donor 
support.  A policy dialogue and performance assessment framework under the PRSC will focus on the 
following cross-cutting and institutional actions which will facilitate progress towards the PRS 
objectives. 
 
(i) Sustaining and accelerating economic growth and broadening its impact
:
Reducing income 
poverty is one of they key focus areas of the PRS.  Private sector and rural development are the two 
areas where reforms are expected to have the biggest impact on reducing income poverty in Tanzania.  
Reforms in the areas of agricultural and rural development are intended to raise agricultural productivity 
and thus enhance the incomes of the population in rural areas, were poverty is most widespread and 
most deeply entrenched.  Measures include enhancement of the profitability of agriculture broadly and 
export products of rural origin in particular, through better quality higher productivity, reduced 
Page  3
marketing cost and improved access to markets and to credit; removal of institutional constraints 
remaining on rural activities; and correcting the incentives provided by the overall tax regime.  With 
respect to private sector development, the focus will be on strengthening of the business environment, in 
particular for SMEs, and legal and administrative reforms to enhance the functioning of land, credit, and 
labor markets.   
 
(ii) Support results orientation of public service delivery: 
The second area of impact is through 
monitoring and leveraging progress in the implementation of sectoral programs to reduce poverty, 
covering the priority sectors identified in the PRS, i.e., primary education, basic health, water, rural 
roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS.  The PRSC policy dialogue 
focuses on the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that allows an assessment of 
the impact and results of sectoral programs.  The information derived from the monitoring and 
evaluation system will then feed into the assessment of progress towards the PRS objective, on which 
future PRSC support will be contingent.  Finally, the resources provided through the PRSC complement 
government and other donor resources in financing priority programs for poverty reduction.  The well 
developed participatory PER-MTEF process provides a mechanism for the monitoring of the use of 
resources. 
 
(iii) Enhance public sector performance:  
Measures in this area will have a direct impact on poverty 
reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty reduction programs in the priority 
sectors and generate additional funds for poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form of low 
allocative or operational efficiency of public expenditures.  Key areas of reform include strengthening of 
financial management through the implementation of the public financial management reform program, 
strengthening of the national audit office, implementation of pay reform coupled with improved 
performance management in the public sector, procurement reform, the implementation of anti-
corruption strategies, and enhanced efficiency in the use of development assistance.
 
(iv) Strengthen environmental management:
 Finally, the PRSC also supports government’s efforts to 
enhance environmental sustainability of Tanzania’s development program.  The PRS identifies this as an 
important element of efforts to improve the quality of life and social well-being.   
 
3. Preliminary description 
The reform agenda that will be supported and monitored by PRSC-3 covers key reforms identified in the 
PRS.  The PRSC supports government efforts to reduce poverty in four areas.  Firstly, it supports 
measures that are expected to contribute directly to the reduction of income poverty.  This includes 
reforms in agricultural and rural development which are intended to raise agricultural productivity and 
thus enhance the incomes of the population in rural areas, where poverty is most widespread and most 
deeply entrenched. It also includes reforms related to private sector development and strengthening of 
the business environment, as well as legal and administrative reforms to enhance the functioning of land, 
credit, and labor markets.  These are intended to foster economic growth and enhance employment 
opportunities as access to formal and informal sector employment has been identified as one of the key 
areas for sustainable poverty reduction in the PRS.   
Secondly, the PRSC monitors and leverages progress in the implementation of sectoral programs to 
reduce poverty, covering the priority sectors identified in the PRS, i.e., primary education, basic health, 
water, rural roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS.  The PRSC policy 
dialogue focuses on the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that allows an 
assessment of the impact and results of sectoral programs.  The information derived from the monitoring 
and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment of progress towards the PRS objectives, on 
which future PRSC support will be contingent.  Finally, the resources provided through the PRSC-3 
Page  4
complement government and other donor resources in financing priority programs for poverty reduction.  
The well developed participatory PER-MTEF process provides a mechanism for monitoring and 
dialogue with the authorities on the use of budgetary resources.  
The third area includes cross-sectoral actions to strengthen public sector performance and enhance the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources.  These measures will have a direct impact on 
poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty reduction programs in 
the priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form 
of low allocative or operational efficiency of public expenditures.  Key areas of reform include 
strengthening of financial management through the implementation of the public financial management 
reform program, strengthening of the national audit office, pay reform coupled with improved 
performance management in the public sector, procurement reform, the implementation of anti-
corruption strategies, and enhancing efficiency in the use of development assistance. 
Finally, the PRSC also supports government’s efforts to enhance environmental sustainability of 
Tanzania’s development program.  The PRS identifies this as an important element of efforts to improve 
the quality of life and social well-being.   
 
4. Environment Aspects 
PRSC-3 falls under OP 8.60 and is no longer subject to environmental safeguards.  As the PRSC focuses 
primarily on institutional reforms, there are no direct significant effects on Tanzania’s environment, 
forests, and other natural resources.  In addition, the PRSC supports reforms of Tanzania’s legal and 
institutional framework for environmental management, environmental impact assessments, and 
strategic environmental assessments (SEAs).  An SEA has been prepared under PRSC-2.  Reviews of 
the environmental impact of PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 included (i) a review of supported sectors within the 
SECAC, (ii) consideration of potential policy reforms under the SECAC; and (iii) an assessment of the 
ability of the government to address any impacts within these sectors using existing mechanisms, or 
using mechanisms developed internally within this particular SECAC. The assessments concluded that: 
(i) the policy reforms supported under the PRSC-1 and 2 would have no deleterious environmental 
impact, or their impacts could be addressed within the existing SEA processes that have been developed 
under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 and will continue to be developed under PRSC3; (ii) sectoral activities to be 
supported generally under the roads and agriculture initiatives may involve some Category “B” 
activities, but guidelines developed under PRSC-1 and 2 for addressing these are being adequately 
implemented by Government, and will continue to be monitored and developed to improve their 
effectiveness in PRSC-3.  
In an effort to mainstream the environmental sustainability dimension into the PRSC process the Bank 
has undertaken various analyses with the objective to identify linkages between key macro and structural 
reforms policies and the environment. This analysis, undertaken under PRSC-1 and 2, identifies 
measures at both national and local government levels to reduce poverty and enhance environmental 
sustainability of policy reforms. The analysis concluded that environment and poverty are linked in three 
major ways: (a) poverty reduction programs should not damage the resource base and the environment 
of which poor depend for their livelihoods (b) improving environmental conditions can help to reduce 
poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor growth; and (c) mitigating measures may be necessary as part 
of policy dialogue. 
Working with the government and other development partners, the analysis identified a number strategic 
entry points for mainstreaming key issues of the poverty-environment nexus in Tanzania into PRSC 
process and ongoing policy reforms in general. This included 
inter alia
.
further support for EA 
activities, a comprehensive environmental review of all taxes and levies associated with the agricultural 
Page  5
sector, and increased attention to removing land tenure uncertainties. Specifically, the Vice President’s 
Office and the National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) have been supporting the 
development  and implementation of various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially in roads and 
agriculture), and have more recently pursued procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental 
assessment to permit mitigation of any adverse environmental impacts while taking advantage of 
potential synergies between poverty reduction and environmental protection efforts. In this regard the 
PRSC2 and PRSC3 reform agenda has specific actions to be implemented by the Government of 
Tanzania as part of the environmental component.
