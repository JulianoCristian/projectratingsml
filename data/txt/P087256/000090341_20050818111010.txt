Description         The Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-3) will support the
                    implementation o f Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Poverty
                    Reduction (MKUKUTA). The financial support provided through the
                    PRSC-3 will narrow the gap between the cost o f implementing key elements
                    o f the MKUKUTA and resources available from government's own
                    domestic revenue and other donor support. The policy dialogue and
                    performance assessment framework under the PRSC-3 focuses on the
                    following cross-cutting and institutional actions which will facilitate
                    progress towards the PRS objectives:
                    (i)Sustain and accelerate economic growth and broaden its impact:
                    Reducing income poverty is one o f the key focus areas o f the MKUKUTA.
                    Private sector and rural development are the two areas where reforms are
                    expected to have the biggest impact on reducing income poverty in
                    Tanzania. Reforms in the areas o f agricultural and rural development are
                    intended to improve producer incentives and raise agricultural profitability
                    and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty i s most widespread
                    and most deeply entrenched. Measures include improving export crop
                    quality, reducing marketing cost and the tax burden on farmers and
                    improving access to markets and finance. With respect to private sector
                    development, the focus will be on strengthening o f the business
                    environment, in particular for SMEs, and legal and administrative reforms to
                    enhance the functioning o f land, credit, and labor markets.
                    (ii)Support results orientationof public service delivery: The second
                    area o f impact is through monitoring and leveraging progress in the
                    implementation o f sectoral programs to reduce poverty, covering the priority
                    sectors identified in the first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), i.e., primary
                    education, basic health, water, rural roads, agricultural research and
                    extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. The PRSC-3 policy dialogue
                    focuses on the establishment o f a robust monitoring and evaluation system
                    that allows an assessment o f the impact and results o f sectoral programs.
                    The information derived from the monitoring and evaluation system will

                                           i

                    then feed into the assessment o f progress towards the MKUKUTA
                    objectives. Finally, the resources provided through the PRSC-3 complement
                    government and other donor resources in financing priority programs for
                    poverty reduction. The well developed participatory Public Expenditure
                    Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (PER-MTEF) process
                    provides a mechanism for the monitoring o f the use o f resources.
                    (iii)Enhancepublicsectorperformance: Measures inthisareawillhave
                    a direct impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity
                    to implement poverty reduction programs inthe priority sectors and generate
                    additional funds for poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form o f
                    low allocative or operational efficiency o f public expenditures. Key areas o f
                    reform include strengthening o f financial management through the
                    implementation o f the public financial management reform program,
                    strengthening o f the national audit office, implementation o f pay reform
                    coupled with improved performance management in the public sector,
                    procurement reform, the implementation o f anti-corruption strategies, and
                    enhanced efficiency inthe use o f development assistance.
                    (iv) Strengthen environmental management: Finally, the PRSC-3 also
                    supports government's efforts to enhance the environmental sustainability of
                    Tanzania's development program. The MKUKUTA identifies this as an
                    important element o f efforts to improve the quality o f life and social well-
                    being.
Benefits            The proposed PRSC-3 will help the United Republic o f Tanzania to
                    implement the MKUKUTA and reach the growth and poverty reduction
                    goals set out in the strategy. The reforms supported by the operation will
                    help to raise growth, make progress towards achieving the Millennium
                    Development Goals and strengthen the institutional infrastructure needed tc
                    improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively, as
                    envisioned in the MKUKUTA. Improved delivery o f public services i s
                    essential if the United Republic o f Tanzania i s to reach its goals for poverQ
                    reduction and improve the quality o f life inTanzania.
Risks               (i) Reforms supported by the credit might encounter resistance from vestec
                    interests. Government has inthe past shown determination to overcome sucf
                    special interests.    (ii)Government efforts to build broad consensus foi
                    reforms through consultative processes sometimes tend to slow down the
                    pace o f reforms. However, the benefits o f this approach clearly outweigh tht
                    risk; (iii)As the utilization of PRSC-3 funds is determined by the budge
                    process, there i s a risk that resource allocation and use i s not fully consisten
                    with the MKUKUTA. However, government has adopted an open anc
                    participative budget process including an annual PER process which helps
                    to align and monitor resource allocation and its consistency with the
                    MKUKUTA. (iv) The CFAA and the CPAR identified significant fiduciary
                    risk, but recent assessments such as the joint HIPC Assessment and Action
                    Plan show significant improvements in this area in recent years and put
                    Tanzania among the best performers in Africa. (v) Capacity for program
                    implementation and service delivery at both the central and district level is
                    weak, however, inkey areas programs are in place to strengthen capacity.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document proposes a third poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-3) for
Tanzania inthe amount of US$ 150 million.

2.       PRSC-1 laid out a three year policy reform framework which would be supported by a series
of three PRSCs. Based on satisfactory implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and
agreed actions, the first PRSC for Tanzania, in the amount of US$ 132 million (US$ 100 million
credit and US$ 32 million grant), was approved by the Bank's Board on May 29, 2003. PRSC-2, in
the amount of US$ 150 million (US $ 60 million credit and US$ 90 million grant), was approved by
the Board on July 29,2004.

3.       The Bank's PRSC support is provided in the context of the multi-donor, Poverty Reduction
Budget Support (PRBS) program. This program consists o f a common performance assessment
framework (PAF), which defines the areas of budget support dialogue and details the monitorable
actions against which participating donors assess progress in program implementation as the basis for
their financing decisions, and ajoint review process, which is intendedto reduce transaction cost and
to ensure consistency in policy dialogue. A Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM) outlines the
principles behind budget support in Tanzania, the responsibilities of government and development
partners, and an annual schedule o f reviews. At present, 14 donors, including the Bank, provide
general budget support through the PRBS program.

4.       The PRBS program for Tanzania:

    e    I s grounded in Tanzania's first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and consistent with
         Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty (MKUKUTA), which
         starting in2005/06 will replace the PRS.
    e    Focuses on cross cutting issues including (a) private sector and rural development, (b) macro-
         economic stability, (c) poverty monitoring systems, (d) public financial management, (e)
         public sector management, (f) governance, and (g) environmental management;
    e    Buildson national processesinthe areas covered;
    e    I s results-focused, primarilythrough supporting and drawing on national monitoring systems;
    e    Contributes to donor harmonization through the use of a common Performance Assessment
         Framework (PAF) andjoint review process, developed and agreed by 14 donors inTanzania;
    e    Provides general budget support in parallel to existing sector development programs for
         education, health, water, and roads, with a gradual shift away from sectoral and towards
         general budget support over time; and
    e    I s supported by technical assistance provided through existing project support.

5.       As the last operation in the first three year PRSC program, PRSC-3 will continue to support
the reforms targeted by the previous two PRSCs. The preparation o f a new multi-year PRBS program
is underway and expected to become operational starting with PRSC-4. In order to ensure continuity


                                                    1

 and predictability of financing in the transition between the current and the new program, triggers for
PRSC-4 have been tentatively identified under the current program and will be reviewed once the new
program is inplace.

 6.       The transition to a new PRJ3S program coincides with a number o f other important transitions
that are expected to take place in 2005. Firstly, there i s the adoption o f a new PRSP (National
 Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty - which to emphasize national ownership is commonly
referred to by its Kiswahili acronym as MKUKUTA) which was approved by the Government in
February 2005 and the implementation o f which will start with the FY06 budget.' Building on the
new MKUKUTA, the Government is leading the development o f a Joint Assistance Strategy (TJAS)
which will provide the framework for donor assistance to the MKUKUTA. At the political level,
presidential elections are scheduled for October 2005. President Mkapa is currently completing his
 second term and, consistent with Tanzania's Constitution, will not stand for re-election.


                                 11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INTANZANIA
7.        Tanzania has established a solid track record o f macro-economic stability for almost a decade
and pursued an ambitious program o f structural reform, which resulted in an acceleration o f economic
growth which averaged 5.8 percent duringthe past five years.

 8.       Tanzania's economic performance remained solid. As stated in the MKUKUTA, Tanzania's
economic reform agenda continues to focus on higher growth and poverty reduction. The government
remains committed to developing a liberalized private sector-led economy. Real GDP (at factor cost)
 i s estimated to have grown by 6.7 percent in 2004 while inflation i s estimated to have dropped further
to 4.1 percent. The increase in real GDP growth to 6.7 percent in2004 from 5.6 percent in2003 i s due
higher growth in agriculture and trade sectors o f 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent respectively in 2004 as
compared to 4.0 percent and 6.5 percent in2003.

9.        Public expenditure was 22 percent o f GDP in 2003104 and i s estimated to have increased to
25 percent o f GDP in 2004/05. This increase in expenditure was financed through a combination o f
 increased domestic revenue and higher aid inflows, and higher net domestic financing. Domestic
revenue increased from 12.7 percent o f GDP in 2003104 to 13.6 percent in 2004/05. The overall
deficit after grants increased to 3.2 percent in 2003104 to 4.8 percent in 2004/05. Most o f the deficit
after grants was financed through net concessional borrowing, but net domestic financing increasedto
0.6 percent, while inthe previousyear net domestic financing was negative at 0.4 percent o f GDP.

  10.     Box 1 provides an overview o f the status o f key structural reforms in Tanzania. The fifth
Investors Round Table took place in May 2005, continuing the joint government private sector
process o f identifying problems and finding solutions. Formal consultations between the government
and the private sector continue to take place within the Tanzania National Business Council
framework.

 Box 1. Overview of Structural Reforms in Tanzania
I
 Financial Sector. During the past decade, the fmancial sector has seen significant improvement. From being the
 sole preserve o f state-owned financial institutions, it has gone through a process o f privatization and been opened
 up to new entrants. These reforms have already shown some results inthe form ofnarrowed interest spreads and
 a fairly rapid increase in credit to the private sector. Aside from the unfinished privatization agenda, the main
 challenges for the sector include mher reduction in interest spreads and enhanced access to credit by the private
 sector, especially inrural areas. The recent establishment o f a credit rating agency i s a further step inenhancing
 the efficiency of financial intermediation in Tanzania. Access to credit by SMEs and the rural sector remains
 limited.

 Parastatal Sector. Tanzania has been aggressively implementing its privatization agenda. The privatization o f
 manufacturing and commercial parastatals was virtually complete by 2000 and a solid success. Inthe fmancial
 sector, the largest commercial bank has been successfully privatized. Privatization o f the National Microfinance
 Bank is at an advanced stage and the privatization process of the National Insurance Corporation is also
 progressing. The reform and privatization o f infrastructure utilities proved much more difficult. The President
 of Tanzania has appointed a Privatization Review Commission to review progress in the privatization o f
 infrastructure utilities.

 Trade Policies and Institutions. Reforms o f trade policies have taken mainly place inthe context of regional
 agreements, including SADC and EAC. Tanzania adopted the Common Extemal Tariff (CET) o f the East
 African Community (EAC) in January 2005, lowering its average tariff from 13.8 to 12.3 percent, but further
 raised the dispersion o f protection. The lowering o f the maximum tariff o f the CET from the current 25 percent
 to 20 percent, as expected to happen in 5 years in accordance with the Customs Union Protocol, should help
 correct some o f the dispersion o f protection. On the export side, the main issue pertains to export taxes.
 International experience has shown that export taxes and bans have generally failed to achieve industrial
 development objectives, led to informal trade, and frequently hurt small-holders who receive lower prices as a
 result.

 Factor Markets (Labor and Land). Revisions o f land and labor legislation have been completed, with most of
 the emphasis on the reform of institutions. The main challenge is now to implementthis new legislation, which
 inthe caseoflandreforms is expectedto bealengthyandcostlyprocess.
 Infrastructure (Power Sector and Transport). The establishment o f the executive agency TANROADS with
 responsibility for the trunk and regional road network has been a major step forward for the transport sector.
 However, some responsibilities in the roads sector have not yet been clearly defined and this hampers effective
 road maintenance and development activities.           The current formulation of a new Road Act provides an
 opportunity to clarify these issues and provide the basis for accelerated transport development.
 Detailed work on the restructuring o f the power sector has been carried out but the implementation o f the
 restructuring has been delayed, partly as a consequence o f developments inthe international energy market. The
 financial performance o f TANESCO (Tanzania Electricity Supply Company) has significantly improved under a
 performance based management contract. Nonetheless, reform o f the policy and institutional framework for the
 power sector is essential to ensure the effectiveness o f k t u r e investments inthe sector.

 Public Institutions Interfacing with the Private Sector.               From the mid 1990s, the government started
 reviewing regulations, focusing on removing obstacles and re-organizing the most important tasks o f government,
 Inpractical terms this means (1) harmonization of local government taxation to remove excessive tax burdenon
 private enterprise; (2) streamlining o f work permitprocedures; (3) review and amendment o f licensing legislation
 to reduce the cost o f business establishment and continuation; (4) review and revision o f export-imporl
 procedures to reduce time costs and corruption-related costs; and (5) design and implementation o f a program foi
 enhancing access to commercial courts by SMEs. Tanzania has reformed the legal framework for regulatorq
 institutions which are currently being established. The effectiveness o f these regulatory institutions, especial11
 given the current oversight arrangements, needs to be closely monitored.

11,       Governance. Tanzania's reform program has continued to aim at improving Tanzania's
governance system. The broad range of structural reforms undertaken in the 1990s, including
liberalization of the economy and privatization, has significantly reduced the scope of rent seeking
opportunities. More recent reforms, supported by the PRSC, aim at improving financial management
and accountability, including through the implementation of the public finance management reform
program and the procurement reforms. Finally, government also targets corruption directly through
theNational Anti-corruption Strategy at the nationaland district level.

12.       The governance indicators compiled by Kaufmann et ala2(Figure 1) suggest improvements on
most dimensions of governance in Tanzania between 1996 and 2004. Tanzania's performance i s also
significantly better than that o f other low income countries (Figure 2) on all dimensions of
governance. The most dramatic improvement seems to have occurred with respect to "control of
corruption," where Tanzania has moved from being among the poorest performers to being close to
the international average.           The main area of concern is "regulatory quality" where Tanzania's
performance seems to have deteriorated continuously since 1998. Tanzania has put in place a new
regulatory framework and is currently making a series o f regulatory agencies operational, with the
decline in regulatory quality likely due to several reasons: First, with the liberalization of the

economy and the private sector participation in most utilities, including water, telecommunications,
and transport, the quality o f regulation has gained in importance and is subject to increased scrutiny
by observers and expectations are higher. Second, there have been delays in the implementation of
the new regulatory framework, and finally, concerns about the appropriateness of oversight
arrangements o f these new regulatory agencies. The governance indicators would suggest that this is
a key area for enhanced government attention. A recent World Bank review o f the performance of
regulatory agencies as well as financial support is designedto enhance the regulatory environment.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.     Economic reforms undertaken duringthe past decade provide a strong basis for continued
economic growth and there is a strong commitment by the authorities to sustaining macro-
economic stability. Tanzania's MKUKUTA targets growth rates of 6-8 percent and policy based
projections undertaken for the forthcoming CEM suggest that such growth rates are ambitious but
indeedachievable. These growth rateswould also be consistent with halfingpoverty by 2015.

14.     Inaddition to preserving and deepeningreform achievements inthe areas ofprudent fiscal
and monetary policy, liberalized markets, an open economy, and a clearer definition of the role of
the private and the pubic sector, achieving sustained high growth will also require a scaling up of
investment in infrastructure and enhanced access to capital by the private sector. In the medium
term, raising the number of Tanzanians with post-primary education, strengthening incentives for
innovation and adoption of new technologies, improving the institutions for steering Tanzania's
growth agenda, and continued progress in fighting corruption will be essential for sustained high
growth.

15.     Outlookfor 2005        -2007. Tanzania's economy projectedto grow by6.9-7.5
                                                             i s                                   percent
over the medium term. In support of this target, investment i s expected to grow by 1.6 percent of
GDP in response to ongoing reforms o f the business environment and the financial sector, as well
as sustained macroeconomic stability. The agriculture sector is projected to grow by 5.2-6.0
percent over the medium term.        The government's strategy to facilitate agricultural growth
includes (i)the reform of crop boards; (ii)   the reform of local government taxation; and (iii)       the
improvement in rural infrastructure. Inflation is expected to stay at 4.0 percent over the medium
term period. The revenue effort is also expected to increase from 13.6 to 16.2 percent over the
mediumterm period due to improved tax administration, expanded tax base, rationalization of tax
laws and regulations, and sustained macroeconomic stability. Export earnings are expected to
increase from US$ 1.5 billion to US$ 2.2 billion over the medium term due to increased export o f
non-traditional commodities and gold. Imports are also expected to increase from US$ 2.6 billion
to US$ 3.7 billion over the mediumterm.

16.     Debt sustainability..' After receiving HIPC debt relief in 2001, Tanzania's NPV of debt-
to-export ratio had declinedto about 130. The most recent debt sustainability analysis prepared by
Fund and Bank staff shows that this debt indicator has fallen to 118 in 2004 and i s expected to
continue this decline, reaching 87 by 2024          However, this favorable development of debt
indicators depends critically on sustained economic growth and enhanced export performance.
Tanzania's external debt position is thus considered to be sustainable, with moderate risk.

17,     In addition, progress in securing debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors is critical to
ensure the continued sustainability of Tanzania's debt. Negotiations have been concluded with 5
creditors (Kuwait, India, Bulgaria, China and Slovak and Czech Republics). Negotiations are
underway with four creditors (Hungary, Iran, Libya, and UAE) and negotiations are pendingwith
seven other non-Paris Club creditors.

PROGRESSTOWARDS THE MILLENNIUMDEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS)
18.     It will be challenging for Tanzania to meet all MDGs, yet there is room for cautious
optimism for the achievement o f at least some of them. Preliminary results from the 2004


 The formalization and implementation o fthe G-8 Gleneagles debt cancellation will also directly impact
Tanzania's debt sustainability.


                                                   6

Demographic and Health Survey suggest that considerable progress was made in the reduction o f
malnutrition and child mortality. And policy simulations show that the income poverty and hunger
MDGs may be attainable if Tanzania is able to continue with its episode o f medium highgrowth
and with its improvements inthe social sectors.

   Maternalmortality is a so called low frequency event. Low frequency events are difficult to measure
accuratelyin surveys likethe DHSwhich serve as source for these estimates, as few cases ofmaternal
mortality are registered.Consequentlymatemal mortalityrates are associatedwith large confidence intervals
and the observedmatemal mortality rates of 529 in 1996 and 578 in2004 are statistically not different.

19.      With respect to the eradicationo f extreme poverty and hunger, the latest household survey
carried out in 2000/01 shows that, using the national poverty line, income poverty has declined
from 38.6 percent in 1991 to 35.6 percent in 2000/01. Ifthe international dollar a day poverty line
i s used, income poverty declined from 61.1 percent to 57.5 percent. Halving poverty by 2015
would thus require poverty to decline to 19.3 and 30.6 percent respectively. With the limited
progress made during the 1990s (Table 2) this appears unattainable, but the data obscure that the
early 1990s were characterized by a recession. The period o f positive growth only materialized
from 1995 onward so that by the end o f the 1990s most of the damage from the earlier period was
undone, The period o f high growth since 2000/01 i s not captured in the survey data. Yet poverty
simulations, presented in Figure 3, suggest that the income poverty MDG i s attainable. Much will
depend on rural income growth as most poor are found inrural areas.

20.      After a decade o f stagnation in which the fraction o f underweight children remained at 29
percent, it declined to 22 percent between 1999 and 2004, so that Tanzania i s on track with respect
to attaining the hunger MDG. Income growth can explain at most a third o f the decline.


                                                     7

Malnutrition appears more responsive to changes in non-income factors such as more effective
management o f malaria and vitamin A supplementation. Policy simulations (Figure 3) suggest that
ifincome growth and especially improvements innutritionrelatedinterventions can be sustained,
the hunger MDGmay be attained by 2015.

21.      Progress towards attaining the MDG on universal primary education has been impressive.
As soon as universal primary education was introduced in 2001, net enrollment ratesjumped and
are now close (91 percent) to the target of 100 percent enrollment.

22.      Close to complete enrollment also implies gender equality in education. In primary
education such inequalities are small (Table 2), but in secondary education gender inequalities
persist. These inequalities may be on the way out: in 2004 the girl-boy ratio in Form Iwas 0.98
while it was 0.55 in Form IV. Whether this is the case requires further monitoring. Other non-
MDG indicators such as the womedmen prevalence of HIV/AIDS (of 1.22) show that gender
inequality persists.

23.     Another encouraging fact is the observed reduction in child mortality from 141per 1000 in
1991 to 112 in 2004. This drop occurs after stagnancy in child mortality rates duringthe 1990s (it
was 137 in 1996 and 147 in 1999) and appears to be a reflection o f improved malaria management
(improved treatment as well as increased use of bed nets) and stronger health systems in general.
The MDG target of 47 deaths per 1000 is ambitious however, and it will remain a challenge to
meetthis objective.

24.      With respect to the reduction of maternal mortality no progress has been made. The data in
Table 2 even suggest an increase in maternal mortality rates but the difference is not statistically
significant. The lack of progress is reason for concern as the MDG is ambitious (a 75 percent
reduction) and maternalmortality rates high (578 per 100,000 births).

25.      A recent blood sample survey suggests that the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS is 7 percent
which is less than was expected based on tests performed on blood donors. There is much
variation in infection rates by age group, gender and location. Women (7.7 percent) are more
affected than men (6.3 percent). Prevalence is 5.2 percent in the 20-24 age cohort but more than
double that 10.9 percent on the 30-44 age cohort. Prevalence rates vary from a low of 2.0 percent
inManyaraand Kigomato ahigh of 13.5 percent inMbeyaandIringa.

26.      Finally some limited progress was made in improving access to drinking water mainly due
to increasedaccess to protected wells and springs. Still some 54 percent o f all rural households do
not have access to improved drinking water and much needs to be done to attain the MDG
objective of 33 percent. As far as sanitation is concerned almost all urban (96 percent) and rural
(92 percent) households have access to a toilet. In urban areas, one observes an increase in the
fraction of households without a toilet from 2 percent on 1991 to 4 percent in 2000, possibly as a
resultfrom rapid urbanization.

                               111. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

          27.     Tanzania's first PRSP was prepared in 2000 and three annual progress reports documented
          progress in its implementation. A new National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty
          (commonly referred to by its Kiswahili acronym, MKUKUTA) for the period 2005/06 - 2009/10
          was approved in February 2005. The MKUKUTA provides the overall framework for Tanzania's
          policies for growth and poverty reduction, with the budget and the MTEF as the main instrument
          for its operationalization and implementation. The review o f the poverty monitoring system and
          the preparation of an implementationplanare currently underway. The MKUKUTA maintains the
          three areas of focus o f the first PRSP, namely:
          9 Cluster 1:Growthandreductionofincome poverty;
          9 Cluster 2: Improvementofquality oflifeand social wellbeing;and
          9 Cluster 3:Governance andAccountability.

          28.     There is now clearly a stronger emphasis on economic growth with greater attention to
          stimulating the private sector response, infrastructure, human resource development, and building
          a competitive economy and an efficient government. The target growth rate i s 6-8 percent per
          annum for the period 2005-2010. In addition, the strategy adopts an outcome-based approach in
          contrast to the priority sector spending approach under the first PRSP. The "outcomes-approach"
          counts on the contribution of all sectors towards growth and poverty reduction and stresses cross
          sector collaboration and inter-sector linkages and synergies.

          29.     The adoption of the PRSP approach has changed policy making in Tanzania in significant
          ways. Firstly, poverty reduction has become the central policy objective in Tanzania. The budget
          process as well as sectoral initiatives have been re-oriented to ensure their contribution to overall
          poverty reduction objectives.       Secondly, policy making has become more participatory, both


                                                            9

through the participatory process for the formulation of the PRSP, but equally important also at the
level of sectoral policy formulation. Finally, and possibly among the most important changes that
took place since the introduction of PRSl is the greater focus on poverty monitoring, results, and
outcomes. A comprehensive Poverty Monitoring System has been put in place and efforts to
strengthen statistical capacity andthe link between information generatedby the system and policy
making are ongoing.


    IV. BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
30.      The last CAS for Tanzania was approved in 2000 and foresaw the provision of general
budget support to assist Tanzania's efforts in combating poverty, spurringrural development, and
promoting the protection of the environment as a basis for sustainable development. The 2000
CAS is still relevant and consistent with the objectives of the PRS. Preparation o f a new CAS has
been delayed to allow full alignment and consistency with the MKUKUTA; and to allow it to be
developed in harmony with other development partners.

31.      As the next logical step in the evolution of increased aid effectiveness and client
ownership, the Government is now leading the preparation of a Joint Assistance Strategy (TJAS),
which is expected to fulfill most of the functions of a traditional CAS. One o f the key themes of
the new JAS will be the full alignment of BanWdonor instruments with the principles of local
ownership and leadership of development efforts as set out in the MKUKUTA and, more
specifically, in the Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS). Because government policies and the
government budget are the key instruments for implementing the MKUKUTA, the Bank will
increasingly provide general budget support, a shift that has already been initiated under the
current CAS. The shift to programmatic lending was precipitated by the government's call for a
change in donors' lending modalities, and is justified on three grounds: (1) the MKUKUTA has
evolved to be the overarching framework for policy dialogue and formulation, both within
Tanzania and between government and the donor community, (2) progress on the macroeconomic
front has lessened the need for traditional adjustment lending, and (3) progress in planning and
budget management provides confidence that public resource allocations and the execution of the
budget are consistent with MKUKUTApriorities. The new JAS is expected to define more clearly
criteria for the choice of specific aid modalities.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
32.      Tanzania receives development assistance from a large number of bilateral and multilateral
donors and NGOs. For the past five years, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of foreign
aid and the establishment of a conducive relationship between government, domestic stakeholders,
and donors has been an important element of Tanzania's development agenda. The Tanzania
Assistance Strategy lays out principles governing the government-donor relationship.            Key
elements for rationalizing donor assistanceinclude the move towards sector development programs
(already in place for primary and secondary education, health, and agriculture and under
preparation for water and roads) and general budget support. These aid modalities are seen as
appropriate mechanisms for increased donor coordination, better integration o f donor assistance
into government systems and processes, enhanced ownership, and reduced transaction costs. The
local Development Partnership Group is the principal mechanism for ensuringoverall coordination
among donors insupport o f government programs.



                                                 10

33.     With respect to the proposed PRSC-3 operation, the key areas o f coordination are with (a)
other donors providing budget support, (b) sector development programs supported by the Bank
and other donors, and (c) the IMF.


ThePRBS donor group
34.     PRSC support i s part o f the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) facility, which
provides a common framework for general budget support for the implementation o f the PRS. At
present, 14 donors4participate inthe PRBS facility. Usingthis facility, donors have agreed to seek
improved flexibility, reporting, and predictability o f aid flows through the budget. To ensure
impact, the government and donors have agreed on an annually reviewed and updated Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) with a three year horizon for monitoring progress in implementing

participating donors, within the framework o f the PAF, the Bank retains flexibility to select - in
agreed reforms under the PRBS and as the basis for financing decisions. As i s the case for other

consultation with government and other PRBS donors - specific benchmarks and form an
independent judgment as to whether significant progress has been made. However, all involved
parties encourage minimizing such differences which, if left unchecked, would undermine
efficiency objectives and predictability o f resource flows.

35.      In 2004, an important innovation to the PRBS facility was the introduction of more
formalized structures o f the PRBS group for internal decision making and external representation
and dialogue. The PRBS group i s currently chaired by Norway.                     The responsibility for the
representation o f the group in high level dialogue with Government, lies with the "Troika plus",
which consists o f the current chair, the past chair, and the incoming chair as well as the World
Bank. Responsibility for internal decision making lies with the "Heads o f Cooperation Group",
which includes the Heads o f all participating agencies. A "Coordination Group," which consists
o f representatives o f the "Troika plus" at the technical level as well as representatives o f key
thematic groups on poverty monitoring, public expenditure, and governance, is responsible for
leading the technical work o f the PRBS group and for ensuring the linkages to other processes in
Tanzania. Finally, the PRBS group i s supported by a permanent PRBS secretariat.


TheIMF
36.      The current three year PRGF arrangement was approved by the IMF Board in August 2003
and supports measures to (a) enhance revenue mobilization, in order to strengthen domestic
savings and reduce aid dependency; (b) improve the economy's supply response by removing
impediments to growth, including measures to improve the efficiency o f the financial sector and
promote private sector development; and (c) continue trade liberalization in order to enhance
efficiency and strengthen the tradables sector. Reflecting Tanzania's improved external position,
access under current PRGF arrangement i s only 10 percent o f quota.                     The authorities have
indicated that they would like some form o f Fund involvement with formal Board approval to
continue after the current PRGF expires.

37.      The reform program supported by the PRSC and the new PRGF arrangement are
complementary and mutually reinforcing.               The PRSC i s closely coordinated with the PRGF
according to the agreed institutional division o f labor, with the IMF taking the lead on macro-
economic issues and the Bank taking the lead on structural and social issues. In a number o f areas

~~




  Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom, the EuropeanUnion, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank. Germany co-financesthe PRSC.

where the mandate of the two institutions overlap, there i s close coordination and collaboration to
ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. Maintained macro-economic stability is
part of the performance assessment framework and the IMF Article IV consultations and PRGF
reviewsare an important input into the assessmentofthe macro-economic situation bythe Bank.


Sector Development and ThematicProgram?
38.     Another area of close coordination between the PRSC and other donors i s in the area of
sector development and thematic programs. Sector development programs which are in place for
primary and secondary education, health, and agriculture and under development for roads and
water serve as instruments for sector specific policy dialogue and resource transfer. The role of
the PRBS vis a vis these sector programs is to (a) ensure alignment of sector development
programs with the PRS; (b) monitor outcomes and focus on adequate monitoring and evaluation
systems; (c) foster cross-sectoral resource allocation and prioritization through the budget process;
(d) strengthen service delivery through public service reform; (e) reduce resource leakagesthrough
strengthening financial management and accountability systems, and (f) provide resources for the
implementation of sector programs through general budget support. It i s envisaged that resource
transfers will increasinglytake place through the PRBS facility, while sectoral policy dialogue will
continue to take place inthe context of the sector development programs.

39.      In addition to sector development programs, there are also several "thematic" donor
supported programs that are closely linkedto the PRBS. These include the Public Sector Reform
Program, the Local Government Reform Program, the Legal Sector Reform Program, the Public
Finance Management Reform Program, the Public Expenditure Review process, and the tax
administration programs, which are supported by various donors through harmonized basket
funding arrangements. These thematic programs relate directly to areas of policy dialogue and
monitoring under the PAF. Here the role of the PRBS i s primarily that of leveraging reform and
monitoring progress, while the thematic programs provide the necessary technical assistance for
the implementationof reforms.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS
40.      Fully developed sector development programs are in place for primary and secondary
education and health. Currently, Bank support to the health sector program i s in the form of an
Adaptable Programmatic Loan (APL). The proposed strategy is to gradually shift IDA financing
for health to the PRSC through the period of the Phase I1APL. Disbursements would decrease
over the life of the project (2004-2006) while the PRSC would increase, and MOF allocations for
health would be closely monitored to ensure that the total health sector budget does not decrease as
a result of the move to the PRSC.

41.      Bank support to the Primary Education Sector Development Program was in the form of
an education sector adjustment credit which provided sectoral budget support of US$ 50 million
per year. After its closure in FY05, financial support to this program will be channeled through
the PRSC program. A sector development program for secondary education is supported through a
Secondary Education Sector Adjustment Credit (2004-2006), before integrating it into the PRSC
program.


  Sectoralandthematic programs are governmentprogramsthat typically consist of apolicy framework, an
expenditure framework, and a process for review anddialogue with donors. Donor support to these programs
can be through a wide range of instruments from traditionalproject support to generalbudget support.


                                                    12

42.     Experience with budget support in Tanzania has also shown that the combination of
general budget support with project support that provides technical assistance for the
implementation o f institutional reforms is effective. For most areas covered by the PRSC such
support is in place, provided by either the Bank or other donors. Bank projects that provide
assistance in the implementation of the PRSC supported reform agenda include a tax
administration project, a public sector reform project, environment projects, and agriculture sector
support. Relevant projects under preparation include a private sector development project and a
project to support transparency and accountability inthe public sector.

LESSONSLEARNED
43.     Prior to the PRSC, Tanzania received traditional Bank adjustment support as well as a
Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit. These adjustment operations provided a rich set of
lessonsthat have influencedthe design of the PRSC program. These lessons include:

         Need for government commitment: Government commitment in both planning and
         implementation is paramount.
         Recognizinglimitationsand constraintsfaced by governments:It is important to gauge
         very carefully any actions that are outside the Government's powers. Similarly, opposition
         to reforms from civil society, CSOs, NGOs, opposition parties and from other stakeholders
         could be mitigated by having an effective dialogue with them at the preparation stage.
         Involving downstream/partner implementing agencies at an early stage: It is
         important for the MOF to involve the other Ministries, Departments and Agencies
         (MDAs), during preparation, which will subsequently be involved in the implementation
         of the program. Experience has shown that ifthese other sectors are not included from the
         beginning,the implementationcan become very difficult subsequently.
         Being realistic in program design and implementation: There has often been a
         tendency to underestimate the Government's capacity constraints and as a result the
         planned implementation is slower than expected.
         Effective design of complex actions: Where a complex and multi-step activity is
         involved, it is crucial to lay out the steps clearly and to pay attention to their sequence and
         linkages.
         Buildingcrucial capacity at an early stage: Tanzania faces serious capacity constraints
         in many areas, which can affect the implementation of reforms. It is thus important, to
         identify the capacity requirements of specific reform programs early on and ensure that
         appropriate capacity enhancing measures are taken.
         Improving predictability of resource flows: A common weakness o f the Bank's
         adjustment support was that ex-ante conditionality led to low predictability of financial aid
         flows, which affectedthe implementation of the government budget.

         The government and the PRBS donor group had commissioned an independent evaluation
of general budget support to Tanzania duringthe period 1995-2004 and a draft report was issued in
December 2004. The report documents improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of the
policy dialogue and resource transfers to Tanzania which has resulted in an improved financing
and institutional framework for public policy and spending. GBS has also enhanced the capacity of
government to influence the proximate determinants of poverty reduction.

45.      In its recommendations, the independent evaluation strongly supports several initiatives
that have been initiated by government. This includes reforming the aid architecture, which is


                                                    13

taking place in the context of the Tanzania Assistance Strategy and the Tanzania Joint Assistance
Strategy processes; and strengthening the institutional framework for public policy and spending
and promoting domestic accountability and open debate, which are among the main objectives of
the MKUKUTAand PERprocesses.

46.     Specific to the PRBS, the joint evaluation suggests to distinguish more clearly
between due process requirements, strategic dialogue and results monitoring. The findings
of this evaluation are an important input for the design of the new Tanzania Joint Assistance
Strategy as well as for the design of the new PRBS program.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
47.     PovertyAnalysis: As part of the Tanzanian Poverty Monitoring System(PMS), the local
Research and Analysis Working Group (RAWG) carries out a wide range o f analytic work on
poverty related issues. This includes joint work by the Government and the Bank on a combined
Country Economic Memorandum and Poverty Assessment. Inaddition to analyzing the interaction
of economic growth with various dimensions of poverty, a particular focus o f the analytic work is
on hunger and nutrition. The Second Poverty and Human Development Report prepared by the
RAWG in 2003 provides an overview of the status of poverty inTanzania, as well as more detailed
analysis on topics such as vulnerability and social protection, benefit incidence, the relationship
between governance and poverty reduction and vulnerability containment, and agriculture. Results
of a comprehensive household budget survey carried out in 2001 were published in 2002, and a
participatory poverty assessment was completed and a report publishedin2003.

48.     Country Economic Work: The last CEM was issued in 2000 and a new CEM is
currently under preparation in close collaboration with Government. The issues addressed by the
CEM include (a) the prospects for sustaining and improving Tanzania's recent growth
performance, (b) reducing income poverty in the rural areas, and (c) linkages between economic
growth and various dimensions o f poverty.

49.     Related to the focus o f the PRSC on private sector and rural development, the Bank is
supporting several pieces o f analytic work that complement the analysis done by government,
donors, and research institutes. This includes an investment climate survey carried out by the
Regional Program on Enterprise Development, a rural investment climate survey and a supply
chain analysis for agricultural products.

50.     Poverty and Social Impact Assessments(PSIAs): Specific to the PRSC reform agenda
in the area of rural development, the Bank has carried out a PSIA of the reform of crop boards.
The objective ofthe work was to examine options for reform o fthe Coffee and Cotton Boards with
close attention to the impact o f reform options and stakeholder workshops to discuss the findings
of the PSIA and agree on the way forward were held in September/October 2004. Another PSIA
on reforms of local government taxation and revenue has been recently completed. The objective
of this study was to assess the impact of recent reforms of local government taxation and to assist
inthe designof a new revenue systemfor local authorities. One ofthe main findings of this PSIA
was that the reform o f local taxation and business licensing has made the tax system more
progressive and thus pro-poor. Aside from the PSIA supported by the Bank, Tanzania can draw
upon significant work by local research institutes as well as studies carried out in the context of
donor supported projects or international research efforts that analyze the social and poverty
impact of a large variety of policy and institutional reforms.




                                                  14

51.      Gender Analysis: In 2004, the Bank carried out a Strategic Country Gender Assessment
for Tanzania. It acknowledges that Tanzania has long been at the forefront o f gender analysis and
practice, and has often articulated the importance o f gender equality. However, it also points to
weaknesses which include (i)the Ministry o f Community Development, Gender and Children
(MCDGC) has a broad and unfocussed mandate and gender focused action plans and policies are
not prioritized nor implemented effectively; (ii)
                                                progress in passing gender-sensitive laws has not
been matched by effective implementation; (iii)gender-based violence remains a pervasive
problem and relevant laws are not being effectively implemented; and (iv) the gender-responsive
budget initiative has stalled. While PRSC-3 does not explicitly address gender issues, many o f the
reforms supported do. In particular, this includes the strengthening o f the poverty monitoring
system, including efforts to provide enhanced gender disaggregated information, the public sector
reform program, which includes a module on addressing gender issues in the public sector, or
reforms o f land legislation and support to its implementation, which eliminates discriminatory
rules on access to land. Sector development programs for health and primary and secondary
education also contain measures to address inequalities and gender specific issues.

52.      Fiduciary Work: In the context o f Tanzania's government led, participatory Public
ExpenditureReview process, a wide variety o f analytical activities are carried out every year. This
includes the Bank-led preparation o f the annual Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Report (PEFAR), whose findings have been presented during the PER Consultative Meeting in
May 2005. The PEFAR combines analytic work that was previously carried out inthe context o f
the annual PER external evaluation and the Country Fiduciary Accountability Assessment. A
CPAR was completed in 2003.              Technical assistance for the implementation o f the
recommendations o f the PEFAR and the CPAR is being provided through a Public Finance
Management Reform Program, while policy dialogue takes place in the context or the PEFAR and
PRBS program.


  V.       THE PROPOSEDTHIRD POVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT
                                               CREDIT

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION
53.      The Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-3) will support the implementation o f
Tanzania's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The financial support provided through the PRSC-
3 will narrow the gap between the cost o f implementing key elements o f the PRS and resources
available from government's own domestic revenue and other donor support.

54.      It had been envisaged that the credit amount o f PRSC-3 would be US$175 million,
reflecting an increase of US$25 million compared to PRSC-2. Such an increase would have been
inresponse government's request to provide IDA support increasinglythrough the PRSC, based on
the implementation o f key reforms in areas supported by the PRSC.            Given the delays in
agriculture sector reform discussed in paragraph 61 and to maintain consistency between IDA
PRSC financing and the pace o f structural reforms, it is proposedto postpone an increase inPRSC
financing until PRSC-4, contingent on satisfactory progress in the implementation o f the
MKUKUTA. The prior action on crop boardreform has been convertedinto atrigger for PRSC-4.

55.     PRSC-3 will support and monitor key reforms identified in Tanzania's PRS6. First, it
supports measures that are expected to contribute directly to the reduction o f income poverty. This
includes reforms in agricultural and rural development which are intended to raise agricultural
productivity and thus enhance the incomes o f the population in rural areas, where poverty i s most
widespread and most deeply entrenched.           It also includes reforms related to private sector
development and strengthening o f the business environment, as well as legal and administrative
reforms to enhance the functioning o f land, credit, and labor markets. These are intendedto foster
economic growth and enhance employment opportunities as access to formal and informal sector
employment has been identified as one o f the key areas for sustainable poverty reduction in the
PRS.

56.     Second, the PRSC-3 monitors and leverages progress in the implementation o f sectoral
programs to reduce poverty, covering the priority sectors identified in the PRS, Le., primary
education, basic health, water, rural roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and
HIV/AIDS. The PRSC policy dialogue focuses on the establishment o f a robust monitoring and
evaluation system that allows an assessment o f the impact and results o f sectoral programs. The
information derived from the monitoring and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment
of progress towards the PRS objectives. Dialogue on sectoral policy issues will continue to take
place in the context o f established sectoral fora. The resources provided through the PRSC-3 will
complement government and other donor resources in financing priority programs for poverty
reduction.    The well developed participatory PER-MTEF process provides a mechanism for
monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on the use o f budgetary resources.

57.     Third, PRSC-3 includes cross-sectoral actions to strengthen public sector performance and
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f the use o f resources. These measures will have a
direct impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty
reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty reduction by
reducing leakages in the form o f low allocative or operational efficiency o f public expenditures.
Key areas o f reform include strengthening o f financial management through the implementation o f
the public financial management reform program, strengthening o f the national audit office, pay
reform coupled with improved performance management inthe public sector, procurement reform,
the implementation o f anti-corruption strategies, and enhancing efficiency in the use o f
development assistance.

58.     Finally, PRSC-3 also supports government's             efforts to enhance        environmental
sustainability o f Tanzania's development program.         The PRS identifies this as an important
element o f efforts to improve the quality o f life and social well-being. Table 3 provides an
overview o f the focus o f policy dialogue under PRSC-3.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTING THE PRSC
SUPPORTEDACTIONS
59.     In the context of the joint PRBS review process, progress in implementing the PRBS
program was assessed during the annual PRBS review in November 2004 and during the PRBS
mid-year review in April 2005.        The PRBS development partners concluded that overall
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and the supporting reform program is
satisfactory and serves as a good basisfor continued cooperation. Progress was good inthe area
o f maintaining macro-economic stability, improving budget formulation and execution, improving
the performance of the public sector, improving external resource management, and enhancing
environmental sustainability.    The reviews also noted various areas o f concern which need
increased attention by government. These include rather slow progress on various reforms related
to reducing income poverty, delays in updating the poverty monitoring indicators o f the PRS, and
the implementation o f specific anti-corruption measures.

PRIOR ACTIONS FORPRSC-3
60.      The set o f prior actions for PRSC-3 corresponds to the triggers identified under PRSC-2.
The prior actions emphasize the strategic focus of the operation on enhancing pro-poor economic
growth and public sector financial management. Seven of the eight prior actions have been
completed satisfactorily.

61.     The prior action regarding the approval of a strategy for the reform of at least two
crop boards has only been partially met. Cabinet approved reforms to the financing of crop
boards, but has not yet endorsed specific reforms of the role and function of crop boards, including
their regulatory functions, governance structures, and accountability to stakeholders.

62.     The agreement on financing reforms is a key step forward in the overall reform of the
Boards. It will bring important savings to producers by reducingtheir burden of multipletaxation.
Italso subjects the finances of the crop boardsto more rigorous scrutiny, by bringingthem into the
fold o f the national budget, and in this way enhances financial accountability. The financing
reforms will be implemented during fiscal year 2005/06.           An appropriate allocation for the
budgetary funding o f crop boards has been made in the budget for 2005/06. Government has
indicated that it plans to proceed with the reform of crop boards by developing an Action Plan for
the Rationalization of Roles, Functions, Financing and Accountability of Crop Boards by
September 2005. New crop board legislation is expected to be submittedto Parliament duringthe
secondhalf of 2006.

63.     Agricultural growth is central to Tanzania's efforts to reduce poverty. Reform of the crop
boards i s considered a critical component of Tanzania's agricultural strategy, reflecting a
commitment of government to enhance the competitiveness of the country's main agricultural
exports. Progress made on reform of financing of crop boards i s important, and the government
has made time-bound commitments toward meetingthe remaining actions for reform of the crop
boards. For this reason, the partial completion of this target i s considered consistent with meeting
overall objectives of the PRSC.

  Completed. The measures conceming the reform of business licencing announcedinthe FY05 budget arc
  being implemented. These include the abolition of business license fees for small businesses. In addition
  business licenses have to be issued only at the time of the establishment of the business and no longei
  annually. The PSIA on the reform of local taxation reports a positive impact of these reforms. In order tc
  establish a well functioning, transparent, and efficient business registration system, additional actions are
  needed. A classification system businesses has been formulated. A draft bill on Business Activities
  Registration is being finalized for submission to Parliament in 2006. Consultants will then design the
  businessregistration system.

  Building on the results of the Crop Boards review, Government approval of a strategy to reform two
  crop boards consistentwith ASDS.

  Partially completed - converted to trigger for PRSC-4. A draft report on the Crop Board review had
  been completed in June 2004 and government organized a series of consultations with stakeholders in the
  coffee and cotton industries in September 2004. In June 2005, Cabinet decided to abolish the Crop
  Development Funds, and replace the fmancing of crop boards' running costs though crop cesses with
  fmancing from the central government budget. No decision has beentakenregarding reforms ofthe role and
  functioning of crop boards, as Cabinet considered available evidence as being inconclusive and requested
  deeper analysis before a decision on further crop boardreforms is taken.

  Approved budget 2004/05 in line with PRS objectives, delineating budget codes for priority sectors
  and items.

   Completed. The analysis of the approved budget and PRS funding for 2004/05 was made inthe Ministry
   of Finance paper: "Budget Review, Recent Developments in Budget Execution and Formulation", which
   was reviewed by the budget support development partners in the PER Macro Group meeting of October
   2004. The general highlight is that PRS finding in 04/05 totals TSh 1,480 billion, 32 percent higher than
   the actual outtum in 2003104 and 44 percent of the budget including Consolidated Funds Services (CFS).
   The relative share of PRS funding in the budget has averaged 45 percent since 2002/03. The paper
   presentedthe PRS funding to the detailed levelof GFS codeditems. The recurrent budget for priority items
   in2004/05 are 8.8 percenthigher than the outtum in2003/04, while the developmentbudget for priority
   items is 5.6 percenthigher thanthe budget in2003/04.

 Budget execution for the first half of 2004105 was in line with the approved budget and PRS priorities (for
 FQ1 and FQ2, total expenditure including CFS was 78% and 130% of estimates respectively). The over
 performancein FQ2 is mainly on account of catching up inrecurrent expenditure as well as registeredhigh
 inflows of project funds. Priority sectors have continued to receive their full quarterly allocations and
 frontloading o f budget support funds has facilitated adequate allocationsto other MDAs.                   I

DESIGNOF A NEW PRBSPROGRAMAND TRIGGERS FOR PRSC-4
64.     The first PRSC program foresaw a series of three PRSCs (PRSC-1 - PRSC-3) which
would support the implementation of Tanzania's first PRSP. The proposed PRSC-3 i s thus the last
operation under the existing program and a new one i s under preparation, basedon Tanzania's new
PRSP. The formulation of the new PRBS program i s expected to respond to (a) the new PRSP
which has a greater outcome orientation than the previous one, (b) the recently completed Joint
Evaluation o f General Budget Support to Tanzania, (c) ongoing efforts for greater donor
harmonization and efforts to provide greater space for government ownership, and (d) the gradual
integration o f sectoral support into the PRBS. It i s expected that the new multi-year PRBS
program will be formulated by October 2005, and its implementation start with PRSC-4. In order
to ensure continuity and predictability of financing during the transition to the new program, the
current PAF has been extended by one year until November 2005/March 2006. The Annual
Review identified monitorable actions for FY06 inthe areas covered by the PAF. Fromthis set of
actions, the following triggers for PRSC-4 have been identified. Once the new PRBS program i s
inplace, the consistency ofthese triggers with the new program will bereviewed.

POLICY AREAS
65.      The following sections review in detail progress made inthe key policy areas covered by
the PRSC-3. Each section discusses the main issues do be addressed, government's reform
strategy, progress made under PRSC-3, actions that government plans to carry out under PRSC-4,
expected results of the PRSC supported reforms, as well as the indicators which the reforms are
expected to influence.


Improved investment and business environment
66.      Issue. The primary issue for government is to create an environment inwhich households
can participate in viable productive activities of their choice by responding to labor or product
markets opportunities. Thus as a major priority, government must enhance the operating
environment for firms to support its productive sectors to succeed ina globalized economy.

67.      Reform Strategy. The PRSC supports government in building a competitive operating
environment by working on two major pillars (1) establishing effective services of public
institutions interfacing with the private sector and (2) establishing the foundation for efficient
factor input markets in starting with land and labor. Pillar 1: the government has started reviewing
regulations, focusing on removing obstacles and re-organizing the most important tasks of
government. In practical terms this means (a) harmonization of local government taxation to
remove excessive tax burden on private enterprise; (b) resolution of outstanding issues emanating
from the Land Act; (c) review and amendment o f labor laws constraining business operations; (d)
streamlining o f work permit procedures; (e) review and amendment of licensing legislation to
reduce the cost of business establishment and continuation; (f) review and revision of export-
import procedures to reduce time costs and corruption-related costs; and (g) design and
implementation of a program for enhancing access to commercial courts by SMEs. Pillar 2:
efficient factor markets are critical for efficient resource allocation and competitiveness of the
Tanzanian economy. The government has already embarked on two critical areas (a) the labor
laws and (b) the Land and Village Land Act. Complementing these actions supported by the
PRSC, the government is also focused on enhancing the efficiency in infrastructure services, ports
and harbors and in utilities such as electricity and water.

68,      Progress under PRSC-3. (Pillar 1) Following approval of the business environment
strengthening (BEST) programme under PRSC-2, its implementation is now underway including
work on land and labour reforms, business licenses, regulatory licensing, and the commercial
dispute resolution (CDR) system. An M&E framework for BEST is expected to be fully
operational by November 2005.

69.      Work progressed on replacing the business-licensing regime by a registration system. In
particular, measures to rationalize business licensing announced in the budget for FY05 are being
implemented (Box 2). This includes the abolition o f business license fees for health facilities
operated by religious organizations and small businesses. Inaddition, business licenses have to be
issued only at the time of the establishment o f the business and no longer annually.             A
classification system has been formulated for businesses. A draft bill on Business Activities
Registrationhas been submitted to Parliament in July 2005. In addition, work i s ongoing on the
harmonisation of sectoral legislation (approximately 26) that affects businesslicensing.

70.      Preparation of a private sector strategy has been delayed, as government wanted first to
complete the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) which was finalized in June 2005.



                                                  23

Implementation of the SME strategy has been slower than expected, due to insufficient budgetary
allocations. Government established an SME Credit Guarantee Fund (SCGF) mid 2003 which
became operational at the end of 2004.

71.       (Pillar 2) Following presidential assent to the new labor legislation on employment
relations, collective labor relations, dispute resolution and labor market institutions ( approved
during the PRSC-2 period), the following labour institutions are being established: Labour
Economic and Social Council (LESCO) and Commission for Mediation and Arbitration (CMA).
The first batch of 30 CMA trainees graduated in January 2005 and the second batch of CMA
trainees began training mid January 2005. Phase I1labour laws including occupational safety and
health, workers compensation act, and employment and skills development i s expected to be
submittedto Parliamentin2006.


Box 2. Impact of abolition of development levy and reform of business licensing

The 2005 Tanzania PSIA on local government tax reformexaminedthe impacts of the 2003 abolition of the
flat rate development levy (along with `nuisance taxes'), and the 2004 abolition of business license fees (for
enterprises below a certain size, and capping of those fees for larger enterprises). The objectives were to (a)
assess the distribution o f the tax burdenacross different social and income groups and smallbusinessesbefore
and after the reforms; and (b) to inform other initiatives directed at fiscal policy reform in the context o f
Tanzania's decentralization.

Regardingbusinesses, fmdings show that the reforms had a progressive impact with an overall reductionof
the tax burden of 14 per cent. Within this, medium businessesrecorded 11per cent less tax, small businesses
36 per cent less tax, and micro businesses (under Tsh 54,000 turnover) 11per cent more tax. The increased
payment by micro-businesses probably results from their non-payment of previous business license fees,
coupledwith the wider use of other taxes (such as billboard fees) by councils after the reform: these were all
imposedonmicro businesseswith greater vigor than the dehct license fees.

The policy objective of improving the business environment via the 2003 and 2004 tax reforms therefore
appears from the study's business surveys to have overall had a modestly beneficial effect, with the middle
category of "small businesses" benefiting the most. According to stakeholders, business start-ups have
increased, and investment, both in terms of re-investment of savings and business expansion, has occurred
since the abolitionof the business license.



72.       The Land (Amendments) Act, 2003 has been passed by Parliament and assented by the
President in April 2004, to bring about as closer as possible proper balance o f the interests of the
mortgagor (borrower) and the mortgagee (lender). Government has put inplace a quick procedure
for the acquisition of title deeds and other related documents. Government also revised the land
policy and formulated and issue land regulations in line with the amendment to the LandAct.

73.       Monitorable Actions under PRSC-4. These include the approval o f a PSD strategy,
institutionalization of the M&E systemfor BEST, implementation of SMEpolicy priority projects,
gazetting of regulations for the "Company Registration Act," establishment o f CMA labour
institution, submission to Parliament o f a draft bill on Business Activities Registration, functioning
of the Commercial Dispute Resolution (CDR) management structure, and Government preparation
of an issues paper on the reform o f the Civil Procedure Code (CPC).

74.       Expected Results of Program The actions implemented under the PRSC program are
expectedto leadto four key medium term outcomes, namely:



                                                       24

       0   Improved efficiency of public institutions interfacing with the private sector, these include
           the Business Registration, Customs and Tax administration;

       0   Improved efficiency o f factor inputmarkets starting with land and labor;

       0   Enterprise creation and growth; and

       0   Increased value addition of production and competitiveness o f Tanzania based
           production.

  75.      Monitoring Indicators. Specific quantitative monitoring indicators under this component
 o fthe PRSC include':

       0   Employment law index* (currently 61 on a scale of 0 to 100 with a higher value meaning
           more regulation);

       0   Cost to register a business (currently 199 percent of per capita income); and

       0   Time to enforce a contract (currently 127 days).


 Agriculture and rural development
  76.      Issues.      The PRS highlights several causes of income poverty, particularly in the
 agriculture sector, identified by groups consulted during its preparation. The highestpriority items
  identified were poor technology, non-availability o f farm inputs, poor roads, limited access to
  markets, and non-availability of credit. In addition, recent research shows that rural poverty is
  associated with lack of access to land, particularly by womeng. Addressing these constraints

I requires reforms of crop boards particularly with respect to input supply, product quality, and
  competitiveness; micro-finance legislation; the institutional arrangements governing rural roads;
  local government taxation; property rights; and overall co-ordination of public interventions inthe
  agriculture sector.

  77.      Policies governing export crops - crop boards: Crop boards were set up to address
  concerns of declining quality of exports, uncompetitive private buyer behavior, and a breakdown
  of input supply systems.             They play a significant role in determining the regulatory and
  institutional environment for crop export and investment growth, and are key determinants in
  reaching Tanzania's ambitious agricultural growth targets. Performance among boards has varied
  significantly. There are also concerns about the inadequate accountability o f the boards to traders
  and farmers whom they are supposed to serve, disruption of marketing and exports, and distortion
  of inputmarkets.

  78.      Micro-finance legislation: Access to finance in rural areas ,is low. The 2000/1 H B S
  shows that only 3.8 percent o f rural households with one or more members have a savings account,
  2.8 percent participate in an informal savings group, and 1.3 percent in non-bank formal savings
  groups. Only 0.4 percent took a bank loan in 1999/2000. In contrast, access to finance was
  highlighted by about one-third o f the groups involved in the PRS consultation as a key constraint
  'These   indicators are reported in the Bank's "Doing Business in 2004" publication and will be updated
  annually.

in agriculture. While some farmers have access to credit through contract farming arrangements
(e.g. tobacco), or through various input schemes operated by the boards (e.g. the voucher and
passbook programs), more attention is needed on the legal and regulatory framework governing
formal savings institutions, particularly micro-finance. It i s also expected that raising the overall
profitability o f agriculture will raise the demand for these financial services.

79.      Institutional arrangements governing rural roads: Rehabilitation and maintenance of
rural roads are key requirements for reducing agricultural marketing transaction costs, with
improved market access essential for the transformation from subsistence to commercial
agriculture. The district road network continues to be in generally poor condition with ninety
percent of district and feeder roads being impassable to vehicles duringthe rainy season. Current
institutional arrangements for the maintenance and rehabilitationof district roads remain weak.

80.      Local government taxation: Prior to the implementation of PRES supported reforms in
this area, rural Tanzanians paid an array of taxes, levies, fees and cesses which inmany cases had
a negative impact on producer incentives and incomes. For example, direct taxes on agricultural
export crops amounted to about 20 percent, inclusive o f local taxes and levies. While the revenue
generated from some of the taxes and levies is rather small, they are perceived to be a significant
constraint to economic activity and create opportunities for abuse and corruption. As local
governments are increasingly called upon to deliver more services and maintain more
infrastructure, it is critical for government to develop a strategy on financing local governments'
responsibilities, including the role of own-source revenues and transfers, that i s consistent with a
supportive incentive framework for economic activity.

81.      Property rights: Lack of access to land is associated with poverty, particularly among
women.     With the change in land use and increasing population over time, the demand and
competition for land for cropping and grazing has increased.              Conflicts between different
categories of land users, rapid urbanization leading to establishment o f unplanned settlements,
increased demand for surveyed land for industrial and commercial investments and poor land
administration were key drivers for the development of the National Land Policy and subsequent
1999 Land Act and Village Land Act. The Acts provide the legal framework for strengthening
property rights. While there has been some progress in the implementation of the Acts,
implementation remains largely uncoordinated, responding to un-prioritized demands. In the
meantime, the government has initiated a program on formalization o f assets and businesses (De
Soto Initiative), to facilitate the use of land as collateral.

82.      ASDP co-ordination: The Agricultural Sector Development Program (ASDP) provides a
framework for the implementation of the sector strategy, however, co-ordination o f the three main
agriculture ministries(Ministries o f Agriculture and Food Security; Co-operatives and Marketing;
and Water and Livestock Development) remains a challenge for implementation. Efficiency of
resource use and effectiveness of service delivery remain key concerns. The fixed costs associated
with the creation of multiple structures are high, with concerns about the lack of coordination and
duplication of activities.

83.      Reform Strategy. The government reform strategy which the PRES supports includes:

84.      Improving policies governing crop boards: Options for reform o f the coffee, cotton,
cashew and tea boards were examined following the review of the existing institutional
arrangements for these crops and evaluatingthe effectiveness of the boards' functions inrelationto
existing or potential alternative arrangements - particularly in the area o f quality control, input

supply, and private sector competition. Government is currently finalizing an Action Plan for the
Rationalization of Roles, Functions, Financing and Accountability of Crop Boards which i s
expected to be circulated during September 2005. New crop board legislation i s expected to be
submittedto Parliament duringthe secondhalfof 2006.

85.     Improving micro-finance legislation:      In an effort to ensure the emergence of more
efficient and sustainable financial intermediaries, a legal and regulatory framework for micro-
finance is to be enforced.

86,     Strengthen the institutional arrangements governing rural roads: Work is underway to
revise the Roads Act which will establish appropriate financial and management arrangements for
the road network in Tanzania, including rural roads. As part o f the preparation, options to
strengthen the institutional arrangements for district road maintenance and rehabilitation will be
developed. Followingthis work, the revisedRoads Act will be submittedto Parliament.

87.     Local government taxation: Government is developing an overall strategy on financing
local governments' responsibilities, including the role of own-source revenues and transfers.
Measures to simplify and rationalize local government taxation will be undertaken and the design
of a new intra-governmental transfer system covering both recurrent and development
expenditures is at an advanced stage. Given this constraint on agricultural export taxes, a study on
taxation of export crops was included as a PAF action under the macroeconomic stability (tax)
section to be followed up within the fiscal policy framework.

Box 3. Tanzania Crop Boards Reforms PSIA

  In an effort to increase producer prices and incentives as well as the intemational competitiveness of
  Tanzania's main export crops, the governmentof Tanzania has embarked on reforms of its Crop Boards.
  To this end, it intendsto implementmeasuresthat would create amore favorable regulatory environment,
  a clearer delineation of public and private functions and associated financing, to prevent conflict of
  interest of the Boards, improved accountability of Boards to stakeholders are. The recent Crop Board
  reform study recommended changes in the following: (1) the regulatory environment, relating to the
  scope of activities that private sector agents can engage inand how various activities can be carried out;
  (2) the scope o f Board activities beyondregulation; (3) financing of Board activities; and (4) governance
  ofthe Boards and crop development funds.

  The study suggests that the regulatory environment in the coffee sector should be reformed to allow
  vertical integration; to permit those with primary processing facilities to buy coffee cherries; to make
  participation inthe coffee auction voluntary, or at a minimum expand the opportunity for direct exports.
  In the cotton and cashew sector, reforms should enable producers to make more informed investment
  decisions by eliminating announcements of indicative prices. Also, transaction costs of producers and
  traders should be reducedandmarket entry eased for new traders inthe coffee, cashew and cotton sectors
  through reducing the cost of licenses and the discretionary powers of the Boards to issue and revoke
  licenses. The Boards' activities are recommendedin areas where there i s a positive public coordination
  externality for private agents, such as the continuation of seed and input supply through the Cotton
  Development Fund with private sector management. In the tea sectors with a strong private sector
  leadership, there is little need for the Tea DevelopmentAgency. The regulatory functions of the Boards
  should be financed through the budget. This is estimatedto result in savings of about US$3.1 millionto
  producers. Finally, reforms should provide a greater representation of producers and traders on the
  Boards and inthe management of crop developmentfknds to improve accountability.

  The stakeholder and institutional mapping carried out as part of the PSIA work by and large confirmed
  the positive impact of such reforms on smallholders. To further ascertain a positive social and poverty
  impact of these reforms, the government has beencompiling additional analysisto inform the preparation
  of an action plan for the reform of crop boards.

88.      Improvingproperty rights: A prioritized strategic plan for implementation o f the LandAct
and Village Land Act will be developed. This will provide priority focus to areas which are likely
to have the highest return while fitting into the overall budget resource envelope.

89.      ASDP co-ordination: Co-ordination arrangements for the implementation o f the ASDP
will be strengthened, including a National Steering Committee (NSC).                  The NSC will oversee
implementation,      comprising the permanent            secretaries   o f key ministries involved in
implementation, and will endeavor to ensure co-ordination and resolve impasses and disputes
across the agriculture sector ministries.          In addition, the overall budget allocations to the
agricultural sector line ministries will be monitored to ensure that an increasing share is going to
ASDP priority areas.

90.      Progress under PRSC-3. Progress is being made on all elements ofthe program. Work on
micro-finance regulations, local government taxation (Box 2), and lands have advanced with
slower progress on crop board reform and rural roads.

91.      The review o f the coffee, cotton, cashew and tea boards was undertaken with subsequent
stakeholder workshops on coffee and cotton held in September 2004. In June 2005, Cabinet


                                                      28

decided to abolish the Crop Development Funds, and replace the financing of crop boards' running
costs through crop cesses with financing from the central government budget. N o decision has
been taken regarding reforms of the role and functioning of crop boards, as Cabinet considered
available evidence as being inconclusive and requested deeper analysis before a decision on
further crop boardreforms is taken.

92.     The micro-finance regulations have been approved by Government and are currently being
gazetted. There is ongoing work on the development of an overall strategy on financing local
governments' responsibilities, including the role of own-source revenues and transfers. The work
includes both an assessment of the links of local taxes and the provision of local services, and on
the fiscal transfers.

93.     After a slow start, work on the preparation of a prioritized implementation plan of the
Land Act and Village Land Act has progressed. Stakeholder field consultations and validation
started in September 2004.      The plan for implementation of the land laws was approved by
Government inApril 2005.

94.     More time than initially anticipated is neededto finalize the Road Act. This will likely be
submitted for the first Parliamentary reading in January 2006 for likely approval by April 2006. A
detailed classification inventory of both trunk and regional roads and district feeder and urban
roads is needed prior to finalization of the Act to assist inthe clearer delineation of responsibilities
between central and local governments. The inventory was completed in September2004.

95.     Monitorable actions under PRSC-4. There are several monitorable actions under PRSC-
4: progress inthe implementation of an Action Plan for the reform o f crop Boards, consistent with
the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy; (ii)enforcement of new regulations for the micro-
finance legislation with licensing of qualifying financial NGOs and financial co-operatives; (iii)
development of an overall strategy on financing local governments' responsibilities, including the
role of own-source revenues and transfers; (iv) implementation o f the land sector strategic plan on
the Land Act and Village Land Act; and (v) the changing share of the agriculture sector line
ministriesbudgets goingto ASDP priorities.

96.     Expected results of program. The actions implemented under the PRBS program are
expected to lead to:

    0   Improved institutional arrangements governing key export crops;
    0   Facilitative legal and regulatory framework for micro-finance;
    0   Strengthenedinstitutional arrangements for ruralroadmaintenance and rehabilitation;
    0   Streamlined local government taxes and levies;
    0   Improved framework for implementation o f the Land Act and Village LandAct; and
    0   Increased focus of relevant Ministries on ASDP priorities.

97.     Monitoring Indicators. Specific monitoring indicators under this component of the
PRES include:
        Number of registered and operatingmicro-finance institutions (MFIs);
        Number ofMFIs' clients;
        Percentage increase involume of agricultural exports;
        Relative increase inpremium prices of agricultural exports;
        Number of people usingland as collateral for accessing credit;

Improvedpoverty monitoring and evaluation
98.      Background. Results orientation and a focus on pro-poor outcomes are key characteristics
of the poverty reduction strategy. To these ends, a poverty monitoring system (PMS) has been set
up in Tanzania in 2001 to support the PRSP. The data and analytics generated are critical to
assessing: overall progress in the implementation of government's poverty reduction agenda; the
effectiveness o f macroeconomic policies and sectoral and cross-cutting structural and institutional
reforms; and related cost efficiency and resource allocation questions. This composite set of
results i s necessary for informing the policy and financing decisions o f the authorities. The PMS
i s made even more critical with the introduction of greater results orientation in the MKUKUTA
for 2005-2010, which is organized around key outcomes in three clusters. There i s a need to
review the PMS to take into account the specificities o f the MKUKUTA, especially the greater
attention to growth and the increased focus on results monitoring. This review of the PMS is
currently ongoing.

99.      Improving the quality of data is key to results management. To this end, the preparation of
a Statistical Master Plan will become an important building block o f the poverty monitoring
system. It will identify how data quality in the National Statistical System (routine data, social
statistics, economic statistics) can be enhanced, by prioritizing amongst different data collection
activities and formulating an implementationplan for improvement of data collection methods.

100.     Progress under PRSGR Government has led a widely consultative process, at national,
regional and local level in the design phase of the MKUKUTA. The MKUKUTA contains a set of
indicators and targets at the outcome, output, process, and input level. Reporting on progress
against indicators is mainly limited to those indicators which are subject to routine data collection,
given no major survey other than the HIV/AIDS survey was produced over the last year. The
MKUKUTA already provides better coverage of indicators that previously received insufficient
attention such as on governance, gender, agriculture, vulnerability, roads and the environment.
Still, a key challenge is to further define and sharpenthe outcomes and related indicators included
inthe MKUKUTAmatrix. This task will be taken forward duringthe PMS review. This process
will also inform other challenges in the MKUKUTA and help clarify the link between outcome
indicators and sector strategies (by defining outcomes, outputs and inputs and the related
indicators), and between outcome indicators and budget allocations.

101.     The RDS TWG has prepared a strategy paper for rationalization of the routine data
collection system. This was seen as a major step towards the modernization of the routine data
collection system. The document presents an overarching framework that goes beyond the PMS.
It aims to rationalize routine data collection and to coordinate between sectors and improve
capacity at the community, ward and village level to process and analyze this information. In
response to challenges in the routine data systems, as well as demands new demand originating
from the monitoring of the MKUKUTA NBS has applied to the TFSCB for funds to design a
national statistical strategy. This strategy would cover data production by NBS as well as routine
data collection. Through a process o f broad consultations that are closely related to the PMS
review, the statistical strategy will for the MKUKUTA period identify national data needs,
prioritize and cost these and provide an implementation plan on how to further improve data
quality provided by surveys and censuses, national accounts and routine data systems.

102.     The Research and Analysis TWG is preparing a new research strategy that takes into
account the focus on results and the inclusion of growth in the MKUKUTA. This strategy not
only pays attention to poverty, but also to growth and impact evaluation. The PHDR currently
under preparation reflects this shift in researchpriorities and will provide in depth analysis of the
business climate (growth), service delivery (quality of life) and local ownership (governance).

103.     Monitorable actions under PRSC-4. These include (i)clearer definition ofMKUKUTA
                                                                  a
outcomes and indicators resulting in the adoption of (part of) the MKUKUTA indicators in the
PAF matrix; (ii)continued reporting on progress and review of performance against the updated
set of indicators and targets in the MKUKUTA; and (iii)development, adoption and
implementationof a strategy to improve data collection inthe National Statistical System.


Macro-economicstability
104.     Issue. Tanzania has successfully implementeda program o f macro-economic stabilization,
resulting in sustained growth, low rates of inflation, and the build up o f international reserves.
Tanzania has also refined its monetary and fiscal instruments and institutions to provide a solid
basis for sustained macro-economic stability. The 4threview under the current PRGF arrangement
was approved by the IMF's Board on July 29, 2005. Weaknesses remain in the areas of'debt
management and tax policy and administration. The PRSC supports efforts to eliminate residual
weaknesses inthese areas.

105.     Tanzania's public and publicly guaranteed external debt i s assessed as being currently
sustainable after obtaining irrevocable debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (amounting
to US$2.026 billion inNPV terms). However, continued sustainability o f Tanzania's external debt
i s contingent on the sustained implementation of macroeconomic and structural reform policies, as
well as prudent management o f external debt.

106.     Tanzania's revenue performance has increased in recent years from 11.3 percent of GDP
in 1998/99 to an estimated 13.6 percent in 2004/05 but is still low compared to other countries in
the region.    Improving Tanzania's comparatively low revenue effort i s a key element of
government's strategy to ensure sustainable financing for the implementation of the PRS.

107.     Reform strategy. Tanzania's reform strategy for debt management is spelled out in the
national debt strategy, the implementation of which is monitored under the PRSC program. Key
elements of this strategy are actions to (a) ensure fiscal sustainability and an optimal debt
structure, (b) deal with domestic contingent liabilities, (c) develop financial markets, (d)
strengthen the institutional arrangement for public debt management, and (e) strengthen the legal
framework for borrowing and debt management.

108.     Tanzania's strategy to enhance government revenue focuses on broadening the tax base
and improving tax administration. Technical support for improving tax administration is provided
bythe Bank and other donors.

109.     Progress under PRSC-3. Government continued prudent debt contracting and
management and close monitoring o f the debt situation. Progress has also been made in
strengthening the institutional framework for debt management. The National Debt Management
Committee and the Technical Debt Management Committee have been meeting regularly to advise
the Minister of Finance on all proposals for new credit and to monitor the implementation of the
National Debt Management Strategy. There has also been improvement inthe coordination among



                                                 31

the various agencies involved in debt management, including the preparation of an inter-agency
work plan for the implementation of the National Debt Strategy, and disseminationof information
on the National Debt Strategy to ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) though various
channels.

110.    Concerning government revenue and taxation issues, the Tanzania Revenue Authority
( T U ) has made progress in implementing an ambitious programme of reform, including
advancing the establishment of a Taxpayer Intelligence Unit, roll-out o f the new Central Motor
Vehicle Registration System, strengthening of the Large Tax Payers Department, establishment of
66 one-stop tax payer centers, and modernization o f the computer system for customs
administration. TRA has carried out a review of tax laws to ensure consistency of measures
undertaken to remove tax exemptions. However, the update of the tax laws has been delayed by
the need to include all historical legal amendments, which were not included inthe first draft. In
addition, revised regulations for customs under the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) Act have been
prepared. These will be incorporated into the Special Economic Zones Act, which is planned to
supersede and incorporate the EPZ Act. Followingthe rationalization o f local taxes and levies to a
closed list in 2003, government i s now undertaking a comprehensive review of taxes and levies
that can be charged by local authorities. Government continues its efforts to enforce the upper
limit for cess on agricultural products to five percent of the farmgate price, although monitoring
and enforcement inall 115 district councils remain difficult.

111.    Monitorable actions under PRSC-4. Inthe area of debt management, the primary focus
will be on continued prudent debt contracting and management and close monitoring of the debt
situation. Regarding strengthening debt administration, the focus will be primarily on the
continuation o f actions pursued under PRSC-3, Le., approval o f the work plan for implementation
of the NDS and integration into the PFMRP, the distribution of circulars to all MDAs describing in
clear language the changes in debt contracting and management enacted inthe Loans, Guarantees
and Grants (Amended) Act, including correct debt contracting procedures, criteria for new loans
and punitive actions for flouters of the legislation, and the preparation o f an updated Debt
Sustainability Analysis. Continued progress on the implementation o f TRA's corporate plan, the
reform of local government taxation, as well as the completion o f consultations on the updated tax
laws are actions to strengthen tax administration.

112.    Expected results of theprogram. The key results of the macroeconomic reforms pursued
under PRSC-3 are (a) prudential debt contracting and management consistent with the annual
repayment and borrowing plan presentedto Parliament together with the annual budget and with
maintaining macro-economic stability and (b) an equitable and efficient tax system that supports
an increase inthe revenue to GDP ratio without impinging on economic growth.

113.    Monitoring indicators. The following indicators will be used to assess the effectiveness
of reforms inthis area:

    0   Net present value o f public external debt to exports (as an indicator of sustainability;
         information source: Debt SustainabilityAnalysis)

    0   Ratio between actual and budgeted:
             a. Debt service (domestic and foreign)
             b. Gross borrowing (domestic and foreign)

    0    The eight key performance indicators usedby the Tax Administration Project.



                                                 32

Public ExpenditureManagement
114.    Issues. The budget is a key instrument for the implementation of the MKUKUTA. An
effective budget process, which can translate MKUKUTA priorities into budgetary allocations and
execute these, i s critical to ensure that both domestic resources and program aid are used
effectively. At the central government level, Tanzania has established fairly robust systems for
budget allocation and execution as documented inthe annual PER external evaluation reports, IMF
monitoring, and the HIPC expenditure tracking exercise. While initial reform efforts have rightly
and successfully focused on strengthening budget management at the central level, budget
management at the local government level has received less attention and still displays
considerable weaknesses. The ongoing decentralization process which gradually gives greater
responsibility for the management of fiscal resources to local government makes reforms of the
intra-governmental transfer system and of budget management at the local level an important focus
of current reform efforts. Progress has also been made in integrating donor resources into
Government's budget management systems. However, an estimated 20 to 30 percent of donor
support is still provided to government outside the budgetary system.

115.    Reform strategy. The PER process is a key forum for discussing expenditure policy issues
and guidingthe reform strategy. Until2004105, the focus was on ensuring a non-declining trend in
allocations to the seven PRS priority sectors (education, health, water, roads, agriculture, judiciary
and HIVIAIDS) and commitment to financing the implementation of the PRS I.From 1998/99 to
2004105, the PRS sectors have seen rising allocations and the share of expenditure compared to the
total budget has also been monitored.        Since the PER External Evaluation o f May 2004,
Government has used the recommendations to further improve budget formulation and execution,
particularly those related to improving linkages between policy and financing. The development
of the MKUKUTA has involved the identification of a comprehensive and wide range of cross-
sectoral poverty reduction goals and strategies. The complex nature of the MKUKUTA has been
key to changing the approach for resource allocation. The need for a more comprehensive,
analytical tool for preparing the budget has arisen and has been developed to improve the MTEF
process. In addition to improving the use o f the MTEF requests from MDAs, the Government is
also aiming to improve the link between such requests, the BudgetGuidelinesresource allocations
and the preparation of annual budget estimates. This reform strategy i s being pursued in order to
promote a tight budget preparation process throughout the cycle. Given the aims to decentralize
the management of resources to local levels, the challenge over the mediumterm will be not only
to integrate the central but also the local government budget formulation process with the
MKUKUTA to ensure a Government-wide approach to tackling poverty reduction through the
budget. The efforts to continue with transparent information on budget execution continue to be
made in order to ensure all parts of the budget cycle are in line with policy.

116.    Progress under PRSC-3.          The approved budget for 2003104 was amended by a
Supplementary budget in February 2004. However, PRS sector budget estimates were not cut as
originally proposed in the reallocation warrants, in order to ensure implementation o f the PRS was
not hampered. Including reallocation warrants and items such as replenishment of the Strategic
Grain Reserve (agriculture sector) and wage adjustments, the total upward adjustment compared to
the original budget amounted to TSh 92.75 billion, with total PRS spending estimates at 45 percent
of the total budget including CFS and the actual outturn at 44 percent of the total budget. PRS
expenditure at itemlevel was also reportedto be consistent with budget estimates, but with foreign
financed development expenditure outturn being low due to the problem of capturing direct-to-
project funds, While capturing o f direct-to-project funds remains difficult, MDA reporting in
2003104 was significantly higher than reporting in2002103,



                                                 33

117.    PRS funding in04/05 totals TSh 1,480 billion, 32 percent higher than the actual outturn in
2003/04 and 44 percent of the budget including Consolidated Funds Services (CFS). The recurrent
budget for priority items in 2004/05 are 8.8 percent higher than the outturn in 2003/04, while the
development budget for priority items is 5.6 percent higher than the budget in2003/04. A detailed
analysis of public expenditure outturns during 2003/04 and the first half of 2004/05 i s provided in
the PEFARreport, which was presentedat the PER consultative meetinginMay 2005.

118.    The Budget Guidelines for 2005/06 - 2007/08 link the MKUKUTA closely with the
budget. In particular, MKUKUTA cluster strategies are being adopted by the relevant spending
votes as MTEF targets. The Government has developed a software - the Strategic Budget
Allocation System (SBAS) - to incorporate all MDA requests for the cross-sectoral MKUKUTA
strategies and other MTEF targets. The SBAS will also aggregate requests, facilitate macro-level
analysis and assist in strategically allocating resources down to vote and target level. Given the
changes in the budget and MTEF planningprocess in light of the MKUKUTA and development of
the SBAS, the Ministry o f Finance had to revise the initial plans for preparing an MTEF manual
for the seven PRS priority sectors.

119.    Government has already started implementation of, resource allocation through the
formula-based recurrent grant system for local government authorities (LGAs). In 2004/05, the
formula was used for personnel emoluments (PE) and other charges (OC) for the health and
education sectors and also for local development funds. Government has reviewed the problems
faced inapplying the formula in 2004/05 in order to ensure smoother application in 2005/06. The
Budget Guidelines 2005106 - 2007/08 incorporate a broad Government policy proposal for both
recurrent (the remaining sectors - agriculture, water and roads) and development grants.
Application of the formulae will follow in 2005/06.           Central government transfers to local
authorities continue to be published quarterly in newspapers and on the national website and
receipt of transfers on notice boards (by districts and sent to wards and villages by councillors).

120.    Monitorable Actions under PRSC-4. The budget for 2005/06 and the budget guidelines
for the period 2006/07 - 2008/9 are expected to reflect MKUKUTA priorities and support its
implementation. Furthermore, budget execution for 2004/05 and the first six month of 2005/06
should be consistent with the approved budget.

121.     Government i s also committed to the preparation o f an MTEF manual for planning
departments in line ministries based on an evaluation of the Budget Guidelines preparation
experience in 2004/05, the implementation o f the formula-based recurrent grant system for all
sectors and new development grant system, and the continued quarterly display of central
government transfers in newspapers and national website and receipt of transfers on notice boards
(by districts and sent to wards and villages by councillors).

122.     Expected Results of the Program. The key result of these actions is to ensure that
budgetary allocations and spending are consistent with the objectives and strategies set out inthe
MKUKUTA. Furthermore, the actions are also intendedto yield greater transparency in budget
formulation and execution both at the central and local government level.

123.     Monitoring Indicators. There are three broad indicators that are usedto monitor progress
inthis area. The first is spending on the PRSP priority sectors, which tries to capture the extent to
which outcomes of the budget process are consistent with the PRS. Recent discussions in
Tanzania have put in question the usefulness and possible moral hazard problems in monitoring
budgetary inputs to priority sectors instead of focusing primarily on outputs o f government


                                                   34

  activities and the integrityo f the budget process. Inaddition, since the definition o f priority sectors
  inthe PRS focuses primarily on social sectors and excludes important spending categories related
  to economic growth such as infrastructure expansion, operation, and maintenance, the usefulness
  o f focusing on expenditure shares o f the priority sectors has also been questioned. The second
  indicator thus focuses on the integrity o f the budget process by monitoring to which extent budgets
  are executed as approved. The share o f budgetary votes for which the deviation between budgeted
  and actual expenditures i s more than five percent captures this aspect o f public expenditure
  management. The last indicator i s the number o f benchmarks met inthe HIPC expenditure tracking
  assessment, as a composite indicator covering many aspects o f budget formulation, execution, and
  reporting.

  124.     The external evaluation under the annual PER process, which also includes an update o f
  the H P C expenditure tracking exercise, serves as the main monitoring tool inthis area. As part o f
  the PRBS annual and mid year review, a detailed budget review i s also carried out and it i s
  intended to mainstream PRBS monitoring requirements, both with respect to substance and timing,
  with the PER external evaluationfunction.


  Public Service Reform
   125.    Issues.    Despite good achievements in structural reforms in the mid-nineties, much
  remained to be done to translate these results into improved service delivery to the people o f
  Tanzania. Although substantial progress had been made in reducing the size o f the public service
  and implementing other cost containment measures, GOT felt that it needed to focus on the
  transformation o f the public service into an institution that will play a pivotal role in economic
  growth and reducing poverty. It believed that, under severe budgetary constraints, it was important
  to put in place a work force that would become more accountable for its performance. It is against
  that background that GOTlaunched a more comprehensive public service reform program in 2000.
  Since then the GOThas also moved to a programmatic approach to harmonize its policy dialogue
  with development partners. The PRSC supports this comprehensive program.

   126.    Reform Strategy. More specifically, the PRSC supports government's effort to improve
  the performance o f the public service by: (i)institutionalizing a strategic process to sustain the
   structural and institutional reforms; and (ii)strengthening the capacity for improved delivery of
  public services. The PRSC supports the government's long-term process o f sustainable capacity
  building and transformation o f the public service to more result-orientation, Under this process,
  the public service i s expected to improve its performance to strategically utilize the limited public
  resources available towards service improvements.                 Within this framework, key capacity


                                                         35

requirements are identified as are appropriate institutional incentives for performance.        Key
components o f the program include the acceleration o f pay reform, the installation o f performance
management in the MDAs, the monitoring o f performance and decentralization o f human
resources management closer to the people. A key constraint to public service performance i s low
public sector wages. This has led to difficulties in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified
staff. However, government recognizes that pay alone will not improve performance o f the public
service and that there i s a need for wage increases to be linked to improved performance. Thus
government i s institutionalizing in MDAs the implementation o f a range o f performance-focused
instruments including annual plans, performance budgets, service delivery surveys, and open
performance appraisal as part o f performance monitoring. Performance improvement i s at the core
o f GOT'Spublic sector reforms and its plan to build sustainable capacity in the public service. In
order to ensure that the program i s truly contributing to delivery o f better services, GOTis putting
inplace a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.

127.    Progress under PRSC-3. GOThas completed service delivery surveys (SDSs) for all
MDAs. Since it was the first time that Government carried out SDSs, the information generated
was o f uneven quality, and the results were in some cases not directly captured in the strategic
planning process. The information from SDSs has been summarized and incorporated into a report
on the State o f the Public Sector which was released to the public in June, 2005. This report will
present the overall progess in implementing the reform program including results o f the SDSs in
assessing the performance o f the public service in delivering services. The GOTi s re-assessing the
feedback mechanism it should be using to measure improvement in performance towards
delivering better services. Government has approved strategic plans and action plans and budgets
that are linked to the medium term expenditure framework for all MDAs. In addition the
Monitoring & Evaluation system developed to monitor performance in implementing the strategic
plans has been rolled out in all MDAs. However, as Government strives to link its planning and
budgeting system closely to achieving outcomes o f the Mkukuta, there seems to be a need to
rationalize the planning, budgeting and monitoring systems that are used within GOT,which could
mean fine-tuning the M&E system put in place to monitor the PSRP. Salary increases between
9.09 and 15 percent were in line with the pay reform targets and the approved budget for FY05.
The selective accelerated salary enhancements (SASE) continued to be granted in four pilot
MDAs, but government is exploring alternatives to the SASE scheme that are currently not
beneficiaries. A study i s underway to assess the scheme and to propose alternatives. In addition to
focusing on pay reform, GOThas also started paying some attention to the issue o f allowances. A
recent study showed that their number i s increasing and that more use o f allowances i s being made
rather than rationalizing remuneration. The approval o f the Amendment o f Public Service Act No.
8 o f 2002 by Parliament on November 10, 2004 reaffirmed that the authority for appointment,
confirmation, promotion and discipline o f public servants in the Local Government Service, other
than those for whom the appointing authority i s the President, shall be the Local Government
Authority (LGA) concerned.

 128.    Monitorable actions under PRSC-4. It is expected that government will continue to use
updated strategic plans, performance budgets and the performance monitoring system for all
MDAs.Inaddition, Government will review the findings ofthe SDSs and start the implementation
o f the emerging recommendations. A popular version o f SDSs will be disseminated in 2005 and
broader mechanism agreed to disseminate to the public feedback on the performance o f the public
service. Government remains committed to implementing pay enhancements consistent with the
approved budget for FY06, and the overall thrust o f the pay reform strategy; and to adopt an
alternative incentive mechanism to SASE for all MDAs. An important element o f the pay reform
strategy is to avoid the re-emergence o f allowances that distort the pay structure and incentive


                                                  36

systems. At present the gains made in reducingthe number o f allowances at the beginning o f the
program seem to be eroding. Based on the findings o f an ongoing review, government needs to
approve a process to reform and rationalize the public sector allowances regime.            Finally,
government will adopt regulations based on the amended Public Service Act to ensure effective
human resource autonomy for Local Government Authorities.

129.    Expectedresults of theprogram. The PRSC actions are expected to lead to the following
outcomes:

    e   Improved public service capacity and performance to support the delivery o f services;

    e   Improved clients' awareness o f what they can expect from the public service and increased
        satisfaction; and

    e   Enhanced professionalization o f the public service through improved motivation and
        retention o f staff.

130.    Monitoring indicators.

    e   M&E performance monitoring system functioning in all MDAs indicating increased
        outputs from the public service;

    e   PSRP M&E system harmonizedwith government's overall planning and budgeting-system;

    e   Pay enhancement in line with pay reform strategy targets;

    e   Specific recommendations on the rationalization and reform o f allowances available;

    e   Gradual but increased decentralization o f human resources management to local
        governments.


Public Financia1Management
131.    Background.        The 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review
(PEFAR) concludes that, generally Tanzania now has a sound system o f formal rules for financial
management and extensive training has taken place on the application o f the financial rules and
regulations. Most o f the recommendations contained inthe 2001 Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) report have been implemented or are included in the Public Financial
Management Reform Programme (PFMRP). The government has made progress in certain areas
o f accounting and auditing.      In terms o f appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks,
significant progress has been made to reduce the risk associated with the lack o f clear rules and
regulations. Also more useful information i s provided in the annual accounts. As a result the
general level o f fiduciary risk has declined.

132.    However these efforts now need to be translated into improved accountability and it i s
recognised that the process o f implementation o f new rules and ways o f working does take time
and does require changes in attitude, continued capacity building and widespread demand for
greater accountability.      Risks remain in terms o f (i)controls, compliance and sanctioning,
including enforcement o f procurement and payroll rules and procedures; (ii)   timeliness o f audited
financial information and effectiveness o f public reporting o f corruption; (iii)predictability o f
internal and external resources; (iv) low technical capacity; (v) effective independent oversight;
and (vi) timeliness and effectiveness o f legislative and public scrutiny. Tanzania does not have the
kindof legal framework that would facilitate and help to make public reporting o f corruption more
effective, i.e. there is no freedom o f information, whistleblower or QuiTam legislation.


                                                   37

133.      A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) carried out in 2003 undertook a
diagnostic review of all areas of public procurement systems inTanzania, including: the legislative
framework; the performance of regulatory functions; the enforcement regime; the capacity of
public sector institutions to conduct procurement; and the effects of corruption on procurement.
CPAR recommendations include: (a) separating the operational and regulatory functions of the
Central Tender Board and transforming the Central Tender Board into a regulatory authority
responsible for procurement policy and monitoring of public procurement; (b) fully decentralizing
procurement operations to MDAs; (c) establishing a new cadre of procurement specialists and a
system of certification for the same; (d) restructuring the composition of the District Tender
Boards to exclude councilors; (e) abolishing the Government Stores and introducing framework
contracts for common items that will be managed by a slim government agency; (f) abolishing the
Materials Management Board and establishing a new Procurement Professionals Body; (8)
publishinga weekly Procurement Journal where all procurement opportunities will be advertised;
(h) establishing a whistle-blowing mechanism to curb corruption inprocurement; and (i)            replacing
the systemofpre-shipmentinspection by destination inspection.

134.      Reform strategy. The CFAA, PEFARand the CPAR have identifiedkey actions that need
to be taken forward over the short and medium term.               The government is taking measures to
address some of these gaps and weaknesses. Government has developed and will update the
Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP)",                     which serves as a coordinating
framework for financial management reforms and associated technical assistance. It sets out a
methodology to mitigate fiduciary risk and strengthen the country's financial accountability
framework. The main output targets of the revised PFMRP have been sequenced to reflect the
logical progression from macroeconomic forecasting through revenue mobilization and resource
allocation to expenditure management and oversight. It recognizes the need to address constraints
to improve PFM across government and will take forward existing public financial management
reform initiatives and address outstanding weaknesses.                The PFMRP provides an analytical
underpinning for design o f the financial management component of the PRBS and in particular to
establish appropriate targets and output indicators/measures.

135.      The government's vision of the future for Local Government Authorities (LGAs) is well
articulated in the reform agenda, which is being implemented through Local Government Reform
Programme (LGRP). The LGRP includes activities on financial management reforms. The
functions, funding, reporting requirements, and other mandates of LGAs are clearly stated in the
various laws and regulations. Inevitably the process of change i s slow as the concept of local
participation is still in its formative stages in Tanzania. As of January 2004, 28 LGAs are fully
using the IFMS. The LGRP i s in the process of identifying an additional 28 LGAs to start
implementingthe IFMS.

136.      Progress under PRSC-3. Coordination of reforms through PFMRP. The PFMRP
basket funding arrangement i s currently in its first year of implementation. The coordination
framework has been established, but several obstacles remained. It has been agreed to measure
"progress in the implementation of the PFMRP" (a prior action) against the 3 following key
measurableundertakings:




loThe original PFMRPhadbeendeveloped in2000 as a conceptby SIDA but it was not yet completelydevelopedand
only partially fundedby SIDA.However,MoF was keento use the existingframeworkto avoid duplication with ongoing
efforts. The CFAA actionplan was thereforeusedas abasisto revise and improvethe PFMRP rather thandevelop a
completely new program.

    0    Monitoring indicatorsto be developed for each component, at output level.

137.     While the target date for achievement o f these key undertakings was set for 31 March,
these key undertakings were achieved by 30 April 2005,

138.     Financial accounting and reporting. The MoF and Civil Service Department are currently
preparing improvements to the payroll system whereby ministries will be required to enter payroll
changes themselves. While the foreign and local debt had been consolidated and also the debt data
is regularly reconciled with that o f the BOT(who runs a parallel system), the foreign and local debt
systems have not yet been integrated with the IFMS. Institutional responsibilities between the
various departments engaged in debt management had been agreed and an action plan was
prepared. It identifies the intermediate actions that need to occur, and timeframe for public debt to
be centralised within the Accountant General's Department. The entire database is anticipated to
be transferred from BOTto the Accountant General's Department by endJune 2007. Tax and non-
tax revenues are now captured in the IFMS. The implementation o f the IFMS disaster recovery
pladsite was delayed because o f the need to re-tender owing to there being an insufficient number
o f eligible tenders in the first instance.    However, the procurement i s now underway and
implementation i s expected from next fiscal year. The government planned to have at least 30
percent o f all financial management positions filled with qualified staff -only around 15 percent
of positions have been filled. Delays have been experienced in the approval o f the recruitment o f
new graduates by PO-PSM.

139.     Internal audit.    Relevant training materials have been developed (based on the new
Manual) and the required internal audit training had been provided by local training institutions. In
addition, the new proposed internal audit structures have been agreed with CSD.                  Audit
Committees have been established in 55 out o f 68 MDAs and most are meeting regularly. Also,
the Accountant General has trained almost all o f these committees' members. The minutes o f the
audit committees are received and monitored by the Accountant General's Department, with 95%
o f MDAs committees meeting quarterly. With respect to substantive follow-up o f internal and
external audit findings, quality varies -some deal with substance, other with terms o f reference.

 140.    External audit. Sixteen o f the positions in the NAO that should be filled by suitably
qualified CPAs are so filled, setting the NAO well on the way to meeting a target o f 15% by
November 2005. The Controller and Auditor General (CAG) was unable to proceed with the
electronic audit o f accounts via access to IFMS because o f the late arrival o f necessary technical
assistance. The CAG was to submit the audit report for fiscal year ending 30 June 2003 to
Parliament during the June/July 2004 budget session, but was 5 months late because o f capacity
and administrative problems.

 141.    Local Government Authorities. The Local Authority Financial Memorandum should be
amended in order to ensure consistency o f legal requirements at the central and local levels -
consistency between the Public Finance Act, Public Procurement Act, their related regulations on
the one hand, and the Local Government Finance Act and the Memorandum on the other. While a



                                                  39

draft Memorandum has been developed, it has not yet been endorsed by the stakeholders or
approved by the Minister for Local Government. With regard to preparationfor the eventual roll-
out o f the IFMS to additional LGAs, the Accountant General's Department has begun training
fresh graduates on the IFMS, and sponsored training in various institutions in and outside the
country in the areas o f information technology, accounting and materials management for several
staff members who will be posted in LGAs. Increased effort has also been put on strengthening
support systems for the implementation o f the IFMS. A Systems Development Unit for LGAs
housed in the Accountant General's Department i s now in place -25 specialists were trained in
the EPICOR software and had been deployed to the zones starting July 01, 2004. Other support
includes defining a chart o f accounts for LGAs, and supervision o f 5 LGAs support zones. Also,
the extension o f IFMS to an additional 18 local authorities was not achieved because o f delays in
the procurement process. All the councils are now submittingtheir audit reports to the National
Audit Office. The statutory requirement for submission (3 months after fiscal year-end), is also
largely observed -only some 10 councils failed to comply.

142.     Procurement. A new Public Procurement Act (2004) was passed by Parliament on
November 12, 2004 and assented by the President in February 2005.       The Government gazetted
the new Public Procurement Regulations (Goods, Works, non-consultant Services, and Disposal o f
Public Procurement; and Selection and Employment o f Consultants) on April 15, 2005. Following
effectiveness and operationalization o f the new Public Procurement Act, effective from May 1,
2005:

         0   The Central Tender Board (CTB) ceased to exist and in its place the Government
             established a Public Procurement RegulatoryAuthority; and

         0   All MDAsbegunto carry out procurement functions within their respective approved
             budgets.

143.     By May 15, 2005, all Accounting Officers and Chief Executive Officers o f the Parastatal
Organizations were asked to constitute their Tender Boards in accordance with the requirements o f
the new Act.

144.     These reforms are consistent with the recommendations o f the CPAR and expected to lead
to enhanced accountability and efficiency inthe government procurement process.

 145,    Monitorable Actions under PRSC-4. Effective implementation of the PFMRP. While
significant strides have been made, there remain various bottlenecks to effective implementation.
Most o f these had been discussed with GOTduring a Joint Steering Committee meeting held in
April 2005. It is important that these are addressed over the next year to ensure that the PFMRP
offers a credible basis for driving forward coordinated and sequenced P F M reform and is
effectively integrated into GOT'Sroutine planning processes and operational work.              Key
undertakings include: (1) the work plan and budget, and reports on the status o f progress against
them, will be distributed to development partners for discussion in JSC meetings; and (2) M o F and
NAO will incorporate PFMRP activities into their strategic plans.

 146.    Financial accounting and reporting. The MoF and Civil Service Department will pilot
improvements to the payroll system whereby at least five ministries will be required to enter
payroll changes themselves. A wireless radio link between the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA)
and the Accountant General's Office, allowing the automatic capturing o f revenue information in
IFMS, is in place but has yet to be activated because TRA has not completed certain connectivity
matters. It i s expected that all will be in place by November 2005. Other non-tax revenue such as


                                                   40

fees and penalties etc. collected by MDAs are captured. Installation of the disaster recovery
system by Softech Consultants was completed and preparations for trials are underway. The
revision of the MOF organisational structure (reflecting legislative and technologicalhystems
changes in accordance with the Public Finance Act) will not be achieved and will be moved to
2006. There seems to be resistance to make these changes in the MOF. Also it appears to be a
lengthy process that causes delays. Inaddition, the government plans to have around 30 percent of
all financial management positions filled with qualified staff. Progress inthis area i s inextricably
linked to the pace of pay reforms ingovernment.

147.    Internal audit. It was originally envisagedthat Audit Committees would provide evidence
of substantive follow-up of internal and external audit findings, showing that civil servants are
sanctioned for financial mismanagement. However, this action depends on the GOThaving
regulations for sanctioning in place. Preparation of penalties and surcharge regulations is at an
advanced stage and it is expected that they will be finalized byNovember 2005.

148.    External audit. Based on its developed computerisation strategy, the NAO will procure
and install computer equipment and train its staff to allow piloting of audits through IFMS-this is
a proposed prior action for PRSC4. Also, the NAO plans to adopt modem audit techniques which
go hand inhand with the computerisation strategy (moving from the transaction audit approach to
a more risk-based and systems approach). The CAG plans to submit to parliament the audit report
for fiscal year ending 30 June 2004 duringthe June-August 2005 budgetary session of Parliament.
This would reduce the time lag by 8 months and allow the Office to move towards compliance
with the statutory requirement of nine months. Finally, of the approximately 450 staff on the
establishment of the NAO, it is expected that about 15% of these positions (originally set at 20%)
will be filled with suitably qualified staff byNovember 2005.

149.    Local Government Authorities. Work on harmonising the legal inconsistencies between
Financial Regulations (for central government) and Financial Memorandum (for local government)
has begun but will be concluded in future periods. The extension of IFMS to more Local
Authorities had been delayed; the procurement is in progress whereby the tendering and bid
evaluation has been concluded. Meanwhile the plan for the roll-out of IFMShas been reviewed. It
is expected that the EPICOR-based IFMS will be piloted in another 28 councils sometime in 2006.
Training of the relevant staff will begin in2005 after installation of the equipment, followed by the
support from the 23 zonal support groups which are beingtrained simultaneously. In addition, 18
Local Authorities, which were part of the initial roll-out plan, require to be subjected to
rectifications and in some cases redoing so that they can perform better.

150.    Procurement. After decentralizing procurement and establishing the PPRA, the PPRA
will continue with the implementation of the other CPAR recommendations within the PFMRP
framework. In the context o f this, the Government has undertaken to complete the following
actions by March 2006: (a) ensuring that the PPRA is fully staffed; (b) completing preparationof a
capacity development strategy; (c) establishing organization structures and staffing levels of
Procurement Management Units (PMus); and (d) establishing a procurement cadre in the public
service.

 151.    No action has yet been initiated in the areas of staffing the PPRA, establishment of
procurement cadre, and establishment of organization structures and staffing levels of procurement
managementunits by Public Service Management (PSM) because defunct CTB was fully engaged
with preparation for operationalization of the new Act. Consideringthat the defunct CTB was also
carrying out its operation mandate o f approving contracts, its capacity was severely strained. Now


                                                  41

that the Act is operational, the PPRA will have adequate capacity to expedite implementation of
procurement reforms, which are being implemented in the framework of the PFMRP. There is
progress regarding development of strategy for procurement capacity. Selection o f the consultant
to undertake this assignment i s at advancedstage.

152.    Expected results of theprogram. Linkage betweenthe PRBS and PFMRP is achieved by
ensuring that the following proposed PRBS outputs and outcomes are consistent with the main
objectives of the PFMRP. Over the course of the PRBS program, Tanzania expects to, inter alia,
achieve the following:

    0   Improve completeness and quality of financial information, accounting records and
        reporting;

    0   Effective cash planning & managementmechanism;

    0   Accountability o f AOs and Audit Committees improved;

    0   Role, responsibilities of MOF and accounting function in line ministries professionalized;

    0   Timely submission of government annual accounts to parliament.

    0   Increase number o f clean audit reports;

    0   External audit capacity developed to enhance quality and timeliness o f reporting;

    0   Enhance the independence of the NAO;

    0   Financial management capacity at Local Government. level enhanced to sufficiently carry
        out responsibilities;

    0   More efficient and transparent procurement of goods, works, and services;

    0   Better value for money; and

    0   Harmonized procurement procedures throughout the government.

 153.   Monitoring indicators. Specific quantitative monitoring indicators under this component
include:
        NAO issues its report on central government for the fiscal year ended 30 June 2004 intime
         for the Financial Budgetary Session of Parliament which will be in June 2005 thru to
        August 2005. Audit reports for local government authorities are submitted in a timely
         manner (within the statutory requirements).

         Audit reports for central government MDAs shows an improvement in Public Accounts
         Committee recommendations being followed up - fewer cases o f audit queries carried
         forward from year to year.
         Pilot changes to the payroll system (whereby ministries will enter payroll changes in at
         least 5 ministries).
         Professionally qualified staff has filled 15% of revisedaudit positions inNAO.
         30 percent o f all financial management positions in MDAs should be filled with qualified
         staff. For N A O the target is proposed at 20 percent (up from the present level of about 5
         percent).
         EPICOR-based IFMS i s introduced and operational in another 28 councils (including
         redoinghectification o f 18 not achieved inprevious year).

         Time for processing international and national competitive tenders reducedby 2 weeks.



                                                   42

        Compliance (as determined by procurement audits) with Procurement Regulations of
        contracts reviewed, improved by 10%.


Anti-Corruption Activities
154.    Issues. The 2002 Report on the State of Corruption in Tanzania, commissioned by the
Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB) and carried out by ESRFRACEIT, indicates that the level
of corruption has declined somewhat between 1996 and 2002 with some variations among sectors.
Since 1996, considerable groundwork has been done on the institutional framework (the National
Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan--NACSAP, Public Finance Act o f 2001 and Public
Procurement Act o f 2001) and in raising the awareness of the public on the need to fight
corruption. However, the perception of the public is that the decline in the level of corruption has
at best been modest. The report cited the incidence o f experiences with corruption as highest
within health services followed by police, business licensing, the judiciary, tax authorities,
education and public utilities. Therefore muchremains to be done to actually curb corruption.


Paper - Vision 2025 states that, inter alia: "Tanzania cherishes good governance and the rule of
155.    Reform strategy. Tanzania's vision, contained in the Government's Development Policy

law ... and seeks to ensure that its people are empowered with the capacity to make leaders and
public servants accountable." Inorder to realize this vision the Government launched the National
Framework on Good Governance (1999) that elaborates the priority areas for reforms, which now
include the Public Service Reform Programme (PSRP), the Public Financial Management Reform
Programme (PFMRP), the Legal Sector Reform Programme (LSRP) and the Local Government
Reform Programme (LGRP). In addition to these reforms that seek to plug the loopholes for
corrupt activities, NACSAP provides a cross cutting anti-corruption strategy that permeates all the
key reforms. The LSRP medium-term strategy was launched on March 22, 2005 with high level
commitment to implement fully the vision "timelyjustice for all".

156.    Specifically NACSAP calls for coordinated steps to achieve the following:

    0   Comprehensive anti-corruption legislation.

    0   Identification o f areas of government activities most prone to corruption and redress them.

    0   Identification of legal and administrative corruption remedies that provide adequate
        deterrence.

    0   Provision of a creative partnership between government and the civil society including the
        private sector, professionaland religious organizations infighting corruption.

157.    Progress under PRSC-3. Limited progress has been made on the implementation of the
seven PAF actions on resource leakage and improving accountability for the period under review.
Progress has been made in reviving dialogue between the Government and development partners.
A High Level Government Governance Team composed of Permanent Secretaries of the Central
Government Ministries has been established to meet regularly with development partners and
government efforts to combat corruption will be a standing agenda item. However, as of now,
there has been limited interaction.      The latest report on anti-corruption has been published,
reflecting actions by MDAs to sanction officers for corrupt activities. A report on the review of
Anti-Corruption legislation has been discussed by stakeholders. However, so far progress is
limited in accelerating the revision of the legislation and in getting it approved. Government has
opted not to do a highprofile launch of the State of Corruption report, although it has been broadly
disseminated.     The Good Governance Coordination Unit (GGCU) has been strengthened by


                                                 43

recruiting a Planning Officer and an Accountant. So far the GGCU has lacked the clout and
visibility to play a significant coordination role. A mechanism for complaints and grievances has
not yet been fully established. However, a decision has been made to pilot the instrument in a
number of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).Draft guidelines for Local Government
Authorities (LGA) Anti-Corruption Action Plans have been published and LGAs have used them
to prepare plans for 2005/06.

158.     Monitorable actions under PRSC-4, Government will seek to have more frequent regular
dialogue on its anti-corruption efforts with development partners through the High Level
Governance Team. Based on the quarterly reports, GGCU will monitor progress on actions taken
vis-a-vis corruption in MDAs and LGAs. In addition, GGCU will bring to the attention of
responsible authorities key issues requiring their attention. For now, the reports are not being used
to improve decision-making in the areas related to the anti-corruption effort. GOTwill present to
DPs a detailed and concrete description of the steps that need to be taken for the repeal and re-
enactment of Anti-Corruption legislation to be passed by Parliament by April 2006. In addition,
Government will take action on the recommendations identified in the evaluation report -
Strengthening of Capacities to Combat Corruption in Tanzania and agreed during a consultative
meeting with the development partners. PO-PSM will establish Ministerial Ethics Committees to
deal with corruption, complaints and grievances and pilot the mechanism to deal with complaints
and grievances in 6 MDAs. Finally, funding for the LGA Action Plans will be included in the
2005/06 budget to enable their implementation.

159.     Expected results of theprogram. The programis expected to yield the following results:

     0   MDAswill show improvementintheir fight against corruption;
     0   Civil society, media and private sector actively engaged inthe fight against corruption;
     0   Joint efforts from the various parts of the public service will show positive results;
     0   There will be an increased number of complaints adequately addressed;
     0   LGAswill improvetheir performance inthe fight against corruption at local level.

 160.    Monitoring indicators. Quarterly Monitoring Reports on NACSAP implementation
contain quantitative and qualitative data, particularly in the areas of monitoring and controlling
public procurement, public finance and legal and judicial processing, that will help assess
progress. GGCUwill provide information on managerial action taken by MDAs as a result of their
monitoring. It is also expected that LGAs will have in place action plans and will prepare
quarterly reports.


Management of DevelopmentAid Resources
 161,    Issues. Official development assistance finances more than 40 percent o f government
expenditures in Tanzania and the efficient management of aid resources thus plays an important
role in the implementation o f the PRS. The management of aid provided by a large number of
donors, each with it own procedures and monitoring and reporting requirements, i s a formidable
task for government, given its very limited and already overstretched capacities. Improved aid
management and reduced transactions costs in the utilization and delivery of foreign aid are
 spelledout inthe PRS as key elements o f creatingan enablingenvironment for its implementation.

 162.    Reform Strategy. Tanzania has put inplace two complementary processesto enhance the
management of aid resources. The first i s the TAS process, which serves as the platform for
 dialogue between government and donors on enhancing aid effectiveness. The TAS lays out



                                                   44

principles for the effective provision and use o f foreign aid, including a move towards sector wide
approaches and general budget support. Under PRSC-1, government finalized a TAS action plan
which sets out concrete steps for improving aid management. The second element o f Tanzania's
aid reform strategy has the PER process at its core. Its objective i s to foster more comprehensive
integration o f donor support into government processes and in particular into the budget. The
PRSC program supports this strategy and monitors progress in the development and
implementation o f the TAS as well as progress in integrating official development assistance inthe
budget.

163.    Progress under PRSC-3. There has been further improvement in the forecasting and
integration o f external finances into the national budget. This again resulted in an improved level
o f coverage o f development partner funded projects and programmes and external finance
reflected in the development budget has increased from TShs 302,272 million in FY 2001/02 to
TShs 667,349 million in FY 2003104 and TShs 857,885 million in FY 2004/05. The second TAS
Annual Implementation Report has been published covering the second year in the roll out o f the
TAS from July 2003 untilJune 2004.

164.    Monitorable actions under PRSC-4. Government attaches high priority to implementing
the TAS and integrating donor assistance into the budget. Actions to be implemented under
PRSC-4 include continued efforts to integrate projections o f external resource flows into the
budget, to fully operationalize the system for both MDAs and LGAs to report on levels o f direct
external assistance budgeted and disbursed, to integrate data on levels o f direct foreign assistance
from MDA quarterly reports to the budget department into the External Finance database, and to
issue a 3"d annual TAS implementation report.

165.    Expected results. The key result inthis area is the better integration o f donor assistance in
the budget, which in turn would facilitate the coherence between government and donor financed
expenditures and thus enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in the use o f domestic and foreign
funds.

166.    Monitoring indicators. Two indicators will be usedto assess progress inthis area, namely
the share of official development assistance in the form o f project and basket donor support
captured in the budget estimates and the ratio between donor assistance shown in the budget
estimates and the amount o f donor assistance captured in the appropriation accounts. The TAS
implementation report and the PER external evaluation monitor these indicators. In recent years,
these indicators have shown steady improvement with the first indicator increasing from 68
percent in FYOO to 107 percent in FY04 and the second indicator displaying an increase from 31
percent inFYOOto 72 percent inFY04.

Environmental Sustainability
167.     Issues.   The primary issues relate to Tanzania's high resource dependence, the close
linkages between poverty and environment, and government's ability to address these within a
modern institutional framework that concurrently promotes environmental protection and
improved livelihoods, especially among the most vulnerable populations. The poor in Tanzania
are heavily dependent on the environment both for income generation and consumption. There is,
however, insufficient understanding of how the positive aspects of poverty/environment and
growth linkages can be pragmatically applied to: (a) support sustainable livelihoods; and (b)
ensure that benefits of high growth sectors reach the poor.

168.     A weak institutional framework for coordination and limited governmental capacity for
monitoring, compliance and enforcement pose serious challenges to broad based growth. The
absence of appropriate governance regimes, for example in fisheries and forestry, leads to
significant loss o f revenues in resource rents. Overexploitation due to weak monitoring and
enforcement leads to unsustainable harvesting and open access situations. Lack of information
and data of markets, and environmental externalities lead to mispricing and revenues that fall short
of their potential.

169.     Reform strategy. The PRSC supports government's efforts to address these issues through
a three-pronged strategy involving (a) mainstreaming of environmental concerns into the PRS, the
budget process, and sectoral policies; (b) improved understanding o f poverty-environment
linkages, and options for reducing vulnerability of the poor; and (c) strengthened institutional
capacity to integrate environmental assessment (EA) procedures into sectoral strategies and
policies and specific activities at the district and local level. Many o f these efforts were spurred by
the National Environmental Action Plan (1994) and the National Environmental Policy (NEP)
adopted in 1997. The goals o f the NEP are to ensure sustainability, security and equitable use of
resources. In December 2002, the Cabinet approved an Institutional and Legal Framework for
Environmental Management Program (ILFEMP), which provides the basis for Environmental
Impact Assessment (EM), cross-sectoral coordination,                                 and integration of environment
management into local government planning processes. A number of key sector policies and
strategies: forestry, agriculture, fisheries and mining reflect an increasing focus on internalizing
environmental sustainability objectives and empowering the poor for improved resource
management.

170.     Progress under PRSC-3. The Environmental Management Act (EMA) has been approved
by Parliament. The passage o f the law was carried out with an intensiveconsultation process, thus



                                                   46

ensuring the ownership o f the law by a range o f stakeholders. An initial needs assessment for
implementation the EMA was conducted as part o f the first PER on environment, and plans are
underway to conduct a detailed assessment under the second PER. A draft Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) training manual has been prepared, and draft EL4 guidelines are in place. Plans
are underway for transforming the guidelines into regulations.        Government also prepared
guidelines on mainstreaming environment for the PRS Review, and guidelines for the
implementation o f MKUKUTA are under preparation. In addition, a report on economic
instruments has been prepared and a report on poverty-environmentindicators has been submitted
as an input to the Poverty Monitoring System (PMS) review. A draft Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) o f PRSC has also been prepared.

171.    Monitorable actions under PRSC-4.          Government i s committed to commence the
implementation o f EMA to achieve the MKUKUTAtargets with a focus on following actions:


    0   Preparation and implementation o f a capacity building programme to strengthen
        institutions for environmental management, and compliance with EMA commitments;

    0   Integration o f environmental planning into local and sector plans to achieve MKUKUTA
        targets and EMA commitments;

     0  Implementation o f environmental economic and fiscal instruments;

     0  Waste management and pollution control strategies and measures inplace;

     0  Environment assessment (EM and SEA) regulations finalised and operational; and

     0  Setting up o f poverty and environment monitoring system, preparation o f state o f
        environment report, and environmental awareness and information programme.

 172.   Expected results of theprogram. The actions implemented under the PRSC program are
expected to lead to five key medium term outcomes, namely:

     0  Improved institutional capacity for environmental assessments (including environmental
        impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments) and their integration into
        sector and district plans;

     0  Harmonized environmental management and increased compliance with environmental
        impact assessments;

     0  Increased environmental information will contribute to the effectiveness o f the poverty
        monitoring system and strengthen the feedback required for the PRS;

     0  Enhanced knowledge and awareness about environment and poverty linkages to ensure the
        sustainability o f poverty reduction and environmental management efforts, and reduce the
        vulnerability o f the poor to environmentalrisk; and

     0  Improved understanding o f the role and use o f economic instruments in environmental
        management.

 173.   Monitoring indicators. Specific quantitative targets to be reached by 2005 under this
 component o f the PRSC (which are commitments under the EMA) include:

     0   40 percent o f sectors with environmental units;


                                                 47

     0   40 percent o f the districts have officers with environmental functions;

     0   30 percent o f the designated environmental officers at the district levels trained;

     0   Committees o f environment established in 30 percent o f the districts inthe country; and

     0   Activities underway to implement 50 percent o f obligations under international
         environmental conventions and agreements.


                          VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
174.     The assessment o f the poverty and social impact o f the measures proposed by the
MKUKUTA and supported by the PRSC is carried out in the context o f Tanzania's poverty
monitoring system. In addition, the Bank supports the preparation o f PSIAs to inform the design
o f specific reform efforts, such as the reform o f crop boards or o f the local tax system.

SUPERVISION
175.     Monitoring arrangements. Tanzania has established a comprehensive monitoring system,
which covers outcome, output, process, and input indicators.             This system comprises three
interrelated tiers.   The poverty monitoring system focuses on the measurement o f impact,
outcomes, and proxy indicators. Sector programs, such as those for education and health, focus on
the tracking o f output indicators with adequate monitoring mechanisms in place. The PER-MTEF
processes focus on inputs, with an emphasis on budget allocation and budget execution. Inorder to
strengthen domestic accountability, the PRSC supports regular reporting to the public in all areas
covered by the PRSC.

176.    In the context o f the PRSC and the PRS, outcome, output, and input indicators provide
direct information on the status o f poverty in all its dimensions. Monitoring o f these indicators i s
based on a broad range o f surveys and administrative data systems identified in the poverty
monitoring master plan.      The Poverty and Human Development Report (PHDR), which i s
published bi-annually, consolidates poverty measures from various sources, and provide analysis
o f poverty trends and underlying factors. Sector development reviews are a key monitoring
mechanisms for outputs at the sectoral level, and the PRGF reviews and the quarterly macro-
financial developments report will be the key sources for the assessment o f the macroeconomic
situation. Progress inpublic expenditure management covering both improvements in systems and
enhanced allocative and operational efficiency in the use o f inputs will be tracked by the annual
PERs.

177.    An additional dimension o f the monitoring framework covers the government-donor
relationship in monitoring progress on PRSC objectives, such as enhanced local ownership o f the
development process, participation by all stakeholders, and efficiency o f aid delivery mechanisms.




                                                     49

This dimension is reviewed via an annual report of the findings o f the independent monitoring
group" for the implementationof the TAS.

178.     Supervision and subsequent PRSCs. Supervision and preparation of the subsequent
credits and grants will take place in close collaboration with other donors and be consistent with
the PRS review mechanism. For most of the program areas, supervision and dialogue will be
carried out on a continuous process in the context of sectoral or thematic programs. This includes
the PER process, the PFMRP, the PSRP, the ASDP, the BEST program and sectoral programs. A
joint PRBS-PRSC review will be conducted annually for an overall assessment of progress made
in each of the program areas. In addition, the achievement of PRSC targets will be assessed
annually in the context of the PRS review that will document the progress made in the PRS
implementation and analyze the outcomes of reforms.                The reform program sets out clear
quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for three years. The PRSC targets are fully consistent
with the PRS. Given satisfactory progress, Tanzania's reform program will be supported through
subsequent PRSCs under the programmatic lending framework, subject to the approval of the
Board of ExecutiveDirectors.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
 179.    Foreign exchange. The safeguards assessment of the Bank of Tanzania (BOT),which was
completed by the IMF on December 5, 2003, found that, while the bank had a relatively strong
internalcontrol environment,some vulnerabilities existed, notably in the externalaudit and
financial reporting areas. In order to mitigate these vulnerabilities, staff recommended that the
BOTshould: (i)     contract annual external audits that are conducted in accordance with International
 Standards on Auditing (ISA); (ii)adopt International Accounting Standards (IAS) as the financial
reporting framework; (iii)       establish a formal process of reconciling accounting data to the program
data reported to the Fund; (iv) publish the full audited financial statements on a timely basis,
within five months of the financial year's end; and (v) adopt an audit charter for the internal audit
function to strengthen audit methodologies and procedures. The 2003/04 financial statements
were audited by a local auditor, TAC, using ISA standards, though TAC is not itself fully ISA
 compliant and the statements were publishedwith a brief delay. To ensure full ISA and I A S
 compliance inthe audit of the 2004/05 financial statements, the authorities have selected Deloitte
 and Touche, Johannesburg to conduct a joint audit with the TAC. The BOTwill hold a new three
year external ISA/IAS compliant audit tender by early September covering the 2005/06 and
 2007/08 financial years. The BOTboard has adopted I A S as its financial reporting framework, and
 a reconciliationprocess was recently adopted.

 180.    Budget resources. In depth assessment of Tanzania's public financial management and
 procurement systems have been carried out through a CFAA in 2001 and a CPAR in 2003 as well
 as in the context of the annual Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability reports (PEFAR).
 The "Public Expenditure Management Country Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) - Tanzania"
 prepared in2004 concludedthat over the last three years Tanzania has made significant progress in
 the PEM reform process and that Tanzania meets 11 of the 16 benchmarks, which places
 Tanzania's PEMamongthe best performingin Sub-SaharanAfrica.

 181.     The assessment also identifiedareas where progress is yet to be made. The coverage
 of fiscal reports continues to be limited to the central government. Fiscal reporting needs to cover

the GFS definition o f the general government sector, Le., including both central, and local
governments, as well as all government operations whether or not they are funded through the
budget. External audit has not been sufficiently strengthened and delays in the submission o f
external audit reports still persist. The ongoing work on internal audit needs to be continued to
make it effective. The procurement system does not meet the benchmark due to weak enforcement
and limited accountability in the current system. Also, a Fiduciary Risk Assessment Report issued
by the Departmentfor InternationalDevelopment(U.K.)inMay 2004 concludedthat: "The overall
problems however remain those o f a weak fiduciary contract between citizens and the state,
inadequate domestic revenue collection, limited delivery o f public goods, inadequate monitoring,
inefficient capacity, non-compliance, lack o f enforcement, and inadequate oversight". The PRSC
contains a strong focus on government's efforts to address residualweaknesses in the areas
of internal and external audit as well as procurement. A Public Finance Management Reform
Program i s in place to ensure sustained improvements in Tanzania's public expenditure
management system.

DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING
182.    Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the UnitedRepublic o f Tanzania. A single-
tranche credit o f SDR 103.8 million (US$l50 million equivalent) would be made available upon
credit effectiveness, anticipated for September 2005. The closing date o f the operation would be
June 30, 2006. It is envisaged that there will be a further single-tranche, annual PRSC to support
the implementation o f the PRS in FY07.

183.    Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements. The proposed credit will follow
the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to
any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit i s approved by
the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the credit will be deposited at the request o f the
Borrower by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the
Bank o f Tanzania.     The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Credit into said
account, an equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a
manner acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in
the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget management system. If
the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Credit
Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount
equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request
shall be cancelled. The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finance.

 184.    The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary assurance:

     0   Foreign reserve account. The GOTwill acknowledge receipt to IDA o f the money into the
         foreign reserve account and the crediting o f this amount in local currency to the Tanzania
         Government Consolidated Fund Account. While no external audit will be required, it i s
         expected that the confirmation o f receipt will be countersigned by the Accountant General
         and the Controller and Auditor General.

     0   Public (government) accounts. The Controller and Auditor General is required by law to
         produce hidher annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months o f
         the financial year-end. IDA will have access to those accounts.

         Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
185.     PRSC-3 falls under OP 8.60 and is no longer subject to environmental safeguards. As the
PRSC focuses primarily on institutional reforms, there are no direct significant effects on
Tanzania's environment, forests, and other natural resources. In addition, the PRSC supports
reforms of Tanzania's legal and institutional framework for environmental management,
environmental impact assessments, and strategic environmental assessments (SEAS).An SEA has
been prepared. Reviews of the environmental impact of PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 included (i)       a review
of supported sectors within the SECAC, (ii)   consideration of potential policy reforms under the
SECAC; and (iii) assessment o f the ability of the government to address any impacts within
                   an
these sectors using existing mechanisms, or using mechanisms developed internally within this
particular SECAC. The assessments concluded that: (i) policy reforms supported under the
                                                           the
PRSC-1 and 2 would have no deleterious environmental impact, or their impacts could be
addressedwithin the existing SEA processesthat have been developed under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2
and will continue to be developed under PRSC-3; (ii)   sectoral activities to be supported generally
under the roads and agriculture initiatives may involve some Category "B" activities, but
guidelines developed under PRSC-1 and 2 for addressing these are being adequately implemented
by Government, and will continue to be monitored and developed to improve their effectiveness in
PRSC-3, Some elaboration on these points is provided below.

186.     In an effort to mainstream the environmental sustainability dimension into the PRSC
process, the Bank has undertaken various analyses with the objective to identify linkages between
key macro and structural reforms policies and the environment. This analysis, undertaken under
PRSC-1 and 2, identifies measures at both national and local government levels to reduce poverty
and enhance environmental sustainability of policy reforms.          The analysis concluded that
environment and poverty are linked in three major ways: (a) poverty reduction programs should
not damage the resource base and the environment of which poor depend for their livelihoods (b)
improving environmental conditions can help to reduce poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor
growth; and (c) mitigating measures may be necessary as part of policy dialogue.

187.     Working with the government and other development partners, the analysis identified a
number strategic entry points for mainstreaming key issues of the poverty-environment nexus in
Tanzania into PRSC process and ongoing policy reforms in general. This included inter alia.
further support for EA activities, a comprehensive environmental review of all taxes and levies
associated with the agricultural sector, and increased attention to removing land tenure
uncertainties.   Specifically, the Vice President's Office and the National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC) have been supporting the development and implementation of
various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially in roads and agriculture), and have more
recently pursued procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental assessment to permit
mitigation of any adverse environmental impacts while taking advantage of potential synergies
between poverty reduction and environmental protection efforts. In this regard the PRSC-2 and
PRSC-3 reform agenda has specific actions to be implementedby the Government of Tanzania as
part of the environmental component.




                                                 52

PARTICIPATORY ASPECTS
188.    The PRSC is grounded invarious participatoryprocesseswhich are critical indefining the
reform agenda and monitoring its implementation. The reform agenda supported by the PRSC
derives from Tanzania's PRSP, which has been developed through a consultative process inwhich
Government sought inputs and feedback from a wide array o f stakeholders representing all levels
of society and all regions of Tanzania. Similarly, Tanzania's Poverty Monitoring System also is
open to inputs from insideand outside government.

189.    Aside from the MKUKUTA, the Government of Tanzania carries out wide ranging
consultations on most policy reforms and many of the policy areas covered by the PRSC are
underpinned by sectoral or thematic processes that are open to stakeholders from civil society,
NGOs, academic and research institutes, the private sector, and the donor community. This
includes the PER process as a regular forum for dialogue on public expenditure, financial, and
macro-economic management, the Investor Round Table and the Tanzania National Business
Council for government -private sector dialogue, and the environment working group. Inaddition,
Tanzania has also put in place a process for an independent monitoring of the government - donor
relationship, which also covers the PRSC.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
190.    Because the proposed PRSC-3 supports the implementation of Tanzania's PRS, there are
two closely interrelated and overlapping sets of risks. The first set covers all risks that may
interfere with the achievement of the objectives of the PRS. The second i s narrower and concerns
risks to the successful implementation of actions covered in the PRSC policy matrix. The
following risks can be identified at this stage:

    0   Election cycle.    As the next round of elections approaches in 2005, concerns about the
        durability of commitment to reforms will mount. To mitigate this risk, government has
        implemented legal and institutional changes to underpin its reforms. This will reduce the
        risk of policy reversals and root these reforms more deeply in both attitude and practice.
        Inspiringinvestors' belief that the changes made are durable is a major challenge in scaling
        up investor response. An important means to sustain reform and limit the possibility of
        policy reversals is the ongoing transition from a conditionality-based approach to reforms, to
        the building of domestic constituencies for reform-which        provides a more durable and
        secure basis for ensuring the sustainability o f reform efforts.

    0   Reliance on domestic budget process. The utilization of PRSC resources is determinedby
        the domestic budget process with the possibility that resource allocation is influenced by
        other factors than pursuit of the PRS objectives, including the above mentioned elections
        cycle. The principal mitigating measure derives from strengthening the role of domestic
        stakeholders in budget formulation and budget review.                Government's continued
        commitment to an open and participatory PER and budget process is an important and well
        established tool to support and monitor consistency o f budget formulation and execution
        with the PRS. It is worth noting that due to fungibility o f resources, the allocative risk also
        exists for other aid modalities and the PRSC i s explicitly designed to address this risk.

    0   External Shocks. Areas of vulnerability to external shocks include tourism, which has
        been become a leading source of foreign exchange and which could be affected by
        developments in the international security situation, agriculture which remains the main
        source of income and employment for Tanzania and exposed to climatic shocks, and terms
        of trade, especially with regard to the prices o f the leading export commodities including



                                                 53

  gold, coffee, tea, and fish, and import commodities, especially oil. Tanzania's economy is
  reasonably diversified and has in the past shown remarkable resilience to individual shocks
  such as the drought in 2003/04 or the increase in oil prices. However, simultaneous or
  prolonged negative shocks could undermine macro-economic and fiscal stability. Tanzania's
  dependence on external aid, which i s about 12 percent o f GDP and finances almost half o f
  her budget, makes the country extremely vulnerable to changes in donor sentiment. The
  Tanzania Assistance Strategy clearly recognizes the need to design aid modalities with a
  view towards minimizing the scope for abrupt changes. However, there i s also a clear
  recognition that the authorities need to maintain an appropriate environment for sustaining
  relatively high levels o f aid.

e Fiduciary risks. Both the CFAA and the CPAR identify significant fiduciary risks. In
  recent years, government has implemented measures to eliminate fiduciary risks, including
  the approval and application o f new public finance and procurement acts, the full
  operationalization o f the Integrated Financial Management System, and strengthening o f the
  National Audit Office. The PFMRP and actions monitored by the PRSC are designed to
  address weaknesses ingovernment's financial management and procurement systems.
e Slow decision processes. As policymaking has become more inclusive-with          a greater role
  for stakeholders beyond the executive and, in particular, for parliament-decision making
  processes have tended to become more drawn out. This poses a risk primarily with respect to
  the speed o f implementation o f agreed actions, while the risk for significant policy reversals
  is considered to be reduced. The key mitigating measures contain two elements. The first i s
  dissemination and knowledge sharing with a wide range o f domestic constituencies on the
  rationale and benefits o f reforms. The second relates to using the process leading to the
  definition o f the PRSC policy matrix (PAF) to gauge the extent to which there i s consensus
  on reforms among key constituencies and then sequence reforms accordingly.
e Decentralization. Another risk for the achievement o f PRS objectives arises from the
  ongoing decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty reducing
  programs in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. Preliminary
  assessments indicate great variations in the quality and capacity o f financial management
  and reporting systems across districts, in addition to often limited capacities to manage and
  implement poverty reducing programs. The local government reform program focuses on
  strengthening the capacity o f local authorities.      The PRSC also supports actions to
  strengthen the watchdog role o f beneficiaries at the community level through disclosure o f
  the flow of resources to various activities at the grassroots level and expenditure tracking o f
  financial flows from the central government through the annual PERs.
  Capacity constraints. Although systems and capacities at the central level are generally
  stronger than at the local level, limited human resources capacity to implement and manage
  the PRSC reform agenda at the center represents another risk in the Tanzanian context,
  especially in the areas o f public expenditure management, procurement, and financial
  management.      To mitigate these risks, the proposed PRSC focuses appropriately on the
  strengthening o f oversight arrangements. A large number o f capacity-building efforts are in
  place. Most reform programs have capacity-building components embedded, including the
  PFMRP, the local government reform program, and the public sector reform programs.
  Similarly, sector programs and projects typically also contain capacity building components.
  The challenge for Tanzania is to enhance the effectiveness o f capacity-building efforts by
  shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven efforts and address capacity building in a

  building efforts are organized in a mutually reinforcing manner. Analytic work to address

        these issues is planned. In the medium term, it i s expected that the shift from project to
        budget support by the Bank and other donors will release staff who are currently tied up in
        project management to play a greater role in overall public sector management.


191.    To ensure that such risks do not derail the implementation o f the PRS and PRSC,
appropriate monitoring instruments have been put in place. The government's annual PRS progress
report, which builds on the recently developed, comprehensive poverty monitoring system, and a
well-established annual PER mechanism, provide open and transparent arrangements for
monitoring outcomes on fiduciary risks. Moreover, the annual nature o f the PRSC provides a
framework for appraising risks identified in the CFAA and CPAR and agreeing on necessary
corrective actions.

   Ms. Judy O'Connor
   Country Director,
   World Bank
   1818H Street, NW
   WASHINGTON D.C

   Dear Ms. O'Connor,



                               RE: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

1.        On behalf of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, I hereby write to
request for approval of the third Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 3) of US$ 150
million (SDR equivalent). This credit will assist in the implementation of the newly adopted
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP or MKUKUTA in
Kiswahili), by augmenting the Government's resources directed to MKUKUTA targets.
The credit will also support implementation of complementary structural reforms relating
to private sector and rural development; macroeconomic management, public financial
management, public service reform, governance and environmental sustainability.

1.        BACKGROUNDAND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

A.        MACROECONOMICPERFORMANCE
2.        Tanzania's overall macroeconomic performance has recovered following a severe
drought in most parts of the country during 2003. Real GDP grew by 6.7 percent in 2004,
against a projection of 6.3 percent and the 5.7 percent recorded in 2003. This was
contributed mainly by the recovery in agricultural production on account of improved



                                                    57

weather conditions, and a noticeable improvement in mining, construction, transportation,
communications, manufacturing, trade and tourism activities. Manufacturing for exports,
including Export Processing Zones and SMEs, continue to pick up. The overall annual
inflation which had risen to 6.5 percent by end June 2004 owing to effect of draught,
declined to 4.2 percent by end June 2005 despite higher fuel prices. The Government has
introduced a new Series of Consumer Price Index (CPI) whose basket is based on the
2000/01 household budget survey. The change to a new index is on account of
commodity market prices movements over time and changes in the composition of the
basket of goods and services consumed by a typical household.

3.      Gross official reserves of the Bank of Tanzania at end March 2005 reached US$
2,125.51 million from about US$ 1,878 million at end-June 2004. This level is equivalent
to about 7.5 months of imports of goods and non-factor services, and is attributable to a
steady inflow of foreign assistance during July-December 2004, coupled with modest
increase in exports and foreign investments. Tanzania successfully concluded its Third
Review under the IMF's Low Access Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in February
2005, and the Fourth Review is due for completion in July 2005. The Government
remains committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic management policies, and
ensuring a sustainable growth and reduction of poverty.

B.      REVIEW OF TANZANIA'S POVERTY REDUCTIONSTRATEGY AND
        ADOPTION OF THE NATIONALSTRATEGY FOR GROWTH AND
        REDUCTIONOF POVERTY (MKUKUTA)

4.      Following the successful completion of the implementation period of the
first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS I) and publication of the final PRS
Monitoring Report in 2004, a new National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty was adopted in February 2005. The adoption of MKUKUTA was preceded by a
national consensus building process that included discussion at the regional level before
presentation to a National Conference during the National Poverty Policy Week in
November 2004. In this respect, all civil government agencies, society representatives,
non-governmental      organisations,  development    partners   private  sector  players,
contributed their views during the drafting process.




                                             58

MKUKUTA focuses on three core areas as instrumental to poverty reduction in the period
2005-10. These are (i) Growth of the Economy and Reduction of Income Poverty; (ii)
Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Wellbeing; and (iii) Governance and
Accountability. Key to higher growth and reduced poverty will be water. Governance and
accountability will be addressed through more equitable allocation of resources, the
protection of the rights of the poor and of vulnerable groups and the improvement of
personal and material security.


C.     BUDGET SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S
       OWNREFORM PROCESSES

5.     The.Government reaffirms that general budget support is the preferred mode of
development assistance delivery since it enhances national planning and Implementation
systems, local ownership, transparency as well as shifting Government accountability
from external to the domestic constituency. Currently, the facility is supported by 14
development partners, 12 of which contribute grant aid to the programme, the World
Bank provides a combination of an IDA credit and a grant under the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC), and the African Development Bank provides credit in the form of
a Poverty Reduction Support Loan (PRSL). The 12 development partners are the EU, the
UK, the Netherlands, Germany (KNV), Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Ireland,
Switzerland, Japan and Canada. National planning would benefit from better information
sharing on the basis of determining the credit and grant portions of IDA support under this
instrument. The Policy Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix had been commonly used to
assess Government's progress in various areas of the reform agenda under the PRS I
cycle. With the adoption of MKUKUTA, the Government has initiated consultations with
development partners to align the budget support review within the existing
forums/processes so as to minimize transaction costs and facilitate the strengthening of
these forums/processes. These processes include the PRGF, MKUKUTA reviews, the
PER/PEFAR Review process, Sector Reviews, and Annual Poverty Monitoring System.

II.    REFORM PROGRAMME UNDER THE PAF 2004/05 -2005/06 II

A.     IMPROVED INVESTMENTAND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
6.     Substantial progress has been observed in the areas related to private sector
development. All reform programmes in this area are on track. A major study on a new


                                           59

PSD strategy is under way and the Strategy is scheduled to be completed by November,
2005 and approved by the Government by April 2006. This work will benefit through
inputs from a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study COnS) currently underway by the World
Bank. The reform work in this area will increase the longterm growth potential of the
economy and support poverty reduction through increased incomes. A coherent M&E
system for BEST, SME Policy, and PSD strategy is being developed and is expected to
be institutionalised by November 2005. The Government has continued to mobilise
resources and it is envisaged that the implementation of SME Policy priority projects will
start by November 2005.

7.      With regard to the SMEs' access to finance, the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme
(SME -CGS) was launched in May 2005 with an initial funding of TShs 2 billion from
government budget. In addition, TShs. 1.5 billion has been set aside for the scheme in
the 2005106 and TShs 1.5 billion for the National Entrepreneurs Development Fund
(NEDF) both from government budget. These resources for SME development will be
augmented by the USD 1 million earmarked for the SME Competitiveness Fund (SCF)
under the Business Service Programme Support I1(BSPS 11).

8.      The Better Regulation Unit (BRU) is currently finalising the implementation of first
year priority work plans, and has reviewed various draft bills including the draft Business
Activities Registration Bill; draft Land (Mortgage) Regulations; Occupational Health and
Safety Bill; and Workmen's Compensation Bill, all of which have been forwarded for final
drafting. Other regulatory instruments under review include the Regulatory Licensing
System; and the draft Regulations for Real Estate Agents for facilitation of the operation
of the Land Market.

9.      Management structures for BEST were established in January, 2005 and the
BEST Steering Committee and the Tripartite Review Committee held meetings in
February 2005 to approve the work plans, activities and budget for the first year. Work
plans for the Commercial Dispute Resolution component of the BEST programme have
also been prepared and are among the activities that were approved by the Review
Committee. Recruitment of international lead advisors to support the implementation of
 CDR reforms is on going. Implementation of priority activities including reform of Civil
 Procedure Code was expected to commence in June 2005. BRU's work plan for financial
 year 2005/06 were also approved by the Tripartite Review Committee in June 2005.


                                             60

Regulations for the Companies Act, 2002 have been prepared, and are to be gazetted
soon.

10.     Under Phase II of the labour law reforms, the Government is reviewing the
policy and legislations on occupational safety and health, Workmen's Compensation,
Social Security, Employment Services, Skills Development, Labour Market Information
and Employment Promotion. Reports on Social Security, Employment Services, Skills
Development, Labour Market and Information and Employment Promotion were
presented to the Labour Law Reform Task Force in April 2005 and early May 2005. Sixty
trainees from the Commission for Mediation and Arbitration (CMA) have already
graduated, with the last batch scheduled to graduate in July, 2005 thereby paving the way
for the Labour Institutions to commence full operations.

11.     Reforms in the business licensing system have continued consistent with the
Government's commitment under the following PRSC 3 prior action:

        New business licensing framework under implementation in a phased
        strategy.

In this regard, the business licensing reforms introduced with the 2004 budget were
implemented at the central and local government levels. A Draft Business Activities.
Registration Bill has also been prepared and is expected to be submitted to Parliament in
July, 2005. The draft Bill proposes the repeal of the Business Licensing Act of 1972.
Further, other forms of regulatory licensing are being targeted for reform and proposals
have been invited from stakeholders. The Prior Action in this area has therefore been
met.

B.      AGRICULTURALAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

 12.    Agriculture continues to be a key sector of the economy due to its strong
 contribution to growth and poverty reduction. In addition to improving rural infrastructure,
 elimination of nuisance taxes targeting crop production, and strengthening the provision
 of extension services, crop marketing is a key element of the sector's development
 strategy. The reform of crop boards to reduce their burden on producers has been being
 implemented in phases.




                                             61

The review process of the roles and funding arrangements of Crop Boards completed,
and the following were decided by the Government in June 2005.


(0    To abolish the Crop Development Funds, and ensure people/farmers are not
      charged for these funds.

(ii)  That the Government shall finance Crop Boards' running costs.

(iii) Given the strategic importance of crop development for growth and poverty
      alleviation, the Government will improve provision and availability of extension
      services to all farmers and that respective Crop Boards and the Government will
      continue playing a key role in this endeavour.

(iv)  That in view of the inconclusive outcome of the study on Crop boards' Reform, there
      is a need to carry out a deeper analysis and determine who is doing what among
      the institutions and agents dealing with agriculture in the country in order to form a
      firm basis for further Government action in this area.

The Government decision has anchored the Crop Board reforms on the sources of
financing and in view of this, the Government is preparing an "Action Plan for the
Rationalization of Roles, Functions, Financing and Accountability of Crop Boards''
detailing reform interventions including the amendment of relevant legislation as well as
activities to effect the interventions and expected outputs. The Action plan will be
completed and circulated by the first week of September, 2005.

The following outputs are therefore expected as a result of the Crop Boards reform:
      Crop Boards legislation will be revised with a view of abolishing as appropriate non
       regulatory functions, collection of crops cess, issuing indicative prices;

      The legislation will be reviewed to reduce the number and frequency of issuance of
       licences, consistent with the Finance Act No. 15 of 2004;

       Increased producer margins as a result of the abolishment of levies charged on
       crops to finance Crop Boards operations;

       Creation of favourable regulatory environment.

         Following the completion of the Agricultural Sector Development Programme
(ASDP) framework in December 2002, monitoring benchmarks for assessing the
effectiveness of coordination mechanisms for ASDP implementation have been prepared


                                               62

to focus on, among others, timely reporting and monitoring of the sector in accordance
with the ASDP monitoring and evaluation framework, and the share of Agricultural Sector
Lead Ministries' (ASLMs) budgets and actual expenditures going to ASDP priorities. In the
fiscal year 2004/05, 88% of the total budget of ASLMs was aligned to ASDP priorities. In
Fiscal year 2005/06, the ASDP priority proportion has been increased to 90%. Moreover,
we intended to have a detailed PER study carried out to clarify the definition of ASDP
priority and non-priority areas.

14.     The law for establishing legal, regulatory and supervisory framework for micro-
finance institutions was approved by Parliament in February 2003 in order to improve
access to essential agricultural and rural financial services. The Microfinance
Regulations, completed in March 2005, provide the legal framework for Micro Finance
Companies and Financial Cooperative Societies to operate and contribute to the
implementation of the Microfinance Policy and facilitate rural financing.

15.      The Government is committed to further improving the security of tenure in order
to promote rural development. The Government has therefore approved the Strategic
Plan for the Implementation of the Land Laws that will operationalise the Land and Village
Land Acts. In this regard, the following Prior Action is on track.



   Finalised and obtained Government approval of the strategic
   planfor operationalisation of the LandAct andVillage LandAct.


16.      Development of rural roads also continues to be part of the Government's reform
programme benefiting rural areas. Efforts are underway to strengthen the capacity at
district level to manage road rehabilitation and maintenance carried out by contractors.
The compilation of Road Inventory is expected to be completed by September 20051 and
provide inputs to the delineation of responsibilities between central government
institutions and LGAs, following the road classifications. The draft Road Act is expected to
 be submitted for Parliamentary approval in February 2006.




                                              63

C.      POVERTY MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

17.     Government has made progress in improving the routine data collection system
with sector Ministries and operational guidelines are expected to be formulated and
adopted after the review of technical issues and field trips. Consultationswith some core
sector Ministries (namely the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Works,
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Ministry of Water and Livestock Development)
on the Routine Data Collection (ROC) strategy have been conducted, issues for the
technical review prepared, and fact finding field trips conducted. This will form the basis
for an ROC strategy.

18.     Given that the MKUKUTA was adopted only recently and its implementationstarts
with the 2005/06 budget while the PMS review is on-going, it is too early to provide
indication on the process of reviewing the performance of the updated set of indicators
and targets in the MKUKUTA. However the Government remains committed to reporting
on poverty trends and indicators this year, and expects to use the Poverty and Human
Development Report 2005 as a basis for such reporting.

19.     Substantial progress has been made in translating the MKUKUTA framework into
policy actions. The new budget process provides budget incentives for MDAs to adjust
their strategies to the clusters, goals and targets of MKUKUTA. Furthermore, draft
MKUKUTA implementationguidelines providing broad guidance to MDAs on how to adapt
their plans and strategies to MKUKUTA are being finalised. This should facilitate linkage
of resource utilisationto poverty outcomes in the future.

D.      MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

20.     The Government continues to implement policies which aim at securing and
sustaining the macroeconomic gains achieved so far by clearly emphasizing on fiscal and
debt sustainability as key areas of macro economic reforms. Strong growth is expected to
continue across all sectors of the economy leading to overall economic growth targeted at
6.9 percent in real terms in 2005 and, supported by the continued structural reforms and
infrastructure investment, accelerating further to 7.5 percent over the medium term.
Inflation, on the other hand, is expected to be contained at around 4 percent in the
medium term. While the trade balance is projected to remain consistently negative in the



                                            64

medium term, overall foreign reserves are expected to remain favourable on account of
aid and investment flows.

Debt management
21.    Public debt continued to be managed favourably as planned, with debt relief
beyond HlPC having been obtained from all but one Paris Club creditors. Moreover, the
UK has offered additional relief this year of 10 percent of debt service obligations to IDA
and ADB. Efforts are under way to have the remaining bilateral agreements signed with
Brazil and the outstanding Japanese agencies namely EID/MITI and the Japanese Food
Agency. Also, Tanzania has concluded debt relief negotiations with several non-Paris
Club creditors. Once approved by the relevant institutions, the proposal by the G8
countries for additional debt relief would provide savings that would reduce the financing
gaps in health and education, and substantially pop up poverty reduction efforts. The
Government continues to be guided by the National Debt Strategy in its debt
management activities, and borrows only from concessional sources. In line with the
strategy, a circular was issued to all MDAs in May 2005 describing in clear language, the
changes in the debt contracting and management framework enacted through the Loans,
Guarantees and Grants (Amended) Act of 1974 including correct debt contracting
procedures, criteria for new loans and punitive actions for flouters of the legislation.

Tax managementand policy
22.     Good progress has also been made in the area of taxation, in both the policy and
administration areas. The review of tax laws was completed, and changes introduced
after consultations with stakeholders. Implementation of the TRA Second Corporate Plan
is also progressing well, with revenue collection increasing at 19 percent per annum over
the last three years, and much improved services for taxpayers. Other achievements
realised over the past year include:

  (i)   Consolidation of the recently installed flow meters to ensure greater accuracy
        when measuring petroleum imports through the introduction of air eliminators;
        thereby improving tax assessment of petroleum imports;

  (ii)  Rollout of the new Central Motor Vehicle Registration System to two new stations,
        namely Tanga and Dodoma;




                                             65

 (iii) Adoption of a function-based organisation structure at the Large Taxpayers
       Department and the merger of the Income Tax and VAT Departments into a single
       Domestic Revenue Department, in pursuit of integration of TRA operations;

  (iv) Expansion of the coverage of the Large Taxpayers' Department, from 100 to 208
       taxpayers over the last 12 months, with plans to increase this to 350 by June
       2006;

       Introduction of One-Stop-Centres at all District TRA Offices.
       Review of the EAC Customs Management Bill, and commencement of
       implementation of the EAC Customs Management Law.
       Adoption of the HIV / AIDS policy for the Authority.


23.    Simplification and rationalisation of Local Government taxation continued, with
more nuisance levies and fees abolished in the 2005/06 budget. To provide a framework
for sustainable financing of LGAs, the Government commissioned a study on the matter.
The study has been completed, and the Government is reviewing its recommendations
with a view to developing a strategy' for local Government financing that ensures prudent
taxation without advers,ely affecting the fiscal viability of LGAs or the benefits of fiscal
decentralisation and the overall national objectives including investment climate.


E.     IMPROVEMENTIN THE EFFECTIVENESSOF ClELlVERY OF PUBLIC
       SERVICES

24.    The focus in this area has continued to be on the need for transparency in all
stages of the budget formulation and budget execution, both at the Central and Local
Government levels. With the introduction of the outcome -focused MKUKUTA, new
challenges in resource allocation have come on board. Unlike the situation under PRSl
whereby resource allocation focused on seven traditional priority sectors (namely
education, health, water, roads, agriculture, governance and HIV / AIDS), the MKUKUTA
is cross cutting, involving all MDAs. The newly developed Strategic Budget Allocation
System (SBAS) has ensured this strategic linkage, with MKUKUTA related funding
accounting for 54 percent of Central Government budget allocations. Over time, as
MKUKUTA gets fully costed and interventions prioritised and sequenced, the
Government's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework will translate comprehensively the


                                             66

policy objectives into programmes, targets and activities. Nevertheless, public expenditure
is already driven by policy priorities and disciplined by budget realities, such as
institutional capacity and resource constraints. In order to mitigate these constraints, the
Government will press ahead with its ongoing programmes of strengthening public
expenditure management systems and domestic resource mobilization.

25.      With regard to the budget formulation, the following Prior Actions 2005/06 have
been achieved:

          Approved budget 2004105 in line with PRS objectives,
          delineating budget codes for prioritysectors and items.


Analysis of approved budget and PRS funding for fiscal year 2004/05 presented to
stakeholders at PER consultative meetings shows that overall priority sector funding
increased compared to 2003/04.        As noted in the PRBS Annual Review Report of
November 2004 and the PER Report for 2004/05, budget execution for 2003104 and
2004/05 was in line with the approved budget and PRS priorities, as priority sector
expenditures continued to be protected. Moreover, the Budget Guidelines for 2005/06 -
2007/08 include a significant effort to link the MKUKUTA and sector strategies more
explicitly with budget allocations. To do this the SBAS indicates the poverty cluster
interventions (targets) and the respective action (sectors) that will be required to
collaborate during the implementation of their activities. In this regard, we consider the
following action to have been completed.


          Budget Guidelines for 2005106          - 2007108 consistent with PRS
          priorities, and explicitly taking into account recommendations
          of PRS review process, sector reviews, PER sector reports and
          the PER external evaluation 2003104.


 27.     Allocation of resources to LGAs for recurrent and development expenditures in
 2005106 was based on the formula adopted in 2004. This allocation system has covered
 all sectors, namely, Education, Health, Water, Roads, Agriculture and Administration.




                                             67

However, after orientation of LGAs staff of MKUKUTA, it is envisaged that future resource
allocations to LGAs will be linked to MKUKUTA cluster strategies.

28.     Budget execution for 2003/04 and 2004/05 was in line with budget estimates.
Therefore, the following PRSC 3 Prior Action in this area has remained on track:



         Executed the FY 2004 budget and first semester of the FY 2005
         budget in line with its approved budget and PRS priorities, and
         reported such budget execution as per identified expenditure
         budget codes for priority sectors and items.


The Government remained committed to ensuring transparency in its budgetary
operations. To this end, the reports on the execution of the first two quarters of the
financial year 2004/05 have been made public, and subsequent reports will be published
as well. In the reports, detailed information is provided on revenue collection as well as
expenditure execution in the priority sectors and priority items. It is noteworthy that there
has been an overall increase in expenditure execution relative to estimates, which
indicates that procurement planning and implementation are improving.

29.     It is still difficult to timely assess budget execution at the Local Government level,
since no related consolidated expenditure data is available as there are only 32 Councils
currently using IFMS. We are implementing a plan to add another 32 Councils during
2005/06, before rolling out to all Councils in future and therefore establish the basis for
consolidating the general Government budget (Central and Local Governments) and
hence its execution. In view of the fact that many Councils are not yet linked to IFMS,
manual reports serve the purpose in the short term as we move to full integrated system
in the medium term.

30.     The Government continues to publish the transfers to LGAs in newspapers, and
on the Government website. LGAs are equally being encouraged to continue displaying
receipt of grants on their District Notice Boards, with evidence of the practice having been
confirmed by the Ministry of Finance's Technical Audit Unit (TAU) as part of its audit
activities.

F.      IMPROVED PERFORMANCEOF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE
        OVERALL INCENTIVEENVIRONMENT

31.     Substantial progress has been made in the implementation of the Public Service
Reform Programme (PSRP), aiming at improving public service delivery so as to
contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The reform strategy has continued
to be in attracting and retaining better qualified staff and strengthening human resource
capacity in order to sustain the overall Government reform programmes. This will be
achieved through the Government's long-term plan of capacity building as well as
performance orientated pay reform. An M&E system has been installed in 34 MDAs and
five staffs from each MDA have been trained in the use of the system. Plans are
underway to commission a consultant to prepare popular version of Service Delivery
Surveys in English and Kiswahili in order to operationalise the system. Based on financial
feasibility, the Government has continued implementation of the Medium Term Pay
Reform. A study is underway to establish a detailed analysis of the nature of and trends in
employment allowances, and employment growth in order to make specific
recommendations that would be consistent with improved rationality and an accelerated
pace of salary enhancement within an affordable wage bill. With these developments, we
consider the following PRSC3 prior action to have been met.

32.     As part of the public service reform, we plan to establish Ministerial Ethics
Committees to handle complaints and grievances internally and from the public. Initially,
the system will be field tested in 6 MDAs by November, 2005 before being rolled out to 10
other MDAs by November 2006. The code of conduct for public servants has also been
revised and published, in consultation with stakeholders.

G.     MINIMISATION OF RESOURCE LEAKAGESAND THE STRENGTHENING
       OF ACCOUNTABILITY

i) Public Financial Management
33.    The Government continued in its effort to secure sustainable and effective
financial management arrangements that support an equitable delivery of public services,
and to minimise resource leakages as well as strengthen accountability over use of public
funds. The Financial Management Reform Programme (PFMRP) is the main vehicle for
building the requisite capacity in public institutions for this purpose. Progress made in the
implementation of the PFMRP includes the identification of core activities for each
component as well as the processes, outcome and output indicators, and a structure for
monitoring, reporting and controlling performance. The PFMRP has been mainstreamed
into the budget to ensure consistency between strategic plans and budgets, and the
programme activities have been accommodated in current Government accounting
codes. The following prior action is therefore considered to be met:

       I Progress in the implementation of the PFMRP.


34.    With respect to procurement, substantial progress has been made, meeting the
prior action for establishing a Regulatory Authority, by enacting a new law, (The Public
Procurement Act 2004), which has decentralised all tendering functions and established a
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). The PPRA's regulatory function is
expected to be substantially strengthened as operational functions have been
decentralised. The following PRSC 3 prior action is completed.




ii) Reduction of corruption
35.     Government continues to pursue good governance as part of the strategy to
 reduce resource leakages. In the fight against corruption, the focus is on implementing


                                                70

the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP), and the Anti -
Corruption Plans of individual MDAs. Published quarterly reports on the implementation of
the MDAs' anti-corruption plans depict substantial progress. Anticorruption strategies and
action plans for all Local Government Authorities were prepared and submitted to the
Good Governance Coordination Unit (GGCU) during 2004/05, with implementation slated
to start in 2005/06. The Government is also taking broad measures to strengthen the
GGCU through, among others, increasing the number of staff and enhancing training.
Tanzania's commitment to improve good governance, and the results thereof, has been
recognised by local and international stakeholders including a finding from a recent
survey that the country's governance profile made the most improvement in all three
governance areas (Voice and Accountability, Government Effectiveness, and Control of
Corruption) over the last ten years among African countries South of the Sahara'.

Improvements in Aid management

36.      Consistent with the undertakings under the Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS),
the second TAS Annual Implementation Report (FY 2003/04) has been prepared and
shared with members of the Joint TAS secretariat. The report provides progress made to
date by the Government, Development Partners (DPs) and other stakeholders in
implementing the TAS priorities according to TAS Action Plan in the second year. It also
highlights the remaining challenges related to achieving the principles and objectives of
best practices in aid coordination as set out in the TAS document. The report will be
officially released and widely distributed as soon as approved.

37.      The Government continued to liaise with Development Partners in compiling the
external resources commitments and projections for the FYs 2005106 -2007108 MTEF
period as part of the routine activities of the annual PER process. The data were
consolidated and circulated to sector Ministries (projects and basket funds) for review.
Discussions of these data with sector Ministries were made during November December   -
2004 and then compiled and submitted to the Budget Guidelines Committee for the
preparations of the FY 2005106 -2007108 Budget Guidelines. These data were also
shared with the PER macro group in February 2005, during their discussion on the FY
200906 -2007/08 Budget Guidelines. Further, budget support and basket funds data to

                                                  71

circulated to Development Partners during February 2005 for re-confirmation and firming
up and the ensuing data were used for the preparation of annual budget for FY 2005106.
Project funds were reconfirmed with sector Ministries and regions during the national
budget finalization process.

H.      ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITY

38.     Following its passage by Parliament in 2004, implementation of the Environmental
Management Act (EMA) has commenced, with a focus on (i) capacity building
programmes to strengthen institutions on environmental management, and compliance
with EMA commitments; promulgation of guidelines on mainstreaming environment in the
policy processes; and development of poverty-environment indicators to be fed into the
Poverty Monitoring System (PMS) Review. Environment experts are now represented in
the PER sector Working Groups, in order to mainstream environmental issues into
Government processes.

39.     In the coming year, the Government targets the finalisation of the regulations and
guidelines on environmental assessments, to include: (a) integrating environmental
assessments into sectoral and district planning processes, (b) economic instruments, and
(c) environmental standards for monitoring and compliance. Implementation of priority
activities in the new institutional framework began in fiscal year 2004/05. Government will
arrange for training on environmental assessment within sectors and districts and carry
out pilot strategic environmental assessments in priority areas. Implementation of the
action plan for building capacity within the VPO for poverty-environment monitoring will be
initiated and the mainstreaming of the poverty-environment indicators within the PMS will
be completed.


1.      CONCLUSION

40.     The Government remains committed to pursuing efficient and effective
implementation of articulated strategies for maintaining sustainable growth and reducing
poverty and through the MKUKUTA framework. The favourable overall macroeconomic
developments in Tanzania and continued efforts in improving domestic revenue
mobilisation, augmented by favourable external support, are supportive of growth and
poverty reduction. The remarkable achievements in reaching the PRSC 3 prior actions



                                              72

and pursuit of the agreed policy actions laid out in the new PRBS/PRSC Performance
Assessment Framework for the coming year will continue to guide the Government in
policy reforms. In addition, consistent implementation of the Government's reform agenda
in private sector and agricultural development will enhance a sustained positive growth.
Good performance in domestic revenue collections and well planned expenditure
programme will facilitate the realization of the MKUKUTA targets.

Notes:



For the first annual cycle, all actions in the context of the Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) for PRBS/PRSC 1, includingthe Prior Actions (in bold) for PRSC 1 were to be completed
no later than March 2003.

The Prior Actions for PRSC 2 (in bold) and the indicative Prior Actions (Triggers) identified For
PRSC 3, will have to be fully accomplished/completed by March 2004 and March 2005,
respectively, in order for successful negotiations and subsequentpresentation o f the relevant PRSC
operation to the World Bank's Board of Directors. All other Actions, would have had to be
completed by no later than 14 March 2005 (PRBS/PRSC 2) and November, 2005 (PRBSFRSC 3).

Substantive progress on the full set of actions is recognized as vital for continuation of the overall
program of support to Tanzania. A broad-based review of the PAF Actions will be conducted in
November of eachyear.

The review of the PAF, originally designedfor a three-yearprogramme, concludes in 2004/05.
During the November 2004 PRBS Annual Review/ PRSC 3 pre-appraisal, joint agreement has
been made to achieve indicative PAF actions to be completed by November 2005March 2006.
This interim arrangementfor a continuedPAF isfor oneyear (2005/06). If stakeholdersagree
to a revision of the assessmentframework before then, then the revisedframework will take
precedencefor monitoring in the budget support arrangement.

                                   1.      Main principles

The Government andthe donors considerthe PartnershipFramework" (PF) for budget su~port'~          as
the common instrument of support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) through the
Government's budget. The PF is an integral part of the Government of Tanzania's public sector
budgetingand priority setting process and the PRS. The budgetwill be usedas a tool to reach the
PRS objectives, and priority sectors as defined in the PRS will be protectedin the budget. The
agreed priority allocations as well as indicators of achievements will continue to be monitored
through joint processes including the Public Expenditure Review (PER) and PRS process and
reviews as detailed in this PF. These joint processes will involve the Government and the PF
donors.

This PF Memorandum describes the common framework for the development grant and loan
agreements to fund poverty-orientedprogramme budget support to Tanzania. Together with the
attached Technical Annexes, it replaces the Memorandum of Understanding for the Poverty
Reduction Budget Support (PRJ3S) signed on 27* November 2001 and the Technical Note of
October 2001. This Performance Framework Memorandum has beenreviewedand agreedby the
Government and the PF donors during the joint Annual Review/pre-appraisalof general budget
support carriedout inNovember2002.

The PF Memorandum will be supplemented by bilateral agreements between each individual
donor and the Government of Tanzania, and by a PRSC programme document and related legal
documents of the World Bank. The bilateralagreementswill have the choiceto focus on all or a
subset of the actions and targets in the list of policy actions and targets jointly agreed on in the
PAF. It is understood by the parties that the contents in the individual funding agreements take
legal precedence over this Partnership Framework Memorandum. However, it is the intention of
the parties to establish funding agreements that are compatible with the provisions of this
PartnershipFrameworkMemorandum.

The intention is to manage existing and future budgetary support from donors and financing
institutionsthroughthe PF facility. The objectives are to minimizetransactioncosts, to harmonize
performancebenchmarks and dialoguebetweenthe parties andto link fundingcommitmentsby the
donors to achievement of targets set. The Partnership Framework and the funding Facility is
therefore open for contributionfrom and participationby all donors and financial institutionsthat
are providingor consideringprovidingsuchbudgetarysupport.

The PF aims at increasingthe predictability of donor flows. This will benefit overall economic
developments and the implementationand efficiency of programmes in priority sectors. The PF

                                        2.     Justification

Tanzania has implemented an economic reform programme that has shown a number o f positive
results. Significant progress has been made in macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reform
of the economy. Inflation has stabilised below 5 percent and signs are that many o f the elements
required for a private sector led growth are inplace.

In the first years o f the reform programme, growth rates in the economy were slow to pick up,
however, and this led to lack o f progress in poverty reduction and slow development o f the
economic base needed to support the public sector. Growth rates inthe economy have improved in
recent years, but poverty i s still prevalent. It has been estimated that about one third o f the
population cannot afford basic needs for livelihood. As many as 18 percent are living in abject
poverty, that is, in a situation where the income is insufficient to buy food to cover minimum
nutritional needs. Tanzania needs several years o f high per capita growth rates to reduce poverty
levels significantly.

Surveys of poverty and living conditions in Tanzania show that there are important challenges in
the priority sectors that are detailed in the PRS. These priority sectors (and priority items) may be
subject to change during the ongoing process o f reviewing and updating the PRS, but they
currently include: health (primary); education (basic); water; roads (rural); agriculture (extension
services); justice and HIVI AIDS. There is furthermore a serious concern about the possibility o f
large segments o f the population being left out o f the economic growth and income generation
process. In recognition o f the enormous challenge in combating poverty the Government o f the
United Republic o f Tanzania has refocused priorities towards social sectors and primary services
within them. Long-term targets for poverty reduction were articulated in the Vision 2025 and
elaborated further in National Poverty Eradication Strategy adopted by the Government in
November 1997. The Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS), which expresses the modalities and
coordination requirements for donor support and the PRS focus on how to combat poverty in an
effective manner, both in terms of more effective use of public resources and in improving the
possibilities for economic growth, employment creation and income generation.

Domestic revenue to the public sector inTanzania was 12,2 percent o f GDP inthe 2001/02 budget
year. The fiscal deficit before grants was 6,6 percent. In addition to the reforms carried out in tax
policy and administration, the Government recognizes that more measures are needed to enhance
domestic resource mobilization. However, a realistic assessment i s that the tax base, which is the
monetized, non-governmental part o f the economy, needs to grow faster than overall GDP for a
number of years to yield a significantly higher tax/GDP ratio. While efforts to increase revenue
mobilisation are being implemented, the poverty reduction programme i s in need o f external grants
or other concessional financing. Direct budget support provides a sustainable route to manage the
transition from aid dependency. It strengthens national ownership o f the development process as
well as Government institutions, and it facilitates the implementation o f democratically selected
sector strategies for growth and poverty reduction.

                  3.      The Performance Assessment Framework

The PF is linked to a common set o f policy and poverty reduction goals. These goals are agreed
between the Government o f Tanzania and the participating donors and shall be based on the goals
of the PRS. The goals, including the policies to reach them and the indicators to monitor them, are




                                                 119

described in a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)17. It is the intention of the parties to
harmonizethe PRS actionplanandthe PAF completely within threeyears.

The PAF is a results-orientedmatrix of agreed actions and indicators including timeframe for
reachingtargets. The PAF sets out agreed key short and mediumterm actions to reduce poverty
such as macroeconomic stability andperformance improvements inthe public sector together with
specific annual measures to be taken by the Government to achieve the PRS targets. The
indicators for the macroeconomic targets of the PAF will be those elaborated in the IMF
programme framework discussions. Dialogueon these issues with a wider groups of stakeholders
will be handled in the appropriate common forum e.g. the PER macroeconomic group. The PF
partieswill avoid introducingnew targets, indicatorsor measuresthat are outside the PAF andthe
IMFprogrammemacroeconomicframework.

The parties will use the PAF and PRS Review process as a tool for dialogue on PRS
implementation and progress on PRS implementationand PAF actions will help to determine
appropriate levelsof future fundingfor the GeneralBudget. Througha continuous process, it will
allow the Government and the Donors to assess progress towards agreed mediumterm objectives
and the implementationstatus of specific measures. The PAF will be updated annually as part of
the AnnualReviewprocess.

                                      4.     Review Process

The review process for PF will be common for all participatingdonors and based on the review
process for the PRS. The Government of Tanzania and the donors participatingwill maintaina
close dialogue regarding the PF. The parties shall meet on an agreed schedule to review
implementation and the attainment of objectives (see Appendix). The PAF matrix and PRS
Progress Report will form the basis for discussions on progress between PF donors and the
Government.

The timing of review meetings through the year will be decided in such a way that the budget
process is facilitatedand that the PRSC requirements and the bilateraldonors' need for inputsto
their decision-makingprocesses are accommodated. The table in the Appendix lists the meetings
and actions needed.

Assessment of performance will be based on progress towards targets and measures identified
throughthe PRS and expressed in the PAF matrix. Joint reviewsof the PF Facility will be carried
out by Government and all participatingcontributors. These reviewswill use informationgathered
throughongoing processesto ensure that they do not set up a parallelreview process. The review
processes should endeavour to minimize additional technical work. However, should the quality
of regular informationprove not to be satisfactory, the PF donors and the Governmentwill agree
on a timeframe and on the possible support donors could offer to build the capacity needed to
providethis information.

The reviewprocesseswill draw together summaryreports reviewingprogress against relevantPAF
and PRS targets. Progress against the list of indicatorsof socialwell-being, derivedfrom the PRS
and attached to the PAF matrix, should be covered in the context of the PRS and discussed as part
of the Annual Review. The aim will be to fully harmonise the Annual Review Report with the

PRS progress report over time. This will ultimatelydependon progress with harmonisationof the
PAF andPRSAction Plan.

At least two weeks prior to the reviews, the Government of Tanzania shall providethe following
informationto the donors:

       For each of the reviewmeetings, statements showingthe budget and the budget execution
       figures includingtax revenues and presentationof priority expenditures as defined in the
       PRS progress reports;

       For the Annual Review, PRS progress report and a progress report on implementationof
       PAF actions;

       For the Mid-term and Annual Review, a statement of inflows and outflows from the PF
       accounts includinga statement of internalaudit; and

       As soonas available, the AnnualAudit Reportpreparedbythe NationalAudit Office.

             5.     Responsibilitiesof the Government of Tanzania

The donor support towards the PF is based upon the understanding that the Government of
Tanzaniawill:

    0  Implement the key actions identified within the PAF and through the on-going PRS
       process;

    0  Implementthe overall economic programmeaimedat stabilisationand increasedeconomic
       growth as has been described in the context of the IMF programme macroeconomic
       framework.

    0  Ensure that total expenditures and sector allocations effectively reflect the poverty
       reductioncommitment and that extra budgetary expenditure is brought into the budget so
       that budgetcomprehensiveness is ensured; and

    0  Monitor and report on the effective implementation of the budget and on progress in
       achieving PRSandPAFtargets.

                        6.       Responsibilitiesof the donors

The development partners are committed to working in Partnership with the Government of
Tanzania and facilitating implementationof the PRS boththrough financing governed by this PF
and complementary support provided through development partners' wider development
cooperation programmes. To the best extent possible within existing administrativeand statutory
provisions including individual bilateral funding agreements with Tanzania, which ultimately
governdecisionson disbursements andcommitments,the donors committhemselvesto:

    0  provide informationon future disbursements in advance of the budget year in a common
       financialframeworkfor PF;




                                              121

    0   disburse all of the commitments made within the Tanzanian budget year and attempt,
        where possible, to front loadtheir disbursementswithin the first quarter;

    0   as a general rule, change funding only for the next budget year by reference to the
        implementationof measures inthe PAF, the PRS and IMF assessmentsof macroeconomic
        performance; and

    0   endeavour to co-ordinate their disbursements in line with the Government's budgetary
        requirementsas presentedby the Government.

The donors will endeavour to follow the principlesenshrined in the PF and assess performance on
the basis of the PAF and PRS progress report. Reference to these key processes should be
includedin individualbilateralfundingagreementsto the maximumextent. These agreementswill
mainly provide further details on the obligationsof bothparties and the procedures for disbursing
funds together with any standard conditionsfor developmentcooperationthat the individualdonor
mayhave.The parties agreeto keep such general conditionsto a minimum.

                                        7.     Appendix
Dates for review meetings will be determined by taking into account the preparation of the
Tanzanianbudget and by the presentationof the annualPRSreport.The budgetyear is from 1stof
July to 30thof June.
The Annual Review process of updatingthe PAF targets will involve focused technical working
groups for each area of the PAF. Eachof these groupswill comprise Governmentrepresentatives,
PRBS donor representatives and World Bank representatives. They will jointly review progress
and priorities for the future. A finaljoint meeting involvingall working groups will then be held
to agree on key findings of the reviews and the way forward. The Mid-year Review will involve
similar processes, but will be a light reviewof progress to date. The Ministry of Finance, inclose
coordinationwith the Vice President's Office will maintainoversight of the Review process and
coordinate inputs where necessary from other Government departments. Within the Ministry of
Finance, the Technical Committee will act as the main point of contact; they will co-ordinate
preparation of the necessary Government assessments of progress and provide the informationas
outlined in Paragraph 17; and they will also lead the process of updating the Performance
Assessment Framework.

                                  TechnicalArrangements
The technical arrangements for the bilateral donors and the European Commission are described
below:
        All donor contributions to the PRBS foreign exchange account and interest accrued, shall
        be used to provide budget support to the Government of Tanzania;
        The facility shall be managedbythe Ministryof Finance;
        The interest-bearing PRBS forex account shall be monitored by the Bank of Tanzania on
        the authority ofthe MinistryofFinance, Accountant General's Department;

        The donors shall provide updates at the mid-termand annual review meetings regarding
        disbursements for the PRBS facility (amounts and timing);

        The Permanent Secretary, Ministryof Finance shall issue payment instructions to the BOT
        authorising the transfer from the PRBS account to the consolidated account;

        The Ministry of Finance, Policy Analysis Department will co-ordinate the operations,
        advising donors when the balance inthe PRBS account i s less than anticipated;
        Deposits in the PRBS forex account, and transfers to the consolidated fund, will be subject
        to an annual external audit financed by Government of Tanzania. (See Audit section below
        for further details);
        The Ministryo f Finance and Bank of Tanzania shall keep detailed records inrespect ofthe
        PRBS foreign exchange account as follows:
            9 Disbursementsmadebydonors;
            9 Balances inthe account atthe endofevery quarter;
            9 Withdrawal ofthe PRBSaccount for payment intothe ConsolidatedAccount.

                                    Audit Arrangements
The following audit arrangements shall be established:
        The National Audit Office (NAO) carries out an independent annual external audit of the
        Government Accounts. The annual audit report by the N A O shall be presented to PRBS
        donors as soon as it becomes available;
        Given the current considerable time lag between the end of the fiscal year and the
        availability o f the annual N A O audit report for that fiscal year, a more timely audit of
        selectedflows inthe Government Accounts would be undertaken annually. This audit will
        be carried out by the NAO, which may contract assistance from an internationally
        recognised audit company. This audit would be financed by the PRBS donors. The terms
        of reference for this selected external audit and a short list of audit companies would be
        jointly prepared and agreed by the Government, the National Audit Office and the PRBS
        donors. The selection o f auditors and approval o f the audit contract would be endorsed by
        the Government andthe PRBS donors;
        Internal audits o f the PRBS account will be undertaken.          Contributing donors may
        undertake an independent external audit of the PRBS account at any time at their own
        cost;
        The internal and external audit reports will be discussed as part of the reviews (ref.:
        Appendix o f the Partnership Framework Memorandum- schedule of reviews).

 THE UNITED REPUBLICOF TANZANIA




         TECHNICAL NOTE

               ON

POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT



      FOR THE WORLD BANK



          DRAFT UPDATE

           MARCH2005




               126

                             PRSC-3 Credit Administration

1. The technical arrangements and the steps to follow inrespect to the IDA Credit administration
are described below:


2. Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the United Republic o f Tanzania. A single-
tranche credit o f SDR 103.8 million (US$l50 million equivalent) would be made available upon
credit effectiveness, anticipated for September 2005. The closing date o f the operation would be
June 30, 2006. It is envisaged that there will be a further single-tranche, annual PRSC to support
the implementationo f the PRS in FY07.

3, Disbursement, reporting,and auditing arrangements. The proposed credit will follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to any specific
purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit i s approved by the Board
and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the credit will be deposited at the request o f the Borrower
by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Bank o f
Tanzania. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Credit into said account, an
equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget management system. If the
proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Credit
Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount
equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request
shall be cancelled. The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finance.

4. The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary assurance:
        Foreign reserve account. The GOTwill acknowledge receipt to IDA o f the money into the
        foreign reserve account and the crediting o f this amount in local currency to the Tanzania
        Government Consolidated Fund Account. While no external audit will be required, it is
        expected that the confirmation o f receipt will be countersigned by the Accountant General
        and the Controller and Auditor General.
        Public (government) accounts. The Controller and Auditor General is required by law to
        produce hidher annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months o f
        the financial year-end. IDA will have access to those accounts.
        Bank ofTanzania. The annual entity financial statements o f the Bank o f Tanzania, audited
        in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the International
        Federation o f Accountants, are publicly available.
5. Governance aspects. Aside from the measures supported by the PRSC that aim at the
strengthening o f governance, various processes are in place that aim at improved accountability
and transparency for the use o f public resources. The Prevention o f Corruption Bureau and the
National Audit Office have been significantly strengthened during recent years, and the Bank is
preparing a project that would support further strengthening o f accountability mechanisms. The
participatory PER-MTEF process provides for an open review o f budgetary performance. The
CFAA on Tanzania concluded that the central and local government financial management
systems represent high fiduciary risk. The major recommendations contained in that report have
been reflected in the reform program supported by the PRSC. To ensure effective implementation


                                                 127

o f the reform, the government has developed the PFMRP, the implementation o f which will be
monitored under the PER process.

6. Environmentalissues. PRSC-3 falls under OP 8.60 and i s no longer subject to environmental
safeguards. As the PRSC focuses primarily on institutional reforms, there are no direct significant
effects on Tanzania's environment, forests, and other natural resources. In addition, the PRSC
supports reforms o f Tanzania's legal and institutional framework for environmental management,
environmental impact assessments, and strategic environmental assessments (SEAS). An SEA has
been prepared. Reviews o f the environmental impact o fPRSC-1 and PRSC-2 included (i)      a review
o f supported sectors within the SECAC, (ii)  consideration o f potential policy reforms under the
SECAC; and (iii) assessment o f the ability o f the government to address any impacts within
                    an
these sectors using existing mechanisms, or using mechanisms developed internally within this
particular SECAC. The assessments concluded that: (i) policy reforms supported under the
                                                           the
PRSC-1 and 2 would have no deleterious environmental impact, or their impacts could be
addressed within the existing SEA processes that have been developed under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2
and will continue to be developed under PRSC3; (ii)    sectoral activities to be supported generally
under the roads and agriculture initiatives may involve some Category "B" activities, but
guidelines developed under PRSC-1 and 2 for addressing these are being adequately implemented
by Government, and will continue to be monitored and developed to improve their effectiveness in
PRSC-3. Some elaborationon these points i s provided below.

7. In an effort to mainstream the environmental sustainability dimension into the PRSC process
the Bank has undertaken various analyses with the objective to identify linkages between key
macro and structural reforms policies and the environment. This analysis, undertaken under PRSC-
1 and 2, identifies measures at both national and local government levels to reduce poverty and
enhance environmental sustainability o f policy reforms. The analysis concluded that environment
and poverty are linked inthree major ways: (a) poverty reduction programs should not damage the
resource base and the environment o f which poor depend for their livelihoods (b) improving
environmental conditions can help to reduce poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor growth;
and (c) mitigating measures may be necessary as part o f policy dialogue.

8. Working with the government and other development partners, the analysis identified a
number strategic entry points for mainstreaming key issues o f the poverty-environment nexus in
Tanzania into PRSC process and ongoing policy reforms in general. This included inter alia.
further support for EA activities, a comprehensive environmental review o f all taxes and levies
associated with the agricultural sector, and increased attention to removing land tenure
uncertainties. Specifically,  the Vice President's Office and the National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC) have been supporting the development and implementation o f
various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially in roads and agriculture), and have more
recently pursued procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental assessment to permit
mitigation o f any adverse environmental impacts while taking advantage o f potential synergies
between poverty reduction and environmental protection efforts. In this regard the PRSC2 and
PRSC3 reform agenda has specific actions to be implemented by the Government o f Tanzania as
part o f the environmental component.

 authorities will need to buildon tlie recent success by inairitaining souiid policies and steadily
 pmsuingkey structural reforms and capacity buildingto remove key impediments to growthand
 make meaningful progress on poverty reduction. Sustainedreformefforts to stimiilate private-
 sector led growth will be needed, particularly insuch areas as infrastnicture, access to the
 financial sector, improving the business enviroruiient, trade facilitation, and governance.


 <`Theauthorities' decision to scale back tlie planned rapidexpansion of govenuiient speuding
 under the 2005106 budget is commendable inview of the need to limit net domestic budget
 firianciiig and reduce the risk of crowding out prodwtive private sector activity. Itwill be
 iniportcutto protect priority arid poverty-related spending while avoiding divergences between
 the proprunandbudget expenditure levels, as they undeimine the budset process and
 transparency. The autlioiities are committed to strengtheningpublic expenditure umiageuient

 "Mobilizing domestic resources andraising tlie reveiiue-to-GDP ratio throtighbetter tax
 administration will provide resources for key expenditures for development andpoverty
 alleviation, andreduce the dependence on fore@ aid. Inthis regard, it will be essential to fiu-ther
 eidiaiice the operation of the VAT and income tax depai-tnietits, fiwther strengthen tlie Large
 Taxpayers Department, arid continue efforts to streamline customs aduinistration.
