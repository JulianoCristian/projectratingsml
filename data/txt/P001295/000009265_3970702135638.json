In addition, the project will review the\n            finances of the non-water and sewerage activities of Nairobi\n            City, and initiate in-house training to improve financial\n            and operational performance.  Finally, the project will help\n            prepare a long-term program to manage Nairobi's water\n            resources on a regional basis.  In an effort to achieve\n            these objectives, the project consists of:  (a) project\n            preparation; and (b) technical assistance for institutional development."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
