It would\n            involve the following components: (i) accelerated research\n            to breed more suitable and higher yielding cotton varieties\n            and the production of Breeder and Foundation seed of\n            recommended varieties; (ii) improved production from the use\n            of certified seed, more intensive plant protection services,\n            and cultural practices; (iii) modernization and expansion of\n            ginning and cottonseed processing; (iv) provision of a\n            revolving fund for incremental seasonal credit to growers;\n            and (v) training program."}, "docdt": "1975-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
