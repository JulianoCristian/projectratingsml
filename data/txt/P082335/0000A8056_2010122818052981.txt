                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In Tanzania, this project, and the Health Basket Fund generally, have contributed to a reduction in the infant mortality rate by almost half, from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999
                         to 51 in 2010. This brings Tanzania within reach of the child mortality Millennium Development Goal. There was also a 44% reduction in under-five mortality rate from 144 deaths per
                         1,000 live births in 1999 to 81 in 2010 due to an increased proportion of children under five sleeping under bed nets (from 36.3% in 2007/8 to 72.6% in 2009/10), increased
                         vaccination coverage, and improved functioning Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) at the facility and community levels. The Maternal Mortality Ratio also decreased
                         over 20% from 578 per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 454 in 2010, resulting in almost 2,000 fewer maternal deaths per year. An external review of the SWAp process in Tanzania

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                        Report No: ISR1923



                         concluded that the "SWAp has contributed to improvements in health outcomes and to improvements in the quality of health services at community level. These improvements can, in
                         turn, be plausibly linked to progress toward MDG and PRSP/MKUKUTA goals, especially relating to infant and child mortality".

                         The Health Basket Fund (HBF) is now approaching $90 million per year, which represents about 15% of the total health sector budget, and one of the few sources of discretionary
                         expenditure. The IDA funding represents about 17% of the total, making the Bank the second largest financier of the Basket. The Bank has played a key role in institutionalizing the
                         HBF approach, and basket funds have been used extensively to finance medical supplies and drugs, as well as to get funds to the front line for direct service delivery.
