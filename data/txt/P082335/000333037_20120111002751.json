Second Health Sector\n            Development Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) has\n            contributed to the alignment of both Development Program\n            (DP) and Government budgeting and accounting through a\n            single system thereby contributing to a reduction in\n            transaction costs. Central, programmatic and SWAp funding\n            are essential for implementation of health services in\n            raising health indicators as exemplified by funding for NMCP\n            Nutrition and HIV/AIDS program. At the time of project\n            implementation, the SWAp contributed to greater sector\n            coherence and consistency, which secured higher levels of\n            both domestic and external financial resources for health\n            throughout the implementation period. Compared to the set of\n            loosely or non-coordinated projects and programs previously\n            in place, SWAp delivered real improvement in sector\n            coordination and dialogue. Non-salary, discretionary\n            resources at local/facility level seem to have played a\n            critical role in the results attained. It is an important\n            lesson as we continue to consider supporting such resource allocations."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
