                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In Tanzania, this project, and the Health Basket Fund generally, have contributed to a reduction in the infant mortality rate by almost half, from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999
                         to 51 in 2010. This brings Tanzania within reach of the child mortality Millennium Development Goal. There was also a 44% reduction in under-five mortality rate from 144 deaths per
                         1,000 live births in 1999 to 81 in 2010 due to an increased proportion of children under five sleeping under bed nets (from 36.3% in 2007/8 to 72.6% in 2009/10), increased
                         vaccination coverage, and improved functioning Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) at the facility and community levels. The Maternal Mortality Ratio also decreased
                         over 20% from 578 per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 454 in 2010, resulting in almost 2,000 fewer maternal deaths per year.

                         An external review of the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) process in Tanzania concluded that the SWAp has contributed to improvements in health outcomes and to improvements in

                         the quality of health services at community level. These improvements can, in turn, be plausibly linked to progress toward MDG and PRSP/MKUKUTA goals, especially relating to
                         infant and child mortality. In terms of relevance, the external review came to the following conclusion: "Assessed in total, health sector strategies, priorities, plans, budgets and
                         programs have been relevant to achieving the MDGs and health sector goals and targets throughout the evaluation period ... The organization of much of the external support to the
                         sector under a SWAP agreement has helped to ensure that most remains relevant to the needs of the health sector and the national priorities expressed in MKUKUTA and the
                         MDGs. Contributions to the Health Basket Fund have played a particularly important role in enabling one of the central strategies of health sector reform: strengthening council health
                         services." HSDP II has been an integral part of this external support.

                         The use of the health basket fund approach has proved to be an efficient mechanism for providing the Bank#s assistance to the health sector. The Health Basket Fund (HBF) is now
                         around $90 million per year (increasing to $112 million in FY12), and represents about 15% of the total health sector budget. It is one of the few sources of discretionary expenditure
                         for the sector. The IDA funding represents about 17% of the total, making the Bank the second largest financier of the Basket. The Bank has played a key role in institutionalizing the
                         HBF approach, and basket funds have been used extensively to finance medical supplies and drugs, as well as to get funds to the front line for direct service delivery.

                         The final 2010 DHS report has been released on May 26, 2011, and the indicators have been updated with this most recent data. They show generally positive trends across a
                         number of indicators, including the ratio of the infant mortality rate between the richest and poorest income quintiles, which declined from 1.22 to 1.03, indicating that health services
                         and positive health outcomes are becoming more available for the poor. The positive results across a number of indicators suggest that the project was successful in meeting its
                         development objectives.
