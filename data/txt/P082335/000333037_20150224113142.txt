Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) remains a major challenge for Tanzania.
Health-related MDG indicators were either stagnant or worsened over the 1990s. More than 70
percent of life years lost in Tanzania are due to preventable causes, notably malaria, diarrhea,
pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, perinatal and maternal conditions.




In 1999, the government of Tanzania developed a long-term, three-phased Health Sector
Development Program aimed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in use and allocation of
resources for better access and quality of health services–particularly for poor people, women
and children. The Health Sector Development Program is a common framework through which
IDA and a number of other partners coordinate their support for broad health sector reform.




Infant mortality rate declined to 68 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2004/5, from 99/1,000 in
1999. Under-five child mortality rate has gone down to 112 deaths/1,000 live births, from
146.6/1,000. The program is playing an important part in Tanzania’s progress toward
achieving the MDGs.


Highlights:
- Tanzania’s health budget per capita increased to US$9.92 in FY06, from US$6.6 in 2003.
- The National Health Insurance Fund is now available to all public sector employees, and is
expanding to cover the private sector.
- 121 Council Health Management Teams were established as part of the district health system.
They have prepared comprehensive health plans against which they have received block grants.
- The Roadmap to Reducing Maternal and Neonatal Mortality has been produced and
implementation has commenced in 2007.
- Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) and vitamin A distribution has been
expanded nationwide.
- Use of bed-nets has been expanded under an innovative bed-net program which partners with
industry and retailers to provide vouchers for nets to pregnant women. Under this program
launched in 2004, 38 percent of pregnant women slept under a net in 2005 and 52 percent in
2006.
- US$86 million (2000-07) in support of a $US1.6 billion multi-donor program.
- IDA provided technical support for health care financing--specifically health insurance options
and budget strengthening; for addressing health human resource constraints; for procurement
systems.
- IDA supported the harmonized donors’ framework: It is currently the “Lead Donor” and chairs
the Development Partner Group for Health, a group comprising 22 multilateral and bilateral
development assistance agencies working in health.

IDA support for the health sector is gradually shifting in order to be provided through the Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) as budget support.
