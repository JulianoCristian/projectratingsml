of the Additional\n            Financing for the Second Health Sector Development Project\n            (HSDP II) for Tanzania is to assist the Borrower in\n            continuing to improve the quality of health services and\n            management of resources allocated to the health sector\n            through the expansion of the health sector policy and\n            institutional capacity building reforms initiated during the\n            first phase of the program. The Second Health Sector\n            Strategic Plan (HSSP II) was launched in 2003 and was\n            supported by over 20 development partners through a mix of\n            general budget support, the Health Basket Fund (HBF), and\n            targeted project financing (largely for malaria and AIDS).\n            The additional financing will fund scaled-up activities to\n            enhance the impact of this well-performing project,\n            specifically covering costs associated with the initial two\n            years of Third Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP III). The\n            project has contributed to the Government of Tanzania's\n            long term health sector program. This program has included\n            efforts to increase financing for district-level essential\n            health services; scale-up the integrated management of\n            childhood illness; increase vitamin A distribution; improve\n            malaria treatment and HIV/AIDS testing, counseling and\n            treatment; implement strategies for reducing maternal\n            mortality; expand public-private partnerships for access to\n            medicines; distribute bed nets; provide services by\n            faith-based institutions; strengthen routine monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E); expand insurance coverage; and\n            rehabilitate primary health facilities."}, "docdt": "2009-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
