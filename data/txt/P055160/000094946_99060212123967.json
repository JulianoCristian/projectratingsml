the restoration of sustained growth and improved living\n            standards through reforms that enhance government\n            functioning and also strengthen the environment for more\n            efficient private sector development. Governance and\n            institutional reform will be the backbone of the reform\n            program. The project will aid fiscal adjustment and ensure\n            the sustainability of the reform process by strengthening\n            the institutional infrastructure needed to improve the\n            public sector's capacity to carry out its role\n            effectively and efficiently. It will also encourage private\n            sector development and improve the efficiency and\n            functioning of the banking system. By reducing public sector\n            recourse to the banking system, the SAC will allow more\n            resources for private sector investment. The project will\n            also provide a positive signal to international institutions\n            and investors regarding the government's commitment to\n            reform. The project risks include: 1) excessive pressure on\n            economy and macroeconomic stability as a result of continued\n            influx of refugees into Albania; 2) high inflation as a\n            result of macroeconomic instability; 3) potential civil\n            disorders because of political instability; and 4) program\n            implementation delay because of poor coordination among ministries."}, "docdt": "1999-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
