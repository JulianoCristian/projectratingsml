impact substantial. Major lessons indicate that: 1) a reform\n            program can be greatly enhanced, when the strategy is to\n            combine the project, with follow-up investment operations,\n            as well as reducing sustainability risks; 2) an\n            inter-ministerial committee, with support from the Prime\n            Minister, can become a beneficial tool vs. resistance to\n            reform; in this case, the Committee, with ministerial\n            intervention, implemented key civil service recruitments,\n            confirming that the Government actually was willing to\n            enforce the new merit-based civil service law; 3) adjustment\n            operations do not need to be all encompassing, free-standing\n            operations, rather a structural adjustment operation should\n            be seen as an integral element of a broader reform agenda;\n            4) a major thrust of the project was strengthening\n            institutional capacity, and management of public resources,\n            a detailed work program which may set realistic objectives\n            to motivate, and stimulate professional viewpoints on\n            economic policy, and public sector reform within the\n            Government; 5) launching an adjustment operation, in spite\n            of crisis conditions, can help preserve a reform agenda, for\n            the project provided highly visible support, and increased\n            the Bank's credibility, regardless of adverse\n            circumstances due to the Kosovo crisis; and, 6) donor\n            coordination is critical for success, assuring systematic\n            support to the Government."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
