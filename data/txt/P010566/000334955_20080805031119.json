Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) careful design and cost review\n            at the pre-bidding stage will lead to lower costs of the\n            works; 2) agency's strong commitment will also lead to\n            cost reductions; 3) strong contract management by the\n            Employer is indispensable to minimize delay and keep\n            implementation within the contractually stipulated time\n            frame; 4) a good management consultant supporting the\n            overall function of the employer will help the employer to\n            enhance his contract management and capacity building; 5)\n            the success of the Environmental Management Unit was due to\n            strong consultant's guidance in the preparation stage\n            and repeated training programs during implementation; 6)\n            repeated consultation is likely to bring about stakeholder\n            satisfaction and contribute to the project success; 7) a\n            principal rule for success of a project is that strong\n            continued leadership and commitment of the implementing\n            agency's top management is a key factor; 8) supervision\n            of periodic maintenance by the implementing agency is a good\n            hands-on technical capacity building opportunity to enhance\n            its role as the owner of the network; and 9) performance\n            indicators for measuring the outcome of institutional\n            capacity enhancement need careful attention to capture the essence."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
