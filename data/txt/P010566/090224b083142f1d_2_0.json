But a highway project financed by the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction helped turn this rural\n            area around by upgrading roads and maintenance. As a result,\n            businesses thrived, agricultural production increased,\n            students and teachers attended school more easily and\n            frequently, and health improved as transport to and from the\n            Gujarat Province became faster and safer."}, "docdt": "2010-04-29T09:58:03Z"}
