These measures\n            mitigate impacts: To control dust, spray water at mixing\n            sites, on temporary roads, and at regular intervals; use\n            coal ash with 30 percent water content; cover vehicles; seal\n            mixing equipment; install dust-removal devices; use proper\n            road surface runoff and drainage; replace roadside trees;\n            and encourage afforestation. To control air pollution,\n            conform to emissions standards; distance asphalt-mixing\n            sites; and regularly monitor worker health and emissions\n            levels. To control noise, enforce noise standards; enforce\n            worker airplug and helmet use; limit work hours; monitor\n            vehicle and machine maintenance; and employ sound barriers,\n            berms, and other soundproofing materials. Use retaining\n            walls to prevent floods, and excavate to replace area of\n            water bodies. To improve drainage, minimize earth movements;\n            avoid contamination from fuel and lubricants; dispose of\n            cement and steel reinforcements; and replace or relocate\n            wells. Contain water erosion on soil by replanting and\n            reseeding. Fill in borrow pits holding contaminants.\n            Retaining walls and barriers will minimize cross sections\n            while protecting flora. Phase II addresses specifically the\n            wild ass crossing on Viramgam - Halvad corridor, sets the\n            institutional and legal framework, and presents the public\n            participation programme (vols. 5-10)."}, "docdt": "2002-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
