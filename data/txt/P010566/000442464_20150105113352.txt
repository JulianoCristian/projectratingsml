 Synopsis

   Despite a once fast-growing economy, Gujarat Province was facing an economic decline that was not
   being helped by its poor road conditions and a growing population of car users. The impact on people’s
   lives in this rural area turned around with implementation of the IBRD-financed highway project that
   upgraded road conditions and maintenance. Businesses thrived, agricultural production increased,
   students and teachers attended school more easily and frequently, and health improved as transport to
   and from Gujarat Province became faster and safer.
