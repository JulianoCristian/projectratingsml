MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Benin and Togo
Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project
(Credits 1189-BEN and 1190-TO)
Nanxbeto Hvdroelectric Project (Credits 1507-BEN and 1508-TO)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Benin and Togo - Power
Engineering and Technical Assistance Project (Credits 1189-BEN and 1190-TO) and
Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project (Credits 1507-BEN and 1508-TO)" prepared by the
Africa Regional Office. No comments were received from the Borrowers nor were
the views of the co-financiers sought by the Region.
The objectives of the Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project were to minimize
the cost of long-term electricity supply in Benin and Togo and to strengthen the
Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB), the Societe Beninoise d'Electricite et
d'Eau (SBEE) and the Compagnie d'Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET). They were
substantially met.  The dam and power plant were commissioned on time and on
budget. The plant is producing its full potential although power imports from
Ghana have become much cheaper.  The resettlement of 11,000 rural people was
completed before reservoir filling began.
The objectives of the Technical Assistance Project were to make
technical preparation of the Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project and to assess the
management, financial, and manpower needs of CEB, SBEE and CEET.   They were
fully met.
IDA financed 25% of the US$ 138.6 million Nangbeto Hydroelectric
project cost and induced the participation of nine co-financiers.  The Kuwait
Fund (18;) was the next major co-financier followed by KfW (11.7%), CCCE (10%),
BADEA (10%) and CIDA (9.2Z). The balance (13%) was financed by AfDB, OPEC Fund,
FAC and the UNDP.  Coordination among co-financiers was very good and their
respective shares were committed before project implementation began.
The overall outcome of the projects is rated as satisfactory and
institutional development as substantial. The sustainability of the projects'
benefits is rated as likely because power imports from Ghana are supply
constrained and the output of Nangbeto remains least-cost vis-a-vis alternative
thermal generation in Benin and Togo.
The PCR provides a good account of implementation,  results and
lessons for these two projects.
The projects may be audited to sharpen lessons drawn from the
successful utilization of foreign services, and assess the impacts on resettlers
and physical environment of this bi-national undertaking.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the combined Project Completion Report for the Power Engineering and Technical
Assistance Project and the Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project, both of which were jointly executed
by the Republics of Benin and Togo as regional projects. Although the Power Engineering and
TA Project was completed in 1985, it was agreed that a single PCR would be prepared jointly
with the Nangbeto Project.
The Power Engineering and TA Project was funded by two Credits (1189-BEN & 1190-
TO) amounting to SDR 3.5 million (Benin - SDR 1.7 mn. and Togo - SDR 1.8 mn.), approved
on November 10, 1981. They closed on June 30, 1985 and the last disbursement took place on
October 11, 1985. An undisbursed balance of SDR 0.159 million was cancelled.
The Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project was funded by two Credits (1507-BEN & 1508-TO)
amounting to SDR 28.2 million (SDR 14.1 million to each country), approved on June 28, 1984.
The Credits were fully disbursed and closed on June 30, 1992. Nine other lenders participated
in the financing of this project.
The proceeds of the four Credits were onlent by the two governments to the Communaute
Electrique du Benin (CEB), while the Compagnie d'Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET) and the
Societe Beninoise d'Electricite et d'Eau (SBEE) received part of the funds on a grant basis.
Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division of the Occidental and Central Africa Department and are based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal and President's reports, Development Credit Agreements, supervision reports,
progress reports prepared by the executing agency, correspondence and data from Bank files and
discussions with staff involved in project supervision. A Bank mission visited Cotonou, Benin,
in March 1993, to discuss the project with CEB and SBEE staff.
The two governments have requested CEB to prepare Part II of this report. This has not
been received.

NANGBETO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.   QOjectives The objectives of these two closely interlinked projects were to prepare and
implement the first hydroelectric project in the Republics of Benin and Togo, which share the
resources of the Mono River. This entailed the construction of a dam at Nangbeto in Togo with
a 63 MW power station and associated transmission lines to connect it to the existing high-
voltage system. The projects were also designed to improve power system planning and to
strengthen the three power sector entities in Benin and Togo (paras. 3.01-3.06).
2.    Implementation The construction of the Nangbeto dam, power station and transmission
lines went smoothly. Timely implementation was assisted by the thorough preparatory work
carried out under the preceding Engineering and TA Project. Construction adhered to schedule
and no unforeseen difficulties were encountered. Better than expected geological conditions
resulted in significant cost savings. The creation of a reservoir behind the dam necessitated the
resettlement of nearly 11,000 people living in 39 villages. 18 new villages in previously
uninhabited areas were set up as part of the project, each with access routes, tubewells and
latrines. All existing facilities in the old villages were rebuilt and some additional communal
buildings were provided. Farmers were allocated land for cultivation, commensurate with the
holdings they exploited prior to relocation.  The resettlement operation was successfully
completed prior to reservoir filling (Paras. 4.01-4.14).
3.    Results The power plant was commissioned in October 1988 at cost of US$ 123 million,
8 % less than estimated. The Nangbeto plant has now been in service for five years without any
major technical problems. It has also produced energy above the estimated average output of
the plant in three out of the five years. CEB, the entity that runs the Nangbeto plant today is
a mature organization with an experienced, competent and motivated staff capable of successfully
executing large and complex investment projects in the future. Sector planning and coordination
also improved as a result of the project. The two distribution companies also benefited directly
from the project in the field of training and computerization (Paras. 5.01-5.04).



- iii -
4.    The internal economic rate of return on the Nangbeto project has been recalculated using
the actual costs of construction. Valuing the future average output of the plant over a 30-year
period at the present CEB bulk tariff produces an IERR of about 10%, the same as that
estimated at the time of appraisal (Paras. 5.05-5.08).
5.    Conclusions and Lessons Learned. The main lessons learned from these two operations
are the following:
(a) Extensive consultation with cofinanciers and completion of the detailed procurement
arrangements with them prior to Board presentation were key factors contributing to the
timely execution of the Nangbeto project. The lack of government interference, the
motivation of project staff and staff continuity on both the Bank and executing agency
sides also helped make a success of project implementation.
(b) The lack of socio-economic and public health surveys after project completion makes
it difficult to assess present living conditions in the resettled villages. Preparatory work
on future hydro projects should include a review of experience in these areas.
(c) Despite the use during project appraisal of a sharply lower rate of demand growth
than that experienced in the years prior to the project, the demand forecast proved to be
too optimistic. The impact on sales of the very substantial tariff increases of the mid-
1980s was thus underestimated.
(d) Tariffs may have been set too high at the time of project appraisal as CEB's financial
performance has generally exceeded the requirements set out in the Credits' financial
covenants. It has built up significant financial reserves while keeping its bulk tariff
unchanged since the mid-1980s.
(e) Investments in extending the electricity distribution networks have lagged and should
have been undertaken to follow immediately after the commissioning of the Nangbeto
plant. A more commercial approach to promoting electricity sales is needed in the
distribution companies.
(f) There has been a failure to develop the fishing potential of the reservoir, largely
because of administrative barriers. These should be lifted rapidly to allow benefits from
this activity to be realized.

2. BACKGROLTND
2.01         Togo and Benin set up a joint regional entity, the Communaute Electrique du
Benin (CEB), in 1968 for the common development of power generation and transmission in the
two countries.  From  1973 till 1987, when CEB's first hydro generating plant was
commissioned, its activities were limited to the operation of a high-voltage transmission system
and the resale of bulk power (purchased from Ghana's low-cost Akosombo hydro plant) to the
two distribution companies, the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET) and the Societe
BEninoise d'Electricite et d'Eau (SBEE). Ghana remains the principal source of electricity
consumed in the two countries.



- 2 -
2.02        Despite the monopoly of all new generation plant granted to CEB by the two
countries, support for closer integration of facilities was slow as both governments built new
thermal plant in the late 1970s, without involving CEB.
2.03        The hydroelectric potential of the Mono River2, had already been studied in the
mid-1960s and the Nangbeto site identified as the most promising. The small size of the power
market meant that further work on it was premature at that time. However, in the late 1970s,
a feasibility study3 was carried out that established its technical and economic viability.
3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project
3.01        The main purpose of this project was to: (a) complete technical preparation of the
Nangbeto hydroelectric project; (b) assess the organizational, financial, management and training
needs of the three power companies (CEB, SBEE AND CEET), in the light of the forthcoming
large investment in power generation; and (c) to provide them with assistance in power system
planning.
3.02        Specifically, the Engineering Credits provided funds for: (a) completion of
detailed engineering design studies, including hydraulic model tests; (b) preparation of bid
documents for the Nangbeto plant and assistance in prequalification of contractors and bid
evaluation; (c) organizational and manpower studies of the three companies; (d) a tariff study
for the combined power sector of the two countries; (e) independent audits of the accounts of
the three companies; (f) a hydroelectric resource survey of Togo and Benin, including a ranking
of the priority sites identified; (g) a master plan for the long-term development of power
generation and transmission in the two countries; and (h) plans for the extension of the electricity
distribution networks in the cities of Cotonou and Lome.
Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project
3.03        As stated in the SAR, the project objectives were to: (a) minimize the cost of
long-term electricity supply in the two countries through the construction of a hydroelectric
plant; (b) improve the operations of CEB's system; and (c) strengthen the three power sector
institutions and their staff through improved coordination, planning and training.
2 While the Mono River flows mainly through Togo, its lower reaches form the border
between Togo and Benin.
3 IDA was the executing agency for the study, which was financed by UNDP.



3.04        The Nangbeto project initially consisted of: (a) construction of a dam at Nangbeto
on the Mono River in Togo with a 63 MW power station and 110 km of 161 kV transmission
line to connect it to the existing network; (b) technical assistance and training for the three
utilities; and (c) studies, including: (i) an assessment of the potential of the Oueme River in
Benin; (ii) a feasibility study of the Adjarala site downstream from Nangbeto on the Mono; and
(iii) a load dispatching study for the two countries.
3.05        Following completion of construction at a significantly lower than estimated cost,
additional related components were included in the project to fully utilize uncommitted funds.
These were: (a) the paving of the road from Nangbeto to Akpare; (b) construction of workers
housing at the dam site; and (c) computerization of CEB. Financing of a load dispatching study
was taken over by the African Development Bank.
3.06        The Nangbeto hydroelectric project underwent a lengthy and thorough preparation.
A pre-feasibility study and a detailed feasibility study were carried out in 1977 and 1980
respectively. The detailed engineering and bid documents were prepared under the IDA-financed
Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project. In addition, the design of the dam was
reviewed by an IDA-financed independent panel of experts.
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project
4.01        The Engineering and TA Credit was executed by CEB without difficulty. As a
further measure of prudence to confirm the choice of the Nangbeto site, the above project
financed a hydro inventory and a long-term system development plan, prior to appraisal of the
Nangbeto project. The preparatory work carried out under it was critical for the smooth
implementation of the Nangbeto Project as it made a thorough organizational and financial
review of all aspects of the hydro project and defined the appropriate arrangements for project
execution prior to commencement of construction.
Nangbeto Hydroelectric Project
4.02        In overall terms, the construction of the dam, power station and transmission lines
went smoothly. Timely implementation was undoubtedly assisted by the thorough preparatory
work carried out under the Engineering and Technical Assistance Credits. The setting up of the
Project Directorate within CEB prior to Board presentation was another contributing factor. The
Panel of Independent Experts set up under the project to review the design of the dam and to
monitor progress during construction provided CEB with valuable advice and helped reduce costs
through modifications they proposed.



- 4 -
4.03         The call for bids was issued in July 1983, after the IDA appraisal mission. Bi.
evaluation was completed well before Board presentation and the procurement arrangements
were finalized with all the cofinanciers4, at a specially-convened donors' meeting in February
1984. This enabled an early start to construction as CEB was in a position to sign contracts with
suppliers shortly after Credit signature (July 1984) and well before the date of Credit
effectiveness. Thanks to its healthy financial position, CEB was able to pay the necessary
advances to the contractors in order to enable construction to begin in September 1984. A
potential delay of 6 months was thus avoided as the Credit did not become effective till Marcii
1985.
4.04         This delay was mainly due to the extensive legal documentation that had to be
ratified in the two countries for the ten different loans/grants relating to the project. Tht.
Borrowers' cumbersome legal procedures also contributed to the delay. Despite the fact that the
bulk of funds took the form of parallel rather than joint-financing agreements, cross-effectiveness
clauses meant that all the financing was held up until all the formalities had been completed for
every donor. However, for a project of this nature it would have been impossible to avoid the
cross-effectiveness requirement that virtually all donors insisted on.
Dam and power plant construction
4.05         The work adhered strictly to the schedule drawn up by the supervising engineers,
despite the heaviest rainfall in 20 years during the 1985 rainy season. No unforeseen difficulties
were encountered and because of better than expected geological conditions, significant savings
were achieved, particularly with regard to the volume of excavation carried out and the quantity
of concrete cast.  At the time of peak activity in mid-1986, 1350 local workers and 75
expatriates were employed on the site. Good rains in the summer of 1987 meant that the
reservoir was entirely filled and the first generating unit of the power plant went into service in
September 1987. The second unit was commissioned a month later.
4.06         CEB had recruited about 20 staff to run the plant in sufficient time so that they
could be trained on similar power plants abroad before the completion of the Nangbeto project.
They were all present at the time of commissioning, enabling CEB to take over plant operations
immediately, without recourse to large scale technical assistance.
Population Resettlement
4.07         The creation of a reservoir of about 180 sq. km behind the dam necessitated the
resettlement of nearly 11,000 rural people living in 39 villages. 18 new regrouped villages in
4 The project was cofinanced by CCCE and FAC (France), CIDA (Canada), AfDB, OPEC
Fund, BADEA, Kuwait Fund, KfW (Germany) and UNDP.



previously uninhabited areas were set up as part of the project, each with access routes, hand-
operated tubewells5 and latrines. All existing facilities in the old villages such as primary
schools were rebuilt and some additional communal buildings (eg grain storage warehouses) were
provided. Farmers were allocated land for cultivation commensurate with the holdings they
exploited prior to relocation. The resettlement program was designed by CEB staff after the
plan submitted by consultants was found to be inappropriate for Togolese rural conditions. It was
then implemented entirely by CEB without outside assistance. The affected population was
actively involved in the design of the program and participated in the construction of the new
housing. Rather than build replacement housing along standardized lines, CEB decided to
provide the affected families with minimum, semi-permanent shelter in the new villages while
fully compensating them for their lost homes, thereby giving them the freedom to rebuild
according to their own requirements and tastes. Food aid provided by WFP was distributed by
CEB during the agricultural season that was disturbed by the resettlement. Funds were provided
for religious ceremonies held at the time of departure and arrival in the new villages. With the
exception of the undue delay in payment of the compensation for the value of lost dwellings6,
the resettlement operation was successfully completed on schedule before reservoir filling began.
No adverse incidents or hostile reactions on the part of the affected villagers were reported.
Public Health
4.08         Periodic surveys of the prevalence of Bilharzia and Malaria were carried out under
the project from 1985 through 1988 to ensure that the incidence of these water-related diseases
did not rise as a result of the project. However, the follow-up surveys that were initially
envisaged for three years after project completion7, were not carried out from 1989 onwards
and the present situation is unknown. The environmental impact analysis of a future project
downstream from Nangbeto should include a review of the health of villagers affected by the
construction of Nangbeto.
5 62 tubewells were drilled in total, a number considerably in excess of the Togolese norm
of 1 well per 500 inhabitants.
6Payments were initially held up because of the closure of the rural development bank which
was to make the payments. By the time new banking arrangements were made, CEB was faced
with a cash flow crisis with the result that the final payments to the villagers did not take place
till 1990.
' In a side letter (dated July 26, 1984) to the DCA the Togolese Government and CEB
undertook to continue "detailed work on resettlement...for at least three years after reservoir
filling".



-6-
Ecological protection
4.09        In order to ensure that the quality of water in the lake would be acceptable, 4500
ha of wooded terrain was cleared before flooding took place. The possibility of utilizing the
wood for charcoal production was studied but was found to be uneconomic, given the isolation
of the site and the distance from large towns.
4.10        A multi-disciplinary team from the University of Benin studied the flora and fauna
of the affected region prior to flooding and determined that no special measures were required
for the protection of the prevalent species as they were sufficiently well represented elsewhere
in Togo.
Other Nangbeto project components
4.11  CEET: The Nangbeto Project financed scholarships for CEET staff to be trained at the
ESIE engineering school as well as in-house training courses for lower-level employees. Data
processing hardware, software and training for accounting, billing inventory and personnel
management were also provided under the project.
4.12  SBEE:  Numerous training courses were financed by the project in the fields of
distribution system maintenance, diesel plant operations, computerization and customer
management. Some computer and communications equipment was also acquired. Total use of
the Credit by SBEE amounted to SDR 1.2 million.
Studies
4.13        The hydroelectric potential of the Oueme River in Benin was studied under the
Nangbeto project and a potential site for future development, Ketou, was identified. The
hydrology and geology of the Ouem6 basin were studied and extensive aerial mapping of the
region was carried out. A prefeasibility study of the Ketou site was also carried out under the
project. The cost of these studies was about US$ 1.7 million.
4.14        The Nangbeto Project also financed the feasibility study, detailed engineering and
preparation of the bidding documents for the Adjarala site on the Mono River downstream from
Nangbeto, which had earlier been identified as the next most attractive hydro site for
development in the two countries. About US$ 4.3 million of the Nangbeto Credit was used for
this component. Further preparatory work on the Adjalara site, (including the Environmental
Impact Analysis) is being carried out under the ongoing Engineering and TA Project (Cr.2366-
BEN/2367-TO).



-7-
Project Costs and Financing
4.15        The project was initially expected to cost US$127 million including contingencies,
with interest during construction (IDC) expected to amount to a further US$ 12.6 million. These
cost estimates were based on the actual bids received, thereby minimizing the risk of significant
variations. However, the different modifications to the project during construction recommended
by the panel of independent experts all served to bring down the final cost. In addition, the
project benefited from better than expected geological conditions at the dam site. At end-1988,
when virtually all outstanding payments relating to the project had been made, the final cost was
US$ 117.4 million'. IDC added a further US$6 mn. to this figure. The cost savings of nearly
8% in dollar terms was achieved despite the very sharp decline in the value of the dollar during
the construction period9.
4.16        The cost savings did not affect all the cofinanciers equally. In most cases,
undisbursed balances were cancelled. However, IDA, CCCE and KfW agreed to allow the
savings to be used for other project-related items. In the case of the IDA credit, SDR 6.1
million, or about 20% of the total, was reallocated to cover activities that were less directly
linked to the power plant, but which remained consistent with the original objectives of the
project as enunciated in the SAR.
4.17        The three main additional items financed by IDA out of the remainder of the
Nangbeto Credits were the computerization of CEB, the paving of the 18 km Akpare-Nangbeto
access road and the construction of 50 units of workers' housing at the dam site.
4.18        As late as 1988, computers were not used in CEB. Following a study of CEB
needs by consultants, a computerization plan including staff training, was prepared and
equipment purchased. The cost of the program, including software packages and training, was
CFAF 220 million (US$ 0.7 million). It was successfully implemented and CEB's billing,
accounting, personnel and administrative records are now computerized. The annual accounts
from 1991 onwards are prepared using the new system. Today, use of PCs among staff is
widespread and CEB's own training center holds regular courses for staff of all the three utilities
on the use of PCs.
8 Payments in different currencies were converted to US$ at the rate prevailing on the day
of settlement.
9 The exchange rate prevailing in February 1984 used in the SAR was CFAF 392/US$. By
end-1987 the rate had fallen by 27 % to CFAF 286/US$. Most of the project financing was
dollar-linked while the bulk of the payments were in DM, FF and SWFr. The adverse effect
of the fall in the dollar on the cost of the project was mitigated by the fact that very substantial
payments were made to contractors in 1985 while the dollar was still higher than the rate used
at the time of appraisal.

4.19        The workers' housing at Nangbeto was built in 1990-91 at a cost of CFAF 505
million (US$ 1.7 million) and the road was completed in mid-1992 at a cost of CFAF I billion
(US$ 3.4 million), thereby completely utilizing the funds remaining in the Credit.
5. PROJECT RESULTS
5.01        Both Projects can be said to have achieved their objectives as CEB successfully
prepared and completed construction of its first power generating plant on schedule and below
cost, despite having no prior experience in managing large projects of this nature. Furthermore,
the Nangbeto plant has now been in service for five years without any major technical problems.
It has also produced energy above the estimated average output of the plant in three out of the
five years. CEB today is a mature entity with an experienced, competent and motivated staff
capable of successfully executing large and complex investment projects in the future. Sector
planning and coordination also improved as a result of the project and the creation of a
Permanent Coordinating Committee of the three General Managers, supported by working-level
committees on specific topics, ensures that sector planning and development is not dispersed and
efforts duplicated. The two distribution companies also benefited directly from both projects in
the field of training and computerization.
5.02        In broad terms, there is no evidence of any negative impact from the project on
the physical environment. However, no scientific study of the downstream effects of the dam
has yet been done to examine any possible impact on salinity, sedimentation, erosion of the
lagoon.
5.03        The populations displaced by the project do not appear to be worse off as a result,
although the absence of a socio-economic survey of the new villages makes it difficult to assess
whether the living conditions today are superior to those in the old villages. However, the
report of a visit by a sociologist to some of the new villages in mid-1992, five years after the
resettlement indicates that there is now considerable pressure on public facilities like schools and
on land for cultivation, due both to demographic growth as well as inward migration. Numerous
cases of non-functioning tubewells were also cited as the villages have to rely on outside
assistance for maintenance and repair. These are common problems in rural areas and CEB,
whose responsibility for the infrastructure in the new villages ceased at the end of the
construction phase, cannot be expected to provide this service. However, the design of the
resettlement program could have included a small component for the training of a selected
villager in basic pump maintenance.
5.04        Construction of the project provided a brief boost to employment and incomes of
several thousand laborers, but has only created a relatively small number of permanent additional



-9-
jobs. Fishing in the lake has the potential to contribute substantially to incomes and employment
in the area, but has been largely unexploited so far"0.
Economic Impact and Benefits
5.05        The main economic benefit from the project was expected to be the hydro
electricity at a cost lower than the thermal alternative. At the time of appraisal, an overall load
growth rate for the CEB system of 9.1 % was used. This was significantly less than the average
of 15.9% recorded over the previous decade (1972-82) and was believed to be conservative.
In order to meet this level of demand growth", additional generation capacity was required,
given both contractual as well as technical limits to the quantities CEB could import from
Ghana. This was the principal justification for the Nangbeto project.
5.06        However, contrary to expectations, demand growth did not materialize and CEB's
sales in 1989 (496 Gwh) were at the same level as in 1982. Sales have risen during the past
three years, and in 1992 reached 581 Gwh, largely as a result of economic recovery in Benin.
Imports from Ghana are now once again at their 1982 level of about 500 GWh, after having
dropped sharply in the years immediately following the commissioning of the Nangbeto plant.
In effect, the lower than forecast demand growth meant that the additional generation capacity
estimated to be needed by 1988 was not required till 1990. Consequently, the energy output
from Nangbeto initially substituted for the energy imported from Ghana rather than being
incremental to it. As the cost of energy from Nangbeto was higher12 than the price of imported
electricity from Ghana, economic benefits from the project were also deferred.
5.07        This outcome would have been impossible to foresee at the time the key decisions
were made on the timing of the project because it is the cumulative result of a series of
unfavorable factors. As stated above, the load forecast used at the time of appraisal was already
over 40 percent lower than the rate experienced over the previous decade. The sharp decline in
the performance of the economy in Benin prior to 1990, followed by the subsequent slump in
Togo could not have been anticipated. However, it does appear that the load forecast did not
adequately take into account the likely effect on residential demand of the very substantial tariff
10 From 1987 to 1991 fishing in the lake was prohibited under instructions from the Office
of the President of Togo. The ban was lifted for a brief period in 1991-92, during which time
there was a rapid growth in fishing, particularly by people from outside the area. Following
disputes between fishermen and locals and the general lack of any regulatory framework
governing the activity, the local administrative authorities decided to reimpose the ban till the
necessary rules had been introduced. Preparation of these regulations has since been held up
by the ongoing political crisis.
" The SAR estimated that in 1990, the last year of the projections, 343 Gwh of domestic
generation would be required and as the firm output of Nangbeto was only 148 GWh, all its
output would be fully absorbed.
12 The financial cost of production at the Nangbeto plant is 24 CFAF/kWh, including debt
service (10 CFAF/kWh), and depreciation (CFAF 12 CFAF/kWh). The present price of energy
from Ghana is USc5/kwh or about 12 CFAF.

increases of 1984-5 which pushed up the average retail tariff in the two countries to about CFAF
58/kWh'3. As this was accompanied by falling real incomes in both countries, the affordability
of electricity became a real issue for many lower-income consumers.  Both distribution
companies also had high connection charges for new customers and did not have a policy of
actively promoting electricity sales. Furthermore, extension and rehabilitation of the distribution
networks did not begin till 1990'4, keeping down demand growth at a time when there were
no supply constraints. In future, large generation projects should be accompanied by parallel
efforts to increase sales as rapidly as possible.
5.08         The internal economic rate of return on the project has been recalculated using
the actual costs of construction. Valuing the future average output of the plant over a 30-year
period at the present CEB bulk tariff produces an IERR of about 10%, the same as that
estimated at the time of appraisal. The IERR is not very sensitive to the energy output of the
plant. If a 10 % higher figure than the appraisal estimate for the average output is used, the
IERR rises to 11%15. On the other hand, if the extra cost (3 US cents/kWh), incurred during
the years 1987-90 by producing from Nangbeto rather than importing from Ghana is deducted
from the value of the benefits, the IERR falls to 9%. However, the IERR is affected by the
future CFAF/US$ exchange rate used to value the plant output. Details are contained in Table
6 (Part III).
Financial Performance
5.09         CEB's financial position has been highly satisfactory throughout the 1980s, with
a healthy debt/equity ratio, ample debt service coverage and a consistently positive net income.
This is in large measure due to the level of the bulk tariff of about CFAF 24/kWh that it charges
to CEET and SBEE. This tariff was set in 1984 to enable CEB to generate resources to cover
its 18% share of the investment in Nangbeto. Under the terms of the IDA Credit, CEB was to
set its tariffs from 1987 onwards at a level sufficient to self-finance 45% of its annual investment
program, pending the setting of an appropriate target rate of return (ROR) on assets. Under the
subsequent Engineering and TA Project, (Cr. 2366/2367) a 6% ROR on net current fixed assets
was agreed as a financial target for all three power companies. CEB has been able to achieve
or exceed this target during the past few years while maintaining its 1984 tariff levels.
5.10         As about 70 percent of its supply is low-cost Ghanaian energy, CEB has earned
13 This is equivalent to USc 21/Kwh at today's exchange rate.
14 the IDA follow-up distribution rehabilitation and extension projects for Togo and Benin
were approved in mid-1990 and mid-1991 respectively. Their implementation has suffered from
considerable delays.
'5 Actual output over the period 1988-92 was about 15% higher than the estimated average
(148 GWh); there is reason to believe that this long-term average may have been underestimated.

significant profits over and above its investment requirements. It has been allowed to keep these
profits"6, as retained earnings, enabling it to pre-finance the start of construction of the
Nangbeto project and helping to meet unexpected strains on its cash flow when SBEE
accumulated large arrears to it in 1988-89. At the present time, these reserves will assist CEB
in meeting payments to Ghana during a difficult period when CEET is unable to pay CEB for
its electricity consumption. However, the initial justification for the policy of building up
substantial reserves was to contribute to future investment projects. In retrospect, it may have
been appropriate to set tariffs somewhat lower, in the light of their impact on demand growth
in the mid-1980s and the accumulation of reserves. Responding to growing consumer pressure
on the distribution companies, CEB has recently introduced a small cut in its bulk tariff.
6. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
6.01        CEB is a well-run organization and the Nangbeto plant is likely to function
without major problems for decades to come. Economic benefits will accrue to an increasing
extent as the demand for electricity increases and also if the cost of imported energy and/or
thermal generation rises in real terms. Benefits from fishing should also rise considerably once
this activity resumes.
7. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01        In overall terms, the Bank's performance was good. Preparation was thorough
and the appraisal was exhaustive. Supervision was carried out regularly; at least twice a year
throughout the life of the project.  Adequate resources were committed to this activity,
particularly at key points during physical construction. The project also benefited from the
continuity of Bank staff involved with it.
8. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
8.01        CEB's performance was good throughout the project. Quarterly progress reports
were prepared regularly and promptly during the construction phase. CEB's audited accounts
are submitted to the Bank annually and without delay. Construction of the Nangbeto plant and
the resettlement program was well managed by the Project Directorate assisted by the
supervising engineers. The Project Directorate was run by a competent and efficient senior
engineer who was also allowed a high degree of autonomy by the Director-General of CEB.
These were critical elements in the success of the project. Its staff were dynamic and motivated
and as most are still with CEB, the organization continues to benefit from the experience they
gained during project implementation, even though the Project Directorate was wound up after
16 Which are not subject to taxation.

implementation was complete.
9. PROJECT RELATIONSHIPS
9.01        Relations between the Bank and CEB were excellent throughout the period, in part
due to the high degree of staff continuity on both sides. Relations with cofinanciers were also
good and their large number does not appear to have created difficulties. The Bank's leadership
was explicitly sought by both governments and CEB and was thus accepted by the other
cofinanciers. Most cofinanciers also delegated supervision responsibility to the Bank, which
routinely made its supervision reports available to them. Good relations also prevailed between
CEB and the two Governments as these latter generally respected CEB's autonomy and did not
interfere in project matters.
10. CONSULTING SERVICES
10.1        Consultants were used extensively to carry out technical studies during project
preparation, to assist in the procurement process and for supervision of the contractors during
construction. Their performance was generally of good quality.
11. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
11.01       The documentation available on the Nangbeto project is extensive and this greatly
facilitated preparation of the PCR. As the SAR was finalized after bids had been analyzed for
the main components, the project costs, financing and procurement sections provided a good
frame of reference for supervision. CEB prepared a detailed financial report in early 1988, once
construction had been completed and the final costs were known. This was widely circulated
to all cofinanciers and facilitated decisions on the use of the unutilized funds. A summary report
on the physical aspects of construction prepared by the consulting engineers at the end of the
project also constitutes a useful record of project execution.
