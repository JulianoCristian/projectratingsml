the First Social Inclusion\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Peru were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            programmatic development policy instrument proved to have\n            weaknesses in context of this operation. The design of the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system needs to ensure\n            that the set of indicators are properly defined, ensuring\n            clarity of measuring methods, data collection, and\n            availability of baseline. The selection of indicators needs\n            to take into account that they should be achievable within a\n            short DPL framework. The indicator on training to promoters\n            for family support was based on an activity that the\n            government needed to scale up after piloting. Maintaining a\n            fluid communication with the counterpart proved to be\n            crucial, especially when executing complex reforms.\n            Government commitment and the development of a sector\n            strategy are key elements for the success and sustainability\n            of social inclusion policies. The combination of instruments\n            (DPL, technical assistance loan (TAL), non-lending technical\n            assistance (NLTA), and sector-wide approach (SWAP) proved to\n            be effective to provide adequate and timely response to the\n            Ministerio de Desarrollo e Inclusi\u00f3n Social (MIDIS) in the\n            area of social inclusion."}, "docdt": "2015-12-15T01:04:01Z"}
