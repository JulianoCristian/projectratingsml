National Environmental Policy Reform\n            Project's objective is to establish the basis for\n            improved environmental management by defining environmental\n            policy reforms and elaborating a National Environmental\n            Management Program (NEMP) through a learning and\n            participatory process. There are three components in this\n            project. First, supporting policy and institutional reform\n            will define priority legal, institutional, and fiscal\n            reforms to improve environmental management, define sectoral\n            action plans for environmental management reform, and\n            develop a NEMP. Second, developing pilot activities will\n            develop innovative models for natural resource management,\n            and increase decentralization of environmental functions.\n            The third component, aiming at building capacity for project\n            management and providing technical training, will strengthen\n            capacity for environmental planning and management in key\n            environmental agencies; ensure efficient and effective\n            project implementation; and develop the needed human\n            resources for the new institutional arrangements resulting\n            from the reforms."}, "docdt": "1998-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
