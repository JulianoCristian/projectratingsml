Some lessons learned included: adjustment\n            credits are not effective mechanisms for promoting complex\n            institutional and management reforms in higher education,\n            and perhaps not in the health and education sectors\n            generally. In order to safeguard quality objectives under\n            higher education projects, explicit attention should be\n            given to managing and monitoring unit costs per student as a\n            key indicator of educational quality. Higher education\n            project objectives should not only promote cost efficiency\n            and effective resource allocation, but also the parallel\n            need for establishing mechanisms and procedures for quality\n            assurance. The diversity of university circumstances in\n            Nigeria (e.g., size, mission, location, age) is too great to\n            be encompassed by a single uniform set of eligibility\n            criteria. Finally, project re-structuring can be an be an\n            effective response to a poorly performing project."}, "docdt": "1997-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
