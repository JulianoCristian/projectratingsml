overall objective of the Federal\n            Universities Development Sector Adjustment Credit Project is\n            to assist the Government in its efforts to ensure that the\n            federal universities will improve the effectiveness and\n            relevance of their teaching and research while at the same\n            time becoming more cost effective.  More specifically the\n            program aims to : a) encourage universities to reduce the\n            recurrent cost per student borne by the Government; b)\n            increase internally generated income; c) reduce overstaffing\n            and other areas of wastage; d) make more effective use of\n            scarce resources available through funds transfers to areas\n            more critical for quality teaching and research; e) help\n            accelerate the pace of reequipping academic space; and f)\n            strengthen institutions for planning, budgeting and procurement."}, "docdt": "1990-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
