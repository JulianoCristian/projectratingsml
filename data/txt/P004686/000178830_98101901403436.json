35,000 ha in 1977-78; and about 50,000 ha\n            in 1978-79 and 1979-80 respectively, for a total of about\n            160,000 ha (of which 80,000 ha would be incremental); (b)\n            increasing the capacity of the Fund to cope with the\n            production of high quality planting material for an annual\n            replanting program of 50,000 ha; (c) maintenance of all\n            immature replantings; (d) establishment of about 400 Group\n            Marketing Organizations (GMOs); (e) increasing the use of\n            modern yield stimulation techniques during the final three\n            years prior to replanting on about 100,000 ha p.a.; (f)\n            expanding training programs for Fund staff and for rubber\n            smallholders, in techniques of planting, field maintenance,\n            tapping, processing and marketing; (g) technical assistance\n            for project planning and implementation by UNDP/FAO; and (h)\n            establishing a monitoring system to evaluate the\n            socio-economic impact of, and rubber growers incentives and\n            participation in, the replanting program."}, "docdt": "1976-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
