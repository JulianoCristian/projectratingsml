F. Results Framework Analysis

     (a) Program Development Objectives (from approval document)
The objective of the new series of two single tranche Economic Reform Support Grants (ERSG IV and V)
was: (i) to consolidate results obtained during the first programmatic series of two DPOs (ERSG II and
III); (ii) to support the continuation of reforms in the public finance management system (in order to
improve accountability and transparency in public spending); and (iii) to reenergize the reform process in
private sector development (through the promotion of private sector investment, energy sector reform and
the modernization of export sectors). The fifth ERSG also aimed at helping the country cope with the
impact of the food and fuel price crisis (through key policy measures aimed at protecting essential social
programs against the effects of major variations in international food and fuel prices on the most
vulnerable households).

Comment                   The lack of data may indicate that progress made is modest. Yet, the reliability of power
                          supply is critical for private enterprises, notably artisans and small businesses, which
                          dominate the private sector in Burundi.

                          improve its operational performance, the beginning of negotiations for the privatization of
                          Hotel Sources du Nil, and plans to separate the profitable operations of SOBUGEA from the

                              program progresses very slowly: lack of expertise in the agency responsible for the
                              program; no broad political consensus behind the reform and limited interest of potential

Date Achieved                       2010                   12/31/2011                12/31/2012
Comment                    Target met. Modest increase in allocations gives some strength to policy measures
                           introduced in 2005-06 but inadequately implemented at least initially.

  The above tables show that all the PFM indicators of ERSG IV and V have been achieved. In addition, six
  of the seven PSD indicators of ERSG IV have also been met. More problematic was implementation of
  the PSD indicators of ERSG V, notably with respect to the privatization of public enterprises and the
  restructuring of export filières. The three PSD indicators of ERSG V concerning API and REGIDEAO
  were met but the two other indicators (privatization of 5 public enterprises and sale of 60 coffee washing
  stations) were only partly met. While the restructuring of the coffee sector made some partial but
  significant progress during ERSG V, the public enterprise privatization program is stalled. Persuading all
  the stakeholders to support the privatization process proved to be particularly difficult in a complex
  political environment.

  G. Ratings of Program Performance in ISRs

  Because of the short time elapsing between the approval of a DPO and the follow-up operation,
  supervision of DPO 1 (ERSG IV) and preparation of DPO 2 (ERSG V) were performed simultaneously
  and no ISR was prepared. A number of aide-memoires were drafted and sent to the government (see
  summary of aide-memoire of the March-April 2011 mission in Annex 6). These aide-memoires, which
  reflected the results of extensive discussions with the government: (i) commented on achievements and
  failures in implementing ongoing DPOs; and (ii) made suggestions on how to improve the performance of
  the government and, if needed, adjust some of the program components. Although no specific rating was
  quoted in these aide-memoires, the comments made on implementation clearly showed that the
  performance of the government was viewed as fully satisfactory, except with respect to the public
  enterprise privatization process.

  H. Restructuring

  Not Applicable. ERSG IV and ERSG V were not restructured during implementation.

     I.    PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1. Context at appraisal:

1.         The context at appraisal was dominated by a number of positive and negative factors.

2.      A positive factor was the successful implementation of the first programmatic series of
DPOs in Burundi, (i.e. ERSG II/ERSG III). Approved by the Board in 2009, ERSG II supported
reforms in public finance management, legal and institutional measures aimed at improving the
business environment, and structural reforms in the coffee sector. Approved in 2010, ERSG III had
similar objectives, but also supported reforms in the domestic petroleum sector viewed as essential
to stimulate private sector development.

3.      The June 2011 ICR of the first programmatic series concluded that implementation of
ERSG II was moderately satisfactory but progress achieved under ERSG III was fully satisfactory.
Indeed, during implementation of the series, the government carried out important reforms, notably
in public finance management: (i) adoption/implementation of a new Public Finance Framework
Law (Loi Organique); (ii) closing several off-budget accounts; (iii) definition of a comprehensive
PFM strategy; and (iv) initial implementation of the recently approved procurement code. In
addition the government sold 13 coffee washing stations to a reputable international investor and
adopted a quasi-automatic price adjustment mechanism for petroleum products.

4.       The impact of these measures was significant. After a decade of recession during the civil
war, and six years of economic stagnation during the first half of the 2000s (when the civil war
officially ended), implementation of ERSG I, II and III helped restore the confidence of the donor
community and stimulated growth which averaged 4.26 percent in 2006-2009.2 This was due not
only to large inflows of development assistance and externally financed public investments, but also
to a significant increase in private investment from less than 2 percent of GDP during the first half
of the 2000s to about 9 percent in 2006-2009. At the same time, social indicators (e.g. primary
school enrollment ratios and access to primary health care services) improved as a result of
measures (free primary education and health care services for children under five and women giving
birth), which were initiated in 2005 and 2006 but were not fully implemented during the first years.

5.      The positive results obtained during the first programmatic series of ERSGs encouraged the
government and the Bank to prepare and implement a second series of DPOs with similar
objectives.

6.      The combination of two negative factors – renewed political tensions in Burundi and
changes in the international economic environment – began to influence the country’s situation and
prospects when the Bank appraised and approved ERSG IV and V.

7.      The relative success of the political transition – adoption of a new constitution and a first
round of democratic elections in 2005, implementation of the cease-fire agreement with the FNL in
2008-2009, the (slow) progress of the Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration process, and
improved security – had played a major role in stimulating economic recovery during the ERSG II
and III period. However, a second round of democratic elections in 2010 led to controversy and
sparked violence. Although the local elections of May 2010 were viewed as reasonably fair and
transparent by the international community, the results were challenged by thirteen opposition
parties which boycotted national legislative and presidential elections. Sporadic local attacks caused

    Lower than the 7 percent target of the first PRSP, but much higher than the 1-2 percent of the early 2000s.

losses of life. Consolidating its political base and restoring peace and security became again the
main objective of the government, although continuing ongoing macroeconomic and PFM reforms
remained a priority.

8.      The international environment also had a negative influence on the country’s performance.
The rise of international food and fuel prices in 2008 and 2011 created inflationary pressures as the
CPI index rose by 26 percent in 2008 and again by 15 percent in 2011. In addition, the country felt
the impact of the global economic and financial crisis, as a result of lower than expected transfers
and workers’ remittances, decline in world coffee prices, lower than expected FDIs and declining
investor interest in the coffee sector. Both external and domestic factors, including the continuing
shortage of energy, caused the GDP growth rate to go down to less than 4 percent in 2009 and 2010.
Consequently, when the government embarked on the second programmatic series of DPOs (ERSG
IV and V), Burundi remained a fragile post-conflict country, with major institutional and capacity
constraints and uncertain prospects.

9.       Through its effective implementation of ERSG II and III, the government had shown its
determination to improve its economic and public finance management and remained fully
committed to the reform process, provided the pace of reforms was compatible with the need for
political stabilization. The situation fully justified the active involvement of the Bank and other
donors in economic and financial support to Burundi, together with an effort to focus assistance and
reforms on a small number of critical issues, given the country’s political and capacity constraints.
In this context, a particularly high priority had to be given to creating a favorable business
environment, through a combination of legal and regulatory reforms, infrastructure development
(energy), privatization of public enterprises, and coffee sector reforms.

10.      The justification for another programmatic series of DPOs was the same as for the first
series in 2009, namely, to give more impetus to the reform process, strengthen the government
commitment, improve the predictability of budget support, and encourage other donors to better
plan and implement their own budget support.

1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

11.      The objectives of the new series of two single tranche Economic Reform Support Grants
were broadly similar to the objectives of ERSG II and III. The goal was to consolidate results
obtained during the first programmatic series of DPOs, namely, to: (i) support the continuation of
reforms in the public finance management system (to improve accountability and transparency in
public spending); and (ii) reenergize the reform process in private sector development (through the
promotion of private sector investment, rehabilitation of the energy sector, privatization of public
enterprises and modernizing the agricultural export sector). The fifth ERSG also aimed at helping
the country cope with the impact of the ongoing food and fuel price crisis (through key policy
measures aimed at protecting the most vulnerable households and essential social programs against
the effects of major variations in international food and fuel prices.

12.       The key outcome indicators were:

    1. PFM Reforms
        Percentage of national budget that had followed the MTEF process;
        Amount of arrears toward suppliers (over 60 days) as a percent of total expenditures;
        Amount of civilian wage bill paid through the newly-installed MIS; and
        Public wage bill as a percent of GDP.


                                                  2 
 
    2. PSD Reforms
       Number of dossiers and amount of investment registered with the Investment Promotion
         Agency (API);
       Average time taken by the API to process a dossier;
       Percentage of REGIDESO subscribers participating in a pre-payment program;
       Average unplanned power outages in Bujumbura (number/year);
       Number of restructuring and privatizations of public enterprises initiated; and
       Number of publicly-owned coffee washing stations sold.

    3. Food and fuel price crisis-related measures
       The share of the budget allocated to the school feeding program (in primary schools); and
       The share of the budget allocated to the free health care program for children under five and
         women giving birth.

1.3. Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
     reasons/justification:

Not Applicable. The PDOs were not revised.

1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

Like previous ERSGs, the new programmatic series supported reforms highly focused on two main
policy issues: (i) public finance management; and (ii) private sector development (including reform
of the export filières). In addition, ERSG V included modest measures aimed at reducing poverty
and protecting vulnerable groups.

      -   Public Finance Management: ERSG IV and V emphasized four important sub-objectives:
          (i) strengthening the links between the country’s strategic planning instruments (including
          the PRSP) and the government budget (through the development of central and sector
          MTEFs); (ii) improving budget execution, through strict implementation of quarterly
          commitment plans (based on realistic cash management plans) and stronger controls; and
          (iii) improving the management of human resources, and reducing the share of the
          government wage bill in total public spending and GDP. In addition ERSG V aimed at
          improving access of the public to financial information (through publication of budgets and
          budget execution reports on the government web site).
      -   Private Sector Development: The new series was designed to: (i) stimulate private
          investment, by strengthening the newly created Investment Promotion Agency (API), and
          improving power supply, viewed by small and medium-scale businesses as essential to
          enable them to expand their activity; and (ii) prepare and implement public enterprise
          privatization plans.
      -   Reform of the coffee filière (and other export sectors): The series also aimed at: (i) more
          than quadrupling the number of coffee washing stations sold to private investors (from 13
          to 60) and (ii) initiating similar reforms with respect to the tea filière.
      -   Reducing Poverty and Protecting Vulnerable Groups: The series provided for increased
          budget allocations to: (i) primary school feeding programs; and (ii) primary health care
          services for children under five and women giving birth.

1.5. Revised Policy Areas:
Not Applicable. No revision was undertaken.

1.6. Other significant changes:
Not Applicable.

II.        KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1. Program Performance:

13.     Prior actions: Annex 4 lists all the prior actions mentioned in the Legal Agreements for
ERSG IV and V. All these prior actions were completed before Board approval of each operation.
This is not surprising given the strong commitment of the government to the reform process, the
country’s need for budget support, and, more importantly, the prudent step-by-step approach
adopted by the government and the Bank in the design of the program and the selection of prior
actions (see Box 1 below)

      Box 1 – Examples of the step-by-step approach adopted in the selection of prior actions

           The number of prior actions envisaged in ERSG IV (6) and ERSG V (8) was substantially lower
            than for the previous programmatic series (10 prior actions for ERSG II and another set of 10 for
            ERSG III).
           The new series (mainly ERSG V) introduced only a small number of new initiatives (new payroll
            management system, publication of budgets and budget execution reports, law on pre-
            cooperatives). In fact, most of the prior actions of the new series (two thirds in the case of ERSG
            IV and more than one third in the case of ERSG V) aimed at consolidating measures already
            initiated in the context of previous DPOs (development of the MTEF process, improvement of
            quarterly commitment plans, promotion of private investment through new laws and new
            institutions, privatization of public enterprises, improved viability of REGIDESO through pre-
            payments and revised tariffs). In addition the prior action of ERSG V concerning tax reductions on
            petroleum products was similar to measures initiated in the context of an earlier Food Crisis
            Response DPO.
           A particularly good example of this step-by-step approach is the development of the MTEFs. First,
            ERSG II introduced improved rules on budget preparation. Second, ERSG III tested the sector
            MTEF process on key ministries (agriculture, health and education). Third, ERSG IV developed a
            central MTEF. Fourth ERSG V stipulated that the 2012 budget should be based on the central
            MTEF already prepared for 2011-2013.
           Finally, the Bank showed flexibility, taking into account the political, technical and capacity
            constraints of the government at that time. For example some of the triggers initially envisaged for
            ERSG V were either modified (bidding documents for sale of washing stations), or postponed
            (updating information on civil service staff turnover since 2007) or removed (reform of Cour des
            Comptes) when the final list of prior actions was established.

14.      PDO indicators. As shown in Tables F (b) and (c) of the Results Framework Analysis,
all the PFM indicators of ERSG IV and V have been met.

           With the help of Bank-financed consultants and in cooperation with other donors, sector
            MTEFs were prepared for key economic and social sectors. This led to the preparation of
            Central MTEFs which influenced the formulation of the 2012 budget (framework letter
            and budget law). One should recognize, however, that the preparation of sector and
            central MTEFs is not yet fully integrated into the budget preparation process. A tool is
            available to central and sector ministries. It is not yet clear that it will be used
            systematically as one of the main budget preparation instruments.
           The preparation of realistic cash management plans and implementation of quarterly
            commitment plans for each spending ministry have enabled the government to avoid the
            accumulation of new arrears even when a shortage of domestic and external funds made it
            particularly difficult to achieve that goal.
           Oversight is improving. All the reports of the Cour des Comptes have been reviewed by
            the Parliament. Perhaps more importantly, budget laws and budget execution reports are
            being published on the website of the Ministry of Finance.
                                                        4 
 
         The civilian wage bill is managed through a computerized payroll management system
          integrated into the financial management information system run by the Ministry of
          Finance (SIGEFI).
         The size of the government wage bill, which until now was always growing, slightly
          decreased from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 12 percent in 2011.

15.       Less successful was implementation of the PSD indicators of the programmatic series.

         The Investment Promotion Agency, a new institution created to help new investors,
          improved its performance. It is now able to handle a larger number of applications and
          needs less time to process each application.
         To improve its financial viability, REGIDESO, the power utility company, has
          established a pre-payment system which now involves 75 percent of its subscribers.
          Nevertheless, the operational performance of the company remains inadequate and
          private businesses continue to complain about the frequency of power outages.
         No major progress has been made towards the privatization of the eight public enterprises
          targeted for privatization. 3 Technical and financial audits have been prepared and
          published. Action plans have been developed and a few measures have been taken to
          improve the performance of two public enterprises (new busses for the urban transport
          company, planned separation of profitable and non-profitable operations within Air
          Burundi) and the launch of negotiations for the sale of a third one (Hotel Sources du Nil),
          but recent discussions within the Parliament seem to indicate that the country’s
          privatization program has little public support.

16.      Somewhat more successful has been the restructuring of the coffee sector. After the sale
of thirteen washing stations to Webcor, twenty eight additional washing stations were sold to
domestic investors and one coffee milling plant was sold to a foreign investor. Nevertheless, more
needs to be done to achieve the objectives of the program, since 98 washing stations remain in the
public sector. The conflict between Webcor and its coffee growers on producer prices (See Box 2
below) may discourage local politicians from supporting future privatization schemes. It may also
discourage potential private investors from getting involved in the sector.

17.     A smaller component of the ERSG V program – aimed at mitigating the impact of the
food/fuel crisis on vulnerable groups – was effectively implemented.

         Budget allocations for the primary school feeding program were increased.
         The increase in budget allocations for health care services should help implement the
          gratuity of health care for children under five and women giving birth, a sound measure
          decided in 2005-2006, which initially was poorly implemented for lack of adequate
          funding.

                          Box 2. The privatization of the coffee washing stations

For many years, the government was reluctant to privatize coffee washing stations. Many Burundians did
not see the need for it. The staff of the public agencies had good reasons to oppose the reform and the
National Federation of Coffee Growers demanded access to a substantial share of the capital of the
privatized enterprises. The donor community encouraged the government to go ahead with the reform,
hoping that: (i) the privatized washing stations would produce high quality coffee that would command
high prices on the international market; and (ii) the reform would be accompanied by improvements in
cultivation practices (including rehabilitation of ageing plantations) that would help increase output and
improve quality.

A comprehensive study of the coffee sector (funded by the Bank-financed EMSP project) and a realistic
review of the performance and prospects of the public institutions managing the sector convinced the
government that it could not afford the growing cost of subsidizing these entities. The decision of the
government to initiate the privatization of the coffee sector was viewed by the donor community and the
private sector as a major breakthrough and a sign that the government was ready to implement a strategy
largely based on private sector development. Thirteen washing stations were purchased by Webcor in 2009
and 28 additional stations were purchased by domestic investors in 2012.

Multiple factors probably explain the lack of strong interest of major international investors in the
Burundian coffee sector. First, the local political situation is complex. Second, the global financial and
economic crisis may have played a role. Third, the conflict on producer prices between Webcor and the
farmers who sold their coffee beans to the company may also discourage future international investments
(See Annex 8). Fourth, the donor community did very little to help the coffee farmers rehabilitate ageing
plantation and improve cultivation practices.

Significant results were achieved by a small number of coffee growers and washing stations which were
rewarded for producing high-quality coffee. Prospects, however, remain uncertain. No one knows how
successful future sales of coffee processing facilities are likely to be and how fast the privatized washing
stations will be able to help develop and implement programs aimed at increasing output and improving
quality.

2.2. Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

18.     Government Ownership: The main positive factor was the commitment of the country’s
leadership to the objectives of the program and efforts made by the ministers responsible for the
overall management of the program (mainly finance and plan) to involve their colleagues and other
key officials in a policy debate aimed at mobilizing broader political support for the ongoing reform
program. The dialogue engaged on economic growth, fiscal policy and security issues in the context
of the high-level seminar of March 2011 was important to help create a national consensus and
better inform new members of the government on the difficult political and economic factors
dominating policy choices (See Annex 3). Although successful, this effort needs to be further
extended to a larger segment of the civil society, which does not always seem to recognize the
potential benefits of the reform program.

19.     Coordination Among stakeholders:  Another positive factor was the effort made by the
government, the Bank and other donors to carry out substantial economic and sector work to
improve knowledge and analysis of the country’s economic and sector situation and prospects, as
well as to help the government and the public better understand current constraints and alternative
policy choices. In addition to annual IMF reports on the country’s economic, monetary and fiscal
developments, the Bank prepared – jointly with the government – a CEM, which was submitted to
the Board in March 2011, and a series of policy notes on economic, fiscal and security issues based
on the discussions of the March 2011 seminar. The EMSP-financed project helped carry out a
comprehensive study of the coffee sector that provided the government with the data and analysis
necessary to make an informed decision on the future of the sector. In addition a PSIA study on the
                                                     6 
 
poverty and social impact of the coffee sector reform was performed before the reform and an ex-
post study is underway. The study showed that the reform would have a positive impact on rates of
poverty.

20.     Political Context:  The main negative factor was the political uncertainty created by
contested elections in 2010 and the continued influence of past conflicts on political attitudes.
Another negative factor was the opposition of segments of the civil society to at least some of the
components of the reform program. Despite its commitment to the reform objectives, the
government had to take into account the risk that more decisive action would exacerbate existing
tensions and reactivate past conflicts.   

21.       External Factors: Preparation and implementation of ERSG IV and V took place in a
negative external environment: not only the impact of the global economic crisis on exports
(notably in 2009), budget support and development assistance, but also the influence of high
international prices on domestic inflation, which peaked at 25 percent in March 2012. These
external factors intensified the negative reactions of parts of the population to elements of the
government’s reform program, including the opposition of many Bujumbura’s dwellers to power
tariff increases and of a number of coffee growers to the reform of the coffee sector.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

22.     Design: The government did not establish a new monitoring system for ERSG IV and V,
but continued to rely on the same institutions that were involved in the monitoring of previous
ERSG operations. The main institution responsible for monitoring the program is the Ministry of
Finance. The Ministry supervises not only budget planning and execution (and ongoing PFM
reforms), with the help of the computerized financial management information system created in
2006 (SIGEFI); it is also responsible for monitoring the other components of the program (PSD,
privatizations, REGIDESO, coffee sector restructuring, school feeding, etc.), in cooperation with
more specialized ministries and other entities: Governance and Privatization, SCEP (the office
responsible for public enterprises), Commerce, Agriculture, Education, etc. Within the Finance
Ministry a technical support unit (cellule d’appui) plays a coordinating role and is one of the main
interlocutors of donor agencies on policy reform issues.

23.     Implementation: The main monitoring instruments are budget execution reports (prepared
through SIGEFI) and internal and external controls (performed by the Inspection des Finances, the
Inspection Générale de l’Etat and the Cour des Comptes). The monitoring system functions
adequately with respect to the supervision of budget planning and execution and PFM reforms. The
Ministry of Finance and the cellule d’appui work under considerable pressure, since frequent
missions from the IMF, the World Bank and other donors visit the country to review
implementation of PFM and other reforms. Other ministries and institutions are less motivated to
act promptly and decisively. Discussions with the Bank are focused on meeting the targets of the
PDO indicators and progress towards implementing prior actions that would trigger future DPO
operations (See summary of Bank Aide-Memoire in Annex 7). Discussions between the
government and the Bank also help identify possible implementation issues that would justify
adjustments in the selection and design of future prior actions. (See last paragraph of Box 1 on the
revision of agreed triggers).

24.     Supervision of the public enterprise privatization program relies mainly on SCEP, the office
responsible for monitoring the operations of these enterprises. SCEP does not have the staff and the
authority necessary to manage effectively that function. However, the technical and financial audits
prepared with EMSP/SCEP financing helped the government realize that major reforms were


                                                 7 
 
needed to improve the performance and reduce the deficits of public enterprises and gradually
disengage the state from the sector.

2.4. Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

25.      Under the aegis of a new CAS FY2013-2016, approved by the Board in 2012, the Bank
was expected to launch a new series of programmatic DPOs (ERSG VI-VIII) that would aim at
remedying weaknesses identified during implementation of ERSG IV and V and would also
support a new generation of policy reforms. The Sixth Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG
VI), approved by the Board in October 2012, is the first in a series of two DPOs designed to
leverage the government’s overarching objective of transforming its economic development
trajectory from a fragile post-conflict equilibrium to a more resilient growth-focused path. The
program aims at: (i) promoting greater efficiency and transparency in public spending; (ii)
improving conditions for private investment and promoting private participation and market
access in the export and service sectors; and (iii) decreasing the vulnerability of households to
shocks through an improved social protection system. All these objectives are broadly similar to
the development objectives of ERSG IV and V. Continuity remains an important component of
the strategy of the government and the Bank in this area.

III.    ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

Rating: Satisfactory

26.     Relevance of objectives: The selected areas of policy reform and the program development
objectives were consistent with the country’s PRSP of 2006 and the FY2008-2012 CAS (See Box 3
below). They also reflected some of the most critical requirements of the Burundian economy at
that time. They should continue to dominate government policies and donor programs.

    Box 3. The objectives of the ERSG IV and V series were compatible with the priorities of the
                                 2006 PRSP and the 2008-2012 CAS

The 2006 PRSP had broader priorities than the ERSG IV and V series. They included: (i) good governance
(including good public finance management); (ii) high and sustainable economic growth (through a major
increase in domestic and foreign private investment); and (iii) development of human capital. The 2008-2012
CAS had similar objectives: (i) good governance; (ii) sustainable and equitable growth; and (iii) development
of social sectors. The ERSG priorities were narrower but fully consistent with objectives (i) and (ii). The
development of human resources (iii) occupied only a modest place in the ERSG V program.

Although the Bank’s strategy for Africa’s future of March 2011 has broader and more complex objectives, it
also emphasizes: (i) good governance (and public sector capacity); and (ii) sustainable and equitable growth
through improved competitiveness (and employment). The Bank strategy also promotes resilience and safety
net reforms.

27.     The objectives of ERSG IV and V remain relevant today. Burundi is engaged in a long
struggle to improve its macroeconomic policies and financial management systems, stimulate
growth and reduce poverty. The goal is not to achieve extremely rapid results but to make slow but
steady progress towards an economic and social vision shared by the government and its partners.
Continuity is essential to produce sustainable results.

28.    Relevance of the design: The design of the ERSG IV and V program and its focus on a
small number of policies and objectives was based on lessons learned from previous DPOs in
                                                     8 
 
Burundi. The limited management capacity available in public institutions, after years of open
conflicts, was viewed as a major obstacle to the success of ongoing reforms. A relatively modest
program focused on two priorities – transparent public finance management and private sector
investment – was therefore fully justified.

29.     The selection of these two priorities was appropriate:

- First, the image of the country had long been tarnished by the negative views of the donor
community and the private sector on the capacity of the government to prevent and fight corruption.
Consequently, sound public finance management and improved internal and external controls were
critical to change that image and attract adequate flows of development assistance and FDI.
- Second, the lack of strong economic growth – despite large, and probably unsustainable, inflows
of external assistance – meant that a higher priority had to be given to private sector development.

30.      It could be argued that the ERSG series should have provided more space for policies aimed
at improving income distribution and promoting social sector services. However, substantial
progress had already been made (notably in terms of allocating more public funds to health and
education) and social sector indicators had improved (See selected indicators in Annex 9, notably
lower infant and maternal mortality rates, increases in net primary school enrollment ratios and even
primary school completion rates. It was therefore advisable to refocus government and donor
programs on economic growth. In addition, the key to poverty reduction and improved income
distribution is the growth of the agricultural sector, through investment, improved infrastructure and
structural reforms. In this context the reform of the coffee sector is essential to support growth and
improve income distribution, assuming that the reform will enable coffee farmers to increase their
production, improve its quality, and obtain higher market prices.

31.      Prior actions and PDO indicators. The selection of prior actions and PDO indicators
reflected adequately the broad objectives of the program (See Box 4 below). As mentioned earlier, a
step-by-step approach to the reform process was essential in a country with weak institutions in an
uncertain political climate.

                                 Box 4. Relevance of PDO Indicators

The selection of PDO indicators was adequate:
     A well-conceived Sector and Central MTEFs were expected to improve the strategic planning of
         resource allocations, aligning budgets on agreed economic and social sector priorities.
     Associating both the Cour des Comptes (CdC) and the Parliament in the review of government
         accounts was probably the best way to strengthen the fight against corruption. In the past, the CdC
         had shown its independence by criticizing illegal transactions executed by ministers and/or other
         high-level officials.
     Publishing budgets and budget execution reports on the website of the Ministry of Finance would
         also encourage the civil society to participate actively in the monitoring of public expenditures.
     The elimination of arrears would illustrate the success of efforts made by the Ministry of Finance to
         improve annual and quarterly cash management and commitment plans. It was also essential to
         improve the business environment.
     Better management of the wage bill and its decline in percentage of GDP and total expenditures was
         the most effective way to create fiscal space for additional capital investment and other priority
         economic and social sector spending.
     The government relied on the Investment Promotion Agency to stimulate domestic private
         investment. The volume and speed of its operations would show that the newly created agency was
         becoming more productive.
     The private sector felt that the poor performance of REGIDESO was a major obstacle to its
         development. Improved tariffs and improved bill collection would improve the company’s financial
         viability and operational performance, thus making it possible to reduce the number of power
                                                         9 
 
        outages.
       The privatization of public enterprises was the signal that foreign private investors expected to
        become more confident in the capacity of the government to engage in a PSD-based development
        strategy.
       The sale of the coffee washing stations was another important measure that would improve the
        credibility of the country’s PSD reform program.
       Additional budget allocations to school feeding and health care would confirm that the government
        took seriously the reform of the health and education sectors.


3.2. Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

32.     Although a number of PDO indicators were not met, the reform process (notably with
respect to public finance management) made substantial progress during implementation of the
ERSG IV and V programmatic series. Implementation of the PFM component was successful and
effective. Less satisfactory was implementation of the PSD reform component and its impact on
economic growth

a) Public Finance Management (satisfactory)
     The gradual generalization of the MTEF process encouraged a number of key sector
        ministries to reflect systematically on the budget implications of their sector strategies
        and to better prioritize objectives, programs and projects (smaller ministries were less
        able to improve their strategies and their budgets). As shown in Table B of Annex 10,
        priority economic and social sector ministries were rewarded by increased budget
        allocations.
     Budget execution also improved. As shown in Tables A and B of Annex 10, the share of
        capital expenditures and priority economic and sector ministries increased not only in
        initial budgets but also in actual expenditures (at the commitment stage). Although rates
        of budget execution remained lower in economic and sector ministries than in defense
        and security, they improved and the combination of higher allocations and better rates of
        execution produced a significant increase in the share of economic and social sectors in
        total spending.
     One of the consequences was the constant amelioration of the country’s social indicators
        (see improvements in primary school enrollment ratios and completion rates, infant and
        maternal mortality rates and other education and health indicators in Annex 9).
     The elimination of arrears was critical not only in terms of sound budget management but
        also for the development of the private sector. Past experience has shown the negative
        impact of increased government arrears on the business climate.
     The publication of budget laws and budget execution reports on the website of the
        Ministry of Finance will not have a strong immediate impact since access to internet is
        very limited in Burundi. However, it is an important first step towards more transparency
        and it will encourage civil society institutions to organize themselves to monitor closely
        public finance management.

b) Promotion of Private Investment (moderately satisfactory)
     Implementation of a new investment code, creation of the Investment Promotion Agency
       and other PSD-related measures did not immediately create a positive business
       environment. Nevertheless, the 2011 and 2012 reports on business indicators view
       Burundi as one of the ten top reformers in that area (the country’s ranking improved from
       177th to 169th)
                                                  10 
 
       Private investment increased from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2005-08 to 10.1 percent in 2010-
        11, reflecting new impetus stemming from tourism and agriculture. Foreign direct
        investment also increased from a very low $0.8 million in 2010 to a still modest $3.4
        million in 2011.
       Increased private investment, however, did not produce the accelerated growth which the
        government and the population expected. The rate of growth of GDP remained around
        4% in 2009-2012, slightly below the results achieved in 2006-2009. This is clearly
        insufficient to significantly improve poverty indicators.

c) Privatization of Public Enterprises (unsatisfactory)
     Highly disappointing is the modest progress made in the privatization of public
        enterprises. Audits were published and action plans were prepared. Modest efforts were
        made to initiate the restructuring/privatization process for three public enterprises. The
        delivery of new busses to OTRACO might improve its performance. Discussions began
        with a private investor for the privatization of Hotel Sources du Nil. Separating the
        profitable operations of SOBUGEA from the non-profitable activity of Air Burundi was
        envisaged. However, all these efforts were stopped when a law of February 2012
        stipulated that all future sales of public enterprises had to be authorized by a law fixing
        the list of “privatizable” enterprises. This new law was prepared and discussed with the
        Parliament in August 2013. Five of the eight enterprises targeted for privatization in the
        context of ERSG IV and V are on the list (which does not include SIP, OTRACO and
        ECOSAT). A positive development is the inclusion in the new list of ONATEL, a fairly
        large telecommunications company, which could play a major role in the modernization
        of the telecommunications sector if it is owned and managed by reputable international
        investors.

d) Restructuring of the Coffee Sector (moderately satisfactory)
     The Tables of Annex 8 show the constant decline in the volume of coffee production over
        the past few years. Dramatic measures need to be taken to salvage and reactivate this
        sector which is the main source of cash income for a large part of the rural population.
     Somewhat disappointing is the fact that only 41 of the 60 washing stations targeted for
        privatization have been sold (See Box 2 at the end of section 2.1 on the restructuring of
        the coffee sector). It is hoped that the Webcor experience will not have a durable negative
        impact on the interest of potential investors and the reaction of coffee growers.
     The sale of washing stations is not the only reform necessary to boost production and
        improve quality and prices. A major effort is needed to improve cultivation practices and
        rehabilitate ageing plantations.
     A number of coffee growers and washing stations were rewarded for producing high-
        quality coffee, but much more needs to be done to improve the performance of the sector.

e) Mitigating the Impact of the Food and Fuel Crisis (satisfactory)
     All the measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the food/fuel crisis on vulnerable
        groups were implemented. The expansion of the school feeding programs is a welcome
        development. Increased budget allocations to primary education and primary health care
        will enable the government to improve the efficiency and the impact of free measures
        initiated in 2005-06.

33.      An assessment of achievements during the ERSG IV and V series cannot be made in
isolation from the overall political context. Essentially, Burundi remains a fragile “mid-conflict”
country, with a nascent democratic system, which is not yet fully capable of reconciling and co-
opting opposing segments of the Burundian society.

                                                11 
 
3.3. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

34.      Overall, the ERSG Program (IV and V) is rated Moderately Satisfactory. One could argue
that a better rating was justifiable since two of the three main components of the program (PFM and
mitigating the impact of the food/fuel crisis) deserve a satisfactory rating. However, additional
improvements in the business environment, a more effective public enterprise privatization program
and other measures aimed at more vigorously promoting private investment and economic growth
are essential today to help achieve the country’s long-term development objectives.

35.     In brief, the PDOs were timely, and highly relevant; the design of the program was simple,
and implementation arrangements were generally adequate. However, evolving country conditions
precluded the anticipated pace of capacity development especially for PSD reforms.

3.4. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Although these issues were not at the center of the ERSG IV and V program, some positive results
were achieved, mainly through improved governance and a budget structure that gives a high
priority to basic services. In these areas, several other Bank projects (DRR, Health, Agriculture, and
Energy) are complementing the ERSG program.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
Weak capacity is a common feature of most of the country’s public institutions. They need to
develop their analytical and implementation skills; they should be able to retain experienced and
trained staff; and they should better coordinate their programs and activities with the ministries
responsible for Finance and Development Planning.

36.     Clearly more than five years of ERSG programs (since 2006) had a significant impact on
the performance and capacity of the Ministry of Finance by making available new budget planning
and executions instruments (MTEFs, SIGEFI, commitment plans and payroll management),
gradually strengthening controls, and increasing the authority of the Ministry as coordinator of
macroeconomic and public finance reforms.

37.     Efforts made to strengthen the capacity of SCEP and the public enterprise privatization
program have not yet produced major results. SCEP helps prepare useful audits but does not play a
leading role in the design and implementation of the privatization program.

(c)   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
None.

3.5. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

38.     No beneficiary survey was conducted during or following implementation of the ERSG IV
and V series. However, a high-level government seminar was held in Bujumbura in March 2011 to
discuss economic growth issues and public sector expenditure priorities. The deliberations of this
seminar resulted in three policy papers dealing with Economic Growth, Fiscal Space, and
Streamlining of Security-Related expenditures. This seminar proved to be a good example of the
commitment of the country’s leadership to the objectives of the program. It also provided a unique
opportunity to discuss with other government officials and the donor community the merits and the

                                                 12 
 
risks of accelerating the demobilization process and the reduction of defense and security
expenditures (See summary of the conclusions of the seminar in Annex 3).

IV.   ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Significant

39.      Despite the commitment of the government, several years of civil conflict exacerbated the
main weaknesses of the country’s institutional systems (limited technical and managerial capacity
and poor coordination of program planning and implementation). As a result, the expected
outcomes of the ERSG V are subject to a number of risks. These risks are mitigated by several
factors, including: (i) the design of the operation (a step-by-step approach to the reform process and
the continuity of the effort as each new ERSG aims first at consolidating results achieved in
previous operations); (ii) the strength of the government’s ownership; (iii) an active and continuous
policy dialogue between the Bank and the government; and (iv) a close collaboration with other
donors that provide technical assistance and finance the reform program.

40.      The moderately-satisfactory achievements of ERSG IV and V highlight the enormous
difficulties that lie ahead in a politically-unstable environment.

V.    ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1. Bank Performance: Satisfactory

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

41.     The positive results achieved in this area (see paragraph 3.1) are largely due to the work of
Bank staff during preparation of the program. Considerable AAA work was performed during the
design phase of ERSG IV and V, including a Country Economic Memorandum, a Public
Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA), and a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study. The
Bank-financed EMSP project funded an extensive study of the coffee sector that was used
extensively by the government when it had to decide about the sale of washing stations. In addition,
a PSIA study analyzed the poverty and social impact of the coffee sector reform before and after the
reform. Finally, the intensity of the policy dialogue between the Bank and the government helped
produce an operation, whose objectives were sound and realistic (except for some aspects of the
PSD component). The concept of the program was relevant and efficient and the amount of grant
assistance for budget support was appropriate.

(b) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

42.      As mentioned in Section G (ratings of program performance in ISRs), supervision of the
ongoing DPOs and preparation of follow-up operations were performed simultaneously and their
conclusions were included in detailed aide-memoires which focused on the need to improve and
accelerate the implementation of agreed reforms. The summary of the aide-memoire prepared by
the March-April 2011 mission shows the type of issues that were discussed with the government, in
the context of a broad and largely effective policy dialogue. The high-level government seminar of
March 2011, prepared with the help of the Bank, is a good example of efforts made to advise the
authorities on policy priorities and further strengthen and broaden the commitment of the
government to the agreed reform program.

                                                 13 
 
43.      The supervision of the program was closely coordinated with the Bank’s multilateral and
bilateral development partners (e.g., the IMF, AfDB, EU, USAID, DFID and other donors). A joint
mission involving all the donors providing budget support was organized by the government in
September 2010. The main purpose of that and other joint missions was to provide an assessment of
the PFM program and to evaluate future prospects for PFM reform based on lessons learned. The
Cadre de Partenariat (partnership framework) played a major role in stimulating cooperation
between donors operating in Burundi.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

44.    The performance of the Bank was Satisfactory both at the design and the implementation
stage.

5.2. Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

    (a) Government Performance:
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

45.     The government should be commended for taking most of the necessary actions to
implement PFM reforms, develop the MTEF mechanism, strengthen implementation of quarterly
commitment plans and begin to address the critical wage bill issue. The government, however, was
reluctant to fully implement some of the PSD reforms included in the program, notably the public
enterprise privatization program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.     Implementation of the PFM program by the Ministry of Finance was satisfactory. SCEP did
not have the capacity to play the same role in preparing and implementing the public enterprise
privatization program and the Ministry of Finance should have strengthened its oversight of the
PSD aspects of the program.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

47.     The government successfully implemented PFM reforms, which justifies a Moderately
Satisfactory rating. With the help of the donor community, the government needs to develop a
broad national consensus for undertaking politically-sensitive PSD measures and restructuring
public enterprises.

VI.      LESSONS LEARNED

48.     The programmatic series of DPOs in a fragile political and economic setting has served as
a useful instrument to progress toward the intended program results. The strong commitment of the
country’s leadership to the reform agenda played a major role in helping achieve these results.
Improved dialogue and cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and line ministries also was an
important positive factor.

49.      A complex political situation and national capacity constraints are the main factors behind
slow implementation of major program components (REGIDESO, PSD and privatizations). The
lesson is that more efforts are needed, during program preparation, to evaluate the political
feasibility of the reform agenda and the capacity of national institutions to implement the reforms.

                                                14 
 
In addition, a flexible approach is necessary to adapt specific program targets and timetables taking
into account constraints that were not fully understood during the preparation phase.

50.      Institutional development and structural reforms should be outward looking and take into
account evolving global developments. The sustainability of the coffee sector reform was affected
by decisions of key stakeholders driven by internal struggles and the political economy of the
sector; at the same time, developments in the international commodity markets limited the positive
impact of the reforms and therefore affected the pro-reform consensus achieved at the beginning of
the process. Thus the design of the reforms must not only be forward looking but also flexible
enough to adapt to evolving conditions.

51.      Engaging the civil society in supporting the reform agenda is feasible only if the population
is confident that the government serves adequately national interests and does not discriminate. The
best way to achieve that goal is for the government to show its determination to eliminate
corruption, which for a long time has affected the international reputation of the country. This is a
long battle that the government must continue and win.

52.      Another important issue is the need for a comprehensive approach to sector reforms,
combining essential policy measures with investments designed to exploit the benefits of improved
policies. The long-term success of the coffee sector reform will depend not only on improving
sector regulations and privatizing facilities but also on substantial donor-financed investments
aimed at improving cultivation practices and rehabilitating ageing coffee plantations. Some initial
results have been achieved, notably with respect to the production of high-quality coffee by a few
washing stations, but much more needs to be done in this area, through a combination of DPOs and
investment financing.

VII. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER, IMPLEMENTING
AGENCIES AND PARTNERS

    (a)   Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

53.     The government, especially the CNCA, is concerned that donor coordination is not as
effective as it should be. It argues that many donors have the same preference for programs and
projects that are politically popular in member countries (for example programs addressing gender
inequality issues). As a result important components of the government program, which have been
included in major policy documents approved by the donor community (including the PRSPs),
cannot find donors willing to invest resources in these areas.

54.     The government recognizes that private sector development is critical for achieving its goal
of accelerated and sustainable growth. In this context, the recent increase in domestic private
investment is a welcome development. However, most of the new private investments aim at short-
term gains and finance speculative investments (notably in construction projects), instead of
supporting long-term productive developments in agriculture and mining.

    (b)   Cofinanciers:

55.     Most of the country’s development partners believe that corruption and the lack of
tangible results in reducing political instability remain the most important obstacles to solid
growth. The government, however, considers that major efforts have already been made (creating
a strong anticorruption institutional framework), which are bound to produce results in the
medium and long term.

Annex 3. Stakeholder Workshop – Report and Results

       1.     A cabinet-level seminar was held in Bujumbura in March 2011 to discuss macroeconomic
       and public finance management issues, and in particular public spending priorities. Organized by
       the Vice President for Economic and Social Affairs, the seminar was attended not only by the
       Finance Minister and other officials responsible for economic and social sectors, but also by a large
       number of other ministers and key officials not directly involved in economic management.

       2.       After about 11 years of gradual political normalization, the country’s leadership, including
       the Head of State, felt that it was important to discuss in a large forum what has been achieved by
       the country and its government in terms of internal security, economic growth and human resource
       development and which policy choices need to be made in the near future to foster peace and
       reconciliation, accelerate economic growth, reduce poverty and improve access to, and the quality
       of, basic services.

       3.      The deliberations of the seminar resulted in the preparation of three policy papers: one
       dealing with Economic Growth, a second one dealing mainly with Fiscal Space, and a third one on
       the need for, and the risks of, Streamlining Security-Related expenditures.

       DISCUSSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH

       4.       On economic growth, the workshop noted the generally sound macroeconomic and fiscal
       policies of the decade, the decline in the fiscal deficit, and the government’s capacity to control
       inflationary pressures caused by the rise in international fuel and food prices.

       5.       Nevertheless, overall economic growth remains slow and reducing poverty is particularly
       difficult in a country where the rate of growth of the population is close to 3 percent.

               Slow growth is largely due to the poor performance of the agricultural sector, i.e. the
       limited use of modern inputs, the lack of diversification (two cash crops account for the bulk of the
       country’s export earnings), the lack of efficient extension services and farmers’ organizations, and
       the growing shortage of land resulting from high population density. For the immediate future, the
       main priority should be to accelerate the reform of the coffee sector, i.e.: selling washing stations,
       helping organize coffee growers and promoting the rehabilitation of ageing coffee plants.
               Another factor is the inadequacy of the country’s basic infrastructure: Burundi lags behind
       other Sub-Saharan Africa countries on any measure of infrastructure development (road and
       telephone density, other transport systems, power generation and distribution). The coverage of
       rural areas is particularly deficient.
               Domestic power production per capita is the lowest in the world. REGIDESO’s operations
       are handicapped by obsolete equipment and inadequate tariff policies. Improving the operational
       and financial performance of REGIDESO is of high priority. The government should also develop
       the vast hydroelectric potential of the country.

       6.      Recent improvements in the business environment (investment code, privatization law,
       investment promotion agency) are encouraging, but much more needs to be done to promote
       domestic and foreign private investment. Domestic private investment has begun to increase but
       FDIs remain very low at less than 1 percent of GDP. Adopting a new mining code, giving a new
       impetus to the public/private sector policy dialogue, reforming business regulations, improving
       access of rural areas to finance are among the most urgent reform priorities.

       7.      Governance is a particularly critical issue and the recent approval of the National
       Governance Strategy should be followed by additional measures aimed at: (i) promoting a merit-
       based culture in the selection of key economic management officials, (ii) improving oversight, and
                                                    19 
 
    (iii) enforcing decisions made by anti-corruption agencies.

    DISCUSSION ON FISCAL SPACE

    8.      The second policy paper dealt with fiscal space, which is essential to improve the structure
    of public expenditures in favor of high priority economic and social sectors.

            Increasing domestic revenue on a large scale and increasing domestic and foreign
    borrowing is not feasible at this stage. In 2010, tax revenue accounted for 14.6 percent of GDP,
    which seems adequate for a fragile, mainly rural, economy. External borrowing is not an
    appropriate alternative. Burundi’s external debt declined to 22 percent of GDP since the country
    reached the HIPC completion point, but the risk of debt distress has not been eliminated.
            Foreign grants increased dramatically over the past ten years, but current projections seem
    to indicate a probable decline in net aid inflows in the form of grants. Major improvements in
    public finance management and decisive action regarding corruption cases might encourage the
    donor community to increase its budget support and development assistance.
            The best alternative to increase fiscal space for growth-enhancing investment is a more
    efficient allocation of available resources. Public spending went up from 23 percent of GDP in
    2001 to 40 percent in 2008-10. Current expenditures account for close to 50 percent of total
    expenditures. This is partly due to an increase in the wage bill.
            Three policy reforms should, therefore, be implemented: (i) reducing the share of current
    expenditures by controlling the wage bill; (ii) redirecting resources from defense and security
    toward priority economic and social sectors; and (iii) improving the quality (and efficiency) of
    public investment and other public expenditures.

    DISCUSSION ON DOWNSIZING THE SECURITY SECTOR, EXPANDING FISCAL
    SPACE FOR GROWTH AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

    9.      The third policy paper dealt with the merits and risks of increasing fiscal space by reducing
    defense and security expenditures and accelerating the downsizing of security forces. Although
    creating fiscal space for economic and social sector expenditures is critical to accelerate economic
    growth, the downsizing of defense and security expenditures should be implemented flexibly,
    taking into account the capacity of the private sector to absorb additional workers.

    CONCLUSION

    10.      Reports produced following the seminar did not comment on its impact. It seems, however,
    that the impact was very positive.

           Ministers and other government officials who were not usually involved in the discussion
    of macroeconomic and PFM issues were confronted with: (i) a clear analysis of some of the major
    constraints that will dominate the country’s performance and prospects; and (ii) a review of the
    main policy options offered to the government to address these constraints.
           The main objective of the seminar was to broaden the consensus on the reforms that the
    government had initiated. That objective was at least partly achieved. A more unified government –
    which includes a large number of newcomers – was involved in policy discussions which in the
    past were held mainly with Finance and other economic sector ministries.
           While the seminar itself involved mainly government officials, other meetings with the
    private sector, the civil society and the country’s development partners spread the policy message
    of the seminar, helped the government better understand the views and reactions of other parties
    and therefore should facilitate future dialogues on economic and PFM issues.

              The comments of individual government officials quoted in section VII (a) of the report
      were made orally during a Bank mission to Burundi. The government did not comment in detail on
      a draft report that was submitted for its review. It did not challenge the overall evaluation of
      performance and outcomes, but felt that a satisfactory rating would have been justified, considering
      the success of the PFM component and efforts made to launch the public enterprise privatization
      program and the restructuring of the coffee sector in a difficult political and international
      environment.

Annex 7. Brief summary of an aide-memoire sent to the Government following
a Bank mission to Bujumbura from March 13 to April 5, 2011

        Like most of the aide-memoires prepared during preparation and implementation of ERSG
IV and V, this aide-memoire had two main objectives: (i) supervise implementation of ERSG IV,
note progress achieved and discuss issues revealed during program implementation; and (ii) review
steps taken to accelerate preparation of the next DPO (ERSG V), and make suggestions on ways
and means of handling possible problems. In addition the March-April mission coincided with the
organization of a high-level cabinet seminar on development and fiscal policy issues, which aimed
at involving key Ministers and other government officials in the review of these issues with a view
to helping develop a political consensus on policy design and implementation priorities. This
summary is focused on the review of issues concerning implementation of ERSG IV.

The mission first discussed the progress of agreed ERSG IV performance indicators.

A. Public finance management

    a)  Improved implementation of cash management and commitment plans enabled the
       government to eliminate arrears to suppliers (defined as unpaid bills for 60 days). All the
       arrears have been eliminated by December 31, 2010.
    b) Improved transparency of budget preparation process. The 2011 budget has been published
       on the website of the Ministry of Finance. However, budget execution reports have not yet
       been published.
    c) A SIGEFI module has been developed to help plan and manage the government wage bill.
       It is operational since January 2011.

B. Private sector development

    a) Substantial progress has been made in terms of: (i) the number of dossiers filed with the
       Investment Promotion Agency (API) during the second half of 2010 (as compared to the
       first half); and: (ii) the average time necessary for API to handle each dossier (less than 2
       weeks).
    b) One of the measures envisaged to improve the performance and financial viability of the
       public utility company (REGIDESO) is the gradual extension of the pre-payment system to
       a larger number of subscribers. The mission noted significant progress in this area with
       more than 25 percent of subscribers now participating in the pre-payment mechanism.
    c) Substantial progress has also been made in the preparation of public enterprise privatization
       programs. Existing technical and financial audits have been published. No action plan has
       been prepared as the government wants first to update existing audits: new audits for 2008-
       2010 are being prepared (funded by the Bank-financed EMSP project).
    d) A draft (revised) mining code is being prepared and will be analyzed by the Steering
       Committee. Bank commented on the overall quality of the document but feels that tax
       incentives proposed in the code should be in line with the country’s tax policies.

Substantial progress was also made towards preparation of ERSG V and implementation of
proposer prior actions

    C. Public finance management

    a) Preparation of a central MTEF for 2012-14, which will be used as a basis for the
       framework letter (lettre de cadrage) of the 2012 budget. Progress under way with the help
       of a consultant.
                                                25 
 
    b) Adoption of a draft law strengthening the legal and operational independence of Cour des
       Comptes. No substantial progress. Issue to be discussed with the European Commission.
    c) Updating staff rotations since the 2007 census. Additional financing has been mobilized to
       complete the exercise.
    d) Publication of 2011 budget and first quarter budget execution report on website of Ministry
       of Finance. The 2011 budget already is on the website. First quarterly budget execution
       report not yet posted.

    D. Improving business environment and private sector development

    a) Government revises electricity tariffs to improve financial viability and performance of
       REGIDESO, on the basis of recent study. Study completed but government waits for
       conclusions of a study on poverty impact of tariff revision.
    b) Extension of pre-payment system to at least 50 percent of REGIDESO’s subscribers.
       Substantial progress achieved.
    c) Action plan for privatization of 8 enterprises on the basis of existing technical and financial
       audits. Action plan adopted by Council of Ministers but government wants to wait for
       completion of 2008-10 audits financed by EMSP.

    E. Modernize export sector

    a) Inter-ministerial privatization committee launches bidding documents for sale of remaining
       104 coffee washing stations. Evaluation of results of 1st phase of privatization ongoing with
       EMSP financing. Government will wait for completion of evaluation before going ahead
       with new phase.
    b) Council of Ministers adopts draft law on agricultural pre-cooperatives. Substantial progress
       achieved. Draft prepared and being reviewed by Ministry of Agriculture.
    c) Council of Ministers adopts new mining code. Draft code ready but subject to review by
       supervision committee.

    F. Protect poor & vulnerable groups against high fuel and food prices.

        (i) Suspension of duties and taxes on imports of basic food products; (ii) Expansion of
        school feeding program; (iii) Additional budget allocations for fertilizers; and (iv)
        Additional funding for free primary health care for under 5 and pregnant women. These
        issues will be discussed with the forthcoming ERSG V pre-appraisal mission.

These three Tables show how coffee production has evolved since 1996-97 (both the total
production of the coffee sector and the production of the Kayanza/Ngozi areas, which produce
high-quality coffee and where are located most of the washing stations sold to the private sector):

        Despite the restoration of security in most of the provinces, national coffee production has
         been declining from a national average of almost 100,000 tons in the early 2000s, to about
         50,000 since 2009-10.
        The share of the Kayanza/Ngozi areas has also been declining from 42% in the early 2000s
         to 20% since 2009-10. Obviously, the sale of washing stations to the private sector has not
         had a positive impact on the coffee sector.

Although these data are disappointing, one needs more time to be able to pass a definite judgment
on the long-term advantages of the privatization process.

    a) Bad luck played a role. In the past coffee farmers were paid by the public sector in two
       stages: first when the crop was delivered, and a second time at the end of the campaign (a
       premium taking into account possible increases in international coffee prices).
    b) The payment system introduced by Webcor, which purchased the first 13 washing stations
       sold to the private sector, provided for a single payment at the time of delivery. The
       reaction of farmers was initially positive. They welcomed a large single payment at an
       early stage. In 2010, however, the international coffee price almost doubled between the
       beginning and the end of the campaign. As a result, the coffee farmers dealing with
       Webcor received much less than the farmers who are dealing with the public sector. This
       had a strong negative impact on the views of many Burundians on the merits of the coffee
       sector reform and, to some extent, on the justification of the overall privatization process. It 
       also  strengthened the position of the National Federation of Coffee Growers (representing
       about 10 percent of farmers), which was against the privatization process, as conceived and
       implemented.
                                                         27 
 
    c) Webcor argues that the success of the coffee sector privatization process and the income of
       individual farmers do not depend only on prices and pricing systems but also on the
       volume of the production.
    d) The decline in national coffee production is usually explained by poor weather, inadequate
       farming practices and the old age of plantations, which were not well maintained and
       should be gradually replaced by new, high-yielding, coffee plants.
    e) Consequently, the best way to increase coffee production and improve its marketing is not
       only to sell washing stations to competent private enterprises, but also to organize – with
       the help of the donor community – a strong public/private sector partnership which would
       develop programs and projects aimed at (gradually) rehabilitating coffee plantations,
       replacing old plants, introducing better cultivation techniques and improving the quality
       through improvements at the production and processing stage.
    f) At the same time, additional efforts should be made to negotiate with the National
       Federation of Coffee Growers ways and means of associating them and their members in
       the privatization process.

Table A shows that:
     The share of capital expenditures in initial budgets remained stable (around 18-19%) during the
        ERSG IV and V period
     Thanks to better rates of execution, the share of capital expenditures increased substantially during
        the same period (from 12 % in 2009 to 17% in 2011).

Table B shows that:
     The share of defense & security remained stable in budgets (close to 20% in 2009 and 2011) but
        decreased slightly in total of executed expenditures (from 21% in 2009 to 19% in 2010-2011),
        before returning to the 2009 level in 2012 (21%).
     The share of economic sectors increased in budgets (from 10.8% in 2009 to 12,3% in 2012). Their
        share of executed budgets was much lower but increased sharply during the period (from 6.4% in
        2009 to 10.4% in 2012).
     Similarly, the share of social sectors increased in budgets (from 33% in 2009 to 37% in 2012) and
        increased even more in executed budgets (from 32% in 2009 to 40% in 2012).
     Consequently the share of economic and social sectors together increased in both initial budgets
        (from 44% to 49%) and in executed budgets (from 38% to 50%).
