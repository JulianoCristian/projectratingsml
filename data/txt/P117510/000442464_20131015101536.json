satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the programmatic series of\n            development policy operations (DPOs) in a fragile political\n            and economic setting has served as a useful instrument to\n            progress toward the intended program results. More efforts\n            are needed, during program preparation, to evaluate the\n            political feasibility of the reform agenda and the capacity\n            of national institutions to implement the reforms.\n            Institutional development and structural reforms should be\n            outward looking and take into account evolving global\n            developments. Engaging the civil society in supporting the\n            reform agenda is feasible only if the population is\n            confident that the government serves adequately national\n            interests and does not discriminate. There is the need for a\n            comprehensive approach to sector reforms, combining\n            essential policy measures with investments designed to\n            exploit the benefits of improved policies."}, "docdt": "2013-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
