Both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            rated as highly satisfactory. Key lessons learned included:\n            Selecting but a few objectives and conditions results in\n            greater impact; the Government and the Bank were able to\n            focus on those measures that were critical to further the\n            adjustment effort. Borrower commitment to the adjustment\n            program is critical for success; ownership was built early\n            on through economic and sector work, and relatively lengthy\n            project preparation that included consultations with the\n            private sector. A gradual approach allows for consensus\n            building and sustainability of reforms. Continuity of staff\n            boosts commitment and sustainability; staff who were\n            familiar with reform program objectives and the\n            implementation experience of previous adjustment operations\n            were able to avoid pitfalls already experienced and ensure\n            that implementation matched the original aims envisaged\n            during program design. Close collaboration with the\n            International Monetary Fund on IDA-supported operations,\n            including this project, strengthened the linkages between\n            macro-policies and structural reforms, and facilitated a\n            greater overall impact than if programs had been implemented\n            separately. Finally, the links between macroeconomic\n            stability and structural reform were clearly evident\n            following the privatization of majority shares in the\n            two-state-owned banks which stemmed sources of monetary\n            leakage and helped reduce inflation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
