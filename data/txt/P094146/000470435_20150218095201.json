However, a series of\n            external factors (the fall in coffee prices, the\n            international crisis, the impact of the 2001 earthquakes\n            and, more recently, and the rise in oil prices) slowed down\n            the country\u0092s economic growth and progress on social\n            indicators during 2000-2005. Despite El Salvador\u0092s\n            accomplishments, the World Bank\u0092s poverty assessment for the\n            country concludes that most of the progress on poverty\n            reduction and social indicators has been maintained, but an\n            additional boost is needed to continue improvements.\n            Consequently, in 2004 the Government of El Salvador adopted\n            its \u0093Safe Country 2004-2009\u0094 program focusing on greater\n            economic growth, sound fiscal management, and public sector\n            modernization. The plan requires that a policy and\n            investment agenda be implemented to reinvigorate economic\n            growth through job creation and poverty reduction, together\n            with efforts to redirect fiscal trends and make greater\n            financial management improvements."}, "docdt": "2007-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
