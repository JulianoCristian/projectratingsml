"Ratings for the El Salvador Second\n            Broad-Based Growth Development Policy Loan Project (DPL II)\n            were as follows: Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also rated satisfactory. The factor\n            leading to the cancellation of the project was the\n            non-ratification of the loan by the national assembly of El\n            Salvador, and not due to weak implementation or reversal of\n            the policy reforms supported by the loan. The DPL II project\n            was approved by the Board on December 13, 2005 and the loan\n            agreement was signed on March 15, 2007. Subsequently, in\n            various sessions, the loan was presented to, and discussed\n            by, the national assembly of El Salvador, but due to the\n            political gridlock, the loan was never ratified within the\n            18 months deadline after Board approval. As a result, the\n            Bank terminated the loan agreement as of June 13, 2007. Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: (i) Bank\n            operations are planned and prepared with the Executive\n            branch of the Government and the Legislative branch is never\n            informed nor consulted during the process of project\n            preparation. While this is a good approach to ensure prompt\n            project preparation, the fact that loans could end up\n            trapped in congress due to political reasons is increasingly\n            present. Just like it is done during Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) preparation and in coordination with main\n            government counterparts, a project level consultation\n            process should take place at the congressional level making\n            sure that relevant views are received and, if technically\n            appropriate for the project, taken into account. At the very\n            least, such an approach would convey the message that the\n            Bank is an objective, technical player, ready to work with\n            any given Government as long as the common goals of poverty\n            reduction are pursued as well; (ii) One broad lesson learned\n            to reflect on is the changing socio-political environment in\n            Latin America. The region is today characterized by an\n            increasingly polarized political environment. The Bank\n            continues to have a role to play in this context; however,\n            it needs to define a strategy to work with clients across\n            the political and ideological spectrum existent in Latin\n            America today."}, "docdt": "2008-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
