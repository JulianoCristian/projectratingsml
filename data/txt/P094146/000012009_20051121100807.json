       Government's medium term development strategy in\n            accelerating broad based, and equitable economic growth, and\n            in contributing to the Government's objectives of\n            reigniting growth, particularly through increased private\n            investment and trade, reinforcing macroeconomic stability\n            and strengthening fiscal sustainability, and, increasing the\n            efficiency and transparency of public sector management.\n            This second operation builds on the first operation, and\n            focuses on addressing fiscal issues, and on strengthening\n            the international trade and business environment, for which\n            it will draw on findings set forth in the Country Economic\n            Memorandum (CEM), Public Expenditure Review (PER), Dominican\n            Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement with the\n            United States of America (DR-CAFTA) studies, as well as the\n            Investment Climate Assessment. It will likewise continue to\n            emphasize transparency, and efficiency in public spending by\n            including follow up actions on public financial management,\n            and procurement regulations to ensure the gradual\n            implementation of measures as prescribed in the Country\n            Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country\n            Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Nonetheless, risks\n            exist, such as fiscal, political, external - i.e., sustained\n            high oil prices or a new international recession, could\n            negatively affect El Salvador's economy and worsen debt\n            dynamics - as well as natural disasters, and crime and violence."}, "docdt": "2005-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
