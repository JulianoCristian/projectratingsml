The report cites the\n            following as lessons learned: 1) Improvement in\n            macroeconomic performance is an essential precondition for\n            success. 2) Sophisticated methodologies for risk management\n            have to be implemented at a pace commensurate with local\n            capacity and the market environment. 3) Programmatic lending\n            provides the Bank with more flexibility in supporting the\n            Government's reform agenda and permits the build-up of\n            a broader policy dialogue. 4) A comprehensive and complex\n            policy reform agenda, such as the one supported by this\n            project, might have been better served by a Program\n            consisting of more than two loan operations"}, "docdt": "2005-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
