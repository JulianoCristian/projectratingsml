The extension is necessary to\n            satisfactorily complete the remaining project activities and\n            continue funding of some on-going activities to ensure\n            sustainability of project interventions. An action plan for\n            the satisfactory completion of the project has been\n            developed by the Project Management Unit (PMU). An extension\n            will also allow building into the project as many activities\n            as possible to help prepare the next agricultural project.\n            Such activities would include: continued lending to medium\n            agribusinesses, advancing the pilot brucellosis program,\n            further development of the animal disease information\n            system, specialized studies on food safety standards,\n            agricultural insurance, value chains in agriculture, due\n            diligence of banks interested in lending to agribusiness\n            under the next phase of ADCP, and social and environmental\n            assessments. Finally, the extension would also provide the\n            opportunity to adequately finalize and evaluate the project,\n            articulate lessons learned and incorporate these lessons in\n            the preparation of the subsequent agricultural operation."}, "docdt": "2011-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
