The reallocation is necessary to continue\n            funding the project advisory program and the project\n            operational costs during the remainder of the project. In\n            March 2010, the project task team and Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) reviewed the financial status of all project\n            components and reallocation of credit proceeds to ensure\n            sufficient funding for the remaining project activities. In\n            order to complete the project activities, it is necessary to\n            reallocate Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 691,500 from the\n            category consultancy services for other project components\n            to the categories of consultancy services for Information\n            and Advisory Center (IAC) and Regional Advisory Centers\n            (RACs) and incremental operating costs. Rapidly increasing\n            prices during the project period have resulted in increasing\n            costs for most activities of the information and advisory\n            services sub-component of the project. In particular, the\n            costs of the travel and transportation, rental of rooms,\n            utilities, printing and staff were higher than estimated at\n            the time of project appraisal. Price increase has also\n            affected the budget for the project operation costs."}, "docdt": "2010-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
