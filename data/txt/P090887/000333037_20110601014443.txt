SUMMARY
1. The proposed changes involve responding to the request of the Ministry of Finance of
   the Republic of Azerbaijan to extend the project closing date from May 31, 2011 to
   February 29, 2012 and process a reallocation of proceeds under IDA Credit A
   Number 4207-AZ and IDA Credit B Number 4208-AZ in support of the project
   operations during the proposed extension period.



PROJECT STATUS
2. Implementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily and the project is on track
   to meet the development objectives. The preliminary results of the project’s final
   impact assessment survey show that the core outcome indicators are being met and
   that the project is having significant positive results. Income of participating farmers
   has increased by nine percent in accordance with estimates. The advisory program
   with a well-defined structure is now covering the whole country, as planned. The
   competitive grant program for testing and transferring of new improved technologies
   has been successfully completed. One hundred and eight medium agribusinesses
   have been financed for a total of US$ 15.75 million. Private veterinary units
   established under the project are operating well and the number of clients is
   increasing steadily. A brucellosis control program has been successfully piloted. The
   establishment of a market information system is well underway. In addition, the
   establishment of a market information and commercial hub continues to progress
   well. The project achieved sizeable results also by expanding the outreach of credit
   unions to more communities. Approximately 44,300 small loans have been issued to
   23,000 members of credit unions and borrowers groups1.



PROPOSED CHANGES
Extension of the project closing date

3. The closing date for the project will be extended from May 31, 2011 until February
   29, 2012.



1
 While the overall financial recovery rate remains high, there a small group of credit unions that
demonstrates weak portfolio performance and credit repayment rate.
                                                      4
4. As indicated above, the project continues to perform well and the development
   objectives continue to be achievable.

5.     The proposed extension is necessary to satisfactorily complete the remaining project
      activities and continue funding of some on-going activities to ensure sustainability of
      project interventions. An action plan for the satisfactory completion of the project
      has been developed by the PMU. An extension would also allow building into the
      project as many activities as possible to help prepare the next agricultural project.
      Such activities would include: continued lending to medium agribusinesses,
      advancing the pilot brucellosis program, further development of the animal disease
      information system, specialized studies on food safety standards, agricultural
      insurance, value chains in agriculture, due diligence of banks interested in lending to
      agribusiness under the next phase of ADCP, and social and environmental
      assessments. Finally, the extension would also provide the opportunity to adequately
      finalize and evaluate the project, articulate lessons learned and incorporate these
      lessons in the preparation of the subsequent agricultural operation.

6. Although the total IDA funds of US$29.2 million originally allocated for the project
   have already been fully disbursed, the project will not be fully disbursed by its current
   closing date as the favorable SDR-USD exchange rate has increased the initially
   allocated credit funds by almost US$3 million. In addition, some 18% of funds
   remain undisbursed under the PHRD co-financing grant and the additional time
   would allow to complete implementation of activities to be financed from the Grant.

7.     This will be the first extension of the project.

Reallocation of Proceeds

8. Proceeds for Azerbaijan, Agricultural Development and Credit Project –II, IDA
   Credit A Number 4207-AZ and IDA Credit B Number 4208-AZ will be reallocated as

9. The proposed reallocation is necessary to support implementation of the agreed
   activities and ensure the most effective use of undisbursed credit funds under the
   proposed extension. In particular, the reallocation is necessary to continue funding
   the pilot brucellosis program and development of the animal disease information
   system, additional TA for specialized studies on seeds and food safety standards,
   value chain development and expanding private veterinary services. In order to
   implement these activities, it is necessary to reallocate SDR 386,000 to the categories
   of works and goods (Category 1), consultancy services for other project components
   (Category 2(b)), training (Category 3), and incremental operating costs for others
   (Categories7(b)). Funds will be reallocated from the categories of consultancy
   services for Information and Advisory Center (IAC) and Regional Advisory Centers
   (RACs) (Category 2(a)), sub-loans under Component 1 (a) of the Project (Category
   4) and from the Competitive Grants under Component 1 (c) of the Project (Category
   6).

10. This is a Level Two Restructuring. The project development objectives and results
    indicators would remain unchanged and a restructuring would not affect the project’s
    safeguard category or trigger a new safeguard policy. The projects financial
    management system is currently rated satisfactory, and all audits are acceptable and
    up-to-date.
