                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All project activities are now completed and the project is closing on February 29, 2012. The results of the project impact assessment survey carried out in January – March, 2011
                         (the project was originally scheduled to close on May 31, 2011) show that the core outcome indicators have been met and that the project is having significant positive results. The
                         proportion of project beneficiaries who obtained credit and advisory services, and adopted improved crop and livestock technologies is consistently higher than farmers outside of the
                         project area. Income of participating farmers from agricultural activities has increased by about 30 percent, higher than the project target of 20 percent. ADCP II activities also helped

                         farmers to market their increased production in crops and livestock. The percentage of total production marketed for cash by participating farmers has increased from 60 to 76.6
                         percent (a 27% increase). The project has yielded an overall economic rate of return of 20 percent.

                         The project achieved sizable results with expanding the outreach of the credit unions (CUs) to more communities by facilitating the creation of new CUs. It has also expanded the

                         activities of the CUs that existed at the end of ADCP I by extending the coverage of the credit line, capacity building and provision of MIS software. Some 74.8 million AZN have been
                         provided to credit unions and also borrowers groups (BGs) to help investments in livestock, crop and retail/trade. Some 24,500 members of CUs and BGs have received 52,800 loans
                         with average size of AZN 650 and AZN 2450 for individual members of BGs and CUs respectively which represents a significant achievement in terms of breadth (number of
                         borrowers) and depth of credit outreach (small size of loans). Although the project satisfactorily met the target intermediate outcome indicator of over 95% financial recovery rate,
                         some credit unions suffered weaknesses in governance and repayments. ADCP II also extended financial services to medium agribusiness. Some 119 agribusinesses covering a
                         broad range of sub-sectors have been financed for a total of US$ 18.17 million. The on-lending activities of this sub-component can be considered very successful. The project also
                         supported capacity building to participating banks to improve their skills in appraising agriculture-related investment loans. The competitive grant program for testing and transferring
                         of new improved technologies has been successfully completed. 74 grants for introducing and transferring improved technologies for production, storage, grading, packaging,
                         labeling, small-scale processing and canning of different high-value products have been awarded. Around 7000 entrepreneurs and farmers participated in technology transfer
                         activities.

                         ADCP II has also established the Market Information and Commercial Hub (MICH) with the objective was to provide farmers with market information. 10 large markets were selected
                         for MICH, and information is being collected on a daily basis on key variables such as wholesale and retail prices, farmer prices etc. The system has now been tested and is ready for
                         full launch.

                         The advisory program with a well-defined structure is now covering the whole country, as planned. 201 Private Advisors have been contracted by 10 Regional Advisory Centers with
                         appropriate village training rooms set up. Farmers with access to advisory services are generally positive, with majority of respondents in the project final survey satisfied or highly
                         satisfied with the services provided. Almost all beneficiaries of advisory program indicated that they had at least some production increase, with 55% and 2.7 % indicating that their
                         production had increased by 10-25% and greater than 25% respectively. Some 5500 Special Interest Groups were formed and some 32,600 training one-day training courses have
                         been carried out. In terms of the sustainability of the extension system supported by the project, the government has established by Presidential decree a Working Group whose
                         mandate is to propose further reforms in agricultural sector, including public extension system. The government has also developed a draft law which will govern the operations of the
                         extension system. However, because there has been a delay in the decision making regarding the reforms of the extension system, this uncertainty has disrupted the funding of the
                         extension services established under the project . It is, therefore, important to take a decision quickly to avoid long gap in funding of the extension services,


                         Under ADCP II, the establishment of the private veterinary units has been extended to beyond the initial 25 raions to additional 30 raions to essentially provide coverage throughout
                         the country. The PVUs are all fully operational as planned with the total program of 55 PVUs now comprising some 160 veterinarians. All PVUs achieved the defined performance
                         milestones and are deemed to be operationally self-sufficient, which indic ate potential for the PVUs to become fully sustainable. 90% of livestock owners using the PVU services are
                         satisfied with the quality of the services. Brucellosis control program has been successfully piloted in four raions. The vaccination program has been established and is working well.
                         The project also supported further development of National Animal Disease Information System (AZVET) established under the Avian Flu operation and provided support to the
                         Veterinary Faculty of the Ganja Agricultural University by equipping teaching lab, improving curriculum and training.

                         The program of modernization of the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry (NRICH) has been successfully implemented. NRICH was re-organized, the Advisory Board was
                         established and a consolidated research program to meet national food security strategy and oriented to client needs was developed. As the field equipment and seed cleaning and
                         processing equipment were provided to the five experimental stations, the quality of research plots are much better and the overall quantity and quality of seeds has significantly
                         improved. In 2010 some 769 tons of seeds were provided to 104 certified seed growers and seed companies for commercial production and distribution to farmers. Nine crop
                         varieties have been registered and released for commercial cultivation. Farmers acknowledged improved productivity and income from adoption of new technologies and crop
                         varieties. This component has exceeded its outcome indicators as more than 35% of farmers have already benefited and are satisfied with the quality of locally adapted seeds.
