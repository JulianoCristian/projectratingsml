                         business and agricultural support services including financial, advisory and veterinary services and by stimulating market-oriented investments in rural areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily and the most of activities have been completed successfully. The results of the project final impact assessment survey show
                         that the core outcome indicators are being met and that the project is having significant positive results. Income of participating farmers has increased by 30 percent which exceeds
                         estimates. The advisory program with a well-defined structure is now covering the whole country, as planned. Farmers with access to advisory services demonstrate improved
                         management and increased production. The competitive grant program for testing and transferring of new improved technologies has been successfully completed. 108

                         project achieved sizeable results also with expanding the outreach of the credit unions to more communities. Some 44,300 small loans have been issued to 23,000 members of credit
                         unions and borrowers groups. Some credit unions, however, demonstrate weaknesses in governance and repayment of credits.
