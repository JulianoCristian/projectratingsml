2.       Implementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily as reflected in the current ISR
and rating. Results of the mid-term impact assessment indicate that the project is on track to
achieve its development objectives. Income of participating farmers has increased by nine percent
in accordance with estimates. The advisory program continues to progress very well with a well-
defined structure covering the whole country now in place. All ten regional advisory centers are
performing well and farmers demonstrate improved management and increased production. Good
progress has been made with lending to medium agribusinesses. The competitive grant program
for testing and transferring of new improved technologies is well advanced. Private veterinary
units established under the project are operating well a number of clients is increasing steadily. A
brucellosis control program has been successfully piloted. Establishing a market information
system is well underway. The project achieved sizeable results also in expanding investments in
rural areas with some 37,000 small loans issued. Intensive training for credit unions is currently
being delivered as part of capacity building program for CUs. To date, the project had disbursed
US$26.99 million which represents 89 percent of the currently available IDA credit funds.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to continue funding the project advisory program
and the project operational costs during the remainder of the project. In March 2010, the project
task team and PMU reviewed the financial status of all project components and proposed
reallocation of credit proceeds to ensure sufficient funding for the remaining project activities. In
order to complete the project activities, it is necessary to reallocate SDR 691,500 from the
category consultancy services for other project components (Category 2(b)) to the categories of
consultancy services for Information and Advisory Center (IAC) and Regional Advisory Centers
(RACs) (Category 2(a)) and incremental operating costs (Categories 7(a) and 7(b)). Rapidly
increasing prices during the project period have resulted in increasing costs for most activities of
the Information and Advisory Services sub-component of the Project. In particular, the costs of
the travel and transportation, rental of rooms, utilities, printing and staff were higher than
estimated at the time of project appraisal. Price increase has also affected the budget for the
project operation costs.

4.       The project development objectives and results indicators would remain unchanged and a
restructuring would not affect the project's safeguard category or trigger a new safeguard policy.
The projects financial management system is currently rated satisfactory, and all audits are
acceptable and up-to-date.
