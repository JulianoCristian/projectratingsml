There\n            are two main lessons that can be learned from this project.\n            First, responsibility for administering a line of credit\n            should only be given to a competent Borrower agency, or\n            provision should be included in the project for a strong\n            institutional building element to strengthen the agency.\n            Second, the Bank should avoid financing projects in a sector\n            that it plans to discontinue lending operations, unless it\n            is prepared to make adequate provision for supervision."}, "docdt": "1990-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
