foreign\n            exchange earnings for the Ivory Coast. It would provide\n            US$12.0 million long-term financing for hotel construction\n            through CCI; US$1.0 to finance a wildlife program; and\n            US$1.2 million to finance a technical assistance program in\n            the Ministry of Water and Forests, CCI, the Office National\n            du Tourism (ONT), and SIETHO. The project does not face any\n            special risks. Total project costs, including $0.1 million\n            taxes applicable to the wildlife component, are estimated at\n            US$63.6 million of which about US$39.4 million is in foreign\n            exchange.
