The experience of the\n            Rajasthan Agriculture Development Project offers four\n            lessons for future Bank supported, state-wide multi-sectoral\n            interventions in the agriculture sector in India and\n            elsewhere. 1) When several policy reforms and investments\n            are required in a sector, a multi-phase operation over a\n            longer period may be more appropriate. Early attention could\n            then be focused on critical policy reforms and the most\n            crucial investments to create the right platform for\n            subsequent investments. This would avoid the simultaneous\n            preoccupation with meeting multiple targets at the expense\n            of a sound policy framework. 2) Monitoring and evaluation of\n            outcomes should be integral to project design. Realistic\n            targets and indicators need to be linked to objectives. 3)\n            Complex Bank interventions require strong and constant Bank\n            management oversight to ensure the alignment of\n            implementation and design and strict adherence to Bank\n            procedures and policies. 4) Adequate understanding of the\n            financial situation of the government at the appraisal stage\n            can help ensure the financial health of a project during\n            implementation and the sustainability of activities\n            supported after closure."}, "docdt": "2005-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
