Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            rated as satisfactory overall. The list of lessons learned\n            includes the following: This complex operation involving 12\n            government departments made Borrower coordination and\n            monitoring and World Bank supervision difficult. It would\n            have been better had investments concentrated on fewer\n            critical areas that responded most directly to objectives,\n            were technically robust, and had a higher chance of success.\n            Performance was generally better in those departments that\n            commissioned activity evaluation studies early enough and\n            then took decisive remedial actions. Continuity of key staff\n            contributes to successful implementation. Under typically\n            harsh field conditions, especially when migratory practices\n            are followed, animal breeding programs should avoid use of\n            exotic stock and focus upgrading on selection within the\n            locally adapted breeds (except for intensive dairying).\n            Future programs should focus on fewer high quality\n            demonstrations of technologies with good replication\n            prospects. While the project reform agenda successfully\n            focused on introducing full cost recovery on selected farm\n            inputs, relatively little was included to promote income\n            generation and financial sustainability in the implementing departments."}, "docdt": "2001-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
