MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - RAJASTHAN
1.   The following memorandum and recogmendation on the proposed Development
Credit of SDR 73.1 million (US$106 million equivalent) to India is submitted
for approval. The IDA Credit would be on standard terms, with 35 years
maturity, to help finance the Agricultural Development Project - Rajasthan.
2.    Zaakgzwaun. India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at about 3% per
annum in the 1960. and 1970s, accelerating to 4.5% in the 1980s. Agriculture
grew at about 2.5% until the early 1980s, which is modest compared to other
Asian countries. Since the mid 1980s, the rate of agricultural growth has
declined, and latest indications are that it has stagnated. Reestablishing
growth of agriculture has become a critical objective of the Government of
India (GOI). Agriculture's importa.ce in the economy is reflected by its 35%
contribution to GDP and the large population involved in the sector. About
65% of the total adult population in India is employed directly in the sector,
and about 75% of the population lives in rural areas. The declining rate of
growth of agriculture has significant repercussions on employment and rural
income.s. While per capita income has increased by about 2% per annum to reach
about US$300 in the country as a whole, there has been little improvement in
the standard of living of the poor or in redressing under-employment,
particularly in rural areas. Of the total population of over 850 million, an
estimated 280 million, or 33%, live below the poverty line. One-third of the
agricultural labor force are women, and agriculture is the main source of
employment for women in the rural areas. It follows that the health of the
overall economy and alleviation of poverty are strongly linked to the
performance of agriculture.
3.    The emphasis of GOI and state governments in the past has been on
promoting food production, with the goal of achieving food security,
augmenting agricultural exports and alleviating poverty. Increasing foodgrain
production has been pursued through: (a) the development of improved technical
packages -- fertilizers and improved seed varieties; (b) expansion of
irrigation; and (c) improvement of institutions and support services --
extension, research, seed production, credit and marketing. Notwithstanding
these efforts, and the technical successes of the "Green Revolution" of the
1960s, overall performance has been disappointing. Growth has been
constrained by pervasive central and state interventions through pricing and
trade policies and support )f public enterprises, declining capital formation,
outdated systems of agricultural research and extension, and substandard
management of irrigation infrastructure. Future growth must derive from
intensifying production on irrigated and rainfed land, diversifying to higher-
value crops, and improving the efficiency of resource use and farming systems.
4.   Rajasthan, situated in north-west India, is the second largest State of
the Indian Union. Of the total population of 44 million (1991 Census), over
75% live in rural areas and about 70% of the labor force is engaged in
agriculture. Agriculture's share of State Domestic Product (SDP) fell from
64% in 1970/71 to around 50% in 1988/89. With only 1% of the total water
resources in India and 11% of the area, Rajasthan is very dry. There is also
great variability in rainfall from year to year with frequent severe droughts.



.           -  ~~~~~2 *--
S.    Given the fragility of the resource base in much of Rajasthan,
agriculture is a high risk activity. Agricultural development has already led
to several environmental and social problems. These include: crop production
on lands unsuitable for agriculture: declining groundwater tables (except in
the canal irrigated areas); increasing salinity of groundwater; large pockets
of water-logging anid salinity buildup in the conmand areas of larger
irrigation projects; and a tendency towards indiscriminate use of agro-
chemicals in irrigated areas. In the arid and semi-arid west, comprising over
50% of t!e total land area in the state, livestock is the main rural activity.
The State produces 41% of India's wool from 30% of its shsep. Other important
livestock are milch cattle, buffaloes and, more recently, poultry. In the
central and eastern regions of the state the main activity is crop production.
Irrigation covers 4.5 million ha, or about 25% of the total cropped area.
6.    Through the mid 1960s, the major contributor to agricultural gr',wth was
increases in the cultivated area. Since then, the major contributor hau been
increases in productivity. Based on past sources of growth and analfsis of
potential, future growth will depend largely on improved exploitation of
irrigation, improved crop varieties, livestock breods and tecnnologies, and
improved farming systems. Contributing to this growth wil. be improved soil
and water conservation in rainfed areas, better land use and management, and
expansion of agroindustries.
7.   The Bank/IDA has supported 130 agricultural projects in India with
financing of US$10.2 billion equivalent (81% IDA and 19% Bank). In Rajtbahn,
there have been 19 projects, nine of which are ongoing. They have supported
development of agricultural research; the T&V system of extension: production
of high-yielding variety seeds; major and minor irrigation; forestry and
watershed protection; dairy, cotton -.nd oilseeds; and improved storage and
marketing for agricultural products.
8.   Many agricultural projects in India have suffered from implementation
problems, including: (a) delays in project mobilization; (b) delays in
procurement; (c) poor quality irrigation and civil .orks; (d) institutional
weaknesses: (e) insufficient local funding; and (f) insufficient preparation
of resettlpanent and rehabilitation components. These problems have been
evident in BaiaAthan also, although recently there has been an improving
trend. The important lessons from the Bank/IDA's experience in Rajasthan are
that: (i) institutional arrangements must be established from the very
beginning of a project to ensure adequate and timely funding, monitoring and
coordination; and (ii) the availability of funding needs to be reviewed
periodically to ensure that adequate capital and operating costs are promptly
provided. The design of the proposed project includes measures to redress
problems of past implementation performance.
9.    Rational, for sank Tnvolvmunt.  Acting mainly through the Central
Government authorities, the Bank has had limited eauccess at encouraging
Government (GOI and state governments) to enact agricultural reforms.
Contentious areas of reform include improving cost recovery for goods and
services provided by the public sector, e.g. tariffs for electric power,
charges for irrigation water and costs of seedlings, reducing expenditures on
subsidies, e.g. for fertilizers and seeds, reforming cooperatives to make them
financially viable and bring them under control of their farmer members, and
reining in escalating co8ts of public enterprises. Agriculture,
constitutionally, is a state respon.Aibilaty. Therefore, the Bank has agreed



-3-
with GO0 that the Bank's lending strategy for agriculture should be to addreEs
most problems of the sectcr on a state-by-state basis, at the same time as
supporting selective reforms at the Center in areas of agricultural pricing
and trade policy. The exercise entails analyses of past and likely future
sources of growth, identification of physical, economic and institutional
constraints to growth, and definition of policy reforms and priorities for
future public and private investment in the sector. The essence of an
Agricultural Development Project (ADP) is that once the Bank has agreed with a
state government on a broad strategy for agricultural growth and on specific
reform measures, the Bank would help finance priority investments in the
sector. It is expected that the proposed project will be followeo by ADPs for
several other states over the next few years.
10.  The basic strategy for reforming agriculture in India, as summarized in
the FY91 CEM, is to: (a) improve the structure of incentives, (b) increase the
efficiency of public investment and promote private investment: (c) encourage
technology generation and adoption; and (d) improve the performance of
irrigation. For Raigathan, this strategy is equally appropriate.
Agricultural growth in the State is constrained by the harsh physical
conditions and by GOR policies. Various input subsidies and other
interventions and regulations have constrained private sector investment.
GOR's excessive involvement in the supply of inputs and in agricultural
processing (either directly or through State-controlled cooperatives) has
served as an impediment to growth of the sector. The project would confine
itself to strategies and reforms that are within the purview of GOR. Pricing
policies (for inputs and outputs) or product support programs that derive from
GOI would not be adiressed, since they should be taken up in a broader context
with GOI directly. Policy issues pertaining to major and medium surface
irrigation in the State would be better dealt with through a State water
Resources Consolidation Project.
11.  Projet Objietives.  The project would assist GOR to implement its new
agricultural strategy as set out in its Agricultural Sector Strategy paper,
which was submitted to IDA prior to appraisal in May 1992. The broad
objectives of the strategy would be to: (a) accelerate the growth of agri-
culture through improved technical, financial and economic use of resources;
(b) enhance the long-term sustainability of growth through appropriate
management and conservation of natural resources; and (c) improve equity
through better targeting of development programs to the poorer strata of the
rural population. The latter objective would include the provision of greater
opportunities for women to participate in the growth process.  These object-
ives would be supported by specific policy reforms and related investments.
*         12.  Policg Reforms. The policy reforms, which are included in a Policy
Reform Program (para. 20), would address sector issues surrounding cost
recovery and subsidies for inputs, the quantity and quality of surface water
and groundwater, livestock improvement, the generation and dissemination of
productive and sustainable technologies, the environment, constraints to
private sector initiatives, development of agro-processing and marketing, and
priorities in public expenditures. The proposed reforms would include: (a)
pricing the supply of goods and services from the public sector to agriculture
(except irrigation) at full cost; (b) eliminating or reducing subsidies
provided by GOR -- those that are maintained would be better targeted; (c)
lmproving the efficiency of water use and sustainability of the resource; (d)
reviewing constraints to the development of agro-industries and marketing, and



-4-
ways to improve the operational efficiency of markets for agricultural
products: (e) inCreasing emphasis on the livestock sector to exploit its
potential for growth and poverty alleviation: (f) undertaking institutional
reforms of rural cooperatives to make them more democratUc and responsive to
their members; (g) strengthening GOR's capacity to review agricultural
policies, and to evaluate and plan for public investments in agriculture; and
(h) strengthening GOR's environmental oversight for agriculture.
13.   For agriculture activities excluding irrigation in 1987/88, GOR's cost
recovery was only 7% as compared to the total cost of providing the goods and
F-rvices. This figure compares with an average of 29% for all-India in the
same year, and with 21% in Rajasthan ten years earlier. The deterioration in
cost recovery and increasing input subsidies have occurred when fixed public
investment in Rajasthan's agriculture has declined at a real rate of 7.5% per
year (1984 to 1989). Since 1989, GOR's expenditures on a2ULUr.±it subsidies
have accelerated further -- for crop production by over 150% per year. The
dramatic increase has occurred mainly because of GOR's introduction of
subsidies for certified seeds, groundwater irrigation equipment and fodder
development. The increased subsidies have crowded out needed expenditures for
increased public capital formation in the sector and, notably, have occurred
at a time when rates of agricultural growth have stagnated or declined.
14.   In addition to the explicit subsidies, large ml±aicit subsidies are
provided for surface irrigation water, electric power, credit and fertilizers.
Because the cost of the fertilizer subsidy is borne entirely by GOI, it has no
impact on GOR's finances. (In 1990/91, the cost to GOI of the subsidy for
fertilizer consumption in Rajasthan was US$62 million equivalent, compared to
the all-India cost of US$2.3 billion.) GOR has estimated the net annual
subsidy for irrigation in 1987 at US$330 million equivalent, with farmers
paying about 3% of the financial cost of delivered water. Similarly, the
power subsidy to agriculture in terms of reduced tariffs was estimated at
US$145 million equivalent in 1987/88. No recent figures are available on
implicit subsidies for credit. The magnitude of these subsidies, together
with the substantial expenditures on the Rajasthan Canal, suggests that GOR
should reassess fundamentally its expenditure priorities in agriculture. A
reallocation of public expenditures from certain recurrent items to increased
capital formation (infrastructure, technology seneration and dissemination,
and development of human resources) would contribute to accelerated and more
equitable growth in the sector.
15. In the case of groundwater, the availability of GOR subsidies -- for
digging wells, power connections and power tariffs -- has contributed to
overexploitation of the resource, such that in many areas the water table has
been steadily declining, and water quality has been deteriorating. These
phenomena, together with limited knowledge about groundwater reserves,
extraction and aquifer recharge, imply that GOR has inadequate control over
the State's most precious resource.  In July 1992, GOR increased its ru.al
power tariff from paisa 42 to 50 per kWh, a level recommended by GOI and the
highest rural tariff in the country. GOR also plans to increase by mid 1993
its flat rate tariff for rural power to be equivalent to the metered rate
(about 20% of Rajasthan's rural power connections are charged on a flat rate
basis rather than per unit). These measures, together with a comprehensive,
long-term Water Resources Planning Study for the State, will help to ensure
that the exploitation of groundwater becomes more efficient, equitable and
sustainable, and will increase revenues to the State Electricity Board (SEB).

16.  As in the rest of India, GOR is the predominant shareholder and appoints
civil servants as directors and managers of the State's cooperatives. Most
cooperatives are essentially public enterprises. The proposed policy c~hanges
should initiate the process of weaning selected rural cooperatives from State
control and putting their management in the hands of voluntary associations of
their members. For the evolution of an agri-business system, key elements are
efficient agro-processing and marketing. GOR plans to carry out an
opportunity survey and constraints analysis for agro-industries, in
consultation with the State Chamber of Commerce.
17.   The Rajasthan Agricultural University (RAU), established in 1987, is
ill-equipped to respond to the challenges of the 21st century, including:
integrating agriculture in the State with the rest- of India and beyond; the
changing structure of demand for agricultural products; and the fragility of
the natural resource base in Rajasthan. Under the project, the relevance and
responsiveness of the education and research programs would be fundamentally
reviewed, as would issues such as faculty performance, professional isolation,
promotion criteria and graduation standards.
18.   Prooet' Tnveantmntm. The project would finance investments in crop
husbandry, horticulture, animal husbandry, water resources, agricultural
research and training, rural roads, project coordination, and environmental
strengthening through creation of an Environment Cell (in the Office of the
Development Commissioner). Complementary activities in support of these
investments would include extension, demonstrations and training, technical
assistance and studies, and support for women's activities and NGOs. The
project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1999.
19. To facilitate flexibility in planning and implementation of the project,
a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would prepare annual action plans based on
project objectives and implementation experience.  A mid-term evaluation of
the project would be carried out jointly by GOR and IDA. With the help of
NOOs, GOR would encourage participatory development: groups of beneficiaries
would participate in planning and would contribute willi GOR to the capital
costs (labor and/or cash) of infrastructure such as construction or
rehabilitation of minor irrigation schemes, some link roads and watershed
protection. All 06M costs would be borne by the beneficiaries. Participatory
development would also include new approaches to extension where groups of
farmers would hire their own extension agents with financial assistance from
GOR on a declining basis. Special efforts would be made to expand the
involvement of women in these and other productive activities.
20. GOR agreed at negotiations that it would carry out the Policy Reform
Program (see Annex 1 of the Staff Appraisal Report).  Examples of reforms are
that GOR: (a) will phase in full cost recovery for specific goods and services
produced by the public sector according to a formula agreed upon with IDA; (b)
will increase by June 30, 1993 its flat rate tariffs for rural power to levels
equivalent to the prevailing metered rate; (c) will establish by March 31,
1993 a standing State Water Resources Comittee; (d) will transfer from the
public sector to water users the operation and maintenance of minor irrigation
schemes and, on a pilot basis, of major irrigation commands; (e) will
authorize by March 31, 1993 rural cooperatives to make their own business
decisions; (f) will commission by March 31, 1993 an ag:o-industrial
opportunity survey and constraint analysis, in consultation with the State
Chamber of Commerce; and (f) will encourage the private sector in the



provision of veterinary services. GOR agreed at negotiations also that, inter
alia: (a) by March 31, 1993 it will recruit consultants to carry out a State
Water Resources Planning Study, and by December 31, 1995 it will furnish to
IDA the results of the study for its cois.nents; (b) by March 31, 1993 Rajasthan
Agricultural University (RAU) will commission a study for preparation of a
Strategic Development Plan for RAU; and (c) its Public Works Department will
employ consultants under terms of reference acceptable to IDA to inspect and
verify the technical quality of road works financed under the project. The
Credit would include retroactive financing up to US$4 million equivalent for
expenditures incurred after April 1, 1992 to the date of Credit signing. To
facilitate IDA disbursements, a Special Ac%ount in US dollars woald be estab-
lished in the Reserve Bank of India with ar. deposit of up to US$5 million.
The Closing Date of the Credit would be September 30, 1999.
21.       rn1nnantal lla6.  An environmental impact assessment was prepared
for the project and it was designated category "B". None of the project
components are expected to have an adverse environmental impact. The water
resources study would assist GOR in planning for long-term, sustainable
exploitation of scarce water in the State. For rural roads, potential adverse
effects arising from a loss of agricultural or forest land, soil erosion or
traversing protected habitat have been minimized by the criteria for road
selection. To help address specific envirinmental issues of the project and
to tackle broader generic issues of the agricultural sector, a permanent
Environment Cell would be established under the project.
22.   I      opn2-z  Woman.  As in most states of India, rural women in Rajasthan
contribute to almost all farm and household operations. Women are involved
especially in horticulture, livestock and post-harvest activities. Improving
women's access to more productive and sustainable agricultural technologies
through expanded training and extension would enable them to participate in
these activities more effectively, raising their productivity and income
earning capacity. Women's involvement in participatory planning and
development would also enhance their share of project benefits.
23.   lnef4et..  Through preparation and appraisal, including preparation by
GOR of its Agricultural Strategy Paper, the proposed project has already had a
substantial impact on GOR's capacity to address agricultural policy issues,
and to formulate specific, timebound proposals for a reform agenda. It would
have the long-term benefit of establishing a permanent sector policy analysis
and investment planning capability in the State. As such, it would make a
substantial contribution to GOR's development objectives of accelerating
growth, alleviating poverty and conserving resources, as well as rationalizing
public expenditures and improving the efficiency of public and private
investment. The project would contribute to GOR's objective of providing road
links to all villages with populations of 1,000 and above by the end of the
project period. It would also help to assess the extent, locations, quality
and sustainability of water in the State for municipal, industrial and
agricultural uses. It would enhance the availability of higher quality seeds,
seedlings and livestock, would introduce improved farm management systems, and
would enhance opportunities for poorer sections of the rural population,
particularly women, to contribute to the process of growth. The agreed
reductions in explicit subsidies are expected to result in savings of some
US$1 million equivalent over the next three years, which is about 50% of the
amount spent by GOR on such subsidies from 1987/88 to 1989/90 on crop



-7-
production, horticulture, livestock and fisheries. Increases in rural power
tariffs are e,pected to generate the equivalent of US$35 to 50 million per
year in additional revenues to the SEB. Not least, the project would support
the Bank's overall effort to assist GOI and state governments in carrying out
agricultural sector reforms, following on from the recommendations in the FY91
CEl.
24.   Laka.  The main project risk would be the timely implementation and
adherence by GOR to the policy reforms, including the implementation of
recoimndations from studies supported by the project.  Preparation by GOR of
its Agricultural Strategy Paper, official clearance of the Paper by the State
Government, and the carrying out of certains reforms already, are persuasive
evidence of GOR's willingness to address policy issues and effect change.  A
continuing dialogue with IDA during supervision on the reform process and on
progress of the studies should minimize the risks. Legislative approval would
not be required for any of the proposed reforms.
25.          ndatfnn. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comp'y
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
