    agricultural development in Rajasthan through a broad\n            approach linking policy reforms and public investments. The\n            project's objectives are to: accelerate the growth of\n            agriculture through improved technical, financial and\n            economic use of resources; enhance sustainability of the\n            productive resource base; and improve equity within the\n            sector. Policy reforms will include full cost recovery for\n            publicly provided goods and services, reduced inputs\n            subsidies, improved efficiency and sustainability of water\n            use, institutional reforms of rural cooperatives,\n            alleviating constraints to private investment in\n            agroindustry, and strengthening of the Government's\n            environmental oversight for agriculture. Investment\n            components will include crop husbandry, horticulture, animal\n            husbandry, water resources, agricultural research and\n            training, rural roads, project coordination, and\n            environmental strengthening."}, "docdt": "1992-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
