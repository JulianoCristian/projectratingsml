Some lessons learned included: 1) With\n            respect to program coordination, Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster\n            Response Project (KHADREP) support to National HIV/AIDS\n            Control Council (NACC) has been essential for the progress\n            which has been achieved, and support should be continued\n            under the planned new Project (TOWA). Future support should\n            also be linked to the full implementation of NACC's\n            institutional restructuring plan, and NACC's delivery\n            of the specific results outlined in the Kenya National\n            HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP) 2005-2010 results framework;\n            2) Attention should be paid to both the internal and the\n            external domains of public sector programs when the emphasis\n            of the work of the AIDS Control Units (ACUs) has been on the\n            internal domain; 3) The role of the financial management\n            agent (FMA) and the arrangements to mitigate concerns about\n            inappropriate selection of projects and \"briefcase\n            NGOs\" should be strengthened; 4) The lack of an\n            effective programmatic monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            has made it difficult to quantify the impact of the KHADREP.\n            This is a lesson that applies not only to Kenya, but more\n            generally to other countries fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic;\n            and 5) The KHADREP experience shows that the NACC needs\n            leadership that is creative, results-based, effective in\n            communications, collaborative and with complete integrity.\n            In addition to the specific investments needed in such areas\n            as financial management strengthening, internal oversight\n            and audit, and the development of a fiduciary risk\n            management policy, strengthening local decision-making,\n            monitoring and accountability at the central and local\n            levels, communications, it is also critically important that\n            the newly recruited senior staff at the NACC should be\n            trained and supported to enable them to function effectively."}, "docdt": "2007-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
