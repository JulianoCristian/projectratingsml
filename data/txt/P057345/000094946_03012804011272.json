satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was high and, the Bank and borrower performance were\n            both highly satisfactory. The lessons learned indicated that\n            strengthening rural communities and introducing more\n            democratic practices in their internal organization was\n            possible with relatively limited human and material\n            resources. An effective transfer of responsibilities and\n            resources followed quickly to community's\n            organizational efforts. Decentralized procedures allowed\n            communities to be responsible for the procurement process as\n            part of the implementation. The rate of beneficiary\n            contribution (twenty per cent in kind or in cash) requested\n            by the project as a condition for co-financing did not\n            constitute a major constraint for the communities. Overall,\n            the communities expressed their willingness to contribute to\n            a large range of micro-projects that include social\n            infrastructure, agriculture productivity improvement, and\n            income generating activities. The main weakness of the\n            project was limited participation of women in the village in\n            the organizational process, and a small number of selected\n            micro-projects were specifically oriented to respond to\n            women's needs."}, "docdt": "2002-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
