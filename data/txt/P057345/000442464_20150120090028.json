To help the rural poor especially women\n            utilize their environment in more efficient and sustainable\n            ways, the World Bank in 1998 launched the Borgou pilot rural\n            support project. Its primary goal was to encourage local\n            institutions, village committees in particular to embrace\n            collective decision-making. The project has supported 150\n            basic literacy courses delivered in local languages to 2,200\n            women and 2,500 men. It has also offered 262 technical\n            training courses on subjects as varied as financial\n            management, bee keeping, fishing, and refining crops."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
