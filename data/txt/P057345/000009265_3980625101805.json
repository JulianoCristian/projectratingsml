understanding of this environment; (b) improving local\n            institutes to strengthen collective decision-making\n            capabilities; (c) providing the populations with resources\n            to implement their development plans; and (d) improving the\n            capacity of the providers of goods and services to respond\n            to demands from the rural communities to carry out\n            sustainable development activities designed and implemented\n            through a participatory approach.
