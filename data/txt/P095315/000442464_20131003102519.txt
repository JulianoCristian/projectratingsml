      1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 By the end of 2005, there were about 312 million rural people in China reported to be without
access to safe water supply and 790 million rural residents without improved sanitation, many of whom
were living in China’s western provinces. The Government of China (GoC) had assigned high priority to
the development of western China, but because of the region's relative under-development, dispersed and
remote poverty distribution and limited experience in adopting community participation approaches, it
was a challenge to develop equitable and sustainable rural water supply and sanitation programs, which
could address the scale of the problem. Poor integration of water supply, sanitation and hygiene
promotion activities and limited cooperation between the relevant sector agencies were key barriers to
achieving sustainable investments and maximizing the impact on health, productivity and rural
livelihoods.

1.1.2 Many parts of western China were still plagued by water source contamination as a result of
agricultural and industrial pollution, untreated domestic wastewater and/or high natural arsenic, fluoride
or salinity levels. Water resources were scarce in parts of the region and scarcity was increasing because
of increased demand from industry and urban centers, combined with inefficient use of water for irrigated
agriculture and industry. For rural village households, the identification of safe sources and collection of
adequate water supply were difficult, time-consuming tasks. GoC had begun to address water quality
problems and to support moves towards more efficient and sustainable water use. However, the lack of
access to safe water supply and adequate sanitation, together with poor hygiene practices, presented a real
risk to poverty alleviation because incidents of poor health could force those just above the poverty line
back below it.

1.1.3 GoC’s Eleventh Five Year Plan (FYP) for Rural Safe Drinking Water Supply (2006-2010) set a
target of providing safe drinking water to 160 million people and aimed to invest Y40 billion (US$5.14
billion). This FYP emphasized that the poorer western regions, with serious problems of water scarcity
and quality, poverty areas and rural schools, would be the focus for funding and other assistance. GoC
also intended to introduce a new approach that in principle addressed the whole life cycle of safe drinking
water programs, by integrating sanitation and hygiene promotion activities together with water supply,
known as the three-in-one approach. GoC was also committed to improving outcomes through the
introduction of an innovative approach for scheme selection, institutional arrangements, community
participation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems.

1.1.4 To help address the above issues, GoC requested the Bank, in partnership with the UK
Department for International Development (DfID) and the United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF), to
design a project to demonstrate many of the innovations set out in the Eleventh FYP in two poorer
western provinces: Shaanxi Province and Sichuan Province. The overall goal of the project was to
develop a replicable model to increase access by poor participating villages to sustainable safe drinking
water, sanitation and hygiene promotion services using the three-in-one approach.


Rationale for Bank Involvement




                                                     1
1.1.5    The project supported three of the five core themes of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) of 2006-2010 1, namely: (a) Theme 2 - Reducing poverty and social exclusion, through sustaining
rural livelihoods and expanding access to basic social and infrastructure services, particularly in rural
areas; (b) Theme 3 – Managing resources scarcity and environmental challenges, including the
conservation of water resources; and (c) Theme 5 – Improving public institutions by reforming public
sector units. By addressing the rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (RWSSHP) sector
issues in Shaanxi and Sichuan, the Bank had a unique opportunity to partner, not only with the provincial
governments, but because of the demonstrative nature of the project, to influence national policy in the
sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The PDO in the PAD was: “to increase access of poor participating communities to sustainable
and equitable water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion services by adopting an integrated and
participatory approach, which can be replicated in other provinces.” The PDO in the Loan Agreement
was basically the same, but did not mention replication: “to assist Shaanxi Province and Sichuan Province
in increasing access of poor communities to sustainable and equitable water supply, sanitation and
hygiene promotion services using an integrated and a participatory approach.”

1.2.2 Key outcome indicators included: (a) Increased number of people and schools with access to safe
water supply; (b) Increased number of people and schools with access to improved sanitation; (c)
Increased percentage of people and students in schools adopting safe hygiene and sanitary behaviors; (d)
Percentage of water supply schemes operating in an equitable and sustainable way; and (e) Evidence of
the adoption and sustainability of the integrated three–in-one approach and replication in domestic
programs.

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
        reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO was not revised; however as part of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) carried out in
June/July 2010, the Bank, DfID, UNICEF and the Provincial Project Management Offices (PPMOs)
agreed on changes to the KPIs following a reduction in available financing. The proposed changes
included: (a) reducing project outputs; (b) dropping the indicators related to the three-in-one approach;
and (c) replacing all Hygiene Promotion (HP) related intermediate outcome indicators with two
behavioral based indicators: (i) hand washing with soap (HWWS) in village communities and schools;
and (ii) safe disposal of young children’s faeces. The restructuring was only submitted and approved in
May 2012. (See Sections 2.2, 2.3 and Annex 2 for further details.)

       1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target beneficiaries at appraisal were: (a) a total of 771,109 people (Shaanxi 326,716
and Sichuan 444,393) to be provided with access to safe drinking water; (b) a total of 664,005 people
(Shaanxi 326,716 and Sichuan 337,289) would benefit from improved sanitation services; and (c) a total
of 448 schools (Shaanxi 297 and Sichuan 151) were to be provided with access to improved sanitation
services. All the main beneficiaries were in poor and vulnerable villages. Beneficiary institutions directly
involved in project implementation and management included the Provincial and County Development

                                                                      2
and Reform Commissions (PDRC, CDRC), and line agencies at provincial and township levels
responsible for water supply, sanitation and health and hygiene service provision.

1.4.2     The first restructuring in May 2012 was initiated by the two provinces due to the withdrawal of
DFID’s grant and depreciation of the US dollar and the pound sterling which result in shortfall of
available funding to support the project activities in its full extent, and reduced the primary beneficiaries
such that: (i) people gaining access to safe drinking water was reduced to 584,716 (-24%); and (ii) people
gaining access to improved sanitation services was reduced to 200,505 (-70%).

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1   The project had four main components as detailed below:

        a.   Component 1: Safe Drinking Water Supply (Total Cost US$44.45 million; 62.4% of
             total project cost; IBRD US$14.55 million; DfID US$14.55 million eq.). This component
             was to finance improvements in access to safe drinking water, for 61 multi-village and 335
             single village systems, 75 rainwater collection systems, 1816 clustered and 23,247 single
             household (HH) schemes. All schools within the project area of Shaanxi Province and
             selected schools in Sichuan Province were to be provided with a safe water supply.

        b. Component 2: Environmental Sanitation – (Total Cost US$19.00 million; 26.7% of total
           project cost; IBRD US$6.725 million; DfID US$6.725 million eq.). This component was to
           finance the construction of 159,554 household latrines and 51 soak-away systems, 162
           village level public/shared latrines; and 1171 village level garbage drop-off points; 448
           school latrines, including hand washing and drainage facilities and 222 school garbage drop-
           off                                                                                  points.

        c.   Component 3: Hygiene Promotion – (Total Cost US$3.79 million; 5.3% of total project
             cost; IBRD US$1.895 million; DfID US$1.895 million eq.). The hygiene promotion (HP)
             component was to finance formative research, technical assistance, capacity building and
             training, mass media programs, print and electronic media, person-to-person contact
             (demonstrations, role playing and direct training), community and school participatory
             hygiene      promotion       campaigns,      and      behavioral      change       M&E.

        d. Component 4: Institutional Strengthening and Development – (Total Cost US$3.93
           million; 5.5% of total project cost; IBRD US$ 1.825 million; DfID US$1.825 million eq.).
           This component was to finance a comprehensive training program to increase capacity
           building at all levels; technical training for line agencies, contractors, and etc; community
           training for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion) committees, selected
           community leaders and members; and social activities to mobilize communities and enhance
           participation. It also included the development of a result-based M&E System, Community-
           based M&E System (CBMES) and a Management Information System (MIS).

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The May 2012 restructuring was necessary because of the withdrawal of DFID’s grant and the
depreciation of dollars and pound sterling, which resulted in a shortfall of funds to support the project.
The scope and scale of a number of activities were reduced and both provinces tailored the restructuring
toward their own priorities. Because Shaanxi suffered acutely from water scarcity, it chose to safeguard
financing for village water supply schemes under Component 1 at the expense of environmental sanitation
works under Component 2. Sichuan on the other hand, cut Components 1 and 2 across the board,


                                                     3
reducing outputs considerably. For Component 3, both provinces reduced activities to those necessary to
complete final HP behavioral surveys and carry out local workshops to share experiences amongst
CPMOs. For Component 4, Shaanxi reduced the number of proposed domestic studies tours to a
minimum, while both provinces made provision to hire suitable consultants to complete their borrower’s
ICR. (See Section 3.2 and Annex 2 for details of component revisions and project wide cost revisions.)

1.6.2 Another significant change was DfID withdrawal from the project in 2010 due to changes in aid
priorities by the UK Government. As a result, the original DfID contribution of GBP 13,542,429
(equivalent to US$25 million or 33% of the total project costs) was reduced GBP9,751,536 (equivalent to
US$15.34 million at completion or 72% of the planned amount).2 This cancellation resulted in a reduction
in scale and scope of the project. In addition, the depreciation of the US dollar by around 20% during
implementation also impacted the availability of resources for the project. As a result, the borrower’s
contribution increased from the planned US$25.36 million equivalent at appraisal to a final of US$31.65
million equivalent. The final project cost was US$72.59 million (or RMB450.06 million) compared to
US$75.36 (RMB582.53 million) at appraisal, more details are provided in Annex 1. The final project
cost was 4% less than the original project cost estimate at appraisal, but the 20% US$ depreciation,
theincrease in labor/material cost, and the insufficient contingency allowance meant that the available
funding in local terms was not enough to support the project activities to the fullest extent intended.

1.6.3 Reallocation and Extension of Closing Date. As part of the first restructuring, the Loan
proceeds were reallocated among the disbursement categories and the financing percentages among
categories of expenditure were increased in order to alleviate funding shortages following the withdrawal
of DfID and to enable full disbursement of the Loan. In the second restructuring of September 27, 2012,
the closing date was extended from September 30, 2012 to March 29, 2013 so that the two provinces
could complete ongoing works necessary to increase access to safe water supply and sanitation, carry out
beneficiary surveys and complete the borrower’s ICR.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1    Soundness of Background Analysis. At a strategic level, the Bank’s rationale for involvement
in the project was sound because it strongly supported the objectives of the CPS of 2006 -2010. Both the
project concept and design were technically sound, but very complex from an implementation point of
view. The design drew on China’s experience in RWSSH, and the Bank’s own considerable experience
and lessons learned from more than 20 years of supporting the RWSSH sector in China. Lessons learned
and incorporated into this project were many, but included: (a) careful attention to water scheme design to
avoid excess capacity; (b) the need to enhance the sustainability of RWS investment by including
mechanisms to ensure greater community participation in scheme selection, and management
arrangements; and (c) offering individual households a choice of affordable sanitation option.

2.1.2    The project by design, very closely supported the GoC’s strategic direction in the sector, as
articulated in the 11th FYP. The project was co-financed by the World Bank and the United Kingdom


2
 DfID Cancellation. In 2009, DfID informed GoC and the Bank that it was considering closing its China program,
and that any undisbursed portion of its grant would be cancelled. However, at that time, DfID was not able to give a
definitive answer and this indecision caused a host of problems, particularly the inability of the provinces to
formulate AWPs. Despite extensive negotiations between the GoC, the Bank and the British Government, DfID
formally withdrew from the project in December 21, 2010 as part of the decision to close its China program.



                                                         4
Department for International Development (DfID) and the GoC, with United Nations Fund for Children
(UNICEF) as a development partner. This strategic partnership provided a rich input to transfer
international and national experiences for implementing an integrated, sustainable approach for the
provision of water supply and sanitation services and health promotion.           DfID in particular had
previously supported a number of integrated community-managed programs in China and had developed
strengths in participatory approaches and community management models that were incorporated into
project design. The UNICEF brought its strong advocacy for raising the profile of sanitation, hygiene
promotion and water quality monitoring, as well as its extensive experience of sanitation and hygiene
promotion approaches. The design of the project therefore set out to harness the expertise of the three
international agencies and by working together, provide substantial added value to the design and delivery
of new approaches for RWSSH in China.

2.1.3 Assessment of Project Design. The project was correctly designed as a demonstration project to
“prove” the new three-in-one approach, with one of the key development objectives focused on
strengthening national policy and replication in other provinces in China. The project was complex in
that it involved multiple financing sources: an IBRD loan, a DfID grant and counterpart funding from
provincial and county governments, each contributing one-third. It also had a wide geographic spread in
two contiguous provinces, covering 25 counties, and a total of 661 villages. Added to the complexity was
the need to effectively address the challenge of the fragmented and uncoordinated approach to provision
of RWSSHP services at provincial and county levels involving the coordination and integration of the
three key line agencies, the Water Resource Bureau, Health Bureau, and the Patriotic Health Campaign
Committee Office (PHCCO), as well as the Health Education Institutes and other relevant departments.

2.1.4    In addition to being an equal financing partner, DFID, as part of its overall support to the
RWSSH sector, provided a separate grant of US$1.7 million equivalent to UNICEF, who also committed
US$1.1 million for a parallel technical assistance (TA) program known as the Knowledge and Advocacy
for Sanitation & Hygiene (KASH) program, aimed at strengthening central government policy and
management in the sector.

2.1.5     This KASH initiative was very strongly supported by the World Bank and NDRC and was very
firmly linked to this project. KASH was established early, with preparation and appraisal of both
running in parallel with the project. This allowed the Bank, DfID and UNICEF, as well as national and
provincial governments, to provide joint input consistent with the objective of close collaboration. The
activities of the KASH were developed in cooperation with the Social Development Department of
NDRC, the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and PHCCO. The
KASH project was designed to provide a range of opportunities to study and disseminate experiences that
were to be gained from the WPRWSSH project. Given the direct link with the central government, the
KASH project was designed to provide significant opportunities to scale up approaches developed under
this project.

2.1.6    The WPRWSSH project was designed incorporating a programmatic approach to
implementation, in which the first phase (tranche), covering 20% of schemes, was fully prepared and
appraised. The subsequent tranches (remaining 80%) were to be prepared using the technical and
safeguards frameworks specified in the PAD and submitted to the Bank for approval in the form of annual
works plans (AWPs). This programmatic approach was efficient in that it sped up project preparation
and appraisal given the large number of villages (661) and allowed some flexibility in final selection of
villages and allowed lessons learned to be progressively incorporated in detailed designs and estimated
costs of project activities to more current and realistic. This approach also spread the cost normally
associated with full preparation over the project implementation stage.




                                                    5
2.1.7 The design, included a strategy for directly supporting poor and vulnerable groups, was based on
a thorough Social Assessment done as part of project preparation. The key-elements included: (a)
Upfront Identification of Poor and Vulnerable Households by WASH Committees with the help of the
Civil Affairs Office and the Poverty Alleviation Office. The selection criteria reflected government
policy on vulnerable groups, as well as those with low-income levels. These households were then
directly targeted for subsidies for: (i) water supply connection fees; (ii) flexible arrangements for the
payment of Water tariffs; and (iii) and (iii) Sanitation Subsidies.

2.1.8 PDO/KPIs. The PDO was clearly stated, but by current standards it was long and complex in
that for the project to be successful, the access to the three services (water supply, sanitation and hygiene
promotion) had to be “sustainable” and “equitable” and had to be delivered or adopted using an
“integrated and participatory approach” and be replicable.        Some indicators were useful for monitoring
project progress and guiding implementation towards achievement of the PDO. However, KPI (e)
relating to “Evidence of the adoption and sustainability of the integrated three-in-one approach and
replication in domestic problems” was not quantified or easily measureable at provincial level and was
dropped at the first restructuring. In addition, there were too many indicators in the PAD, where no or
very little data was collected. As a result, a number of indicators (duplication of three-in-one approach)
were dropped or replaced with others during the project restructuring as requested by both provinces.

2.1.9 Safeguards. This project was designated Category B, safeguard screening category S2, and
triggered three safeguards: (i) Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01); Involuntary Resettlement (OP
4.12); and (iii) Dam Safety (OP/BP 4.37). Environmental Assessments (EAs) were completed in each
province and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were prepared at appraisal. A detailed
Resettlement Plan (RP), based on a socio-economic survey of the appraised 20% of schemes, was
prepared by local expert institutions experienced in the resettlement and monitoring requirements of the
World Bank. The project did not finance the construction of any new dams. However, at appraisal,
certain reservoirs in both provinces were identified as the water source for some of the first tranche of
water supply schemes. These dams underwent a review by dam safety experts in each province, and
detailed remediation plans were reviewed and approved by the Bank. The remaining 80% of project
schemes, which were very similar in scale and scope to the first 20%, were prepared using an
Environmental Framework and check list, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and Dam Safety
Framework. The project-wide EA was sent to the Bank’s InfoShop on December 1, 2006, the final RP
was disclosed on December 25, 2006, and the final Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) was disclosed
in the InfoShop on February 16, 2007.

2.1.10 Adequacy of Government Commitment. At appraisal and during early implementation the
provincial governments’ commitment to the project was strong. Consistent with the three-in-one
approach and the primary need to overcome the problems of lack of coordination between sectors, each
province established the PDRC as the lead project agency. The provincial governments also established
effective, strong and powerful project leading groups (PLGs) that included wide representation from the
concerned provincial level project departments (Finance, Water, Sanitation and Health, Environment,
Land Use) and from the China Women’s Federation (CWF), the key NGO involved with village
communities. Each province also set up the same project oversight and management arrangements at
county level with the County Development and Reform Bureaus (CDRB) in the lead. Each province and
all project-nominated counties participated extensively in the design of the project and demonstrated a
high level of ownership.

2.1.11 Risk Assessment. The appraisal team realistically assessed the project’s overall risk assessment
as “Substantial”. Four of the seven risks identified were rated “substantial” and three were “moderate”.
One of the substantial risks was that of limited demand amongst communities for sanitation investments
resulting in latrines not being built or used, which did materialize. Latrines were built as planned, with


                                                     6
HHs given a choice of the particular latrine that best suited them, but in many cases, new latrines
remained unused due to lack of follow-up instructions on O&M and adequate training. Another risk
identified at appraisal as moderate, related to the hygiene promotion program not being carried out using
modern and cost effective approaches. The mitigation measures included the need for close supervision
of HP activities though the engagement of international expertise. However, the TA was never mobilized
and this may have contributed to the poor outcome of this component. (See section 3.2).

2.1.12 Significant risks not identified at appraisal that affected project implementation were: (a) the
risk of natural disaster, especially of an earthquake despite Sichuan Province being regularly hit by major
earthquake events. The likely occurrence of future earthquakes is high and poses a very real threat to
development outcomes (see Section 4); (b) the risk associated with cost and price variations was
significant and the contingencies applied at appraisal were inadequate; and (c) the risk associated
implementation delays at the early stage of the project and the mismatch of expenditures with the forecast
availability of donor contributions was underestimated. These variations, combined with DfID’s
withdrawal, put the project in a situation of always having to accelerate implementation or suffer the loss
of grant funds (see Section 2.2). A risk not identified was the lack of central coordination of the two
provinces. This caused long delays that resulted in a significant slowdown in implementation. A way to
mitigate this problem could have been to enhance NDRC’s role in project coordination.

2.1.13 Quality at Entry (QAE). The QAE was not assessed by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group
(QAG). However, preparation was thorough as evidenced by the quality and detail of the PAD. The
programmatic approach, involving the detailed preparation and appraisal of 20% of the schemes, allowed
the provinces to concentrate their preparation resources better and produce higher quality results at
appraisal in less preparation time. Proper social and safeguards work was carried out and the results
incorporated into the design. The risk assessment was correct at “substantial” but omitted a couple of key
risks, especially the risk of natural disasters affecting implementation and outcomes and the risk regarding
adoption of proper hygiene behaviors. The Bank should have insisted on a central government project
coordination mechanism because the project included two provinces. This lack of coordination was a
key problem that caused a long delay (22 months) in getting the restructuring of the project approved,
with significant impact on implementation process and outcomes. Also, the Bank should have built more
flexibility into the project design to allow one province to move faster than the other in making
adjustments to project implementation specifics. If such flexibility had been in place, it would have been
possible to have two restructurings to allow Shaanxi province to restructure its own part of the project,
and move ahead a year earlier. At appraisal, broad cost estimates for public latrines and garbage drop off
points were based on very basic and outmoded standards for generic structures, typical in rural China, and
the cost of above ground structures to be financed by users, requiring additional funding from local
government to cover the gap. However, once detailed designs were completed, it was found that the
actual requirements varied greatly from those at appraisal, consistent with the actual situation on the
ground. An example of this was the need for increased privacy at public latrines, as well as the provision
of larger public facilities, consistent with current government standards. Also, a lower EIRR at ICR was
mostly due to the lower actual consumption of water than estimated at project appraisal (details refer to
section 3.3). Quality at Entry had a number of shortcomings.

2.2 Implementation
2.2.1 In the first year of the project, implementation fell significantly behind schedule, initially because
of the need to build capacity at PPMO and CPMO levels. But then, on May 12, 2008, six months after
effectiveness, both Sichuan and Shaanxi Provinces were severely impacted by the major Wenchuan
Earthquake (8.0 on the Richter scale) that killed at least 69,195 people and left some 4.8 million
homeless, with some estimates as high as 11 million. The earthquake event impacted implementation
progress in two key ways: (a) the emergency recovery and rebuilding response by the provincial
governments completely diverted the attention of all government agencies away from the project; and (b)


                                                     7
the emergency response absorbed much of the provinces’ financial resources, greatly limiting counterpart
funding availability for the first AWP. After two years of sluggish implementation progress (IP), the
Bank downgraded the IP rating to moderately satisfactory, until sufficient progress was made by
February 2010 to upgrade it again to satisfactory.

2.2.2            However, implementation soon came under significant financial pressure for several
reasons. First, as a consequence of the Wenchuan earthquake, demand for construction materials and
labor greatly increased, and the prices of these items rose significantly thus increasing project costs,
particularly civil works. Second, the value of the Chinese RMB rose substantially compared to the US
Dollar and the British Pound Sterling (GBP), thus increasing the cost of project activities in RMB terms.
Thirdly, at appraisal, broad cost estimates for public latrines and garbage drop-off points were based on
very basic, out-of-date standards for generic structures typical in rural China. However, once detailed
designs were done, actual requirements, incorporating revised standards for size and privacy, varied
greatly and costs increased considerably. Financial pressure continued to mount in 2009 and 2010 when
DfID eventually closed its China program. However, at that time, DfID was not able to give a definitive
answer and this indecision caused a host of problems, particularly the inability of the provinces to
formulate AWPs. The slow start of implementation, was mostly caused by the Wenchuan earthquake,
and resulted in lagging disbursements of the DfID Grant, which later completely withdraw from the
project, resulting in the cancellation of GBP 3.79 million (about 28 %) of the original grant amount of
GBP 13.54 million.

2.2.3 In anticipation of the withdrawal of DfID, the Bank, at the MTR in June/July 2010, advised the
provinces to submit a restructuring plan that reduced the project’s scale and scope consistent with the
likely reality of reduced available funding. However, because DfID did not make a final decision until
December 2010, the provinces had no firm financing figures upon which to base their restructuring, nor
did they attempt to do contingency planning based on various financing scenarios. Much to the
frustration of many project stakeholders, including the Bank, an agreed restructuring plan was not
formally submitted to the Bank by MoF until March, 2012. In the period between the withdrawal of DfID
and the actual restructuring, contracts could not be awarded, and implementation slowed to a virtual
standstill in 2011. Accordingly, both the DO the IP ratings were downgraded to unsatisfactory from
December 2011 through June 2012.

2.2.4 Restructuring of the Project (Level 2). This first restructuring involved a reduction in scope
and outcomes of the project to fit the reduced funding availability. Specifically, the restructuring: (a)
reduced project activities consistent with the reduced funds available; (b) revised project costs consistent
with significantly greater than forecast inflation and currency variations; (c) reallocated Loan proceeds
among components and increased disbursement percentages; (d) updated the results framework to reflect
the reduced scale and scope of the project (per section 1.3). Unfortunately the restructuring was approved
with the Loan already 77% disbursed and with elapsed time at 90%, which left little time to complete the
scaled down project, and led to the need for the second restructuring to extend the Loan closing date, by
six months.

2.2.5 Three-in-One Approach Reduced. Unfortunately, the reduction in financing fundamentally
limited the impact of the three-in-one approach. As mentioned in Section 1.6, Shaanxi elected to
safeguard its objective of increasing access to safe water supply, but did so at the expense of the
environmental sanitation works (see reduced targets in Annex 2). Sichuan reduced outputs for both the
water and sanitation components. Neither province implemented the hygiene promotion activities to the
extent desired. Due to the reduction of effort on the three-in-one approach and the fact that the
restructuring was carried out so late, the PDO could not be fully achieved and remained at MU through
closing.



                                                     8
2.2.6 Project management performance: Before the restructuring was approved in May 2012 there
were a number of shortcomings with project management, particularly with respect to M&E, procurement
management and the provision of counterpart funding, as detailed in the ISRs. After the MTR, Shaanxi
province was very quick to develop its restructuring plan. However, Sichuan province was very slow in
developing a viable restructuring plan which resulted in the 22 month delay. In addition: (a) Sichuan
exhibited poor M&E performance, particularly for components two and three; (b) both provinces were
late submitting their AWPs for 2010 and 2011 and other required periodic project reports; (c) there was
also repeated procurement irregularity issues uncovered in both provinces that remained unresolved at
project end; and (d) there was a lack of safeguard compliance with respect to water quality and latrine
testing.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization3

2.3.1 Design. The PDO had five key aspects relating to the provision of the three integrated services of
water supply, sanitation and HP, including- accessibility, safety (of water supplied), sustainability and
equity. The fifth aspect of the PDO was as objective of replicating the project approach in other
provinces. To measure the achievement of the PDO, seven indicators (PDOIs) were established, but five
related to accessibility, one for sustainability and one for replicability. The intermediate indicators (IIs)
covering all the five key aspects of the PDO. However, the M&E design had too many indicators (7
PDOIs and 23 IIs) as set out in PAD Annex 3. The design included many indicators that required new
collection methods and effort, and proved to be problematic. A more efficient and simpler approach to
the design would have been to build the M&E system around and enhance and efficiency of the existing
large amount of data already collected at county and provincial levels. The result was that for many
indictors no data was collected and so some were dropped at the first restructuring. Particularly affected
was the HP component where the designed indicators were replaced with only two to measure behavioral
change relating to HWWS and safe disposal of infant faeces.

2.3.2 Implementation. M&E training and capacity building was provided in the early stages of the
project. However, due to the delays in the project, only the MIS software package was completed. This
included a procurement package/contract management function that tracked each contract along the entire
implementation process, including disbursements. The MIS software was to be enhanced to include a
module that allowed the tracking of the handover and testing of each completed water supply scheme, but
no data was provided to support the important sustainability aspects of the PDO. The collection of output
data was done manually at the local level and uploaded and consolidated at provincial level using excels
spreadsheets. This proved adequate to measure outputs under components 1 and 2, given the huge number
and geographic spread of activities that had to be tracked, but fell well short of the fully integrated
MIS/MES computer-based system that was envisaged at appraisal. While the excel based system worked
well for output data, the quality, accuracy and availability of outcome data varied considerably between
provinces. Shaanxi was able to produce some meaningful output data while Sichuan had a number of key
data gaps. Both provinces dropped or changed significantly key outcome indicators for components 2
and 3 and abandoned all the indicators to measure the “Replicable approach adopted to service delivery”
at the first restructuring.

2.3.3 Utilization. Both the government and the project management levels utilized the monitoring
information to make management decisions affecting the project. Output data was used by both provinces

 The PAD Annex 3 and the datasheet at the front of this ICR lists the indicators differently. The datasheet includes
all the original and added indictors and lists them numerically. The datasheet format is used throughout this
document.

to assist with the formulation of AWPs to in an effort to overcome delays in the early part of the project
and adjust implementation plans to try and keep the project on schedule.               Existing data on
implementation progress was used in formulating the respective restructuring plans after the MTR to fit
the limited time and financing available to complete the project. The monitoring information and results
were summarized and formed the basis of semi-annual reports which were then submitted to the Bank, the
respective government leaders, departments and offices and the provincial and county PMOs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1   Environmental Safeguards. As established through supervision missions and regular progress
reports on EMP implementation, the EMPs in both provinces were generally well implemented. Both
PPMOs had dedicated staff for environmental management, and the appropriate environmental mitigation
and management measures were incorporated and carried out during project implementation. In addition,
each province engaged consultants to independently monitor and supervise EMP implementation.
However, implementation was severely disrupted in Sichuan and to a lesser extent in Shaanxi, firstly by
the Wenchuan Earthquake and then by delays in restructuring the project. In order to accelerate
implementation, the requirements for the preparation of the environmental framework, as part of the
approval process for the new schemes added after appraisal (80%), were not fully followed, especially in
Sichuan. Eventually, the Bank agreed to a more efficient approach to address environmental issues using
Environmental Guidelines and/or Codes of Good Practice that identified the mitigation measures in site
selection, design and implementation for the different types of activities. The rationale for agreeing to
this change was threefold: (i) the EMPs were implemented and monitored well after the disruptions; (ii)
the well-established requirements of the EMPs were progressively included and applied to the new
schemes appropriately; and (iii) the project activities in subsequent AWPs were similar in nature,
geographical spread and scale as those in the first tranche project activities. In addition to the water
supply and sanitation activities, the EIA/EMPs provided guidance to communities on the siting,
construction and use of garbage drop-off points of garbage, which was a small and unique activity under
the project.

2.4.2 Testing of drinking water quality and latrines. The requirements for environmental monitoring
also included the testing of drinking water quality in both provinces and sanitation testing of new latrines
in Sichuan. This testing was entrusted to existing specialists from the County Water Resource Bureau
(CWRB) and County level offices of the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) Bureau. These Bureaus
had the responsibility, competency and capacity to undertake the testing specified. However, many
CWRBs did not regularly carry out tests to assess water quality in accordance with Chinese national
standards (GB/T5749-2006) for the project-built schemes, claiming that there was insufficient counterpart
budget cover in the project. Clearly, this lack of funding hindered the comprehensive testing and periodic
monitoring of drinking water quality, as specified as part of the Bank’s safeguard requirement. The
sample testing of new latrines was also required to be carried out by the CDC as a project specific
requirement. The level of testing specified was not a compulsory requirement domestically. Because no
counterpart funds were set aside by the borrower, only a limited amount of latrine testing was carried out.
Overall, the project did comply with OP 4.01, but because of the testing shortfalls detailed above,
implementation of EA safeguards is rated moderately satisfactory.

2.4.3 Social Safeguards - Resettlement. Both Sichuan and Shanxi provinces generally implemented
the RAPs well and the RPF was followed according to the findings shown in the Bank supervision
mission aide memoire, project internal progress and external monitoring and evaluation reports regarding
resettlement and social aspects of the project. The PPMOs designated focal point staff to take charge of
social development and safeguards management. A range of mitigation measures for social risks and
adverse impacts were deployed, including the active promotion of wide participation, as well as proper



                                                    10
compensation and process for land acquisition. The project’s gender dimension ensured that women
participated in and benefiting from the project.

2.4.4 An experienced social development team from Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences was hired in
2008 as the external independent monitoring agent of social safeguards implementation in both project
provinces. The first monitoring and evaluation report on resettlement and land acquisition was submitted
in 2009. The M & E consulting team carried out regular reviews and monitoring of the implementation of
the RAPs through documents review, site visits, and interviews with project owners, resettlement
implementing agencies, and project affected people (PAPs), among others. The items monitored included
the implementing progress and quality of resettlement, implementation of policies for resettlement and
restoration, compensation policies, grievance redress, public participation, and consultation. The
consulting team produced nine reports altogether for the two project provinces during the project
implementation period detailing the results of site surveys reviews and investigations, including a
baseline survey and a completion M&E report, the external monitoring reports were prepared based on
the findings of the survey and investigation and submitted to the PPMOs and the World Bank for
information and review.

2.4.5     Land acquisition and compensation. During implementation, the acquisition of land was
minimized to avoid house demolition. The total population affected by permanent land acquisition was
2422 people (1237 in Sichuan and 1185 in Shaanxi), in a total 612 households. To support the project
investment, a total of only 12.61 hectare (ha) or 189.174 mu of land was permanently acquired. A further
132.6 ha (1980.83 mu) of land was temporarily acquired during construction. The total cost on land
acquisition was about US$ 0.354 million (RMB2.2 million) for Shaanxi and US$0.161 million (RMB1
million) for Sichuan. The changes to the scale and scope of project as part of the first restructuring
resulted in a substantial decrease in the amount of acquired land and in the number of affected people
compared with original plan and appraisal estimation as shown in the RAPs. The land acquisition and
compensation were dealt with generally in accordance with the Bank approved RAPs and RPFs.
Assessment reports showed that implementation was completed successfully and that the standards of
living of the Project Affected People (PAPs) improved. Therefore, the implementation of this safeguard
is rated satisfactory.

2.4.6 Safety of Dams. Safety of Dams (OP 4.37) was triggered because three dams in Shaanxi
Province and eight in Sichuan Province were identified as the source of raw water supply to the first
tranche of water supply schemes.      The PPMOs recruited third party independent dam safety experts
satisfactory to the Bank. They provided dam safety assessments, and reviewed reports and remedial plans
in accordance with OP4.37 and domestic regulations, methods and processes (State Council 1999 and
MWR 1995). These reports were reviewed, evaluated and cleared by the Bank as part of its due diligence
at appraisal. The same expert review processes put in place at appraisal were used to review the
additional dams supplying raw water to the other 80% of water supply schemes added during project
implementation. At project completion, and as a result of the project restructuring, the number of dams
declined to seven in Sichuan; no additional dams were identified in Shaanxi. Immediately after the
Wenchuan earthquake, the PWRBs in both Sichuan and Shaanxi carried out special inspections of all
project-related and other dams to confirm their safety. Therefore, compliance with the dam safety policy
was satisfactory.

2.4.7   Financial Management (FM). The formal FM assessment was conducted in 2006 in line with
Bank's requirements of OP/BP10.02. No significant changes were made during project implementation.

                                                         11
However, due to the weak capacity (lack of knowledge/experience and high staff turnover) of PMOs in
managing the complex project, the project FM is rated moderately satisfactory. The project FMS
provided moderate assurance that Bank Loan and DFID Grant proceeds were used for the intended
purpose. The PPMOs were able to generate basic financial records and reports to reflect project
implementation status, and generally there was compliance with legal covenants relating to annual audit
reports and interim financial reports. Through training and capacity building, key project FM staff
progressively accumulated the required skills, knowledge and experience that resulted in enhanced
financial management capacity. However, Shaanxi PPMO performed better in some areas. For instance,
the financial statements reflected adequate information of the source and use of project funds, and the
MIS was used as intended for the generation of disbursement applications.

2.4.8 Procurement Management. Procurement was generally carried out in accordance with the
Bank’s procurement procedures and the agreed procurement plans. However, during post reviews carried
out over the period 2010 to 2013, indications of possible collusive practice were identified three times
with the procurement of small NCB contracts for village water supply managed by CPMOs in both
provinces. These collusion indicators were pervasive, and the Bank, after each post procurement review,
(PPR) presented its findings and recommendations to the PPMOs and CPMOs with the expectation that
the necessary corrective actions would be taken, including identifying red flags of collusion during bid
evaluation; and investigating and reporting these cases to the relevant authorities for possible sanctioning.
However the PPMOs, the CPMOs and the Procurement Agent failed repeatedly to take timely actions to
address these issues. For this reason, the Bank established, as a condition of approval of extending the
closing date in September 2012, a requirement that the PPMOs develop and adopt specific provincial
level Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plans (GAAPs). For a number of contracts where the
indicators of collusion were serious, the provinces agreed that they would not seek reimbursement from
the Bank for these expenditures. Unfortunately, the final PPR conducted in 2013, gave no indication that
the agreed GAAPs were being fully implemented in either province. The findings of each PPR were
referred to the Regional Procurement Manager and, on July 28, 2010 to the office of the Integrity Vice-
Presidency (INT) 5of the Bank, for action in accordance with Bank policy. As of Loan closing, INT’s
investigation remained open and it had not communicated any findings or recommendations. Compliance
with Bank procurement policy is rated unsatisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Water supply scheme management options were identified according to the type of scheme built
and included: (i) multi-villages piped water supply schemes; (ii) smaller/single village piped water supply
schemes (both gravity and pumped); (iii) low-cost water supply options to serve communities in the more
remote and sparsely populated areas, and single household supply. In accordance with domestic
procedures, each scheme was subjected to final acceptance and testing (FAT) before being handed over to
the entity responsible for management, operations and maintenance (MOM). In both provinces, all the
single village and clustered HH piped water supply schemes were handed over for operation to village
WASH committees. WASH committees then set and began collection of water charges consistent with
annual MOM costs of the particular water supply scheme under their control. Village level operators
were required to undertake training in day to day operational requirements. Provision for back-up support
for short term MOM tasks beyond the capability of the WASH committees is provided by established

town water supply stations, which belong to the county water supply stations. However, because the
WASH committee management arrangement is new, there are no clear financial arrangements in place to
cover major repairs, rehabilitation and replacement of assets like pump sets and electrical switch gear
installations. This could affect the longer term viability of smaller cluster and village schemes. Most
multiple-village schemes have been handed over for management by town or county water supply stations.
A few schemes have been handover for management by existing utility style companies.

2.5.2 The MOM responsibility of the various types of sanitation systems investment completed has
been assigned as follows. Single HH systems (biogas, three compartments, double urn) remain the
responsibility of each HH. All school sanitation investment, latrines, and soak-away systems, including
garbage drop-off points have been handled over to schools administration and village level sanitation
investment in public latrines and garbage drop-off points, have been have been handed over to the village
committees or in bigger villages/townships, the existing Township bureaus responsible. There was a
problem with the issuing of clear, simple O&M instructions for the more technically advanced biogas
latrines to households and there was a problem with the initial and on-going testing of this type of latrine.
Biogas latrines are common a type of household latrine provided widely in rural China and some follow-
up training the care and use these latrines has occurred through local WASH committees. However, there
is no evidence to suggest that the testing of the latrines has improved.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 Rating: Substantial. The PDO was highly relevant at appraisal and remained relevant through to
project completion. The PDO was directly linked to the overarching theme of the Bank’s CPS for 2006-
2010 of “Reducing Poverty, Inequality and Social Exclusion”. The PDO was also linked to the DfID
Country Assistance Plan (CAP) which focused on assisting China in the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. To support a key part of the PDO -- to demonstrate the new three-in-one approach,
strengthen the national policy framework and ultimately replicate the proven approaches tested under the
project in other provinces -- the higher level KASH TA program, aimed directly at supporting the
RWSSH sector at national policy level was implemented through UNICEF. The KASH was closely
linked to the project. UNICEF was a project partner and at the beginning of the KASH program, its
priorities in China were directed towards: (i) work on early childhood care and development, including
safe drinking water, (ii) a healthy environment; and (iii) good hygiene practices. These are still the same
priorities in 2013.

3.1.2 In fact, at completion, this project also supported two themes in the current CPS for FY2013-
20166: (i) supporting greener growth; and (ii) promoting more inclusive development. Also as a result of
the strong linkages between the project and the highly successful outcome of KASH (Annex 7), national
policy was strongly influenced to incorporate a more integrated and participatory approach for the
provision RWSSHP services. Given the above, the rating for relevance of objectives, design and
implementation is substantial.

3.2.1 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The PDO encompassed an integrated approach (three-in-
one) for the provision of water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion services, in order to maximize
the health benefits. However, as noted above, in May 2012 this project underwent a substantial Level 2
restructuring, which reduced the project’s outputs in line with available financing and resulted in the
breakdown of the integrated approach from that point forward. Since the restructuring came quite late into
implementation, the project’s outcome is weighed more heavily against the achievements before the
restructuring. Based on this assessment, the project achievement of the PDO was rated moderately
unsatisfactory. More details are provided in Annex 2 and the Data Sheet.

3.2.2     Water supply investments were intended to improve access to safe drinking water through
different typologies: multi-village and single village piped water supply schemes and water supply to
clustered households and single households. Rainwater collection systems and wells with hand or electric
pumps were also financed. In addition, the project was to provide all schools within the project areas of
Shaanxi and selected schools within the project areas of Sichuan with safe water supply. The PDO
indicators 1 and 3 tracked people and schools access respectively. Shaanxi met the original PAD target
for population with access to drinking water with 326, 716 people gaining access (100% achievement),
while Sichuan supplied water to only 262,737, which was 59% of the original target of 444,393, but
102% of the restructured target of 258,000. For schools, Shaanxi supplied only 32 schools (11%) of the
original target of 297 and only 78% of the restructured target of 41. Sichuan supplied 33 schools, which
was 59% of the restructured target of 51, but only 22% of the original target of 151 (see Annex 2 for more
details).

3.2.3 A safe supply of drinking water was to be measured by intermediate indicator 5 - percentage of
Water Quality Certification of water supply scheme done on time, as measured by the appropriate
provincial/national standard water quality tests. There was full achievement of this requirement because
at the initial stage of commissioning of schemes water testing is a mandatory requirement of the final
assessment and testing (FAT) before handover. However, there were some problems identified with on-
going water testing of schemes once handed over During the ICR mission (June 3013) based on a very
small sample of 2 villages in each province, the continuing persistent problems with water testing were
confirmed. All the villages visited as part of the ICR mission (May/June 2013) were small HH cluster
water supply schemes with no functioning and effective water treatment. In each case, the WASH
committee had issued instructions to all HHs that water must be boiled before drinking to ensure its safety.
Therefore, the conclusion, based on the facts is that water testing as part of the FAT process was at best
ad-hoc given the water treatment equipment short comings identified; ineffective operator training and
knowledge and no evidence of a systemic and regular on-going raw and treated water regime is that the
performance of schemes to provide a safe drinking water supply is in doubt.

Increase in the number of people and schools with access to improved sanitation
(Partially achieved)

3.2.4 Access to improved sanitation services was provided to a total of 224,620 people. However, this
was only 34% of the original PAD target, but 112% of the restructured target. Sichuan’s achievement of
43% of the PAD target (145,400 people) was better than Shaanxi’s at only 24% (79,220) of the original
target. Both provinces did however meet or exceed their respective restructured targets. At completion,
the major project outputs were:(i) 43,857 HH and 65 school latrines; (ii) 66 school hand washing
facilities; (iii) 211 village public latrines; (iv) 833 village and 73 school solid waste collection points.
At the first restructuring, the scale of this component was significantly curtailed because of the reduced



                                                    14
funding available. As a result, most outputs were significantly less that the PAD targets. Household
latrine outputs were only average only 27% of the original targets; schools latrines and hand washing
facilities built were a very disappointing 15% of the PAD targets. This reduction in school latrines can
also be attributed to the impact of national education policy that required that some smaller village level
schools included in the project at appraisal were closed and consolidated with larger schools.

3.2.5 On a more positive note, the 193 public latrines built in Shaanxi exceeded by a large margin the
original target of 126 and also bettered the increased restructured target of 178. More public latrines
were built because there was a demand for them by some village communities and households who
preferred public latrines as an alternative to more expensive individual HH options (Annex 2 Table 2).

Increase in percentage of people in participating communities and students in schools who
have adopt safe hygiene and sanitary behaviors
(Not achieved)

3.2.6 The objective was to provide a broad range of good hygiene and sanitary practices and bring
about behavioral change in order to prevent disease. The final independent hygiene surveys carried out in
both provinces were able to measure the net impact of the project because control groups, consisting of
communities and HHs were established early in the project. (Both provinces did a base line survey). The
results unfortunately showed that the actual project impact for both the HWWS activities (communities
and schools) was very low, even though the targets were established in May 2012. Shaanxi had the worst
results with a net impact of 4.4% for communities and zero for schools. The results in Sichuan were only
marginally better at 7.8% and 14% respectively. The only positive outcome was the full achievement of
the safe disposal of infant faeces with 84% in Shaanxi against a target of 70% and 93% in Sichuan against
a target of 80%.

Percentage of implemented water supply schemes operating in an equitable and sustainable way.
(Not achieved)

3.2.7 The project measured the extent that the poor, the vulnerable and women participated in and
benefited from the provision of water supply services. This aspect was fully achieved through the direct
participation of village communities individual and collectively through the formation and fostering of the
WASH committees. Adherence to equitable membership make-up allowed the voice of the poor,
vulnerable and women to be heard not only during project implementation, but beyond the project
because the WASH committees are well functioning and have real responsibilities and ownership of the
village water supply schemes. The project also took other measures to enable poor and vulnerable
households to participate and benefit, such as waiving the payment for connection fees connecting to
house to the water main in the street. Payments waived for poor HHs were typically about RMB 200/HH
(US$32).

3.2.8 The mandated WASH committee membership make up including women members, is ensuring
equity of representation and influence. Water tariffs are set at levels that were affordable and sufficient to
meet recurrent funding requirements.

3.2.9 Several key specific indicators were included to measure the sustainability of water supply
schemes by capturing data on the percentage of water supply schemes: (i) meeting the tariff covenant
after the first year of operations; (ii) meeting full design supply capacity 2 years after construction
completion; and (iii) operating sustainably after one year. (Sustainability as defined in the results
framework (PAD page 27 footnote 3).




                                                     15
3.2.10 The September, 2012 technical mission also looked in-depth at sustainability and found a number
of critical issues that affected sustainability of both surface and groundwater schemes as follows: (i) no
monitoring data to support the assessment of original design; (ii) no MOM manuals and/or equipment
trouble shooting guidelines; (iii) the technical standards of surface water supplied schemes were
generally adequate, there were a number of problems identified that may affect schemes reaching their
full design capacity. Because a lot of schemes were completed late in the project, assessment of the
extent of operation 2 years after construction could not be made. Also, the original design capacity was
based on the number of registered people in the villages. With urbanization a lot of people live and work
for long periods away from the village and this will ultimately have an effect on scheme capacity.

Evidence of the adoption and sustainability of the integrated three in one approach and replications
in domestic programs.
(Partially achieved)

3.2.11 The objective was to measure the number of other government agencies/programs in the two
project provinces adopting the project approach. No specific data was collected. However, both
provinces implemented the project up to the MTR (June 2010) more or less as designed, including a very
strong commitment to the integration of services and particularly the participation aspects at community
level. At the restructuring in May 2012, the changes to the scale and scope resulted in a balanced project
at appraisal become unbalance and the integration objectives were abandoned for the rest of the project.
However, the application of the three-in-one model beyond the project was an important and key issue
that was discussed, probed and observed at provincial and county government/bureaucracy levels as part
of the ICR mission.       Clearly, what was observed and confirmed was that the project has been
instrumental in changing the way RWSSHP services are delivered. The other key observation was the
strength and commitment to the participation of communities in the selection and management of services
and the equitable inclusion of the poor and vulnerable and the increased role for women in the ongoing
provision of services.

3.2.12 A demonstration project with a very important key part of the PDO focused on the development
of an effective process for the application of the new three-in-one approach for the provision of RWSSHP
services that could be replicated in other provinces by influencing national policy development and
programs. The strategic partnership established between the Bank, DfID, UNICEF, Shaanxi and Sichuan
Provinces, and Chinese Government was pivotal for replication. The strong linkages between the KASH
Program and the project did influence the highly successful outcome of the Program through 2010, when
the KASH program ended. The reduction in scale of the three-in-one approach did not occur until the
restructuring in May 2012. Shaanxi and Sichuan provincial governments have adopted the principles of
the three-in-one approach in their sectoral plans accompanying their 12th FYP. They have modified the
relative importance of the three components sectors to match their circumstances of their respective
provinces but preserved the coordination role of PDRCs, what was established as part of the project.

3.2.13 The objective of the KASH was to increase GoC’s awareness, capacity and commitment to
implement sanitation and hygiene promotion programs, in particular to scaling-up the
coordinated/integrated WASH approach in rural areas in poor western provinces. The objective was
achieved through the successful implementation of a variety of activities in four output areas as planned
including: (i) Evidence-based development on WASH; (ii) Building strategic partnerships; (iii) National
Policies and Guidelines, and (iv) Advocacy for investment in rural sanitation.

3.2.14 The KASH Program assisted the GoC to design and implement two new national programs: (i)
the “Health Sector Reform Program (HSRP, 2009-2011)”, which included rural sanitation and water
supply improvement in rural communities and in local health facilities; and (ii) the redesign of the



                                                   16
national sanitation improvement program entitled the “National Urban-Rural Integrated Sanitation
Improvement Action Plan (NURISIAP)” which was launched in 2010.

3.2.15 While there is no specific quantitative data on the number of other provinces adopting the project
approach, there is clear evidence that the project, through its strong links to KASH, did influence national
policy and national planning processes and is already influencing provincial policy. An example of this
was seen in the project provinces, where the PRDCs are using the project experience and changes to local
policy and “modified” approaches as the basis for preparation of integrated RWSSHP sector master plans,
as part of the overall planning for provincial 13th FYPs. These sector master plans are using the
principles of the “modified” three-in-one approach and particularly the participatory approaches
developed under the project.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Economic analysis. A cost benefit analysis was conducted following the assumptions adopted at
project appraisal. The combined EIRR across the two provinces calculated at project appraisal was
27.7%. At ICR following the same models, the combined EIRR of the project was 16.7%. The major
reason for this lower EIRR was that the actual consumption of water after the completion of the schemes
is lower than estimated at project appraisal. In other words, the demand of water was overestimated at
project appraisal and as a consequence, the realized capacity of the schemes analyzed is only 60% of
design capacity made at project appraisal. (See a detailed analysis in annex 3.) In addition, the economic
benefits used to calculate EIRR does not include the public health benefits, which are difficult to quantify,
such as reducing diarrhea, skin disease, typhoid, eye disease, etc. Another widely accepted benefit is the
improved sanitation which is more important in epidemiological terms. If these benefits could be
quantified, the EIRR for all schemes would be greater. Whilst the EIRR at ICR (16.7%) is less than that
at appraisal (27.7%), the ICR figure is well above the discount rate of 10%. Therefore, the rating for
efficiency is deemed to be satisfactory.

3.3.2 Financial analysis. The key objective of the project was to provide an affordable, but
sustainable water supply. To achieve this objective, tariffs needed to be set at a level sufficient to at least
cover the operation and maintenance cost of providing water supply services. The appraisal assessment
was that tariffs needed to be set between RMB1.5 and RMB4/m3 in Sichuan (avg. RMB/2.9/m3) to
achieve financial sustainability, and RMB1.5 and RMB6.45/m3 in Shaanxi (avg. of RMB2.7/m3).

3.3.3 After the operation of the schemes, the tariffs in Sichuan ranged from RMB1.80 to 3.90 /m3 and
in Shaanxi RMB2.50 to RMB4.00/ m3. These tariffs generally fell in the ranges of tariffs projected at
project appraisal. However, these tariff levels did not necessarily ensure all schemes covered their O&M
costs by tariffs. Some of the schemes needed other revenues, such as connection fees and sales of
materials to cover O&M costs. Detailed analysis is at Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

(Combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.1   The overall rating for the project is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory, based on the following
six considerations: (i) the project PDO was highly relevant at appraisal and throughout the project; (ii) a
large amount of time (22 months) was lost between the MTR (June 2010) and the restructuring plan was
approved (May 2012) just 6 months before the original closing date; (iii) most output targets established



                                                      17
at appraisal were not met, with the exception being that of water supply services in Shaanxi; (iv) the
strategic partnership between the Bank, DfID, UNICEF and the provincial and national governments and
the strong linkage to the project did influence the highly successful outcome of the KASH TA program;
(v) despite the turmoil and problems with the project itself, there is clear evidence that the integrated and
participative three-in-one approach demonstrated under the project has been adopted by the participating
provinces for future domestically funded RWSSHP projects; and (iv) the project efficiency was
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Promotion of public participation and gender equality. The project did specifically focus on
promoting participation of vulnerable and poor individuals and groups and gender equality. Poor
people’s lives were improved by given them priority for receiving water supply and sanitation services
and targeted subsidies. To strongly support the gender aspects, the NGO, China Women’s Federation,
was engaged to train and empower women and ensure that women and women’s issues such as access to
training and participation were front and center during project implementation. Women’s representation
was also enhanced at all levels from PLGs to individual WASH committees at villages. The
representation of vulnerable people and from women on all WASH committees increased to a minimum
requirement of 20%. The project had a professional gender advisor to participate in regular project
missions and ensure gender elements incorporated in the project design and implementation. To guide
project implementation agencies at all levels, a “Gender elements” checklist was provided and used as the
basis for to monitoring of actual achievement. Further, the project provided awareness-raising training on
daily-life health care and hygiene for households in the project communities. In total this training
amounted to 189,490 person days, (104,600 in Shaanxi and 84,890 in Sichuan) with women being a
major portion of the trainees.

3.5.2 Moreover, there were a total 17,108 HHs (75,116 poor people) benefited from the project. The
project also took other measures to enable poor and vulnerable households to participate in and benefit
from the project, such as waiving the payment which was originally planned to be borne by each project
households in connecting to water supply facilities and subsidies for HH latrines. One of such payments
waived for poor households was about RMB200/household for connecting water supply from their houses
to project main pipe networks.

3.5.3 Institutional Change/Strengthening. Institutional strengthening was provided primarily at five
levels: (i) Provincial government agencies; (ii) the PPMOs; (iii) the CPMOs; (iv) village level WASH
Committees; and (v) the provincial and county levels entities providing technical support, such as design
institutes, supervision companies/consultants, and contractors. One of the fundamental objectives of
institutional strengthening under the project was to build an institutional framework based on the
cooperation and coordination of the many government agencies involved in the RWSSHP sector. This
was achieved under the project, and from discussions and observations made during the ICR mission, the
PDRCs are committed to continue this new era of cooperation beyond the project. As both provinces
prepare their provincial level 13th FYPs, the PDRCs are taking the lead to effectively coordinate the
inputs from the various departments to ensure the integrated and coordinated approached to RWSSHP
investment that was developed under the project.        In addition, the knowledge and best practices
surrounding the institutional framework developed under the WPRWSSHP have been disseminated to the
GoC and other provinces as part of the KASH TA program.

3.5.4 Strengthened Institutional Capacity and Development. (Partially achieved). The project
management skills and capacities of the PPMOs, CPMOs, township staff and technical skills of
implementing line agencies were improved through training activities involving a total of 2,130 staff.
Community-based training total of 189,490 people was also completed and comprised 99% of the training


                                                     18
provided under the project.     The strong commitment to this component was evident when it remained
mostly intact through the restructuring. The only activities trimmed were overseas and domestic study
tours. However, this component was only partially achieved. The institutional strengthening included
operational and technical support to WASH committees at village level, particularly for the new cluster
household water supply schemes under the management of WASH committees. There was a strong
commitment by both provincial governments to build on the success of WASH committees and enhance
participation through the establishment of “water supply management and service institutions” based on
the principles governing the establishment of WASH committees established under the project.

3.5.5 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts. Field inspections of beneficiary villages in both
provinces were carried out during the ICR mission (May 2013). These visits showed that while the
provision of safe drinking water to households was the primary goal, the piped water supply service was a
catalyst for other life style improvements such as extensions to houses to include a new modern bathroom
with shower and basin facilities, solar hot water services, washing machines, vegetable gardens and
landscaping. It was also observed that there was a preference to locate the newly provided latrine within
an extension to the house or very near to the house, thus improving security and privacy, particularly for
women.

3.5.6 In a few instances where HHs chose the bio-gas latrine option, it was observed that where the HH
had low occupancy (generally only the housewife because other family members were working as
migrant workers remote from the village), and had no pigs or other farm animals to generate enough
waste to generate biogas, the latrine was not being used. Latrines, if used, had to eventually be cleaned
out, a task beyond the sole occupant. On the positive side, it was observed that bio-gas provided many
benefits to the housewife, such as convenience of operation and considerable time-savings and/or cost in
gathering fire wood. The other positive aspect was that bio-gas was used instead of wood for cooking
which contributed in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

(Optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial - based on the predominance of substantive ratings for the more important risks
identified.

4.1     Risk to the proper management of water supply and sanitation services. This risk is
considered negligible because the basic rural services of water supply and sanitation are in high demand,
particularly in poor and disadvantaged rural villages where these services have been provided for the first
time and village communities have a high level of ownership. Cluster HH water supply schemes and
garbage drop-off points have been handed over to the WASH committees. There was effective
community participation in the design of an appropriate level of water supply service to each community
and a willingness to pay the annual costs of the level of service determined. For the multi and single
village water supply schemes, arrangements for the day to day MOM of all water schemes have been
made and schemes handed over to existing water management entities at county or township level.

4.2     Risk to the sustainability of hygiene promotion and behavioral changes. There is a
substantial risk of students not retaining proper hand-washing with soap in schools because: (i) The long



                                                    19
delay before and then lack of funds for component 3 after the first restructuring meant that the initial
behavioral change campaign in schools was not followed-up to reinforce the HP messages; and (ii)
schools have generally not provided and maintained soap supplies.

4.3      Risk of service disruption in the longer term for smaller water supply schemes and
household latrines. For the smaller cluster HH water supply schemes, there is a substantial risk that
if/when there are major equipment breakdowns (e.g. pumps and electrics) the schemes will fall into
disrepair for long periods of time. WASH committees have a responsibility to recover the recurrent
MOM costs only and there is no written agreement with governments (county or provincial) as to who
will be responsible for financing major repairs and replacements over time. There is also a risk that the
more technically advanced biogas latrines will not be properly maintained by HHs because of the lack of
clear instructions about need for desilting and cleaning of solids from this type of latrine.

4.4      Risk of repeat Natural Disasters. Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces are both in very seismically
active areas of China. In addition to the Wenchuan Earthquake, there have been other smaller quakes
such as one in April 2013. Natural disasters such as flooding (seen in Sichuan in July 2013) related to
climate change and improper land management could also threaten to destroy or render dysfunctional the
water supply assets created under the project or could jeopardize the dams related to those water schemes.
Risk: Substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.1.1 The Bank preparation team was led by a lead operations officer with expert assistance from a
very senior rural water supply specialist and several other water/environment engineers. The task team
also included two social safeguards specialists, fiduciary experts and an M&E specialist and a
professional gender advisor to ensure the proper implementation of the gender elements of the project.
The core team, including the task team leader, was based in Beijing, which allowed for frequent
consultations with GoC and provincial officials and facilitated mission travel to the rural counties. Project
preparation began with the concept review in August 2005 and concluded 22 months later with Board
presentation in June 2007. Total Bank cost of preparation was US$478,200 (66.7 staff weeks).

5.1.1.2 The project concept and PDO were highly relevant and well aligned with national policy
priorities and the Bank’s CPS (Section 2.1). The preparation quality of the project, as set out in the PAD,
was of a high standard and involved the close cooperation with and drew on the expertise of DfID and
UNICEF, both of whom had long and successful experiences in the RWSSHP sector. With their input,
and that of GoC, the project design was based on a thorough analysis of sector issues. Applicable
safeguards policies were identified and the Bank carefully reviewed the EAs, EMPs, RP, dam safety
reports, as well as the social (including willingness-to-pay) and hygiene behavioral assessments. Findings
of the latter were fed into project design and detailed engineering designs. Therefore, the final design was
appropriate and was very well focused on demonstrating a new, integrated solution to a significant
national and provincial challenge, involving the effective delivery of basic services to help China meet the
MDGs in the water and sanitation sectors. Although the restructuring reduced the scale and scope of the
project, the PDO and component design were sound and remained unchanged. A few shortcomings are
cited in Section 2.1 above. Notably the PDO was somewhat complex compared to current standards and
the number of indicators was rather high. A few risks were not included or were under-assessed. The
institutional arrangements should have included some central government coordination. Costs for the
sanitation works were based on generic structure costs (excluding the cost of above ground structures)
and were out of date, causing price variations. Insufficient contingency was allowed in the cost estimate
at appraisal, which in turn contribute to insufficient funding to support the project activities to the full


                                                     20
extent desired. Added to this was the impact of the reduction in DfID funding and depreciation of US
dollar and pound sterling. The risk of over-designed and relatively costly water supply schemes was not
properly addressed and resulted in lower EIRR at completion as compared to the EIRR at appraisal. For
these reasons, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating consideration takes into
account the comments received from Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces on the earlier draft ICR.

5.1.2   Quality of Supervision Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2.1 Throughout implementation, the Bank’s task team was pro-active, flexible, and decisive in
interpreting and applying Bank policies and the covenants in the Loan and Project Agreements, and in
providing ample resources to address project issues as they a rose, with a total of US$661,800 (134.6 staff
weeks) on supervision (see Annex 5 for details). Supervision was carried out through formal bi-annual
supervision missions, and included joint supervision missions with DfID and UNICEF, and was carried
out in a professional manner. The joint supervision ensured that the implementation of the project and the
KASH T.A. program were solidly linked. The Bank followed up formal supervision with day-to-day
contact with the client. The Bank maintained a focus on attaining the PDO despite the turmoil and delays
caused by the Wenchuan earthquake and the withdrawal of DfID. The task team identified the need to
restructure the project at the MTR (July 2010), but did not receive the formal application from MoF to
restructure the project until March 2012. The task team then processed the restructuring in a timely
manner.

5.1.2.2 Supervision of Safeguards and Fiduciary Aspects. The supervision of the social, environment and
dam safety safeguards was satisfactory. The supervision of FM was carried out frequency as part of
supervision missions and special visits. To address the capacity weaknesses, additional training was
provided, but the constant turnover of staff made this training less effective. Procurement supervision
was challenging at times because of the persistent collusion issues in both provinces. At least two PPRs
were done and the Bank insisted and gave guidance on the development and implementation of a GAAP
as a condition for the second extension. (See section 2.4 above). Despite the best efforts of the
procurement staff and the involvement if the RPM and INT, the issues could not be satisfactorily resolved.
Specialists in FM, procurement, environmental management, dam safety, and social sciences participated
consistently in supervision missions and in the day-to-day follow up and interaction with the client. A
good example of this ability to react quickly and with flexibility was the changes adopted by the Bank to
improve the efficiency of environmental assessment work for the small scale works.

5.1.2.3 Supervision Reporting and Follow-up Action. Supervision mission reporting (aide-memoires,
management letters, and Implementation Status Reports) was sufficiently detailed and clear, and the
ratings were realistic and candid. The task team engaged Bank senior management to try and resolve the
serious DfID commitment and funding issues. However, after the MTR, the task team could have been
more proactive in trying to get coordinated action between the provinces and GoC to more quickly
restructure the project. Also, the Bank team could have done more to follow up on M&E and covenant
compliance issues.

5.1.2.4 There were a total of seven Bank task team leaders between appraisal and completion, and this
had an effect on project progress and day to day communication with the Client to some extent. There
were continuity issues with the makeup of the core task team, with only one key member remaining on
the team from appraisal to completion. Owing to this factor and given the ratings noted in sections
5.1.2.3 above, the quality of supervision is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

5.1.3   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                                    21
5.1.3.1 Given the moderately unsatisfactory rating of Quality at Entry and the moderately satisfactory
rating of supervision, the overall rating for Bank Performance is moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
5.2.1 Governments Performance Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1.1 Governments in this case are the Shaanxi and Sichuan provincial governments. Each Province
established and maintained strong, high level PLGs at the political interface and PPMOs were formed
within the PDRCs to provide the necessary interagency coordination arrangements, consistent with the
PDO. The provincial governments maintained this strong commitment to the project up until the MTR.
Shaanxi province moved quickly and produced a restructuring plan that included the immediate increase
in counterpart funds to cover funding shortfalls, which it then submitted to MoF for approval. However,
because it was a multi provincial project, MoF had to wait until Sichuan submitted its restructuring plan,
which took some time. There was no central government agency assigned to coordinate the provinces.
The result was a 22 month delay in implementation and a restructuring with a much reduced scale and
scope, eventually approved by the Bank just five months before the original closing date. Given the
restructuring was done so late; there was very little chance of achieving a satisfactory outcome. The Bank
offered both provinces the alternative of additional IBRD financing to bridge the gap left by DfID, but
this was declined because of concerns that the poor counties included in the project could not service
additional debt.

5.2.2   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2.1 The implementing agencies who had responsibility to management project implementation in
each province were the PPMOs established under each PDRC. Throughout the project implementation,
the Shaanxi PPMO was more stable and performed better because it was an experienced, permanently
constituted unit as an integral part of in the PDRC Foreign Funding Development Department. This
department is responsible for overseeing many foreign-funded projects in the province. This fact
contributed to the decisive response by the Shaanxi government to restructure the project immediately
after the MTR.

5.2.2.2 In contrast, the Sichuan PPMO became dysfunctional during the long delay period, because it was
established as a project-specific entity made up of mostly staff seconded from line departments. When
project activity virtually stopped after the MTR, many key staff from the Sichuan PPMO, drifted back to
their line departments to resume their permanent jobs. However, once the first restructuring was
approved, both PPMOs quickly focused on achieving the revised targets in the very limited time left.
This renewed commitment by the PPMOs contributed to the Bank’s decision to extend the loan closing
date under the second restructuring.

5.2.2.3 Throughout project implementation, both provinces demonstrated strong commitment to
enhanced community participation and the need to build on the success of the enhanced community
participation through WASH committees. From discussions and interviews with higher level officials at
provincial level during the ICR mission, it was clear that the principles governing the formation and
fostering of WASH committees will be incorporated into the design of future domestically funded
RWSSHP projects.

5.2.2.4 Despite the scaled back scope of the main investments under components 1, 2, and 3, the
commitment to component 4, Institutional Strengthening and Development remained fairly strong. The
component remained mostly intact through the restructuring with the only activities trimmed being
overseas and domestic study tours, but there was a lot of training achieved, particularly at the community
level. The MIS developed was satisfactory for measuring the project outputs, but the PPMOs failed to


                                                   22
develop the integrated computer based M&E system. Outcome measurement was not done particularly
well and procurement management was unsatisfactory (section 2.4) because of the inability to deal with
the persistent collusion problems. In Sichuan, the project management and reporting arrangements broke
down between MTR and restructuring (22 months).

5.2.2.5 Compliance with Covenants. Because of the long delays and virtual standstill of project
implementation for the 22 months prior to the May 2012 restructuring, the PPMOs did not deliver project
reports, including M&E, in a timely manner and AWPs were overdue in both 2010 and 2011. The overall
safeguard compliance was also downgraded due to the delayed submission of updated external
monitoring and evaluation reports on land acquisition. However, the project complied with audit
requirements with no overdue audits and with audits consistently yielding unqualified opinions. Both
PPMOs responded well and when the project extension was approved in September 2012, all the required
safeguard reports, including dam safety, EMPs and RP were submitted and assessed as satisfactory,
resulting in an upgrade of the safeguard compliance. However, as noted in the procurement discussion in
Section 2.4, the Bank’s procurement guidelines were not closely followed. The other important measure
of sustainability was in the covenant was that stated that each multi-village and single piped water supply
system completed and commissioned shall, before the end if the first fiscal year of operation, establish
and begin collection of water charges at a level sufficient to cover the cost of MOM. Data compiled on
a sample of schemes in both provinces as part of the economic and financial analysis (annex 3) for the
ICR indicates general compliance with this covenant.

5.2.3   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.3.1 The telling issue was the inability of the two provincial governments to quickly formulate and
agreed on a consolidated restructuring plan for the project. This delay of more than one-third of the
original implementation period resulted in significantly reduced outputs and outcomes with the
restructuring plan approved only 5 months before the scheduled closing date of the project. Therefore,
relative to these reduced targets, there was reasonable achievement, but not if measured against appraisal
targets. (See Annex 2.) The Hygiene Promotion component was particularly affected.

5.2.3.2 The core intended project outcome was the development of an integrated and participatory,
(three-in-one), approach to the provision of RWSSHP services. This was only partially achieved,
because of the significant reduction in the scale and scope of all components at the first restructuring, and
particularly the HP component.. However on the positive side and what was confirmed during the ICR
mission was that both provincial governments saw great value in adopting the integrated and participatory
framework approach developed under the project. Each province has strengthened institutional
cooperation mechanisms to ensure that all planning, design and implementation of RWSSHP will be
carried out using the integrated and participatory (three-in-one), starting with activities planned as part of
the 13th FYP.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 The following project specific and more general lessons were learned during project implementation:

    a. Significant co-financiers not honoring their funding commitment obligations for the life of a
       project has profound effects on project implementation and achievement of the PDO. DfID
       withdrew from the project using a standard and generic clause in the MOU. In order to avoid
       future problems of this nature, MOUs should be strengthened to ensure that co-financiers honor
       their commitments for the life of projects and only cancel these commitments in well define,
       documented and transparent circumstances and with agreement of all parties involved in



                                                     23
         financing.

    b. For multi provincial projects, a Central government agency should be nominated to coordinate
       provincial activity. To avoid delays and prevent one province being held up by the inaction of
       another, as was the case with the restructuring of this project, a central agency like NDRC should
       be nominated as the responsible central agency to better coordinate project provinces.
       Alternatively, project design could be more flexible in the future to allow staged restructuring
       where one province is moving faster than another.

    c. Strategic partnerships and targeted TA add tremendous value.      The strategic partnership
       established between the WB/UNICEF/GoC/DfID added tremendous value and in the end the
       KASH TA program produced a best practice example of leverage and co-operation applied to
       help GoC find solutions to a huge national challenge in the RWSSHP sector. The Bank should
       look for more opportunities to develop similar partnerships to enhance project outcomes.

    d.    Standard physical and price contingence items for Bank lending in China need continual review
         and updating to better reflect reality. The underestimation of contingencies at appraisal resulted
         in significant cost variations.

    e.    Strengthening the support provided by government departments to new community groups. A
         stronger and more permanent relationship between the WASH committees and the Town Water
         Supply Stations and CWRBs needs to be developed to support fledging community committees
         that have been assigned the MOM responsibilities of water supply schemes, but have little or no
         experience with the operational and technical aspects of assets assigned.

    f.    Strength of Programmatic approach to project design. Despite the implementation problems
         with this project, in future a programmatic approach to project design can be effective in
         addressing major national policy issues and challenges, particularly combined with a good
         technical assistance in China.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1 Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1    The borrower raised the following issues.

    a. Shaanxi province generally agreed that the World Bank’s ICR report was comparatively
       comprehensive in its overall assessment of the project. It analyzed the difficulties, problems and
       impacts that occurred during implementation such as Wenchuan earthquake, the withdrawal of
       DfID as a major co-financier of the project, variations of currency exchange rates, rising prices,
       poor implementation, and objectively assessed the relevance, achievement of three-in-one
       approach. It also highlighted the special efforts made by Shaanxi Province.

    b. According to the assessment conclusion, both the overall project and project provinces
       performance are rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, Shaanxi Province strongly felt
       that this rating was inappropriate for Shaanxi and did not reflect their better implementation
       performance.

    c. The major problem that affected project implementation was that cancellation of the DfID grant.
       The withdrawal of DfID meant that the core objective of the integrated three-in-one approach




                                                     24
     involving the provision of water supply, sanitation and health promotion services was seriously
     affected. If the original PAD target is used as basis for assessment, the result is not fair.

d. At the MTR (July 2010), Shaanxi Province quickly approved a restructuring plan in order to
   accelerate implementation. The plan included a commitment to add counterpart funds to replace
   the DfID grant funding shortfall and retain the original 1:1 proportion. Shaanxi wanted to
   commence the follow-up bidding immediately, but instead had to wait for Sichuan Province to
   finalize their restructuring plan, which resulted in the long delay of the project in Shaanxi.
   Therefore, in Shaanxi’s opinion, the conclusion in the report that gives a rating of “moderately
   unsatisfactory” for both provinces is not proper in Shaanxi’s case. As part of the MTR
   restructuring, Shaanxi Province added an additional RMB15 million of counterpart funds to deal
   with the financing gap due to withdrawal of grant. In addition, Shaanxi strengthened the
   coordination of all levels of government to ensure that the mass media of HP promotion material
   was broadcasted on Provincial TV media, free of charge.

e. Shaanxi kindly requested the World Bank to consider the actual implementation conditions of
   project in Shaanxi, in particular the effort made by Shaanxi Provincial Government and general
   public in the project area, and should therefore revise the Shaanxi performance to “Moderately
   Satisfactory”.

f.   Sichuan explained the delay of 22 months for the submission of the restructuring application as
     follows. In June 2010, the Bank task team conducted the MTR mission and the objective was to
     help the project provinces to complete their medium-term adjustment plan. Sichuan prepared the
     MTR adjustment report which included the use of DfID grant, but the remaining grant amount
     could not be determined at the MTR stage. As a consequence, the Bank did not agree to the
     inclusion of the DfID grant as part of the project restructuring. At the MTR stage, there was still
     unused DfID grant remaining in Sichuan’s special account, but the Bank did not agree to pay for
     the newly procured contracts. Sichuan believes that on this DfID grant issue, the Bank should
     have adopted a more practical and effective approach. In January 2012, the PPMO tried to resolve
     the outstanding issues with the Bank’s task team, but these efforts were not successful.
     Considering all the efforts by Sichuan, it is unfair to attribute all the delay in completing the
     project restructuring to the fault of Sichuan.

g. With respect to the procurement collusion issues found in some procurement activities, Sichuan
   pointed out that since the start of procurement activities, the World Bank and the PPMO
   conducted annual reviews of all the procurement documents in Chengdu and on-site. There were
   many procurement training activities and prevenative measures carried out, but during the June
   2010 and June 2011 supervision missions, evidence of collusion was found in contracts
   SCYT09005, SCYDG9002, SCRSG09002 SCGAG10020 and SCRS10001 / 1. In response to the
   procurement problems identified, the Sichuan PPMO conducted several checks and took the
   appropriate anti-corruption measures, and imposed sanctions on the identified contractors, all of
   which have been filed in the World Bank’s records. Therefore, Sichuan does not agree with the
   procurement management section of the ICR report, which states that there were a large number
   of contracts with collusion, and no action was taken by Sichuan to satisfactorily resolve the
   collusion issues.

h. In summary, Sichuan made the following comments:

       i.    Looking back on the past eight years’ experience of project implementation, many
             lessons have been learned.




                                                25
          ii.   The Sichuan Project Implementing Agencies lacked experience with World Bank project
                management. However, despite the lack of experience, the project implementing
                agencies at provincial and county levels worked very hard and took measures to
                advance the implementation, especially early in the project and after the project
                restructuring which involved a concentrated effort of effective, high-speed action to
                advance the construction of the project and to ensure the completion of the project
                activities. Therefore Sichuan hoped that World Bank project task team in the course of
                this ICR preparation can take these efforts into consideration and carry out a more
                objective and impartial analysis.

         iii.   A clear lesson learned is that this project suffered from a lack of national-level
                institutions to coordinate provincial activities. The provincial level implementing agency
                was too weak and not in a position to speak.

         iv.    Sichuan was concerned about the performance rating of MU assigned to the provinces in
                the ICR. Sichuan was of the view that because the Bank team was an integral part of the
                project with its responsibilities, the Bank team’s performance should realistically also be
                rated MU. This would ensure that the ICR ratings are not contradictory.

7.2 Co-financiers – DfID
7.2.1 The following comments on lessons learned were received from DFID:
   a. The commitment to a project should not go beyond an organization's overall             programming
      cycle;

   b. If a project involves many organizations as this did, there should be a sound assessment at design
      stage as to whether the key organizations have reached consensus on the project concepts and
      approaches. If the issue is not well addressed at design stage, we need to ask the question, ‘should
      we go ahead with the design’ and ‘to what extent it is doable?

   c. If a project includes both on the ground implementation and central level dissemination as this
      project did, it is essential to have a strong central government agency to coordinate local partners
      and support the nation-wide dissemination. This role cannot be fulfilled by a local authority, or
      donor agency;

   d. The project was strongly linked to the KASH TA program. The KASH program took the
      responsibility to support the dissemination of experience drawn from the project, however KASH
      finished 18 months earlier than the latter. It was therefore impossible for the provincial WASH to
      have enough lessons to share with the others simply at the middle stage of implementation. The
      nearly two year delay between WASH project approval in 2007 and implementation beginning in
      2009 further exacerbated this problem.

   e. The ICR report highlighted the achievements of KASH, but DfID questioned             of whether any
      independent evaluation had been undertaken to verify the KASH outcomes

   f.   Lessons learned: should incorporate those learnt from complicated, time-consuming Bank
        procedures and the frequent change of Task Team Leader.

   g. An independent evaluation is better positioned to give rating for overall bank performance.




                                                   26
   h. The total DfID financial contribution to the project channelled through World Bank Trust Fund
      (Parent Trust Fund TF070771) is £10,188,505 out of DfID’s original commitment £14,128,346
      (Child Trust Fund TF058298 for the World Bank in an amount £303,350 of & TF058297 for two
      provinces in an amount of £13,542,429), and the total disbursement should be approx 72%.

7.3 Other partners and stakeholders. UNICEF

7.3.1 The comments from UNIFEC are taken from the executive summary of the KASH TA -End of
Program Report. The executive summary verbatim is at Annex 7.

7.3.2 Strong partnerships were established during the KASH program (2006-2010) for the promotion of
sanitation and hygiene in China and regionally/globally. Within China, the KASH Project itself was
implemented by the NDRC, NPHCCO, and MWR with support from their national institutions such as
the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and sub-national level departments. Through KASH,
the implementation of the Western Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion
(WPRWSSHP) Project in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, financed by a World Bank (WB) loan and a
DfID grant, was also supported by the UNICEF-Government cooperation program; and the best practices
from this Sichuan and Shaanxi Project were also disseminated to the related central government
departments.

7.3.3     The purpose of the KASH Project was to address the low priority given to sanitation and
hygiene; to support policy, guideline and standards development; and to advocate for increased
investment through building partnerships, evidence collection and intensive communication. The ultimate
goal was for increased and equal access to water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion services for
the rural poor population in western provinces.

7.3.4 The KASH Project contributed to achieving the goals set in China’s plans for rural water supply
and environmental sanitation, and in helping the government to fulfill its commitment to achieve the
MDGs through planning, designing and implementing the Project with the NDRC, NPHCCO/MoH and
MWR. The KASH Project was also working closely with DFID and the WB through joint assessment
missions to the WPRWSSHP Project, providing capacity building training to the Project Management
Offices in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The UNICEF WASH team also coordinated the relevant NGO partners
working on WASH in China, including Plan International, Save the Children and the China Red Cross
Society, and established a communication platform for 2010 GHD events, ensuring that the campaign was
implemented nationwide, achieving a huge impact. The Project also partnered with the Global Water
Partnership in China to advocate on water and sanitation issues and organized several high level
roundtable meetings.

7.3.5 In general, the KASH Project has contributed greatly to significant improvements in WASH in
China. The results clearly indicate that KASH has fulfilled its objectives in evidence collection,
partnership building, policy and guideline development and advocacy for investment.

7.3.6 The success of KASH was in many ways determined by the close collaboration with key related
government counterparts who are concerned with WASH, and with government stakeholders responsible
for policy development and planning. These partnerships enhanced the influence of Project outputs on
government initiatives, and partnerships with technical institutions ensured smoothness in the
implementation of improvements.

Project Component 1. Water supply. The outputs of this component were 17,055 schemes built
against an original target of 25, 459 and a restructured target of 16,818. The original outcome target was
to give about 771,109 people a new water supply service. Shaanxi in fact maintained and met the
original output and outcome targets and delivered a new service to 326,700 people. Sichuan reduced their
output targets at restructuring and actually built slightly more than this, however, the outcome achieved,
relative to original target of 444,393 people to an actual of 262,737 (-41%).

Project Component 2. Environmental Sanitation. The restructuring saw this component’s output
targets significantly reduced. The actual output achievements relative to the original targets were very
low for all sub-component activities: (i) school latrines and HW facilities, and garbage drop-off points
down 82%; the provision of HH latrines down 73%; and village public latrines and garbage drop-off
points down 23%. The reduction all activities associated with sanitation in schools in both provinces was
particularly disappointing. This poor actual output performance of course had a corresponding affect on
actual outcomes with a significant reduction (-66%) in people gaining access to sanitation services in both
provinces), compared with the original outcome target (664,005 down to 224,620). The biggest reduction
in access was in Shaanxi, (-76% 326,716 down to 79,220) and in Sichuan the figure was -57% (337,289
down to 145,400).

Project Component 3. Hygiene Promotion. The component suffered the most at the restructuring and
was reduced significantly because of the lack of funds. The scope was reduced to focus on three
outcomes; (Communities HWWS on the 5 key occasions; (ii) school students HWWS; and (iii) the safe
disposal of infant faeces. There is no specific output data available for this component. However, each
province did carry out a behavioral change study that establish a baseline and control groups. Sichuan did
an MTR update of the study and both provinces carried out an end of project update. The report results
showed that relative to the control groups, there was not much net benefit attributed by the project for
HWWS at either the community or schools levels. What the survey results did show was that the HP
messages did result in behavioral change for the safe disposal of infant faeces

Project Component 4 Institutional Development and Capacity Building

One of the important outputs of this component was the training activities and data shows at there was a
total of 191,620 training days provided by the project. The data also shows that the vast majority of
training days (189,490 days or 99%) of the training was directed at the community level and only 2,130
days (1%) was applied to project management staff and technical training. An equitable share of the
community level training was directed to empowering the poor and vulnerable. Also women were the
recipients of a lot of the training as well. This investment in capacity building through training is
reflected in the good outcome indicators measuring equity. The other outcome influenced by the success
of the training program at community level was the building of a strong participatory process under the
project.

CHINA: Western Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Project

1.       The cost benefit analysis (CBA) for the water supply component of the project was conducted
after the completion of the implementation of the project. The CBA was based on the representative
samples of different schemes selected at appraisal across the two project provinces. The results of the
CBA were represented by EIRR. The same models used at appraisal to calculate the EIRR were used at
ICR, with the following assumptions :

    a. The investment in water supply was made following the principle of least cost;
    b. The actual capital investment made at ICR were used as against estimated cost of investment at
       appraisal was used to obtain economic value of investment by conversion factor of 93%;
    c. The economic value of O&M costs was 1% of capital investment;
    d. The economic price of water at appraisal was also used to calculate the economic benefit of the
       schemes at ICR;
    e. Water supply scheme capacity was based on the actual water consumption at ICR compared with
       the design capacity used at appraisal and an annually 1% increase of water consumption from
       the commencement of operation was used to calculate the economic benefit of the schemes;
    f. The sensitivity analysis only tested the increase of O&M costs since it closely relates to the
       efficiency of management during the operation.

2.      The results of the CBA were shown in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 below, compared with the results of the
CBA at project appraisal. The results show that the overall EIRR for all schemes analyzed in the two
provinces is 16.7%, lower than one at project appraisal. Among others, the benefits specifically the
consumption of water is lower than one estimated at project appraisal. In another word, the demand of
water was overestimated at project appraisal. Table 3.3 and 3.4 below show the water demand estimated
at project appraisal and the water consumption at ICR. The realized capacity of the schemes analyzed is
only 60% of design capacity made at project appraisal.

3.       The economic benefits used to calculate EIRR does not include the public health benefits, which
are difficult to quantify, such as reducing diarrhea, skin disease, typhoid, eye disease, etc. Another widely
accepted benefit is the improved sanitation which is more important in epidemiological terms. Take into
account these benefits, the EIRR for all schemes would be greater.

Financial analysis

4.       The setting of the correct water tariff is a key to achieving one of the objectives of the project
which is to provide an affordable, but sustainable water supply. To achieve this objective, tariffs should
be set at a level sufficient to at least cover the operation and maintenance cost of providing water supply
services, but would not be expected to cover the Bank loan repayments. These repayments would be
made by the participating county or municipal governments.

5.      At project appraisal, it was projected that tariffs would need to be set between RMB1.5 and
RMB4 per m3 in Sichuan to achieve financial sustainability, with an average of RMB2.9 per m3. It was
also projected that tariffs would need to be set between RMB1.5 and RMB6.45 per m3 in Shaanxi, with
an average of RMB2.7 per m3.

6.      At ICR, 13 schemes in Sichuan were selected and their tariffs ranged from RMB1.80 to 3.90 per
m3. In Shaanxi, 10 schemes were reviewed and their tariffs ranged between RMB2.50 and RMB4.00 per
m3. These tariffs fell within the ranges of tariffs projected at appraisal. However, these tariffs did not
necessarily ensure all schemes covered their O&M costs from the tariff revenue alone. Some of the
schemes needed other revenues such as connection fees and sales of materials to cover O&M costs. Table
3.5 and 3.6 below show the tariffs and O&M costs in the selected schemes in Sichuan and Shaanxi.

Note: In Xindian, the expense of power is RMB1.32/m3 and the office expense is RMB1.64/m3. The sum of both expenses is less than
RMB3.00/m3 (the water tariff in Xindian). However, the expense of salary and welfare is RMB7.40/m3, which should be improved.
The tariff in Baijiazhai is very lower than unit cost of O&M. The tariff is RMB2.20/m3 while the expense of power is RMB5.79/m3, the expense
of salary and welfare is RMB4.00/m3, the office expense is RMB24.60/m3. Its total revenue in 2012 was RMB41.79 million including tariff
revenue, collection fee, and sales of materials, while its total expense in RMB41.50 million. The total revenue can cover all O&M costs.

                            Annex 4. Resettlement and Land Acquisition

1.       The project supported sub-projects with involuntary resettlement (land acquisition) activities,
mainly construction of water supply and sanitation facilities in a number of villages of 25 counties,
including Shaanxi 15 counties in and Sichuan 10 counties in. The involuntary resettlement activities did
not have any house demolition or people replaced according to the resettlement action plans (RAPs) and
actual land acquisition in the two project provinces. All work related to involuntary resettlement of the
project was fully completed before end of March, 2013.

2.       Details of Land Acquisition. A total of 12.61 ha/189.17 mu of land was permanently acquired
(Sichuan 5.99 ha/89.95 mu and Shaanxi 6.62 ha/99.22 mu). A total area of 132.06 ha/1980.83 mu land
was temporarily occupied (Sichuan 65.35 ha/980.23 mu and Shaanxi66.71 ha/1000.6 mu). In Sichuan
province, five project counties (Jianling, Lezhi, Pingchang, Guangan and Yanting) provided land for the
project use within project villages and the affected households were compensated on a land-for-land basis,
rather than monetary compensation. In Shanxi, five project counties (Zichang, Zhidan, Yaozhou, Yintai
and Suide) only had temporary land occupation. The total costs for land compensation was
US$0.515/RMB3.194 million (Sichuan US$0.161/RMB 1.00 million Shaanxi /US$0.354/RMB2.195
million). More details by province are shown in table 1 below:

        Note: The Chinese unit of area is the mu. 15mu =1 hectare or 666 m²


3.   The project civil works were very small in terms of each individual work scale spread over 15
     counties of Shaanxi and 10 counties of Sichuan. The civil works were mainly for village and farm
     household level water supply and including such works as well and small-scale water pumping
     stations, and sanitation/latrine facilities for local households, villages and schools and required the
     acquisition of less than 0.06 hectare (600 m²). In many cases project village communities adopted
     the land for land compensation method, whereby land required was provided by the respective
     project villages by reallocating village land. This also led to a small amount of cost for land
     acquisition in the project.

4.   Compared to the appraisal estimate, the actual involuntary resettlement impacts were reduced for
     project component 1 - safe drinking water supply, and substantially reduced in component two-
     environmental sanitation, because pipeline layout was optimized in implementation, and a big
     portion of DFID fund was withdrawn during the project implementation period, thus reducing the
     scale and scope of this component. For example, at project restructuring, the number of households
     planned for latrine construction reduced from 162,014 to 42,925 with the actual achievement of
     43,925 and the number of latrines for local schools was reduced from 448 to 97, with actual
     achievement of 65.

     Livelihood Restoration of PAPs

5.   All PAPs were compensated properly in accordance with the RAPs. Compensation standards for
     land use were equal to or exceeded those stipulated in the RAPs. All compensation was paid on time
     and all PAPs were consulted during the entire resettlement process. Overall, the resettlement
     objective was realized and resettlement results were satisfactory. The monitoring team conducted
     random investigations on livelihood restoration every year during the project implementation. The
     project only acquired a very small portion of affected people’s land, the adverse impacts on these
     people’s livelihoods were consequently very little. Furthermore, the monitoring reports and analysis
     concluded that the livelihoods of the PAPs have been fully restored and their average annual income
     had actually increased year by year. The PAPs living environment, including provision of public
     facilities and services, such as drinking water and latrine facilities, has improved significantly.

Shaanxi.

Shaanxi prepared a comprehensive ICR report that followed the Bank’s recommended format for
the preparation of the borrower’s ICR and the full report is in the project files. Unlike Sichuan,
no summary of the report was prepared. The report was prepared in seven sections, with many
subsections providing a lot of detail. Its scope and content included:

Section 1 Assessment of Dos and design and quality at entry
Section 2: Achievements of Objectives and Outputs
Section 3 Project Implementation
Section 4: Major factors affecting implementation and outcomes
Section 5: Project Sustainability
Section 6: Bank and Borrower Performance
Section 7: Experience and Lessons Learned

The key experiences noted by Shaanxi were: 1) The “three-in-one” approach is worthwhile to
scale-up; 2) Community participatory is the foundation for smooth implementation and
sustainable operation; 3) The WASH Committees are a key factor for sustainable operation; and
4 ) Cooperation of line agencies is basis for carrying out “three-in-one” approach

The key lessons learned are: 1) It is crucial to stress community participatory; 2) Experience of
monitoring unit affected objectivity of the project outcome; 3) Appropriate estimation of price
contingency and fluctuation of exchange rate is crucial for the project implementation; and 4)
Better mechanisms for cross-provincial coordination are necessary.

ICR Report Summary

        Sichuan rural water supply and environmental health project supported by loan from the
World Bank and grants of the British Government (rural water supply and environmental health
project in Sichuan province) is a demonstration project of exploratory and innovative pilot
coordinating the implement of the 11th Five-year Plan for National Safeguarding Rural Drinking
Water Project carried out in China for the cooperation between World Bank and Chinese
Government, aiming at explore an effective promoting mechanism and pattern among "drinking
water safety, environmental health and health education" in poverty-stricken rural areas. The
project is implemented in Sichuan and Shaanxi and shall be extended in other provinces in China.
Rural water supply and environmental health project in Sichuan Province covers 117700 peasant
households of 10 counties (districts) in Sichuan Province, among which 4 counties are the key

                                                45
counties of the state for poverty alleviation development. The preparation of the project began in
2005, the project was formally implemented in the end of 2008, the project ended up at the end
of the fiscal year of the World Bank in 2013, and the project has lasted for eight years.

        In order to get a comprehensive and systematic summary of the experience of rural water
supply and environmental health project in Sichuan province, project office in Sichuan province
hired experts to form a preparation group of the "completion report" of the project, and the
project implementation agencies in 10 project counties were organized to discuss, formulate,
revise and improve the outline, data and case collection scheme of the "completion report" of the
project in many times, organized and conducted acceptance evaluation work of the project, and
collected a large number of project data, related information, cases, etc. in almost half a year, and
the acceptance evaluation report of this project was written on this basis.

         Nine chapters are used to make an overall review, conclusion and evaluation for the
background, process, implementation situation, benefits, influence, etc. of the rural water supply
and environmental health project in Sichuan province in this report, and the effectiveness, impact
achieved and useful experience explored in the rural water supply and environmental health
project in Sichuan province are overall summed up, to provide experience for reference for the
work to solve the problems of drinking water safety, environmental health, public health, etc. in
rural areas.

UNICEF.    Executive Summary of the Knowledge and Advocacy for Sanitation and Hygiene
(KASH) end of Program Report June 2010.

1. Executive Summary
At the commencement of this project, access to safe water, sanitary means of excreta disposal and good
hygiene practices were a major concern in rural China. With respect to water, in 2005 around 300 million
people lacked access to safe water, over 50 million people lived in fluoride-affected areas; more than 2
million were at risk of chronic arsenic poisoning from contaminated drinking water and more than 10,000
were suffering from frank arsenicosis; over 37 million people were at risk of dental fluorosis and nearly
three million had skeletal fluorosis; even more were drinking from biologically and chemically
contaminated water sources. With respect to sanitation, over 670 million people lived without improved
sanitation, despite the fact that access to sanitation had increased from 8% in 1993 to 40% in 2003. The
use of raw and/or semi-digested human excreta in the field as organic fertilizer was a common practice in
rural China, and hence it is not surprising that an estimated 190 million children were infected with round
worm and another 70 million with whip worm; over 40 million also had hook worm, at project
commencement. These children were thus at risk of anaemia, global malnutrition and slow cognitive
development affecting their learning achievement.

United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) developed its Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
programme (2006-2010) based on the above situation and the lessons learnt and experiences gained from
its previous programme cycle (2001-2005). The three major components of WASH Programme in the
2006-2010 cycle were: i) Knowledge and Advocacy for Sanitation and Hygiene (KASH) to influence
policy change, with a focus on creating an enabling environment for better hygiene practices; ii) WASH
in schools (WiS), in conjunction with UNICEF assistance in Education, to demonstrate Children Friendly
WiS that would ultimately lead to the development of a policy on promoting sanitation and hygiene in all
schools, and iii) Water Quality - Arsenic Mitigation and Management, to facilitate the development of a
long-term plan for water quality issues specifically concerning arsenic and fluoride and developing a
community-based water quality monitoring system.

In this context, the UNICEF collaborated with the United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) and designed the KASH Project with equal amount of funds from both agencies to
be managed by UNICEF China Office. Over five years, a variety of activities were conducted in four
output areas as planned in the project proposal including: 1) Evidence-based Development on WASH; 2)
Building Partnerships; 3) National Policies and Guidelines, and 4) Advocacy for Investment in Rural
Sanitation.

During the complete project cycle, good outcomes or impacts were achieved, as described by output in
the following paragraphs.

Output 1: Evidence on economic and health benefits of integrated WASH developed, documented and
disseminated to various stakeholders in China




                                                    47
Various studies were carried out including, among others, studies on the “burden of disease‟ due to
unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygiene; cost-benefit of improved water supply, sanitation and hygiene;
assessment of the implementation of the national sanitation program against the Government’s 11th Five-
Year Plan (FYP, 2006-2010) and MDG targets covering identification of constraints and opportunities for
further planning and implementation; a compilation of studies/reports on the current situations of rural
water supply and sanitation in China and a survey on the use and construction of public latrines in rural
China and drinking water safety in rural areas. These reports and major findings were developed and
discussed regularly with key government counterparts such as National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC), National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee Office (NPHCCO), Ministry of
Water Resources (MWR), and Ministry of Education (MoE); and all said information provided references
on improved planning and investments in the WASH sector in China.

The publication of studies and presentation of results at various events publicized the cost effectiveness of
investing in sanitation and its contribution to poverty reduction and therefore gained visibility and
attention from the “National Natural Science Fund”. Now such studies are made a category to be
regularly supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China.

During this period of time, new programs were initiated such as China’s three years “Health Sector
Reform Program (HSRP, 2009-2011)”, which includes rural sanitation and water supply improvement in
rural communities and in local health facilities. Another three years sanitation improvement program
entitled the “National Urban-Rural Integrated Sanitation Improvement Action Plan (NURISIAP)” was
also launched in 2010; this program was initiated based on our KASH project experience and drafted with
KASH Project support.

Output 2: International partnerships, regional networks and national level inter-agency cooperation and
coordination mechanism developed

Strong and wide partnership has been established during the last five years for the promotion of sanitation
and hygiene in China and regionally/globally. Within China, the KASH Project itself was implemented
by the NDRC, NPHCCO, and MWR with support from their national institutions such as the China
Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and sub-national level departments. Through KASH, the
implementation of the Western Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion
(WPRWSSHP) Project in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, financed by a World Bank (WB) loan and
DFID grant, was also supported by the UNICEF-Government cooperation program; and the best practices
from this Sichuan and Shaanxi Project were also disseminated to the related government departments.

With support from KASH, China’s participation in regional and global events was enhanced, enabling
interaction with other countries and international agencies on sanitation development in China and
learning from other nations at the first and second East Asia Ministerial Conferences on Sanitation and
Hygiene (EASAN).

Chinese Government counterparts were made aware of the methodologies of the World Health
Organization (WHO)/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) on Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) targets on sanitation and water, and the government is a major partner of the global consultation
on the post-MDG (post-2015) water and sanitation target setting and monitoring.

Wider partnership was also built via events organized for hygiene behaviour change and for promoting
water conservation and use during globally recognized occasions, such as the Global Handwashing Day
(GHD) and the World Water Day (WWD).



                                                     48
Partnership was also connected through workshops, forum, ChinaWASH Yahoogroups managed by
UNICEF, and the WASH website (http://www.qgzjxd.com) created by KASH and now managed by the
Chinese Centre for Health Education (CCHE).

Thanks to KASH, government water and sanitation programs are now more reliably designed with several
ministries‟ involvement and implemented with joint effort, with each responsible for a component. For
example, the establishment of the 12th FYP for rural water supply has been led by MWR with input from
NDRC and NPHCCO and endorsed by all of them. The three years “NURISIAP” was developed by the
NPHCCO with support from UNICEF, and commented by the NPHCCO‟s member ministries and
provincial level authorities, and is being implemented by local governments. In early 2011, the NPHCCO
organized an inspection and supervision with eight member ministries’ participation.

Output 3: Policies, best practices guidelines and manuals for sanitation and hygiene promotion
programmes, and especially the integrated WASH approach documented and disseminated

Studies, surveys, evaluations/assessments, workshops/forums and campaigns supported, plus strategic
partnerships with NDRC, NPHCCO, MWR and MoE, have led to several policy changes and
developments. KASH-supported activities were a major contributor to each of the following major
outputs/outcomes. First was the strengthening of sanitation standards in order to ensure that human waste
would not impose harm to water sources, soil and directly to people. Three national standards were newly
established or revised including “Human Waste Harmless Treatment Standard”, “Rural Household
Latrine Standard” and “Rural Public Latrine Standard”; and the Child Friendly WASH Standard was also
written for use. Second, school water and environmental sanitation was given due attention. The NDRC,
MWR and MoE issued a government paper requesting all levels to take school water supply into the
water sector’s agenda, and corresponding funds have been allocated since 2010. Third, rural waste water
management has been brought to the attention of the government, such that MWR has listed it as a
component of the sector’s 12th FYP. Finally, a comprehensive regulation was developed which laid the
foundation for rural water supply construction, operation, maintenance, quality and monitoring and
evaluation.

During this period, the government has also favoured sanitation and water development, prioritizing it
among the rural and ethnic groups, in child care centres and schools and at health facilities. This
momentum is seen to be continued and indicated in the Party’s and State Council’s Number 1 Paper of
2011.

Output 4: Policy and guidelines for government and private sector investment in rural WASH developed
and adopted by Government of China

The Project supported development of approaches, guidelines, strategies, and standards; conducted
forum/workshops; undertook studies and conducted analysis to provide evidence and built up partnerships
to support the dialogue for government and private sector’s investment in sanitation. The major
outputs/outcomes established include, first, the systematic and integrated approach in the development
and implementation of the “NURISIAP”. The development was initiated and coordinated by PHCCO and
local government is leading the implementation with related PHCCO’s members. This arrangement
allows for financial sources for relevant business managed by different departments to be used jointly for
this integrated Action Plan. Second, some studies clearly revealed the level of willingness of rural
villagers in selected rural communities to pay for sanitation improvement, and analysed the need for funds
from both government and other sources to achieve the MDG sanitation target. Third, surveys on the
possibility of, exploration of mechanisms and promotion forum for marketing sanitation inspired and
fostered the development of private sector participation in pushing sustainable sanitation development.


                                                   49
Investment in rural water supply and sanitation has increased sharply. A sizable increase in central
government investments for rural drinking water supply (from 11.4 billion RMB in 2008 to 15.2 billion
RMB in 2009) and rural sanitation (from 558 million RMB in 2008 to 1.6 billion RMB in 2009) has
materialized. The NDRC and NPHCCO/MoH, our key sanitation counterparts, each played key roles in
incorporating rural water supply and sanitation as part of the Government’s HSRP, thus resulting in this
huge increase in the budget for sanitation during this period.

In general, the KASH Project has contributed greatly to significant improvements in WASH in China.
The results clearly indicate that KASH has fulfilled its objectives in evidence collection, partnership
building, policy and guideline development and advocacy for investment.

The success of KASH was in many ways determined by the close collaboration with key related
government counterparts who are concerned with WASH, and with government stakeholders responsible
for policy development and planning. These partnerships enhanced the influence of Project outputs on
government initiatives, and partnerships with technical institutions ensured smoothness in the
implementation of improvements.

UNICEF is proud of the success of KASH, particularly the momentum in WASH within government and
the probability that China will achieve the MDG target in sanitation. However, we hoped that the private
sector would be more active in investing in rural sanitation using its marketing skills and research and
development capacity; more effort is needed by this sector in the future.

A total of USD 1,655,056.19 was allocated by DFID for the KASH Project, yielding a programmable
amount of USD 1,546,815.52 for UNICEF China. Currently, the balance is USD 20.34. Both government
counterparts and UNICEF are grateful to DFID for this contribution without which the above mentioned
results would not have been achieved. UNICEF and the other domestic and international partners will
continue to support the Government of China in rural sanitation and water, also taking climate change and
environmental degradation into consideration. And, it is expected that China’s success will also benefit
the rest of the world.
