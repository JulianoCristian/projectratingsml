                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the withdrawal of financing from the Department for International Development (of the United Kingdom) from the project, the Bank requested in June 2010 that the two
                         project provinces identify a restructuring plan to scale back the scope of the project to realign it with available funding from the Bank loan and counterpart funding. The request was
                         received only in late March 2012 and the project’s restructuring was completed in early May. Consequently, project implementation, which had stagnated for two years, is posed to

                         access to safe water supply is still at about 378,840 or only 53% of the project target of 771,109. The increase in the percentage of people who have adopted safe hygiene and
                         sanitation behaviors is still not known. A survey was carried out in mid 2011 but the survey results are still not available. An end-of-project survey will be conducted before closing
                         on September 30, 2012. Currently the increase in the percentage of households with improved latrines is only 16% in Shaanxi (new target is 21.4%) and 15% in Sichuan (new target
