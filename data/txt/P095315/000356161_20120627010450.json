China's urban population resides\n            primarily in city districts (shiqu) and town districts\n            (zhenqu), which constitute the urban core of larger\n            administrative units called cities (shi) and respectively\n            towns (zhen). Cities and towns in China are expansive\n            regions, with administrative territories much larger than in\n            the rest of the world (Chan 2007). Cities are conceptually\n            equivalent to counties in the U.S. and thus the whole of\n            China's territory is basically covered by 287\n            prefecture and provincial level municipalities, which within\n            their area include 654 city districts - the cities proper in\n            the conventional sense of this word - and 19,322 towns. Each\n            town in turn includes a town district - an urban core that\n            occupies a fraction of the town's area but accounts for\n            most of the town's urban population. While cities and\n            towns as a whole overlap in their administrative boundaries,\n            with multiple towns nested within each city, city districts\n            and town districts are disjoint structures, being urban\n            embryos within the administrative boundaries of\n            territorially larger cities and towns. The main purpose of\n            this study is to examine the development and features of\n            town districts (zhenqu) - the urbanized core of China's towns."}, "docdt": "2012-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
