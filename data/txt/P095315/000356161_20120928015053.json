The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from September\n            30, 2012 to March 29, 2013.

The project was\n            funded by a combined investment of US$75 million: US$25\n            million from a World Bank loan, US$25 million equivalent\n            from a Department for International Development (DfID)\n            grant, and a US$25 million equivalent investment by the\n            Government of China (GOC).
