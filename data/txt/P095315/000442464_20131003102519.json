{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Western Provinces Rural\n            Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion Project for\n            China were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: memorandum of understandings (MOUs) should\n            be strengthened to ensure that co-financiers honor their\n            commitments for the life of projects and only cancel these\n            commitments in well define, documented, and transparent\n            circumstances and with agreement of all parties involved in\n            financing. To avoid delays and prevent one province being\n            held up by the inaction of another, as was the case with the\n            restructuring of this project, a central agency like\n            National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) should be\n            nominated as the responsible central agency to better\n            coordinate project provinces. Project design can be more\n            flexible in the future to allow staged restructuring where\n            one province is moving faster than another. The Bank should\n            look for more opportunities to develop similar partnerships\n            to enhance project outcomes. Standard physical and price\n            contingence items for Bank lending in China need continual\n            review and updating to better reflect reality. A stronger\n            and more permanent relationship between the water,\n            sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) committees and the town water\n            supply stations and county water resource bureaus (CWRBs)\n            needs to be developed to support fledging community\n            committees that have been assigned the management,\n            operations, and maintenance (MOM) responsibilities of water\n            supply schemes, but have little or no experience with the\n            operational and technical aspects of assets assigned. A\n            programmatic approach to project design can be effective in\n            addressing major national policy issues and challenges,\n            particularly combined with a good technical assistance in China."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
