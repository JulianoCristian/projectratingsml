                     PROMOTION PROJECT

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes in the China Western Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene
Promotion Project (P095315): (a) reduction of project activities; (b) change in project costs,
reallocation of Loan proceeds, and increase in disbursement percentages; and (c) updating of the
results framework. The restructuring is necessary to reduce the scope and outcomes of the
project in line with the reduced funding envelope resulting mainly from: (a) the 2008 Wenchuan
earthquake that significantly affected both project provinces; and (b) the withdrawal of grant
funding from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID) in 2010.

2.     The project was funded by a combined investment of US$75 million: US$25 million
from a World Bank loan, US$25 million equivalent from a DfID grant, and a US$25 million
equivalent investment by the Government of China (GOC). The Loan and DfID Grant were
supported by three legal documents, dated September 29, 2007, namely: (i) a Loan Agreement
between the Bank and the People’s Republic of China; (ii) a Project Agreement between the
Bank and both borrowers – Shaanxi Province and Sichuan Province; and (iii) a Grant Agreement
between the People’s Republic of China and the Bank acting as administrator of the DfID Grant.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The project was approved on June 26, 2007 and became effective on December 20, 2007.
Project implementation fell significantly behind schedule for two reasons. Six months after
effectiveness, the both Sichuan and Shaanxi Province were hit by the Wenchuan Earthquake of
May 2008. The emergency response to the earthquake strained both provinces’ financial and
human resources and resulted in implementation delays of about one year.

4.       Furthermore, the project suffered financing shortfalls for several reasons: (a) as a
consequence of the Wenchuan earthquake, the prices of construction materials and labor rose
significantly; (b) in 2009, DfID informed GOC and the Bank that it intended to close its China
program, and that the undisbursed portion (about US$6 million equivalent) of its grant would be
canceled in 2010; (c) the value of the Chinese RMB rose significantly compared to the US Dollar
and the British Pound Sterling (GBP), thus increasing the cost of the project in RMB terms; and
(d) the project provinces did not provide sufficient counterpart funds. At the mid-term review in
June 2010, the Bank advised the provinces to devise a restructuring plan to realign the project
scope with reduced available funding; however an agreed restructuring plan was not formally
submitted to the Bank until March 2012.

5.     Due to lack of agreement on the scope and funding for the project, contracts could not be
signed and implementation stagnated for almost two years as demonstrated by the lack of
progress in fulfilling key performance indicators (KPIs). For example, the number of additional
                                               6
people with access to safe water supply has reached about 378,840 or only 53% of the project
target. The increase in the percentage of households with improved latrines is only 23% in
Shaanxi (target is 100%) and 15% in Sichuan (target is 70%). The increase in the percentage of
people who have adopted safe hygiene and sanitation behaviors is not known because monitoring
and evaluation have been inadequate (the 2011 survey results should be available soon). Due to
slow implementation progress and the shortfall in financing, it is unlikely that the Project
Development Objective can be satisfactorily met to the extent reflected in the KPIs by the Loan
closing date of September 30, 2012. No funding was made available by the GOC to fill in the
gap. The purpose of the restructuring, therefore, is to allow the Loan to be fully utilized and
achieve most benefits in the remaining time.

6.     Compliance with covenants. The last ISR reports that the project management offices in
each province have not delivered project reports, including M&E, in a timely manner and annual
work plans were not delivered by end October as expected, especially for 2010 and 2011. There
are no overdue audits and audits have consistently yielded unqualified opinions. The overall
safeguard compliance is downgraded due to the delay submission of updated external monitoring
and evaluation report on land acquisition.

8.      For the Environmental Sanitation component, some counties decided to construct a
greater number of public three compartment latrines to replace the household three compartment
latrines which were dropped due to inadequate funding.

9.     For the Hygiene Promotion component, two final activities will be completed by loan
closing: (a) the last survey on behavioral change, which was already included in an existing
consulting service contract and (b) a local workshop to share experiences among county project
management offices.

10.    For the Institutional Development and Capacity Building, three domestic study tours will
be conducted to learn about the operations and maintenance experiences of other rural water
supply projects in China.

       Promotional Materials and Activities

11.    For the Hygiene Promotion component, the only activity scheduled before closing is
execution of the last survey on behavioral change, which is already included in an existing
consulting service contract.

12.     For the Institutional Development and Capacity Building component, Sichuan will hire a
consultant to review the project outcomes and prepare the borrower’s completion report. Annex
1 on the Results Framework and Monitoring shows the key indicators and the expected final
outputs for the reduced project to be reflected in the amendment of the Project Agreement. All 3-
in-1 model adoption/replication related indicators originally shown in the Project Appraisal
Document will be dropped, and all HP related indicators to be replaced with behavior based
indicators because of inadequate available data or attribution issues.

                                                      8
13.     With regard to safeguard review, as only slight reduction in project scope is proposed, the
environmental category of the project remains category B, and no new safeguard policies are
triggered. The restructuring did not bring any changes to the project financial management
system which has been assessed and reviewed as acceptable to the Bank.

depreciation of USD.

16.    Environmental Sanitation. Funding for this component is being reduced from $19
million to $16.51 million because of the reduced available financing envelope following DfID’s
withdrawal.

17.    Hygiene Promotion. This component’s funding will be reduced from $3.79 million to
$1.24 million because the mass media campaign in Shaanxi was financed through an alternative
source and because of the reduced funding available for other activities following DfID’s
withdrawal.

18.    Institutional Strengthening and Training. This component will be slightly reduced by
trimming down the number of domestic study tours for experience learning.

19.    The revised Financing Plan is available from the datasheet proposed by the Borrower
and acceptable to the Bank to reflect the withdrawal of DfID. There is no change in the IBRD
loan of US$25 million. The DfID contribution has declined from US$25 million to US$15.5
million, which was the amount disbursed when DfID withdrew from the project. With the
substantial appreciation of the Chinese RMB against the USD (and GBP), the borrower’s
contribution has risen from $28.51 million to US$31.65 million to be provided by Sichuan and
Shaanxi provincial governments.

20.     Reallocations and Increase in Financing Percentages. The Loan proceeds will be
reallocated among the disbursement categories and the financing percentages for several

                                                       9
categories of expenditure will be increased in order to (a) alleviate funding shortages following
the withdrawal of DfID and to (b) enable full disbursement of the Loan by the September 30,
2012 closing date. These changes are shown in the Tables 4 and 5.
