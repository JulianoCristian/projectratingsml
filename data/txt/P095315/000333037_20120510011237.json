The restructuring is necessary to\n            reduce the scope and outcomes of the project in line with\n            the reduced funding envelope resulting mainly from: (a) the\n            2008 Wenchuan earthquake that significantly affected both\n            project provinces; and (b) the withdrawal of grant funding\n            from the United Kingdom's Department for International\n            Development (DfID) in 2010. The project was funded by a\n            combined investment of US$75 million: US$25 million from a\n            World Bank loan, US$25 million equivalent from a DfID grant,\n            and a US$25 million equivalent investment by the Government\n            of China (GOC). The Loan and DfID grant were supported by\n            three legal documents, dated September 29, 2007, namely: (i)\n            a loan agreement between the Bank and the People's\n            Republic of China; (ii) a project agreement between the Bank\n            and both borrowers, Shaanxi Province and Sichuan Province;\n            and (iii) a grant agreement between the People's\n            Republic of China and the Bank acting as administrator of\n            the DfID grant."}, "docdt": "2012-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
