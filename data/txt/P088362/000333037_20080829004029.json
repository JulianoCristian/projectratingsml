risk to development outcome\n            was significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included:  Approval of procurement at the central\n            level was often slow and caused implementation delays.\n            Decentralization of approving authority would give the\n            provinces more flexibility to tailor and implement their\n            respective activities. This is especially important for\n            emergency operations.  Donor coordination to support the\n            government program is critical. At the beginning of the\n            Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic the lack\n            of clear mechanisms between donors made it difficult to\n            coordinate activities. This situation was improved\n            significantly after the government took the central role in\n            managing the crisis and encouraged the donor community to\n            work together more effectively. Gains made under the project\n            in equipping laboratories and in human resource\n            capacity-building need to be complemented by improvement in\n            the quality management of laboratory testing and field\n            surveillance, data collection and analysis. This will ensure\n            that diagnostic and surveillance results can be trusted to\n            provide necessary information to decision makers.\n            Commune-based disease surveillance and training provided at\n            commune level require better monitoring to ensure the\n            quality and appropriateness of the training contents.\n            Flexibility is needed in responding to the evolving\n            epidemiological situation of HPAI at the national, regional,\n            and global level. As the HPAI epidemic continued at the same\n            time as control and prevention measures were being\n            developed, Vietnam had constantly to adjust its program\n            without losing the opportunity to develop its medium- to\n            long-term response capacity."}, "docdt": "2007-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
