The development\n            objectives of the proposed project are threefold in support\n            of the National Action Plan for the control of Avian\n            Influenza Epidemic: (a) to strengthen disease surveillance\n            and diagnostic capacity in the control of Highly Pathogenic\n            Avian Influenza (HPAI); (b) to strengthen the poultry sector\n            infrastructure to better cope with serious disease\n            outbreaks; and (c) to safeguard human health by improving\n            public awareness and information. The above objectives\n            should be viewed as the first phase of a longer-term program\n            aimed at restructuring Vietnam's poultry sub-sector and\n            strengthening the veterinary services system to deal with\n            other potentially destructive infectious disease outbreaks.\n            The proposed project would therefore serve as a pioneering\n            effort to evaluate the methodologies most suitable for\n            emergency preparedness and longer-term intervention."}, "docdt": "2004-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
