impacts of the project; 2)\n            adopt a series of protection measures so as to eliminate\n            or/and minimize the adverse environmental impacts during the\n            construction and operation periods; 3) establish the\n            environmental facilities and carry out environmental\n            monitoring as well as supervise the implementation of\n            protection measures; and 4) calculate the investment needed\n            for environmental protection.  The study analyzes the\n            impacts of the project on: forests, mineral resources,\n            wildlife and conservation areas, scenery and aesthetics and\n            farmland.  The study also discusses the impacts of the\n            environment on the transmission line such as: unfavorable\n            geological conditions, high elevations, heavy icing, air\n            pollution, and forest fires."}, "docdt": "1994-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
