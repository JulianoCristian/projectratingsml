      impact, and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and\n            Borrower. The Project substantially achieved its physical\n            and policy objectives albeit with some delays and\n            shortcomings.  Lessons learned in the area of project design\n            include: a) major sector reforms require a flexible approach\n            with performance indicators emphasizing satisfactory\n            progress in an agreed overall direction rather than acting\n            as detailed benchmarks that may turn out to be unrealistic;\n            b)  to minimize project implementation delays, especially\n            for critical components, it is important to secure financial\n            arrangements before Board presentation; and it would be\n            prudent to obtain written commitments from local financiers;\n            and c)  it is important to develop a detailed plan for\n            compensation at the time of appraisal, with evaluation of\n            unforeseen risks and provision for suitable cost escalation.\n            In the area of project implementation, lessons learned\n            included: a) while the Project demonstrated that it is\n            possible to construct high-voltage transmission networks in\n            mountainous areas at reasonable cost, procurement design\n            should carefully evaluate the capacity and capability of\n            local contractors as well as the interface of specifications\n            with foreign suppliers; and b) in evaluating the progress in\n            projects requiring substantive restructuring, the Bank\n            should periodically review the key indicators to determine\n            if they remain valid or need fine-tuning."}, "docdt": "2004-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
