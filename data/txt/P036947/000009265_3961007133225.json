"The Sichuan Power Transmission Project\n            will: (a) alleviate an acute shortage of electricity by the\n            construction of a 500-kV transmission network for connecting\n            the ongoing Ertan hydroelectric project to the Sichuan power\n            grid, as well as reinforcing the existing power transmission\n            system; (b) assist in designing and implementing a\n            time-bound program to implement power subsector reforms in\n            Sichuan Province; (c) support the implementation of further\n            power tariff rationalization; (d) promote transfer of\n            contemporary technologies for extra-high voltage\n            transmission networks; (e) strengthen institutional\n            capabilities for environmental management and operation\n            capabilities through well-focused staff training programs.\n            The project will include: (a) construction of an new 500-kV\n            transmission network; (b) carrying out of environmental\n            management and resettlement programs; (c) extension of\n            technical assistance for implementation of the State\n            Planning Commission's reform plan, organization\n            improvements, and development of accounting and financial\n            management systems; and (d) provision of engineering and\n            construction management services and training."}, "docdt": "1995-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
