Both World Bank and Borrower performances\n            were adjudged as satisfactory overall. The project was the\n            first stand alone dam safety project financed by the Bank,\n            and as such, the lessons emerging are of particular\n            interest. The main lesson is that in circumstances with new\n            ideas and institutions, realism is needed in design and\n            planning, and adequate time is required for implementation.\n            Either the preparation phase or the time allowed for the\n            implementation should have been different here. The project\n            and the processes used in this intensive learning ICR have\n            also highlighted a great many technical issues in design,\n            implementation, institutional development, and coordination.\n            These are as follows: Highly technical components, such as\n            flood forecasting using telemetry and risk analysis must be\n            thoroughly prepared before appraisal, using international\n            consultants. The supply and installation contract should\n            include an on-the-job training component. The project design\n            should include developing computer systems to analyze storm\n            data. Training for engineers in dam safety should be\n            institutionalized. Dam investments must be prioritized\n            according to appropriate risk analysis. Dam safety review\n            panels should be constituted to ensure quick and sensible\n            decisionmaking. Clearer rules of operation and an urgent\n            need for reviewing spillway capacities are among other issues."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
