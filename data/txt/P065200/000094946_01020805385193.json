Management of Protected\n            Areas in the Peruvian Amazon Project aims to increase the\n            sustainability of biodiversity conservation by involving\n            indigenous communities in the management of new and existing\n            protected areas. There are four project components. The\n            first 1) prepares planning documents and the consultative\n            process for creating one new protected area and the\n            permanent categorization of three existing reserved zones;\n            2) establishes protected area management committees; 3)\n            creates a community-based and -managed protected area\n            surveillance system; 4) trains indigenous community leaders\n            in participatory methods; 5) implements a public awareness\n            program; 6) builds and refurbishes facilities; 7) involves\n            local staff and specialists; and 8) finances office,\n            transportation, and communications equipment. The second\n            component prepares management plans for titled indigenous\n            land; technical studies and demand and market studies; and\n            provides biodiversity investment sub-grants. The third\n            component establishes a monitoring and evaluation unit at\n            the central level and zonal levels and contracts for an\n            analysis of the conservation and socioeconomic status of\n            project areas and baseline information; develops biological\n            and socio-economic databases and a geographical information\n            system; prepares monitoring plans; and trains staff and\n            local indigenous promoters."}, "docdt": "2001-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
