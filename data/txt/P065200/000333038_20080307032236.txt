F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The objective of the project is to increase the sustainability of biodiversity conservation
in the Peruvian Amazon through the involvement of Indigenous Communities in the
management of new and existing Protected Areas. This will be achieved by: (i)
establishing, categorizing and promoting the participatory indigenous management of
five protected areas; (ii) promoting economically, socially and environmentally
sustainable investments by indigenous grassroots organizations; (iii) developing and
implementing a participatory monitoring and evaluation system for the project areas and
the National Natural Protected Areas System (SINANPE) as a whole; and (iv)
strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of INRENA and indigenous
organizations to sustainably manage the protected areas and their resources. </>

  GEF Global Objective: the conservation and sustainable utilization of important forest
ecosystems in the Peruvian Amazon region through the establishment of protected areas
to be co-managed by indigenous people.

  This project supports Operational Programs 3 (Forests Ecosystems) and 2 (Freshwater
Ecosystems)

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The PDO was not modified, however, during the project#s midterm review indicators
were adjusted for the following reasons: In the case of the first indicator, the project had
developed additional instruments to enhance indigenous peoples# participation in the
comanagement of protected areas. The second indicator was adjusted because; (i) the
baseline database with socioeconomic and biodiversity indicators had not been completed
and the biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system was expected to be ready by the
end of the project; (ii) the lack of this baseline would limit the definition of specific
indicators that could measure the stopping of biodiversity loss; and (iii) the indicator on
biodiversity loss as stated had limitations in terms of measurability and attribution.
Therefore, the performance indicators were adjusted in the following manner to better
assess achievement of the development objective:

  (a) Indigenous people comanage protected areas: Indigenous participation in
comanagement will be assessed by their participation in the PAMC and in other
comanagement instruments created during the project, including communal reserves, and
surveillance committees, and by the number of indigenous populations using these
mechanisms.

  (b) Enhanced conservation of biodiversity: The project objective of improving the
conservation of forest ecosystems in the Peruvian Amazon will be measured by the
expansion of categorized and legally protected natural protected areas and the
establishment of conservation systems, as defined by the IUCN, for the protection of
zones with endangered and/or endemic species.



                                            iii

  (c) Positive environmental impacts from sustainable use of natural resources and related
activities: Improvement of the sustainable utilization of forest ecosystems would be
assessed by the environmental impacts of bioinvestment projects. Specific indicators
formulated for this purpose were: reduction in soil erosion, increase in carbon capture,
increase in hectares of reforestation, and repopulation of hydrobiological species.

  These indicators focus on the three main outcomes encompassed in the development
objective: (a) indigenous peoples# participation in the comanagement of protected areas:
(b) the sustainable use of forest ecosystems in the Peruvian Amazon; and (iii) the
conservation actions that will have a positive impact on the stability, size, and effective
protection of the biological richness of the natural protected areas under the project.
These indicators taken together permit a reliable assessment of whether the PDO was
satisfactorily achieved.

  Two additional GEO Indicators were addedd to reflect these changes.

1.       PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND
DESIGN

This GEF operation was designed to address crucial factors affecting conservation of the
Peruvian Amazon Region. It proposed a participatory conservation model to respond to
indigenous organizations' demands for participation in the management of protected areas in that
region. It also helped to strengthen the institutional framework for conservation and provided the
financial resources to establish the participatory model and institutionalize its tools, as explained
below.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

a. Country and Sector Background: At the time of project preparation, 1998­2001, Peru had
made important progress on environmental conservation, despite high poverty incidence and
institutional and political instability. During this period, a coherent policy framework for
biodiversity conservation and protected areas management was consolidated, including: the
Biodiversity Law; the Protected Areas Law and its bylaw; and the Master Plan for the National
System of Protected Areas (SINANPE). This was the result of continuous efforts, many of them
supported by the GEF and the World Bank, and some specifically intended to reverse the trend of
biodiversity loss of the Peruvian Amazon Region.

b. Institutional framework: Several crucial agencies for environment protection were
established at this time, such as: (i) the National Environmental Council (CONAM), a central
policy and coordinating agency and the national GEF focal point; (ii) the Peruvian Trust Fund for
National Parks and Protected Areas (PROFONANPE) in charge of administering and channeling
financial resources to the management of protected areas and buffer zones; and (iii) the
Directorate of Natural Protected Areas of the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA),
with the mandate of administering the country's National System of Protected Areas (SINANPE).

The creation of the Technical Secretariat of Indigenous Affairs, under the Ministry of Women
and Human Development, was an important step to enhance participation in development of
indigenous peoples. This Technical Secretariat led preparation of the Indigenous and
Afroperuvian Peoples Development (PDPIA) project aimed at strengthening their organizations;
the Interethnic Association for the Development for the Peruvian Amazon (AIDESEP) played an
important role.

Despite the progress achieved, Peru was spending less than US$50 in conservation per km2, of
protected area which represented 39% of Mexico's expenditures and only 12% of those of Brazil
and was highly dependent on external funding. Moreover, the newly created agencies needed
support to strengthen their capacities and gain skills to achieve their goals.

c. Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management: Conservation of protected
areas of the SINANPE at the time of project preparation was not fully operational. Of the five
National Protected Areas (NPAs) under the project only one, Pacaya-Samiria had been
established as a national reserve and had made progress in preparing conservation plans; El Sira
has been established as a communal reserve during project preparation but lacked a master plan;
three areas, Güeppi, Purus, and Santiago-Comaina, were "reserved zones," and needed
categorization and conservation plans. This situation created two major issues: (i) lack of legal




                                                      1

      ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



security for conservation purposes; and (ii) lack of secure land rights for communities within
those areas since it was not possible to issue land titles.

d. Indigenous Legal Framework: In 1994, Peru ratified the ILO Convention on Indigenous and
Tribal Peoples, establishing the GoP's commitment to protect the rights of indigenous peoples,
i.e., access to their land and control over natural resources. Further, in 2001 during consultations
carried out to approve the bylaw of the Natural Protected Areas Law, the GoP agreed to: (i)
respect community rights, including lands titled and rights acquired prior to the establishment of
NPAs; (ii) allow tenure regularization of community lands within protected areas and buffer
zones once an agreement on categorization was reached; (iii) acknowledge their values and
protect their cultural heritage and traditional productive systems; and (iv) encourage indigenous
organizations and community leaders to become members of the NPA Management Committees.
More importantly, the new regulations established a mandatory consultation process to define
categories in the Master Plan and allowed indigenous organizations to manage communal
reserves.

e. The Project in the CAS: The Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Amazon
GEF Project (PIMA) was in alignment with the Peru Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed on July 22, 1997 (16796-PE) and the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report of
March 20, 2001. The CAS was focused on increasing equality and improving the access of the
poor to development opportunities, increasing human capital, and integrating market
infrastructure and the full rights and opportunities of private ownership. The project fit in this
framework by promoting equal rights for indigenous people in the management of protected areas
and better use of natural resources to enhance their livelihoods.

f.   Consistency with GEF Strategy Priorities: Peru ranks among a handful of mega-biodiverse
countries in the world. The Peruvian Amazon Region in particular is one of the most important
repositories of biological diversity on the planet. The GEF was designed to contribute to the
establishment of a long-term protection strategy for globally important ecosystems consistent
with the overall GEF Operational Strategy; specifically, it supported Operational Programs 3
(Forest Ecosystems) and 2 (Freshwater Ecosystems.). The five target protected areas extend over
pristine forests housing many species of global importance and some that are threatened. The
project's conservation activities also targeted biodiversity of the Ucayali, Pachitea, Angusilla,
Purus, Curanja, Comaina, Cenepa, Santiago, and Marañón Rivers. The project was also consistent
with the GEF Strategic Priority 1: catalyzing the sustainability of protected area systems by
supporting the financing of INRENA and strengthening the capacity of indigenous peoples to
participate in the management of protected areas.

Within this context, a GEF operation was both timely and relevant to promote capacity building
and institutional development for the introduction of a participatory approach to conservation of
biodiversity protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon Region with the involvement of indigenous
communities.


1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as Approved)

The project-development objective at appraisal was:

  · To improve the conservation and sustainable utilization of forest ecosystems in the
       Peruvian Amazon through the involvement of indigenous communities in the management
       of Project Protected Areas.


                                                       2

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




The key indicators proposed to assess the achievement of the PDO were:

 ·    Indigenous people comanage protected areas in the five target zones through their
      participation in the corresponding Protected Areas Management Committees.
 ·    Biodiversity loss, as measured by monitoring indicators, is stopped in the five target areas.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by the original approving authority), and
       reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised; however, some adjustments were made to measure key indicators at
the Midterm Review as explained in section F above. The alternative indicators are the following:

(a) Indigenous people comanage protected areas: Indigenous participation in comanagement will
be assessed by their participation in the Protected Areas Management Committees and in other
comanagement instruments created during the project including, communal reserves and
surveillance committees as well as by the number of indigenous populations using these
mechanisms.

(b) Enhanced conservation of biodiversity: The project objective of improving the conservation
of forest ecosystem in the Peruvian Amazon will be measured by the expansion of the categorized
and legally protected natural protected areas and the establishment of conservation systems, as
defined by the IUCN, for the protection of zones with endangered and/or endemic species.

(c) Positive environmental impacts from sustainable use of natural resources and related
activities: Improvement of sustainable utilization of the forest ecosystems would be assessed by
the environmental impacts of the bioinvestment projects. Specific indicators formulated for this
purpose were: reduction in soil erosion, increase in carbon capture, increase in hectares of
reforestation, and repopulation of hydrobiological species

These indicators were incorporated in the project's Monitoring and Evaluation System to measure
progress towards its development goal. PIU Quarterly Reports and ISR in the Bank followed the
same structure.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised

The intended main beneficiaries were the indigenous communities within the five protected areas
under the project--Pacaya-Samiria, Santiago-Comaina, Purus, Güeppi, and El Sira--comprising
a total of 7,677,679 hectares equivalent to 6 percent of the Peruvian territory. The target
population mainly included the following indigenous peoples of the Amazon: Kukama,
Kukamiria (Pacaya-Samiria); Ashaninka, Yanesha, Shipibo-Conibo (El Sira); Cashinabua,
Sharanahua, Culina, Mastanahua, Amahuaca, Asháninka, Chaninahua, Yine (Purus); Awajun,
Huampis (Santiago-Comaina); Kichuas, Huitotos, Secoyas or Airo Pai (Güeppi). It was estimated
that the project will benefit 300 mostly indigenous communities and some mestizo communities,
comprising 120, 000 inhabitants. The National Natural Resources Institute (INRENA) would also
benefit because the project was designed to strengthen its technical and institutional capacity. The
project's beneficiaries remained the same until closing date.

1.5 Original Components (As Approved)

Component 1: Participatory Biodiversity Conservation (US$4.308 million, corresponding to
43.1% of GEF donation).

The objective of this component was to promote the participation of indigenous people in the
establishment, categorization, and management of the five protected areas identified by the
project. A key assumption in this component is that by increasing indigenous participation in the
management of protected areas, the effectiveness of conservation will be assured in the long term.
This component comprises the following subcomponents:

    1.1. Creation and Categorization of Protected Areas
    1.2. Strengthening Participatory Mechanisms
    1.3. Indigenous Peoples' Training in Participatory Mechanisms and Methods for Protected
          Areas Management
    1.4. Provision of Infrastructure and Equipment for Protected Areas
    1.5. Strengthening of Field Teams and Zone Coordination Committees


Component 2: Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity (US$3.112 million, corresponding to 31.1% of
GEF donation).

This component was designed to provide alternatives to the unsustainable use of resources within
the protected areas. Based on the assumption that economically and ecologically sound activities
in the buffer zone of protected areas will relieve pressure from the core area, this component
sought to identify and carry out activities aimed at increasing income based on the forest and
freshwater biodiversity. Thus, the project anticipated the following subcomponents:

    2.1   Management Plans for Titled Indigenous Land
    2.2   Communal Natural Resource Use Contract
    2.3   Demand and Market Studies
    2.4   Biodiversity Investments Subgrants

Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$1.283 million, corresponding to 12.8%
of GEF donation).

The objective was to design and implement a participatory monitoring and evaluation system for
the project areas. In addition, this system was expected to serve as the basis for the entire
National Natural Protected Areas System (SINANPE). This tool should be based on participatory
mechanisms and will be the key component to assess whether a significant biodiversity loss
occurred in the target areas. This component contains the following subcomponents:

    3.1   Biological and Socioeconomic Baselines and Databases
    3.2   Biological and Socioeconomic Monitoring
    3.3   Area Management Monitoring
    3.4   Training, Technical Assistance, and Operational Support

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




Component 4: Project Implementation (US$1.297 million, corresponding to 12.9% of GEF
donation).

This component was aimed at strengthening INRENA's institutional and technical capacity to
include indigenous peoples in the sustainable management of protected areas and their natural
resources. The subcomponents include:

    4.1   Project National Coordination Mechanisms
    4.2   Project Special Implementation Unit
    4.3   Technical Assistance
    4.4   Project Monitoring


1.6 Revised Components


Components were not revised during execution.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Implementation Arrangements: The project experienced five relevant changes that required an
adjustment of its strategy and activities to achieve the Project Development Objective:

  a. PDPIA Cancellation. The Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian Peoples Development Project
  2001­2004 (PDPIA) was a Bank-financed LIL project aimed at: strengthening indigenous and
  Afro-Peruvian communities and organizations. This loan comprised activities to complement
  project Components 1 (Participatory Biodiversity Conservation) and 2 (Sustainable Uses of
  Biodiversity) by financing the strengthening of the organizational capacity of the indigenous
  organizations involved in the management of the communal reserves proposed in two of the
  five areas under the GEF project: El Sira and Santiago-Comaina. However, PDPIA closed early
  in 2004 without satisfactorily achieving its Project Development Objective, thereby reducing
  the planned contribution from this source from US$5 million to only about US$1 million.

  b. Reduced Funds from "Other Sources". During the design phase, it was anticipated that
  US$3.603 million would be obtained from a variety of sources including: (i) other international
  aid agencies, (ii) nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and (iii) local and regional
  governments. These contributions did not materialize for several reasons: (i) because some
  agencies that participated in project preparation were not allowed under Bank rules to
  participate in implementation, they therefore withdrew their contributions; (ii) some NGOs
  reduced their anticipated contributions to conduct their activities separately while maintaining
  close coordination with project staff; and (iii) the changes in administration of some regional
  and local governments reduced their contributions to the project. This reduction was
  compensated with savings in implementation through changes in implementation arrangements,
  the contribution of the Peru-Canada Fund to finance bioinvestment projects, and additional
  resources from the GoP.

  c. Project Institutional Rearrangements. To respond to the reduction in anticipated funds
  and to better address the lack of institutional capacity of community organizations and
  administrative limitations in INRENA, the implementation strategy and planned activities were
  rearranged in the following ways:



                                                      5

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




          Decentralization: The original plan of hiring a single firm in Lima to be in charge of
          executing Component 2 (Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity) was rejected because either
          the participants did not comply with the required capacity or proposals were far more
          costly than expected. Therefore, the decision was to decentralize technical assistance to
          each protected area. This alternative reduced overhead and traveling costs, and made it
          possible to use local services and consultants, thus facilitating consultation and
          technical assistance to community organizations for the execution of bioinvestment
          projects.

          External Administration: With the purpose of circumventing bureaucratic processing
          and of supplementing experience, INRENA signed an agreement with PROFONANPE
          to act as its administrative partner in charge of handling the project's funds, contracts,
          and acquisitions. This partnership allowed the central project team to focus on major
          project activities, thus delegating more functions to local project teams. This agreement
          contributed to a more efficient use of funds.


          Local partnerships: Construction in remote areas of the Amazon proved to be difficult
          and expensive to execute through national commercial firms. The alternative to build
          planned infrastructure in partnership with local communities resulted in significant
          savings, enhanced ownership, and contributed to improve relationships with local
          communities that benefited from these works.

These actions allowed the implementing agency to overcome the shortcomings posed by the
reduction in anticipated funds, and contributed to building local capacity and empowering local
communities that played a more active role in project execution.

d. Change in denomination of GEF Trust Fund: The grant change from SDR to US dollars
instructed by GEF took a year to be ratified by the GoP(between 2003-2004) because of the
changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the change was ratified on December 28th, 2004. This
delay affected the flow in disbursement of funds.

e. Extension of closing date: The Bank granted the project a closing date extension from
December 31, 2006 to May 31, 2007, to allow a full disbursement of the GEF grant. A progress
review carried out at the end of September 2006 indicated that most project activities would be
completed before the closing date. However, the execution of community subprojects and the
construction of the community surveillance centers were experiencing some delays. By granting
the extension, the communities fulfilled activities that represented a small amount of the grant but
were critical for their goals and self-esteem. By the closing date of May 31, all these activities
with the exception of one project have been completed and their goals had been achieved; all
grant resources were disbursed by the end of the grace period on September 30, 2007.

2.      KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND
OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

The Fourth Quality at Entry Assessment (April 2001) rated the overall quality at entry as
satisfactory based on the following factors:

a. Consistency. The project was properly aligned with the development stage and needs of the
Peruvian environmental sector. Its objectives and strategy were fully consistent with the 1997
CAS objectives; the defined activities were consistent with ongoing and planned projects in the
country, thus achieving synergies. It also responded to GEF priorities.

b. Soundness of the background analysis. The project design built on technical studies and a
consultation process funded by the GEF Project Preparation and Development Facility (PDF)
Block B grant comprising: (i) biological diagnoses for the five protected areas; (ii) a
comprehensive social assessment including a public consultation based on field surveys,
workshops, and field reconnaissance. These studies contributed to ratification of the choice of
protected areas in terms of their biodiversity conservation and social feasibility.

c. Participatory Design. The PDF Block B grant financed a broad consultative and
participatory process that included representatives from INRENA and the Ministry of Women
and Human Development. The two major Amazonian indigenous federations (Interethnic
Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest­AIDESEP and the National
Amazonian Confederation of Peru­CONAP) participated actively. Regional and local indigenous
organizations, as well as national and local NGOs, also contributed to project design. The process
helped to gain more precision concerning protected area coverage, timing, local actors, and
interested parties with regard to final categorization, resulting in the selection of target areas for
project implementation. The project also established a Steering Committee comprising the
indigenous federations AIDESP and CONAP, national and international NGOs, as well as
representatives of key government agencies.

Although this ICR recognized these positive features, with hindsight it identifies the following
areas in which further anticipation and discussion at entry point could have facilitated project
implementation and further contributed to the project's success:

        The scope and complexity of the project proved to be a real challenge for INRENA
        which was experimenting with a new conservation paradigm based on participation.
        Although a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was created to address this issue, it was
        difficult to reconcile long-established practices in INRENA with the proposed PIU's
        assigned functions. This issue was overcome by incorporating specialized staff in the PIU,
        and by Bank support through an institutional specialist and overall technical assistance
        during implementation.

        Indigenous organizations consulted during preparation expressed their desire to ensure
        forest integrity and their willingness to participate in its conservation. However, this goal
        was sometimes perceived as being opposed to their rights over ancestral land, particularly
        with regard to the concept of indigenous territory, which is not a legally recognized
        concept in Peru and could not be resolved under the scope of the project. The
        establishment of communal reserves helped to address this issue.

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




         It was indeed difficult to find the right mix of technical and social capacity to carry out
         key studies; this difficulty delayed project implementation. This was particularly the case
         of categorization, preparation of the biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system, hard
         to measure project indicators, staffing of the PIU, as with the centralized approach
         envisioned at the outset.

         During preparation, the lack of counterparts fund was identified as a risk; however,
         mitigation measures were not enough to address this issue, which in fact caused delays
         during implementation.
Therefore, this ICR rates quality at entry as moderately satisfactory for the above-explained
reasons.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation suffered during the first two years due to various external factors and
other influences that could not have been fully anticipated or that lacked adequate mitigation
measures in the design phase.

a. Disagreements with national indigenous organizations: Project implementation had to
address indigenous organizations' claims about the following matters: (i) categorizing protected
areas; (ii) land rights; and (iii) involvement in project management. The PIU with the support of
the IANP, and in some cases of the Bank, engaged in intensive negotiations to respond to this
claims within the legal and institutional frameworks of the project.

         Categorization: Categorization of the reserved zones was strongly influenced by
         demands for land rights and control over natural resources. A process of continued
         negotiations headed by the Director of the PIU and a proactive role by the Bank as a
         mediator helped to finalize categorization successfully in the three reserved zones in the
         project. Where it was not possible to reach an agreement, the area remained as a
         "reserved zone," as in the case of the proposed communal reserve of Santiago Comaina
         (Cordillera Campankis).

         Land rights: AIDESEP also championed the claims for indigenous territory, a concept
         not recognized under Peruvian legislation. The Peruvian ombudsman (Defensoría del
         Pueblo) was invited to facilitate negotiations between AIDESEP and the IANP about
         these issues; the Bank team also participated and offered several solutions. An agreement
         was reached on a roadmap for negotiation; and while it was not fully applied, it kept the
         conflict from escalating.

         Participation in project management: AIDESEP stopped participating in the Steering
         Committee, and asked to: (i) stop the project and transfer it to INDEPA, and (ii)
         introduce project management mechanisms that were not foreseen in the agreement with
         the Peruvian Government. Because these demands could not be met, the Bank team
         offered instead to: (i) reinitiate community consultations to reach agreements on the
         categorization process; (ii) increase the decision-making power of indigenous
         organizations by setting up an Indigenous Unit that would operate separate from the
         Steering Committee; and (iii) carry out actions to speed the titling of communal lands.
         Although an agreement was reached about these issues, it was put on hold due to changes
         in AIDESEP's leadership. This position was not embraced by other regional and local



                                                      8

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



         organizations that continued to support the project. CONAP, the other national
         indigenous federation, also maintained its support and contributed its own evaluation of
         the project. The Bank and the PIU maintained informal dialogue with AIDESEP and
         respected its leadership.

b. Institutional capacity. From the start it was difficult to staff the PIU. The institutional
assessment carried out at the midterm evaluation showed that key staff in the PIU, such as the
environmental and social specialists, lacked sufficient experience to implement the project's
activities. Therefore, with IANP's endorsement of this assessment, most of the PIU's staff was
replaced. With a capable new director at the helm of the PIU, a new team in place, and
implementation agreements reached at midterm, project execution gained pace and disbursement
that had been lagging in previous years increased.

c. Institutional instability. The design and implementation phases of PIMA coincided with the
changes in national administrations. This is an unusual turnover rate for projects of this type.
During project preparation, the project faced the sudden end of the Fujimori administration and
had to begin dialogue with President Paniagua's transition government. Implementation was
mostly carried out under President Toledo and was completed under President Alan Garcia's
administration. By the time the project ended, INRENA had had four changes of General Chiefs
and Protected Areas Managers. Moreover, two of the protected areas are on the country's borders:
one with Ecuador and the other with Colombia. Therefore, the Ministry of External Affairs was
involved in the clearance process for categorization and in the endorsement of the grant
agreement. This instability complicated negotiations with indigenous organizations, in particular
for categorizing the three "reserved zones1."

d. Difficulties in institutional coordination. The involvement of PROFONANPE as project
administrator sped up grant processing but also brought new challenges in defining working
procedures with the PIU and the IANP. It took a while to reach a common understanding in order
to make the system flow. PROFONANPE proved to be a responsible administrator that followed
Bank procedures and helped to maintain quality standards. However, this arrangement was not
sufficient to overcome long-established cumbersome public administration procedures; for
instance in contracting auditors, a process that--despite many efforts--always experienced
delays.

e. Lack of counterpart funds. During the first two years of implementation, the GoP did not
allocate sufficient counterpart funds thus causing delays in execution. Counterpart funds were
later obtained from the Peru-Canada Fund and from savings in the payments of regional taxes that
were returned to the project; this process secured funds but required annual ratifications. At the
end of the project, with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, the project accessed budget
resources to pay for staff and operations in NPA.

f.  Violence in target sites. Organized bands dealing with illegal mahogany logging affected the
execution of activities in some areas of Pacaya-Samiria, Purús, and Güeppí. Unarmed park
rangers were outnumbered by armed gangs. This threat brought a certain degree of insecurity
among local project personnel and community surveillance groups. It took a while for the local

teams and the IANP to recover the communities' trust and for law enforcement to restore order
and reinitiate project activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

a. Biodiversity M&E. The Monitoring and Evaluation activities under Component 3 aimed to
assess how project intervention would influence biodiversity conservation in the target sites. The
design included environmental and social indicators, incorporating traditional knowledge of local
communities that participated actively in design and preparation. The delays in categorization, the
difficulties in contracting a suitable firm, and the initial lack of counterpart resources affected the
establishment of the M&E System in the five areas. However, the process was completed for
Pacaya-Samiria, and Güeppi, including a baseline study, biodiversity and social indicators, as
well as a first monitoring report for each one of these areas. The designed electronic program was
established in INRENA and staff received training to manage its consolidation and expansion.

b. Project M&E System. In accordance with project design, the Monitoring and Evaluation
System would measure progress in implementation using the project's logical framework matrix
and its performance indicators by component and activities. As explained before, the project's
outcome indicators were adjusted at MTR. The project was using several mechanisms to monitor
progress in activities and outputs: (i) annual operating plans with detailed landmarks and
timetables; (ii) progress reports that were regularly presented at Steering Committee meetings to
monitor performance; and (iii) regional meetings with local beneficiaries to check the progress of
activities under Component 2 (Sustainable Use of Biodiversity). At the time of the MTR, these
evaluation processes were formalized including the use of the revised indicators; a full time
specialist was hired to manage it. Quarterly reports were produced ever since to track project
progress and to update ISR. At the end of the project, the PIU prepared its evaluation report,
using the above-mentioned indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with World Bank safeguard policies as identified in the PAD: (i) OP 4.04
Natural Habitats, (ii) OP 4.36 Forestry, (iii) OPN 11.03 Cultural Property, and (iv) OP 4.20
Indigenous Peoples (since the project was prepared before this policy changed to OP 4.10.

a. Environmental safeguards: The project was designed to improve biodiversity conservation
and sustainable use of forest resources in five biologically sensitive areas. The technical studies
prepared to select these NPA helped to identify their biodiversity wealth and established their
importance for global conservation purposes.

Natural Habitats and Forestry: Compliance with these policies was ensured through preparation
of Master Plans and Management Plans for the five NPA under the project. The project also
established two national parks and two communal reserves under IUCN Protection II and VI,
respectively.

Proposed activities based on natural resource use were carefully designed to avoid resource
depletion and negative impacts. Component 3 (Monitoring and Evaluation System) was intended
to support this effort by identifying social and biodiversity indicators to measure progress in
conservation.

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



b. Social safeguards: The project's core strategy was to incorporate indigenous people in the
establishment and management of five new protected areas, following a participatory approach
under the principle of informed decision making.

Indigenous peoples: The project's design took into account safeguard previsions for indigenous
peoples as indicated in OP 4.20, which was in place at the time of project design. A social
assessment was carried out to identify the principal socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds of
indigenous peoples and an extensive consultation was carried out. Because the overwhelming
majority of beneficiaries were indigenous, no separate Indigenous Peoples Plan was prepared;
instead, the entire project design took into account this fact. The principle of free, prior, and
informed consultation was maintained throughout implementation. Indigenous peoples actively
participated in all activities under the project.

Cultural assets: The project incorporated into its design the protection of cultural assets as part of
the respect for the rights of the indigenous population. In the case of the Amazon, cultural assets
and sacred sites usually coincide with areas of biodiversity wealth, water catchments, and other
natural resources vital to survival in the rainforest. These resources were thus protected in
conservation planning. A multicultural perspective was also incorporated to bring traditional
knowledge and indigenous' perspectives into the conservation and sustainable use of natural
resources.

c. Fiduciary Compliance: The project complied with fiduciary regulations as shown by
semiannual audit reports. The IANP complied with all recommendations resulting from the
Bank's audit review. However, due to procedures established by the National Office of the
Comptroller (Contraloría) to select auditors, the submission of these reports was usually
completed after the established date of June 30. For the final audit, it was agreed to present a
single audit comprising the periods of January 1 to December 31, 2007 and the extension period
from January 1 to May 31, 2007. The audits delays, although not directly linked to the executing
agency, were a constant source of concern during implementation. The expertise brought by
PROFONANPE, thanks to its involvement with other GEF projects, was an important factor in
satisfactorily achieving this compliance.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

The IANP prepared a sustainability program comprising three steps: (a) arrangements to ensure
that the project continues to operate after completion and maintains its achieved goals; (b) a
program to consolidate the participatory conservation model, extending it to other protected areas
in the Amazon; and (c) preparation of a second operation focused on communal reserves.

a. Continuation: These arrangements are to ensure that all project goals are supported so that
their intended outcomes can be achieved; they comprise: (i) budget provision to complement
actions carried out under the project such as equipment of facilities, and assistance to communal
reserves by supporting their management contracts; (ii) budget to ensure continuity of NPA staff
and resources for their operation; (iii) agreements with international NGOs and environmental
organizations for community-based subprojects to continue and expand; and (iv) provision of
technical assistance to local staff and communities so that they can have access to grants from
donors and regional and municipal financing.

b. Consolidation Program: This program is expected to be carried out over a period of one and
a half years from the closing of this project at an estimated cost of US$1.5 million, with the
following objectives:


                                                    11

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




        Disseminate lessons learned and project results among grassroots organizations, NGOs,
        and governmental levels (national, regional, and local) involved in the management of
        protected areas.
        Reinforce IANP's capacity to implement the participatory model for comanaging
        protected areas and institutionalize this approach in the SINANPE.
        Consolidate public-private partnerships that can boost the application of the participatory
        conservation model to attract financial resources to support indigenous comanagement of
        these protected areas.

c. Follow up: INRENA has indicated its intention to seek financing for building on the positive
outcomes of PIMA, specifically for the consolidation and expansion of communal reserves. In
addition, INRENA proposes to access funding to institutionalize the comanagement model
through: (i) dissemination of lessons learned on participatory conservation and rural
development; (ii) training and sharing of experiences of INRENA staff and other public officials,
community leaders, and social and environmental experts; and (iii) preparation of a participation
program to support the SINANPE.

3.      ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objective, Design, and Implementation

The protection of the Amazonian ecosystems remains a priority objective of Peru's environmental
agenda to preserve its biodiversity richness and to protect the habitat of many of its indigenous
populations. The conservation of its natural patrimony is also deemed critical to mitigate the
threats generated by global climate change. Reduction of the deforestation rate and restoration of
the forest landscape are two of Peru's commitments under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. Support for these commitments is reflected in the current
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Republic of Peru (2007­2011). The CPS also
maintains the priorities of preserving biodiversity and reducing the deforestation rate. Although it
does not focus explicitly on indigenous issues, it remains committed to meeting the basic needs of
the excluded rural population.

The project's main design feature has been the introduction of a comanagement system based on
stakeholders' participation in the conservation of protected areas. INRENA is committed to
consolidating and expanding the Participatory Conservation Model that the project has generated,
mainly to the other protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon.

The main features of the participatory model developed under the project include: (i) a
participatory monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system; (ii) the establishment of communal
reserves to be managed by indigenous organizations under management contracts; (iii)
preparation of Master Plans using participatory methods; (iv) the execution of bioinvestment
projects directly by community organizations; and (iv) the establishment and official recognition
of community surveillance groups for the sustainable use and conservation of ecosystems.
INRENA has already prepared a program to replicate the model in other areas, focusing on
communal reserves with a mix of public funds and contributions from international donors.
Moreover, INRENA plans to continue working on the development of tools and institutional
arrangements to consolidate the comanagement of protected areas. This approach also provides
an opportunity to contribute to improving living conditions of the indigenous and poor rural
populations in protected areas. Therefore, the PIMA project was and continues to be highly
relevant to GoP's objectives and the Bank's strategy for Peru.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

The achievement of the overall objective is rated Satisfactory. The GEF completed the majority
of its activities and succeeded in improving the conservation and sustainable use of forest
ecosystems in the Peruvian Amazon through the involvement of indigenous communities in the
management of new and existing protected areas.

As previously mentioned, the original outcome indicators for measuring achievement of the PDO
were limited in terms of their measurability, and in the case of biodiversity conservation there
were limitations in terms of realism and attribution. However, there is sufficient evidence that the
project's overall global objective has been achieved, as explained below.

a. Indigenous people comanage protected areas: As a result of the project, 120,000
indigenous and local populations and other stakeholders in the five protected areas are
participating in the comanagement of protected areas through the following mechanisms and
activities:

Establishment of Participatory Mechanisms:

         Protected Areas Management Committees (PAMC): PAMC are consultative groups that
         provide advice on the management of protected areas. These PAMC have been
         established in each of the five target areas and include representatives of all indigenous
         organizations under their jurisdiction.

         Communal Reserves: Indigenous communities organized as Contract Executors
         (Ejecutores de Contrato de Administración, ECA) manage communal reserves through
         administration contracts with INRENA, in which they commit to apply Master Plan
         guidelines for the sustainable use of natural resources. ECOSIRA, the ECA created to
         manage El Sira Communal Reserve (CR), has signed this contract and is presently
         executing it. This CR comprises 616,413.41 hectares and has around 13,000 indigenous
         people. ECOPURUS, established to manage the CR Purus, has prepared its Master Plan
         and signed the administration contract. Purus CR comprises 210,033 ha and 1,000
         indigenous peoples who are the direct beneficiaries.

         Natural resources management contracts: Through these contracts indigenous
         communities can sign formal agreements with INRENA to use natural resources in a
         small-scale, sustainable manner and receive technical assistance. By the time the project
         ended, 50 local groups had signed such contracts and were operating in the Pacaya-
         Samiria National Reserve (PSNR) to ensure its sustainable management.

         Community surveillance systems: Five community surveillance systems have been
         established; one in each one of NPA in the project, giving indigenous peoples the
         capacity to oversee illegal activities in those areas. INRENA has officially recognized the
         authority of these groups and has provided them with an official ID.

Skills and Experience for Participation Developed

         Participation in categorization and planning: Through extensive consultation with
         indigenous communities and often difficult negotiations, the project categorized three
         reserved areas: Güeppi, Santiago-Comaina, and Purus, comprising 3.5 million hectares
         that now have legal protection for conservation. This process also allowed land titles to


                                                    13

    ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



        be issued to communities within their boundaries and buffer zones, a constant request by
        indigenous peoples. Master Plans for communal reserves and national parks were all
        planned through consultation, taking into account the traditions, cultural background, and
        priorities of indigenous peoples.

        Strengthening Indigenous Organizations' Capacity: To construct a positive negotiation
        environment, the project put in place mechanisms to strengthen indigenous participatory
        capacity: (i) 107 internships for communal leaders to travel and evaluate the experience
        of indigenous people with other protected areas (Manu National Park and Pacaya-Samiria
        National Reserve), and (ii) 5 public awareness campaigns to increase support for
        environmental issues.


        Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation System: Indigenous populations were actively
        involved in the design of the Participatory M&E System to measure biodiversity
        conservation that was developed in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve. This helped to
        build into the system their priorities and demands for the management of these protected
        areas. The process comprised: (i) workshops with the local population to identify and
        select social and biological indicators; (ii) establishment of monitoring patrols carried out
        with the assistance of local people, which created positive interaction between the
        project's field staff and local indigenous groups; and (iii) consultation to validate the
        system.


        Project Management: The two national federations of indigenous organizations of the
        Amazon participated in the Steering Committee. Two indigenous professionals appointed
        by these federations acted as their liaisons and as advisors to the director of PUMA in the
        PIU. Indigenous promoters who spoke the local languages worked in the field. Three
        NPA directors and some of their technical staff were also indigenous, which facilitated
        the building of mutual trust.


b. Enhanced Conservation: As a result of the project the National System of Protected Areas
has expanded as follows: (i) categorization of three reserved areas: Güeppi, Santiago-Comaina,
and Purus; (ii) the creation of the two national parks: Alto Purus and Cordillera del Condor,
which added 2.6 million hectares under IUCN Category II to SINANPE; and (iii) the creation of
three communal reserves: Purus, El Sira, and Tuntanait, which added 0.9 million hectares
protected under IUCN Category VI. In Güeppi, one national park and two communal reserves
have been proposed and are awaiting final approval by the GoP. This will expand SINANPE by
an additional 0.6 million hectares, 34% under IUCN Category II and the rest to IUCN Category
VI.

Moreover, as result of these categorizations three biodiversity priority zones in the SINANPE
now have full protection: Zone 20­El Sira Mountain Chain, Zone 28­Alto Purus, and Zone 2­
Cordillera del Condor including over 400 endemic species and at least 3 species in danger of
extinction. For example, the El Sira and Purus communal reserves and the Alto Purus National
Park host endemic species of birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, bears, and mammals. These
protected areas also include at least 11 types of forests and hotspots of tropical Andean
biodiversity.

Conservation efforts comprised five categorization processes and preparation of 15 planning
documents: master plans, resource management plan, research plan, diagnostic plan, zoning plan
and monitoring and evaluation plans; the sustainable use of natural resources was promoted
through 14 management plans for titled indigenous land; one resource-use contract; 50 resource-
use agreements; and 15 minor activity-use grants. In addition, the participatory M&E System was
established, comprising: 5 compendiums of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic
conditions; evaluation protocols and standards; and five biological databases with GIS layers
included. The M&E system for Pacaya-Samiria and Güeppi was completed, including software
package, baseline studies, and annual reports on monitoring of biological and socioeconomic
indicators. Annual reports on monitoring of area management effectiveness were prepared for the
five areas under the project. All these activities included training and technical assistance to
beneficiaries and project staff.

c. Sustainable use of natural resources: The sustainable use of natural resources has had a
positive impact on conservation as proved by preliminary results from the 43 investment
interventions in 200 communities comprising 8,258 direct beneficiaries. The 22 forestry-related
projects for reforestation and forest management are having a positive effect on reducing soil
erosion and carbon capture. According to project estimates, an annual reduction in soil erosion of
34,465 tons and an increasing carbon capture of 2,969 tons will be achieved as a result of these
projects; 1,273 hectares were reforested and the deforestation of 18,664 hectares was prevented.
In addition, the 20 hydrobiological resource projects have prevented unsustainable extraction
from 775 hectares of surface waters and contributed over 100% to repopulation of species;
beneficiaries in the 200 indigenous communities involved have learned and implemented
different conservation practices such as forest management, expansion of hydrobiological
resources, and ecofriendly agriculture. Some of these practices are very likely to be replicated due




                                                    15

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



to their positive economic benefits, and would prevent the local population from overexploiting
other natural resources.

To implement the biodiversity investment projects, 220 preinvestment studies were carried out,
including 87 market plans and technical assistance through direct visits and workshops for the
200 communities; moreover, three regional workshops were carried out to analyze best practices
and lessons learned from these experiences.

In addition to abovementioned outcomes, INRENA has increased its capacity to comply with its
mandate of conducting the sustainable conservation of natural resources. INRENA now has legal
tools and operational mechanisms to promote comanagement of protected areas with the
participation of the indigenous population, such as PAMC established in the five protected areas
and the Special Regime for the Administration of Communal Reserves which can be considered
an intercultural product because it allows indigenous organizations to manage communal reserves
located on traditional indigenous lands under the SINANPE. Moreover, the IANP has gained
experience by directly engaging in discussions about conservation with indigenous organizations
at various levels and adopting the participatory conservation model.

                                Participatory Conservation Model


        A participatory and intercultural design of legal instruments, protocols, and institutional
        arrangements that allow indigenous peoples to participate in the categorization of NPA,
        conservation plans, and natural resource management plans;

        Institutional strengthening of indigenous communities and grassroots organizations
        through training, technical assistance, sharing of experiences, and scholarships for
        selected indigenous leaders;

        The development of a social network at the local level including: community promoters,
        local surveillance groups, resource management units, and contract execution units for
        the communal reserves;

        The design and implementation of community-based productive subprojects identified,
        prioritized, and executed by the communities according to their skills and experience
        (pertinent projects);

        The establishment of communal reserves, taking into account the culture and traditions of
        indigenous organizations; and

        Preparation of Master Plans and Management Plans from the perspective of indigenous
        peoples, taking into account their priorities for conservation and natural resources
        management.


3.3 Efficiency

The economic analysis conducted suggests that the PIMA project has generated positive
economic impacts without incurring high cost on the conservation of natural resources of the
target areas and to the lives of the local indigenous groups who play an important role in the
conservation of those protected areas. The total cost of the project was US$15.8 million (S/. 50.56

implementation. These adjustments offset the reduction in anticipated co-financing during the

project implementation (See Section 6.7). However, through implementation re-arrangements set
up during and after the MTR it was possible to achieve the PDO with cost-savings.

Pertaining to the sustainable production grants, the cost of the total investment was S/ 3.99
millions while the benefits were multifold, as can be seen in Table 13.

In terms of profitability of the sustainable production activities, it was not possible to obtain
enough data for a formal economic analysis. However, the NPV and IRR of two sample sub-
projects show that those sub-projects are economically viable. The NPV of reforestation of
Shebon palm after 20 years would be $56,469.67 and the IRR is 15%. The NPV of agroforestry
systems at 20 years would be $367,201.53 and the IRR is 30%; other successful sub-projects
show the potential of increasing production. These investment grants proved to be a positive
financial incentive to involve indigenous peoples in the comanagement of the protected areas and
to reduce pressures on their natural resources.

The scope of this economic analysis is constrained for several reasons: (i) incremental costs were
used instead of NPV or ERR at project appraisal; (ii) no adequate economic data were collectable
for Components 1 and 3, thus making it difficult to obtain the project's full benefits; (iii) only two
sustainable production subprojects could provide sufficient data for a formal cost-benefit
analysis; (iv) the full benefits of the sustainable production activities could not be measured
because the activities started only toward the end of the project; and (v) the economic benefits of
the sustainable production activities were mostly for self-consumption. Annex 3 provides further
details on the analysis.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcomes Rating

This ICR rates the overall outcomes as Satisfactory.

The project satisfactorily achieved its development objective and most of its anticipated outputs.
The project was and remains relevant for strengthening sustainable biodiversity conservation
efforts in Peru by consolidating the SINANPE and involving indigenous participation in its
comanagement. The project institutionalized indigenous participation by introducing an
indigenous perspective on conservation processes: categorization, development of conservation



                                                    17

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



planning tools, and mechanisms for the comanagement of protected areas. The project contributed
to improved sustainable conservation by expanding the SINANPE; providing legal protection to
endangered and endemic species in biodiversity hot spots and introducing sustainable
development practices with positive effects on the environment. Finally, both INRENA and
indigenous communities have enhanced their capacity to carry out comanagement of protected
areas. The experience gained by the project can serve as a basis to incorporate indigenous
participation in other protected areas within the Peruvian Amazon and other protected areas in the
country. The model can also be expanded to other GoP agencies working on rural development
and involving indigenous peoples. Moreover, all these outcomes were achieved efficiently at low
cost for the conservation of natural resources of the target areas and for the livelihoods of the
local indigenous groups.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts


Poverty alleviation: The project did not directly intend to achieve this goal. However, through
the execution of sustainable biodiversity projects involving 200 communities, the project
generated jobs and incomes that would not have been created without the project, directly
benefiting 1,757 families and 8,258 people in the five target areas. These projects also helped to
improve family nutrition, food security, and the integration of communities in existing market
chains, such as those for organic coffee, fish, medicinal plants, and timber. According to the
efficiency assessment, the expected income to be generated from these activities in the first year
after project implementation is US$550,000.

Gender Issues: Within the limits established by indigenous culture, the project promoted
affirmative actions to increase women's empowerment by encouraging women's participation in
project committees, facilitating their attendance at training sessions, and promoting a more
equitable gender composition within indigenous grassroots organizations. The project promoted
processes to overcome indigenous women's difficulties in reading and speaking Spanish. In the
case of productive activities, the project promoted gender equity in participation; as a result,
many women occupied treasurers' positions because they were acknowledged to have exceptional
talent for handling and controlling the funds received.

Institutional Development: The project has introduced new institutional arrangements for
participatory biodiversity conservation in Peru through the establishment of the abovementioned
Participatory Conservation Model which developed indigenous communities' skills and
INRENA's institutional capacity.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Surveys and/or Stakeholder Workshops


Beneficiary surveys: Four such surveys were conducted in four of the target sites during the last
quarter of 2006. These surveys were intended to systematize the project's lessons learned
regarding the participatory model and project execution in general. The surveys comprised a total
of 177 persons: about 140 (79%) were project beneficiaries and the rest were other stakeholders
including members of grassroots organizations, local and regional authorities, and NGO experts.
Overall, the surveys showed positive judgment on implemented strategies and results.
Beneficiaries confirmed the positive effect of project tools on biodiversity conservation:
encouraging local participation, training, strengthening community organization, and providing
ecologically sound alternatives to the inadequate use of natural resources.
Stakeholders' workshops: Three workshops were held: one each in Pacaya-Samiria and Güeppi
(December 2006) and a third in El Sira (March 2007). These workshops brought together
representatives of beneficiaries, their grassroots organizations, local and regional authorities,


                                                    18

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



social researchers, and NGOs linked to target areas. Most of the participants were also members
of their respective Protected Area Management Committees. These workshops aimed at assessing
project results, impacts and lessons learned; 48 persons attended the Pacaya-Samiria workshop;
38 in Güeppi; and 43 in El Sira. In Pacaya-Samiria, the workshop highlighted the benefits of a
State-civil society partnership, particularly with local communities. It highlighted the fact that
Communal Surveillance Systems are an adequate tool to improve biodiversity conservation. In
Güeppi it was pointed out that the inclusion of indigenous peoples' perspectives in the
categorization of protected areas, although a time-consuming process, produces better results
because it creates solid constituencies for the Protected Areas. In the case of El Sira, the
participants emphasized that conservation of natural resources is a priority for local communities
in the Communal Reserve. Participants also pointed out that a transparent flow of information
from project staff to the communities is an effective way to build mutual trust.

4.       ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

The social and institutional endorsement by INRENA and indigenous communities and the legal
and institutional tools developed under the projects are the main legal, social, and financial basis
to ensure the benefits of the PDO:

              Legal framework: The GoP has approved the Special Regime of Communal
              Reserves, comprising institutional arrangements, regulations, and protocols for
              indigenous communities to manage communal reserves. This is an alternative to
              promote conservation, acceptable to both the indigenous organizations and
              INRENA;

              Social endorsement: The project has been able to build a wide social base among
              indigenous communities and their grassroots and regional organizations that support
              its continuation and expansion; The establishment of ECOSIRA and ECOPURUS
              and the signing of their management contracts are concrete outcomes that have
              gained overall endorsement by indigenous leaders and national and international
              NGOs;

              Financial security: The IANP has succeeded in procuring financial resources from
              government sources to consolidate the accomplished results. These resources will
              cover basic staff and recurring costs in the project's five targeted protected areas and
              will consolidate productive projects. Several international NGOs are contributing to
              the continued execution of community-based subprojects.

However, the rating is moderate because the model requires further support to be fully
institutionalized. INRENA, community organizations, and other institutions involved in
comanagement require additional institutional strengthening and resources. It may also be
difficult for the GoP to commit the necessary budget to consolidate, and expand the model. Yet,
the most important challenge is to balance the interest of conservation against the strong
economic incentives for mining and oil exploitation in the Amazon.

5.      ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project
was moderately satisfactory. Project design and preparation comprised an intensive consultation
process with the indigenous population and other stakeholders. Preparation took into account
CAS and GEF priorities and ensured compliance with safeguard policies. The Bank offered
timely support to INRENA to meet minimum institutional arrangements for project execution.
However, the lack of an institutional assessment during project preparation, limited mitigation
measures to overcome identified risks, and design flaws in monitoring and evaluation
arrangements caused difficulties in project implementation and supervision. Although the risks
were rightly identified, their impacts were not fully assessed in the following cases: (i) indigenous
peoples' perspective about land rights which caused delays in categorization; and (ii) the creation
of a PIU, which was adequate to supplement INRENA but insufficient to overcome long-
established public sector practices. Monitoring and evaluation based on difficult to measure
indicators, generated problems in tracking achievement of development objective.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision during project implementation was conducted mainly by the project team in
Washington with the support of the field team in Lima. INRENA, the executing agency, had little
experience working with the Bank; therefore, close monitoring and assistance were necessary.
However, the changes in TTL (three times) caused some lags in supervision during the transition
periods. During the first two years supervision focused on solving institutional issues and
contractual processing, including the establishment and staffing of the PIU, the contracting of
consulting firms to conduct categorization, the preparation of the biodiversity M&E system, and
the search for a firm to oversee execution of Component 2. During this phase the Bank also had
to address INRENA's lack of experience in managing a GEF operation and promoted the
involvement of PROFONANPE to supplement this capacity. It also promoted institutional
changes that encouraged the Steering Committee to replace the Executive Director.

The Midterm Review mission (MTR) carried out between November 29 and December 10, 2004
provided the opportunity to address the factors affecting project implementation. The mission
incorporated several Bank specialists in various fields and international experts in participatory
conservation who were in charge of similar projects in Mexico and Colombia. This team helped
to perform a thorough assessment of project implementation, comprising: (i) for the first time
during implementation, field visits to the five NPA under the project to gather firsthand
information about project implementation; (ii) a full review of financial and technical
implementation; (iii) an institutional assessment of central and field staff and coordination
procedures; and (iv) an international workshop with specialists from Mexico, Colombia, and Peru
to share experiences, discuss execution issues, and propose recommendations to improve project
implementation.




                                                    20

    ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



On the basis of the MTR's findings and its experts' recommendations, the Bank carried out
several actions that helped to boost planned activities in Components 1 and 2. Specifically, the
MTR promoted:

        Changes in institutional arrangements: An institutional assessment during the MTR
        identified three major issues affecting project implementation: (i) the lack of capacity and
        cohesion in PIU staff; (ii) deficient coordination between field staff and the PIU, and
        between the PIU and the IANP; and (iii) communication problems that created conflicts
        among the staff. With the help of a Bank institutional specialist, who organized two
        workshops with all the parties, functions and tasks were clarified, staff that was causing
        problems was replaced, and an improved communication system was established. A few
        months later, results began to show.

        Improved indigenous participation: The MTR was an opportunity to meet with local,
        regional, and national organizations, and respond to their claims to improve indigenous
        peoples' participation, including: (i) further consultation about categorization; (ii)
        arrangements for greater decision making in project management; (iii) a more active role
        for the two indigenous liaisons; (iv) improved training and support for indigenous
        students to complete studies and share experiences; and (v) full support to carry out
        consultation about the bylaw (Regimen Especial) to make communal reserves operational.
        Later, several similar agreements were added to continue improving indigenous
        participation; while there was not always a full agreement, the project gained indigenous
        peoples' respect and support. At the end, most indigenous organizations were supportive
        of the project and requested its continuation.

        Adaptation of bioinvestment projects: After a closer assessment carried out by local
        project teams, the MTR decided that it was necessary to adapt subprojects and make them
        more responsive to the socioeconomic situation and organizational capability of
        indigenous communities. Accordingly their contributions were reduced from 50% to 10­
        25%; feasibility and market studies involved an intensive consultation with communities
        to ensure ownership.

        Decentralized management of bioinvestment projects: Implementation of bioinvestment
        projects was decentralized, bringing consultants to directly work with the communities
        reducing overhead and traveling costs. Indigenous promoters who speak the local
        languages were incorporated facilitating training and consultation and capacity building
        at the local level.

        Contractual issues: The contracts to carry out two of the most important tasks --
        categorization and design of the Biodiversity M&E System--had to be restructured in
        order to address implementation issues, mainly those linked to communities'
        participation. The Bank supported negotiations and cleared the process to speed
        completion. An agreement to simplify the contracting of infrastructure construction was
        also put in place with the help of PROFONANPE.

        Counterpart funds: The MTR participated in meetings with officials in the MEF and
        Ministry of Agriculture to ensure the availability of counterpart funds. The Bank's
        participation facilitated the decision to allocate resources from the Peru-Canada Fund to
        the project and the reimbursement of the IGV (value-added tax) to be used in the project
        as counterpart funds.

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



         Project M&E: At the MTR several agreements were reached to make the project M&E
         functional, including hiring a full-time professional with suitable qualifications to be
         responsible for preparation of quarterly reports on progress in implementation; these
         reports incorporated adjusted performance indicators to better measure progress in
         achieving the development objective (see Section F). A quarterly report system was
         established to inform the Bank about progress in implementation.

         Intensified supervision: Bank supervision intensified to ensure compliance with all
         agreements reached; institutional and operational specialists continued to provide
         technical assistance; other specialists were brought in to provide advisory support as
         necessary. All missions included field visits, meetings with indigenous organizations, and
         participation in Steering Committee meetings. The Bank also provided advice on
         financial and procurement matters by a specialist in Lima and an independent external
         evaluation on procurement matters was also completed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank was able to overcome shortcomings in project preparation by reaching strategic
agreements with the PIU to speed project implementation and provide ongoing support through
intensified supervision, which allowed the project to achieve its development objective and
disburse the grant in full. The most relevant aspects of Bank performance are the following:

Specialized support: The Bank accompanied the implementing agency throughout project
execution, providing assistance in technical and procedural matters. It also brought international
experience to successfully establish the participatory conservation model with the support of an
international expert who assisted the PIU in this task. The project team also helped to prepare
closing financial reports, project evaluation, and the sustainability program.

Promoting dialogue: The Bank facilitated dialogue among the major stakeholders, helping to
overcome implementation obstacles. All missions comprised visits to the national indigenous
organizations which always received a copy of the Aide-Memoire. Field trips helped to develop
trust and partnership with local and regional organizations that were critical actors in project
implementation. By being responsive to indigenous organizations' demands, the Bank gained
their respect and helped to maintain dialogue even in difficult moments.

Flexibility: The project helped the implementing agency to overcome cumbersome administrative
processes and to join the team in discussions with other government agencies when necessary.
No-objections were granted promptly. At completion, the Bank granted a closing date extension
that made it possible to achieve project objectives and fully disburse the grant.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government performance during project implementation was mixed, influenced by the changes in
administration and the high turnover in officials, which created instability in key areas linked to
the project such as indigenous peoples and conservation policies.



                                                    22

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



The lack of institutional coordination and the cumbersome procedures, as well as insufficient
support to INRENA in general and to the project specifically, affected project implementation,
particularly during the initial years. Main issues affecting implementation were: (i) the
inconsistent availability of budgetary and counterpart resources; (ii) complex regulations about
contractual procedures; and (iii) auditing regulations that caused delays in audit preparation.
However, in the final years of implementation the Ministry of Economy and Finance allowed the
use of funds from the Peru­Canada Fund; the Ministry of Agriculture helped find alternative
sources to allocate regular budget resources for NPA's staff and operation and additional funds to
continue execution of the project's main activities. The Peruvian Ombudsman's Office
(Defensoría del Pueblo) also maintained a vigilant and supportive role during most of the
negotiations with the indigenous organizations; its participation and evaluation statements
ensured respect for indigenous rights and an objective perspective that helped to continue
implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Despite institutional limitations in terms of financial and human resources and insufficient
government support and recognition, INRENA was able to carry out the project until completion.
The IANP provided technical advice on environmental matters and was able to obtain
institutional support from high-level management in INRENA. The establishment of a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) within the IANP was appropriate because it helped bring the expertise
lacking in INRENA. The PIU, originally conceived as a small coordination unit, grew to face
unforeseen challenges in project implementation. However, it took a while for the PIU to be fully
accepted as an integral part of the IANP, causing the abovementioned coordination problems. The
incorporation of PROFONANPE as the administrative agency supplemented INRENA's capacity
and helped to speed grant processing; however, it also added to the complexities of the
institutional framework. Coordination and communication difficulties were eventually resolved
with Bank support.

The quality of the PIU's staff and the incorporation of indigenous professionals were very
positive. The incorporation of an experienced, well-regarded anthropologist as head of the PIU,
helped to build mutual understanding with the IANP and facilitated dialogue with indigenous
organizations. The incorporation of two professionals of indigenous descent as liaisons with
indigenous organizations and the appointment of three NPA directors of indigenous descent were
also positive steps. The participation of these indigenous professionals helped to consolidate
mutual trust and promote intercultural dialogue throughout the project.

Decentralization of activities to the field, under Component 2 (Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity),
also required some adaptation. However, it helped the PIU to build an operational platform
capable of operating with indigenous groups in remote places. It is important to highlight that the
central project team and the zone teams undertook a facilitation role in the intercultural dialogue
among the IANP, the indigenous people, and the environmental sector. The experience and
capacity of field teams were critical to the successful completion of this component.

The IANP and the central project team in the PIU responded with professionalism to implement a
challenging project; the experience of their field staff in previous participatory processes in other
protected areas was critical to achieve a positive outcome. Project execution was a true learning
experience that strengthened the IANP's capacity to interact with indigenous people and build a
model suitable for replication in other NPAs.

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ranking: Satisfactory

INRENA overcame initial difficulties and institutional constraints and was able to establish basic
agreements with other government agencies to obtain counterpart resources and institutional
support for project execution. From the design to implementation phases, both the IANP and the
project team in the PIU and in the field demonstrated commitment and technical proficiency to
complete projected activities and outputs. Positive achievements gained the support of some
government institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture that included the project as a best-
practice example in its 2006 report and helped INRENA to overcome irregular government
support to conservation activities.

6.      LESSONS LEARNED

Constructing a model for participatory conservation of protected areas was a new experience for
INRENA and the GoP. In fact, the project helped to change the prevailing conservation paradigm
based mainly on the establishment of national parks and sanctuaries with reduced or no human
intervention. The inclusion of indigenous peoples incorporated traditional knowledge in
conservation efforts providing important lessons that enriched INRENA's capacity to interact
with indigenous peoples in the management of protected areas. These experiences are also useful
for other countries facing similar environmental challenges.

        The Social Approach to Conservation

The project proved that communities' participation is positive for biodiversity conservation,
which was its original principle. Indeed, communities were a driving force during project
execution through a participation process that encouraged co-responsibility and intercultural
dialogue. This bottom-up approach built on local capacity, promoted community empowerment
and established a social network that supervised and controlled results. Indigenous peoples'
response to this approach was very positive because, in their own words, they felt treated like
equals.

        The Participatory Conservation Model

The project demonstrated the feasibility of combining conventional conservation with an
indigenous conception of protected areas as their living environment. The participatory
conservation model achieved this through:

a. An integrated approach to comanagement: The project designed, tested, and implemented
the tools for communities' participation in all stages of conservation:

        Advisory bodies: Indigenous representatives participate in the five NPA Management
        Committees established under the project;

        Participation in Categorization: Categorization comprised an extensive consultation with
        indigenous communities to incorporate their perspectives and priorities about land and
        natural resources use;

        Participatory Management Planning: Communities also participated in the preparation of
        Master Plans comprising a conservation strategy under an intercultural approach that was
        discussed in each community and approved in their general assemblies;




                                                    24

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



        Community surveillance: Community surveillance groups were established to monitor
        NPA and received training, facilities, and IDs issued by INRENA as members of the
        conservation teams; and

        Participatory Biodiversity M&E System: The participatory M&E system was based on an
        innovative approach that: (i) incorporated socioeconomic data and cultural patterns about
        biodiversity use and land occupation; and (ii) were jointly prepared with local
        communities who contributed with their traditional knowledge and facilitated field
        research.

As shown in beneficiaries' surveys, this approach promoted project ownership and contributed to
the success of the activities and their sustainability. Participation also functioned as a social
control mechanism that helped to ensure the good use of project resources and distribution of
their benefits.

b. Bioinvestment Projects. This a concept developed under the project that demonstrated that
combining the sustainable use of natural resources with the enhancement of community
livelihood generated a positive synergy to conservation that results in positive environmental
impacts. The use of consultation processes helped to select options that incorporated local
knowledge and ensured adaptation to community's needs. The project provided in situ technical
assistance and training to enable indigenous organizations to directly implement the project,
which was in itself, an invigorating exercise that helped to build local capacity and social control
mechanisms to ensure the good use of resources and distribution of benefits.

c. Communal reserves a breaking point in conservation: The struggle about conservation of
natural resources and land rights in protected areas found in communal reserves an alternative
acceptable to indigenous peoples and the GoP. Indigenous communities, legally integrated as
ECAs, directly managed their communal reserves through Administration Contracts to implement
Master Plans approved by the community assembly. This management process is fully described
in the bylaw on the operation of Communal Reserves (Regimen Especial) agreed by consensus of
all indigenous organizations through a consultation process organized under the project and
legally approved by the GoP.

        Training and capacity building as empowerment tools

The project showed that comanagement required enabling indigenous communities by building
their capacity to directly execute activities affecting their livelihoods. Training under the project
responded to this demand and has been a key element in the development of the comanagement
model because: (i) it is an instrument that has helped to strengthen and empower people to
achieve social change; (ii) it was promoted as an intercultural dialogue in which both sides
learned from each other; and (iii) it was custom-made to adapt to local capacity and cultural
background. The training process was applied on permanent basis in stages that moved along
with project implementation to support main activities under the project; (iv) it helped
communities to identify, prioritize, and execute community-based subprojects; (v) it promoted the
exchange of experiences that helped to overcome fears about conservation strategies; and (vi) it
helped indigenous students to complete their education and become an asset for their
communities and their organizations. Overall, this effort contributed to the creation of indigenous
social capital.

        Intercultural dialogue in building understanding and consensus

The project verified that intercultural dialogue was a positive approach to build a common
understanding between indigenous peoples and the project team. The experience showed that the
rules of engagement and the way in which this dialogue takes place were as important as the
matters under discussion. The cultural dialogue as tested and executed in the project had the

following basic conditions: (i) mutual respect: between the parties: (ii) willingness to reach
mutual understanding, (iii) equity in the information exchange, (iv) abandonment of all forms of
imposition or violence, and (v) transparency. Some learning experiences that contributed to
project success are the following:

        Indigenous organizations play different roles and have different priorities; therefore,
        incentives and negotiation mechanisms should be adapted accordingly;

        Consultation is a common practice among indigenous communities; therefore, project
        activities should allow time for this process to take place and be flexible to incorporate
        changes as necessary;

        Bringing neutral actors to mediate in difficult negotiations can help to avoid or minimize
        conflicts and keep dialogue open in difficult negotiations;

        Building trust and mutual respect is the only way to overcome years of neglect and
        ignorance about indigenous peoples' rights and culture; and

        Dialogue is an open-ended exercise that should adapt to ongoing changes in leaderships
        and priorities.

        Institutional capacity is critical to project success

The difficulties experienced in the first years of project implementation demonstrated the need to
address institutional constraints and prepare upfront an institutional strengthening program.
Although the establishment of the PIU and the incorporation of PROFONANPE helped to
overcome INRENA's lack of expertise in certain areas, it also created some coordination
problems. The adjustment took time and distracted the project's attention from other important
tasks. The main lesson here is that the plan for appropriate institutional arrangements merits
major attention during the design phase of the project.

BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARNERS

The borrower through the Executing Agency INRENA provided the following comments:

English Summary

Ratings: The Borrower agreed with all the ratings in the ICR

Main Comments:

    The Borrower agreed overall with the draft ICR particularly that the project achieved
    satisfactorily its objectives and made the following remarks:

    Despite project design flaws the executing team managed to complete all project tasks in
    which the role of field staff was crucial;

    Participatory approach was challenging because each PA involved around four different
    indigenous peoples with their own language and culture. Therefore participation was a time-
    consuming and costly exercise;

    PROFONANPE involvement in project administration was positive but costly and could not
    solve all the bureaucratic processes, thus causing delays in implementation.

    The borrower requested to highlight the quality and experience of field staff that worked
    directly with the communities and continue to operate now financed by regular budget;

    They concurred that decentralization of bioinvestment project was a factor that facilitated
    implementation and reached goals;

    Finally INRENA recommended incorporating in the ICR indigenous organizations and other
    beneficiaries' requests to continue and expand the project activities through a follow up
    operation.

Ratings Sumary

Estamos de acuerdo con la calificación expresada en el documento satisfactoria en la calificación
correspondiente al Performance del ICR; moderadamente satisfactoria para el como la detallada
para el Banco y el Borrower en la correspondiente al Quality at entry y satisfactoria para lo
correspondiente a la calidad de la supervisión y de la agencia ejecutora teniendo en cuenta que
este proyecto ha logrado los objetivos propuestos y tiene resultados que serán están siendo
replicados en el SINANPE y se saco adelante un proyecto que tuvo algunas fallas en el diseño y
varios problemas en la implementación que el equipo de trabajo del proyecto y en especial el
personal de campo de las áreas protegidas logró.

    · Ejecución del proyecto

En lo referente a cumplimiento de objetivos del proyecto, el ICR expresa el cumplimiento de los
diferentes objetivos propuestos y los cambio que se hicieron, por ello se recomienda remarcar que
el proyecto no solo tuvo una alta participación indígena, sino que la población involucrada en el
desarrollo del proyecto no es culturalmente homogénea y que cada área natural protegida tiene
relación con al menos cuatro grupos étnicos con idiomas y cultura diferentes. Aquí también
debemos reconocer que el diseño del proyecto no tuvo en cuenta que los procesos participativos
son costosos y llevan mucho tiempo

Dentro de los arreglos institucionales que tuvo el proyecto PIMA y la administración externa se
destaca que fue una decisión acertada ya que pudo facilitar algunos procedimientos
administrativos especialmente para el desarrollo de concursos de nivel internacional, y
contratación de consultores; sin embargo se tuvo dificultades burocráticas, la logística de campo,
la supervisión de construcciones y contratación de consultores para el trabajo en el campo, en
especial con la transferencia de fondos que retrasó la ejecución de actividades con las
comunidades, ello sumado a los altos costos administrativos.

EL ICR rescata la evolución histórica de la ejecución del proyecto que el inicio no fue
satisfactorio y como se hicieron los cambios adecuados en la unidad central del proyecto.

Es importante precisar la experiencia de la mayoría del personal de campo de las ANP: Jefes de
ANP, profesionales y guardaparque, que estuvieron presentes desde el inicio hasta el final de la
ejecución del proyecto y que a la fecha continúan.

Con respecto a la adaptación de los proyectos de bioinversión, el cambio propuesto durante la
ejecución del proyecto se logró la promoción y fortalecimiento del manejo y uso de recursos
manteniendo los usos y costumbres de la población local dando mejor eficiencia en su
comercialización y generación de recursos económicos.

Se recomienda que se incluya en el documento las diferentes solicitudes de los beneficiarios del
proyecto que lo enfatizaron con sus representantes en las dos últimas reuniones del Comité
Directivo en el que solicitan al INRENA que continúe con proyecto y se apoye a las actividades
como las desarrolladas en el PIMA que les ha permitido el desarrollo de capacidades para
integrarse al desarrollo sustentable del país.

Finalmente en las reuniones de trabajo se han comentado las precisiones correspondientes a las
nominaciones de lugares, instituciones y redacción del documento.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Participatory Biodiversity Conservation

Although it faced some initial difficulties, the project managed to successfully conduct a set of
activities that promoted indigenous participation in the categorization, establishment, and
management of selected protected areas. Table 1 shows relevant outputs achieved compared to
those committed in the original design. Additional notes complement information provided in the
table.

1A relevant output associated with the creation of these Communal Reserves is the legal approval of the "Special Regime for the
Management of Communal Reserves," which established the operational and institutional arrangements for comanaging this type of
protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon.
2The fourth workshop (Purús) was not carried out due to a temporary shortage of personnel in the area. The IANP anticipates holding
this workshop in 2007 as part of the follow-up activities.
3Travel expenses to Manu National Park and Pacaya-Samiria were higher than the budget anticipated during the design phase. Thus,
the number of grantees was lower than original planned.
4During implementation, the project realized that Interpretation Centers were appropriate only if located in major cities to promote
tourism. Tourism activities were nonexistent or scarce in the project sites, making it irrelevant to locate the centers in these areas.
However, building in nearby major cities required land acquisition which was not considered in the original budget.
5 To construct infrastructure for private organizations with public funds (in this case communities), this activity needed to be
designated as a donation. Project personnel tried to make the necessary changes to make these donations possible but the procedures
were too cumbersome to be accomplished during the project cycle.

Component 2: Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity

The project succeeded in promoting alternatives to the unsustainable use of resources within the
protected areas. The communities showed a high degree of reliability and efficiency in controlling
the funds. The evaluation performance indicates that 23 of the 43 subgrants (54%) were
successfully completed in the implementation phase. Table 2 shows relevant outputs. Additional
notes complement information provided in the table.

1The output of 60 contracts was established in the absence of specific regulations for the law of natural protected areas. During
implementation, the abovementioned regulation was approved, indicating that the contracts required payment for usage rights; this
was only possible at a high production scale which was met exceptionally in certain cases (Pacaya-Samiria). For this reason, the
project decided to use "resource use grant agreements" and "resource use grant for minor activities" instead of "contracts."
2The original design planned for 123 sub grants for individual communities. Since the demand was higher than anticipated and there
were communities pursuing similar objectives, some formed associations to conduct one project. Thus, the final number of sub grants
was 43, covering 200 communities.
3The fourth workshop (Purús) was not carried out due to a temporary shortage of personnel in the area. IANP anticipates holding this
workshop in 2007 as part of the follow-up activities.

Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation System

This component allowed the design of a Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation System to track
changes in ecosystems and targeted species. The applied method has been validated in Güeppi
and Pacaya-Samiria. The participatory nature increases indigenous involvement in the
management of protected areas. Table 3 presents relevant outputs; additional notes complement

1It should be pointed out that the project created and uploaded a Web page, which is located within INRENA's Web site. For
monitoring purposes, a software package was developed to handle monitoring data and perform basic queries. This program does not
yet have a public World Wide Web interface because IANP considers this a final step in the M&E for the entire national system. At
this stage the software is being implemented in each of the sites connected through INRENA's Intranet.
2The complete development of activities could not be accomplished in all five sites. The M&E was fully applied only in Güeppi and
Pacaya­Samiria. In the other sites (Santiago-Comaina, Purus, and Sira) the activities launched for this component interfered with the
ongoing categorization activities (workshops, focus groups, local leaders traveling continuously to Lima). In addition, some violent
responses emerged in Santiago-Comaina due to disagreements and misunderstandings during the categorization process. Due to these
problems and difficult access, focus was placed on only two sites.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

        Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon Project

Introduction

This annex aims to analyze the economic impacts of the Indigenous Management of Protected
Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (PIMA) Project. The main objective of the project was to increase
the sustainability of biodiversity conservation through the involvement of indigenous
communities in the management of new and existing protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon
Region. The project aimed to achieve this objective by: (i) establishing, categorizing, and
promoting the participatory management of five protected areas; (ii) promoting economically,
socially, and environmentally sustainable investments by indigenous grassroots organizations;
(iii) developing and implementing a participatory monitoring and evaluation system for the
project areas; and (iv) strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of INRENA and
indigenous organizations to manage the protected areas and their natural resources in a
sustainable manner. The target areas are (1) El Sira Reserve Zone, (2) Güeppi Reserve Zone, (3)
Purus Reserve Zone, (4) Santiago-Comaina Reserve Zone, and (5) Pacaya-Samiria National
Reserve.

The project was organized in four components to implement these actions: (i) Participatory
Biodiversity Conservation ($4.83 million, 48.3% of GEF funding), including creation and
categorization of protected areas and strengthening participatory mechanisms; (ii) Sustainable
Use of Biodiversity ($1.74 million, 17.4%), including management plans for titled indigenous
lands, communal natural resource use contracts, studies, and biodiversity investment subgrants;
(iii) Monitoring and Evaluation System ($0.99 million, 9.9%), including biological and
socioeconomic baselines and databases, biological and socioeconomic monitoring, area
management       monitoring,   training     assistance,      and    operational  support; (iv) Project
Implementation ($2.43 million, 24.3%), including project national coordination mechanisms,
project special implementation unit, technical assistance, and project monitoring. These
components were not restructured during execution.

Scope of Analysis

The extent of the economic analysis for the project is limited for several reasons. First, as
normally done for GEF projects, an incremental cost analysis was used in designing the project.
Therefore, neither net present value nor economic rate of return was estimated at project appraisal.
Second, no economic data were collected for Components 1 and 3. Third, only two investment
subprojects were able to provide enough data for a formal cost-benefit analysis. Fourth, since the
project implementation was largely affected by the cancellation of cofinancing, the investment
subprojects did not start until the fourth year of the project implementation. Therefore, results of
the investment could not be sufficiently observed by the end of the project. Fifth, because most
local indigenous peoples live on subsistence agriculture and fishing and are not easily accessible
to large markets, their income from market transactions is negligible. Therefore, the estimated
benefits from the subprojects include the value of all products whether they are consumed by
themselves or sold at markets to gain money.

The economic analysis presented in this annex focuses mainly on the results of the biodiversity
investment grants under Component 2. Although limited, some cost and benefit data were



                                                    35

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



collected during the project. Those data and the qualitative information on the results of other
components helped to draw a conclusion on the performance in achieving the intended benefits.
The expected benefits from the investment component presented in the Project Appraisal
Document were as follows:

 · use of natural resources in project areas by over 300 indigenous communities for their own
     benefit; and
 · increase in the income of 100 indigenous groups through natural resource biodiversity
     investments.

Biodiversity investment grants financed local investments which were identified during
preparation and selected based on the subsequent pre-investment studies. Two hundred and
twenty project concepts were identified by the local groups through the pre-investment studies.
Among those appraised by the Field Project Teams, 200 community subprojects grouped in 43
interventions were approved by the Zonal Coordinating Committee (ZCC) and financed by grants
on average of US$20,000 each; those 200 communities were the beneficiaries. The project
proponents were required to provide cofinancing of about 30% of total costs, which were mostly
in-kind contributions from the local communities. The project also provided technical assistance
for those 43 investment subprojects to implement the proposed activities.

Baseline Economic Activities

The beneficiaries of the 43 investments are the local indigenous peoples who have lived in the
forest for generations. The baseline activities of these people are mainly slash-and-burn
agriculture, hunting of animals in the forest, and fishing in nearby rivers, typically for their
subsistence. The excess products are sold for their clothing and food, and in some cases for their
children's education. Data on the size of these economic activities are not available. It is reported
that in some locations local people extracted mahogany and sold it for S/. 100 per tree.2 However,
most of the communities are not easily accessible to commercial markets. Therefore, the income
from agriculture, hunting, and fishing was not considered a significant source of income. The
baseline economic data provided later under the financial analysis includes the value of all the
products that are consumed among themselves and sold at local markets.

         Agriculture

The indigenous groups typically slash and burn forests to obtain fertile lands to cultivate produce
such as yucca, potatoes, peanuts, and corn in communal farms called "chacras." They also collect
fruits while clearing forests. After three to four years, the fertility of soil declines naturally. The
people then move to a new location and repeat the slash-and-burn agriculture. Some of the
indigenous groups also plant fruit trees such as cacao, different kinds of palm trees, and coffee in
permanent locations in their territory. The harvests are mainly for their consumption.

To give an idea of the size of agricultural production in the Department of Amazonia, the 1997
data of Condorcanqui Province where the Santiago-Comaina Reserve Zone is located, are as
follows: Among annual crops, yucca and plantains represented 83.8% of the cultivated area and
the rest were yellow corn and rice. The gross value of yucca production was S/. 10.58 millions,
with a productivity of 10 ton/ha. With regard to perennial crops, cacao occupied 1,200 ha.

        Hunting

Hunting has been another important activity for the indigenous groups, almost exclusively done
by men. They hunt small- to medium-sized forest animals such as armadillo, agouti, deer, squirrel,
olingo, peccary, and birds. These are mostly for their subsistence, but some are traded for money.
Traditionally their hunting instrument was a blowgun with poison on the tip of the arrow. But
colonizers and merchants brought firearms such as rifles and shotguns which were exchanged
with forest products. Consequently, more animals are killed, placing the survival of some native
species at risk.

        Fishing

Fish has been another important source of protein for indigenous peoples. Men and women
participate in fishing using arrows, fishing nets, harpoons, long-lining, diving, and traps. South
American catfish, sábalo (Salminus hilarii), silver dollar, and tambaqui are their main catches.
These are mostly for their subsistence and are an important source of protein.

Cost

The total amount of the grants to the activities carried out by the indigenous communities under
Component 2 is S/. 2,810,273. It was initially planned to require a matching contribution of 50%
for each subproject. However, the project decided after a closer assessment carried out at the
midterm review that it should be reduced substantially. Labor costs form the bulk of the costs. It
is assessed that a total labor cost of S/. 1,177,046 was invested in the implementation of the 43
projects. Therefore, the total cost for the investment subprojects was S/. 3,987,319.

Economic Benefits

Table 1 shows the extent of the areas that the project achieved to obtain legal protection status
under the Peruvian law. The deforestation rate in the target protected areas and surrounding areas
was estimated at 31,281 ha/year. Without the project, the legal status of protection would have
not been secured, pending an approval by the Peruvian Ministerial Council.

The project contributed to prepare the critical documentation for the establishment of the new
protected areas and for their sustainable management with the participation of the local
populations. These documents include master plans, resource management plans, research plans,
diagnostics, zoning studies, and monitoring and evaluation plans. As a result two national parks,
Alto Purus comprising 2.5 million ha and Ichigkat Muja (Cordillera del Condor) with 88,477
hectares are now legally protected as IUCN Category II and three Communal Reserves totaling
921,414 ha are protected as IUCN Category VI. The basic infrastructure and the personnel for
managing these protected areas are secured with the support of the project. Most importantly, the
legal designation of the indigenous reserves gave tremendous incentives and a sense of security
for the local indigenous groups to protect the area and use in a sustainable manner the natural
resources that they depend on.

            Avoided Deforestation

   Among the 43 grants for the sustainable use of natural resources, 22 were related to reforestation
   and forest management for the sustainable use of forest resources. As a result, it is estimated that
   the deforestation of 18,777 ha was avoided through these subprojects (see Table 1.) The avoided
   deforestation in the target areas is estimated by the following method: 1) for palms, the area
   equals the size of the natural area that contains the same volume of trees that are planted or
   managed under the subprojects; 2) for tree species, the timber volume projected in 20 years is
   divided by the reference value of 8 m3/ha for the volume extracted for local consumption and for
   profit.

   These forests provide benefits in different ways: habitat for wild species, foods, medicinal plants,
   and timber and nontimber products. The deforestation rate of the target areas was 31,281 ha per
   year before the PIMA project. The rapid deforestation led to fewer goods and services provided
   by the forests on which the local communities have relied for centuries. For example, white-
   lipped peccaries (Tayyassu pecari) are one of the major protein sources for the local indigenous
   people. Losing a forest area of 31,281 ha means that a habitat for 312 white-lipped peccaries
   could have been lost.

            Carbon Sequestration

   Table 2 shows the estimated carbon content sequestered by the forests managed and expanded
   under the subprojects, which totals 2,969 tons of CO2, equivalent per year. With a price of
   US$4.00 per ton and an exchange rate of S/. 3.20, the total value of carbon sequestration is
   estimated at 38,001 S/./year. The carbon sink is calculated by multiplying the mean annual
   increment (MAI) expressed in m3/ha/year by a conversion factor. If the conversion factor is 0.45
   and the MAI is 7.89 m3/ha/year, the sequestered carbon is 3.55 ton/ha/year. The value of the
   conversion factor is based on the article by forester Auberto Ricse Tembladera titled "Reservas de
   Carbono en los Bosques Altos del Género Eucalyptus en el Valle del Mantaro." MAI varies over
   years; thus the quantity of sequestered carbon varies. In addition, the estimation of MAI depends
   on the species, the number of trees per ha, and the quality of sites observed. But these subprojects
   started only one year or so before the data was collected. No study has been done to define the
   conversion factor for the tree species handled in the subprojects; this analysis employed the factor
   that forester Ricse used in his article.

            Soil Erosion

  Increased forest areas and the proper management of the forests contributed to a substantial
  decrease in soil erosion in the area. The estimated volume of the avoided erosion was 34,465 tons
  annually. In the calculation, the erosion map developed by INRENA3 and the Universal Soil Loss
  Equation (USLE) were used. The formula is provided as follows:

  E = R * K * LS * C * P

  Where:

  E = Volume of soil loss
  R = Rainfall-runoff erosivity factor
  K = Soil erodibility factor
  L = Slope length factor
  S = Slope steepness factor
  C = Cover management factor
  P = Conservation practice factor

  Valuing that soil of similar characteristic costs about 5 S/./ton, local farmers saved 172,327
  S/./year. This is an important change not only for local agricultural production, but also for the
  survival of the forests. Local farmers typically cultivate in a cleared land which loses fertility
  after three to four years. The farmers then abandon the land and move to burn more forests to
  continue their farming production. The reforestation and forest management activities reversed
  this vicious cycle and consequently achieved not only direct environmental impacts but also
  economic benefits for local farmers.

            Overextraction of Native Fish Species

  Table 4 shows the ecological impact of the aquatic resources subprojects. A total area of 16.48 ha
  is dedicated for fish farming and 329 ha for natural water ponds under management. These areas
  are important to address over-extraction of fish species in natural water habitats. Managing these
  fish farms and ponds would be equivalent to giving up extraction of native fish species in an area
  of 775.4 ha. It is estimated from the volume of production of fish farms and the density of fish
  population in natural water habitat. Assuming that the average fish population density is 1 fish per
  2 m2, it implies that 3.86 million fish in natural habitat are spared.

Production and Income

Of the 43 grants implemented, 23 are reported to be successfully executed. Productivity and
benefit generated by each subproject are assessed at the end of the project. Most local indigenous
peoples live on subsistence agriculture and fishing and are not easily accessible to large markets;
thus, their income from market transactions is negligible. Therefore, the benefit data provided in
the subsequent sections include the total value of their production, both for their self-consumption
as well as the excess sold at local markets.

         Considering that the majority of these subprojects started in the fourth year of project
         implementation, the full effect of the investment is yet to be captured. Some may see more effects
         of the activity later as products mature over the years. The results are discussed separately by type
         of activity, i.e., forest-related production, aquatic resources production, and ecotourism and
         handicraft production.

         Forest-related Productive Activities

         There are 23 subprojects related to reforestation and forest management activities. (One did not
         provide enough data on the result.) Before the project, the average income of those who
         participated in forest-related subprojects was assessed at 1,655 S/./year/household with the
         highest being 4,950 S/./year/household. A study was done by the project's consultant to assess the
         income from these subprojects in 20 years (10 years in case of ecotourism and handicrafts
         projects). The income after 20 years was calculated by estimating the total increase in production
         over 20 years and averaged out by year. The detailed cost data were provided only for two
         subprojects. Therefore, an appropriate cost benefit analysis is not available for all subprojects. To
         explain the extent of the undertaking, the change in production and income is provided in Table 5.

         The average annual production in 20 years is estimated at 6,015 S/./household with the highest
         being 28,700 S/./household. Nontimber products such as palm leaves and fruits will be harvested
         only several years from now. In the baseline, the production of medicinal plants was very modest.
         Through processing and proper packaging, medicinal plants have a good chance of generating
         high revenue. The subprojects with Shebón palm plantations in Sucre and Leoncio Prado will be
         generating benefits after seven years when the palm trees mature and offer full-grown leaves for
         thatching. (This subproject is further analyzed in the later section.) The area where a single crop
         was cultivated showed very low productivity. A traditional production crop such as coffee caused
         a major loss of fertility and erosion. When it is combined with trees in an agroforestry system,
         these problems are reduced and productivity increases over the years.

M.N.D April 2007


        The following economic analysis is based on the limited data from the two types of
        subprojects under the investment component: one that aims at the reforestation of Shebón
        palms (Scheelea brachyelada) and another that incorporates agroforestry systems in fruit
        production. The cost and benefit data are collected by the project's forester during the
        project.

                    Shebón Palm Plantation
        Two subprojects in the Pacaya-Samiria Native Reserve aim at the reforestation of Shebón palms
        (Scheelea branchyelada). The area of reforestation is 20 ha for each subproject. The locations are
        in the Leoncio Prado Native Community and the Sucre Native Community. Shebón palms mature
        in seven years to start yielding leaves and fruits for consumption. The data here take into
        consideration only the benefits generated with leaves for thatching. Table 6 shows the number of
        leaves yielded over 20 years.

     On average, an 8m x 9m house requires 750 Shebón leaves for thatching. Starting in Year 10, the
     production capacity of a 20 ha plantation will cover 201 houses per year (150,480 leaves/750 per
     house). With the indigenous population of 12,000 people in the area, it is assumed that there are
     3,000 households, 5% of which need thatch maintenance (150 houses). The estimated growth of
     houses is 3% (90 houses). Thus, the total number of houses in need of thatch maintenance is
     estimated at 240. With the Shebón plantation, it is estimated that 83% of the local demand for
     thatching can be met.

     The estimated cost and benefit of the Shebón plantation in 20 ha is provided in Table 7.

  The costs for harvesting reflect the labor cost of 328 S/./day and a total of S/.3,502 for
  transportation. The maintenance costs assume a base cost of 890 S/./ha.

  If the reforestation was fully implemented, the NPV of reforestation of Shebón palm on each of
  these community lands after 20 years would be $56,469.67 at 10% discount rate and the IRR is
  15%.

      Agroforestry Production System

  There are three subprojects that aim to incorporate agroforestry systems: two are in the Güeppi
  Reserve Zone and one in the Purus Communal Reserve. Data were collected for the subproject in
  Miraflores/Nueva Ipiranga in Güeppi, whose objective is to increase the productivity of orchards
  by introducing an agroforestry production system. The area of cultivation is 20 ha. Table 8 shows
  the estimated benefits from the yields of each fruit over the years. Again, the estimated benefits
  are the value of the products if these were sold at markets. Most of the products are consumed
  locally for subsistence.

According to the estimate by the project's forester, the productivity of the agroforestry system
shown above is 2.82 times more efficient than plantain monoculture. Moreover, the agroforestry
subprojects plan to sell wood materials starting in Year 20. The estimated income from the wood
sales is shown in Table 9.

        If the agroforestry production systems were fully implemented, the NPV of these subprojects at
        20 years would be $367,201.53 at a 10% discount rate, and the IRR is 30%. The results seem
        very high. This may be because the products are consumed locally and the various costs such as
        cost for transportation to markets are not taken into consideration.

        Aquatic Resources Activities

        Increased productivity of fish is important for the local community not only in terms of obtaining
        protein and improving their diet, but also as a potential income source. The size of investments is
        relatively small. Most of the fish are consumed locally. An excess of these fish is sold locally and
        becomes a source of income. In the case of tiger peacock bass (lossum bicirrhosum), these are
        aquarium fish and sold to buyers who export them.

        The baseline productivity of aquatic resources was 152,260 kg in total for all the participating
        communities, and the average baseline income was 335.8 S/./household. The productivity in 20
        years is estimated to increase 2.8 times. As in the case of forest management activities, the
        income after 20 years was calculated by estimating the total increase in production over 20 years
        and averaged out by year. In general, fish farms that utilize the natural pond system generated
        greater income. There were five of such fish farms in the Pacaya-Samiria Reserve which
        reproduce native fish species. In the case of the subprojects in Bajo Pachitea of the El Sira
        Communal Reserve to produce aquarium fish, the actual productivity was 12.6 kg/year in a 60m2
        pond and the baseline income was 420 S/./household. It has a potential to increase income even
        more over the years if its access to a larger market is secured. It uses a floating cage to culture the
        fish, thus the environmental impact to the local ecology is minimal. Another successful case was
        in Mamayaque-Canepa of the Santiago Comanina Reserve Zone where fry fish and adult fish of
        native species are produced for commercial purposes at a reproduction center. The potential for
        growth is very high.

              Ecotourism and Handicrafts
         Although there were only five subprojects in this category, the activities were generally
         successful. The average baseline income was 615 S/./household. The income after 10 years was
         calculated by estimating the total increase in production over 20 years and averaged out by year.
         In Santa Margarita of the Purus Communal Reserve, artisan boats were produced by men in
         addition to cotton fabric and hammocks produced by women. These boats have created a great
         demand from nearby communities of Brazil and have a potential to further increase income. In
         San Bernardo of the Purus Communal Reserve, the activity uses communal farms (chacras) to
         produce wood products such as boats and oars. In Nueva Cajamarca in the Pacaya Samiria Native
         Reserve, the main products are fabric made from natural cotton and necklaces made with seeds.

         There are only two ecotourism projects, both in the Pacaya Samiria Native Reserve. These areas
         have already seen demands for ecotourism due to their scenic beauty and rich biodiversity. The
         total number of tourists in both areas increased from 475 to 1,375. This increase was made
         possible by the increased capacity to accommodate more tourists in the newly constructed lodge,
         with solar-powered electricity and the provision of sanitary services.

   Efficiency

   With regard to sustainable production grants, the cost of the total investment was S/. 3.99 millions
   while the benefits were multifold. It is estimated that the deforestation of 18,777 ha is avoided by
   introducing sustainable forest management systems. The deforestation rate was 31,281 ha per
   year before the PIMA project. The estimated carbon content sequestered by the forests managed
   and expanded under the subprojects totals 2,969 tons of CO2, equivalent per year. Increased forest
   areas and proper forest management contributed to a substantial decrease in soil erosion in the
   area. The estimated volume of the avoided erosion was 34,465 tons annually. With a price of
   US$4.00 per ton and an exchange rate of S/. 3.20, the total value of carbon sequestration is
   estimated at 38,001 S/./year.

   Two successful examples of the subprojects demonstrated that the investments are worthwhile.
   The NPV of Shebón palm reforestation after 20 years would be $56,469.67 and the IRR is 15%.
   The NPV of agroforestry systems at 20 years would be $367,201.53 and the IRR is 30%. The
   results may seem high. However, considering the size of the baseline economic activities and the
   effect of the investments on the well-being of the local people, even a small return is worthwhile.
   Considering that soil of similar characteristic costs about 5 S/./ton, local farmers saved 172,327
   S/./year.

   With reference to the efficiency of the entire project, the total project cost was US$15.8 million
   (S/. 50.56 million). The project team considered several alternatives at the time of appraisal.
   Compared to these alternatives, it can be concluded that the project was able to achieve its
   objectives without incurring a huge cost. Some alternatives were (i) establishing protected areas
   only under the strictest management regimes, and (ii) a series of GEF medium-sized projects to
   support activities within the protected areas. By choosing the comanagement of the protected
   areas, the project avoided displacing the indigenous peoples who reside in the target areas and
   reduced the pressures over natural resources in the area by offering the alternative of subprojects
   executed at buffer zones. The decentralization of technical assistance and training, as well as local
   supervision by ZCC in execution of community subprojects, as opposed to central management
   from Lima reduced costs considerably; clustering community subprojects by type and region, also
   produced scale economies.

   To face the significant reduction in anticipated cofinancing (see Section 6.7.) at MTR
   implementation arrangements were modified to reduce costs through(i) decentralization of the
   activities to the field teams of INRENA in the target zones, using the resources already installed
   locally and hiring local services for the assessments and studies, (ii) the development of



                                                       50

productive subprojects to utilize existing experiences, instead of investing in new products that
require intense research and special assessments, and(iii) clustering community subprojects by
type of activity and proximity among communities to gain scale economies

Conclusion

As presented in the previous section on efficiency, the economic analysis, although limited,
suggests that the PIMA project has generated positive economic impacts with the least possible
cost to the conservation of natural resources of the target areas and to the lives of the local
indigenous groups who play an important role in the conservation of these protected areas.

Increased productivity under
agroforestry systems (30 ha)                Component 2           2.82 times more than monoculture

The scope of this economic analysis is constrained for several reasons: 1) incremental costs were
used instead of NPV or ERR at project appraisal; 2) no adequate economic data were collectable
for Components 1 and 3, thus making it difficult to obtain the entire benefits of the project; 3)
only two sustainable production subprojects could provide enough data for a formal cost-benefit
analysis; 3) the impacts of sustainable production activities could be measured because the
activities started only toward the end of the project; and 4) the economic benefits of the
sustainable production activities were mostly for self-consumption.

The challenge would be for the participants to obtain additional financing at least the recurrent
costs of the production such as the supply of seedlings and the maintenance of equipment.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Background and Design: Beneficiary surveys were conducted in four of the target sites during
the last quarter of 2006. These surveys were part of a process to systematize the project's lessons
learned. A total of 177 persons were surveyed; from this total, about 140 (79%) were project
beneficiaries and the rest were other stakeholders including members of grassroots organizations,
local and regional authorities, and NGO experts (Table 1). These beneficiaries belong to 60
communities and about 15 grassroots organizations.
Given the wide variation in history and social settings among the sites, the PIU delegated to each
CCZ the responsibility to conduct an intensive assessment to systematize the lessons learned (see
Table 1 below) using the guidelines prepared for this purpose to: (i) select focal experiences; (ii)
identify and sample direct and indirect actors to be interviewed; (iii) analyze available
documentation related to the chosen experience; (iv) conduct field work; (v) process data; and
(vi) conduct a stakeholder workshop to evaluate and validate the results. The structured
questionnaires developed by each CCZ were aimed at gathering information on the following
topics:
    · Basic information about the beneficiary.
    · Beneficiary assessment of the focal experience prior to project implementation.
    · Evaluation of project performance/intervention focusing on the suitability of the activities,
         training provided, adequacy of local participation including women, and support provided
         by the Field Zone Teams.
    · Results/change achieved by the project intervention. The surveys sought to assess
         perceptions of change both in terms of outputs and local capacity built.
    · Lessons learned.
The guideline to systematize the experience was a useful tool to orient the process and
particularly the survey. The number of questions varied by the site and the experience assessed.
Thus, total questions varied from 9 to 15 open-choice answers. The interview was conducted in
Spanish because is a common language to most of the beneficiaries, thus avoiding the use of
multiple translators. In Santiago-Comaina the survey was not carried out because the zone team
was still fully concentrated on activities related to categorization and addressing the demands of
productive projects. The systematization process they conducted did not include outputs from
beneficiary surveys.

Main Findings:

All sites considered the Community Surveillance System an important experience to be assessed.
This was followed by the process of categorizing protected areas and the application of
productive projects (two sites each). Finally, there were experiences of particular interest to the
target site.

The application of Community Surveillance Systems to prevent encroachment and resource
deterioration was highly regarded by the beneficiaries (70%­80%). Thus, 67%­100%
acknowledged that prior to project intervention there was illegal extraction of forests and aquatic
resources. Local communities were involved in some forms of active control (40%­67%) but
lacked institutional support from a governmental institution. The IANP, through the project, met
this need. People acknowledged that the project provided training and equipment to increase
surveillance (40%­100%). However, they also considered that these inputs were not enough to
cover all critical areas. Beneficiaries also indicated that the community surveillance system
helped to decrease illegal extraction and prevent natural resource depletion (67%­100%). As a
lesson learned they identified the need to increase training, embark on a more aggressive media
campaign to deter intrusions, and implement newly identified guard posts.

The beneficiaries reported that they were aware of the categorization process (Purus and Güeppi).
Around 80% of those interviewed stated that they have participated in meetings relating to the
categorization of protected areas. In Purus, 84% agreed with the achieved result while in Güeppi
there is total consensus on the proposed categories. The perception of benefits due to final
categorization is about 66% in Purus. People responding negatively indicated that their situation
remained the same with the new protected areas while those who responded affirmatively
indicated that the park and reserve were helping to avoid loggers, protect their resources, give
opportunities to build local capacities for managing natural resources such as river turtles, and
create a good opportunity to receive tourists.

Productive projects were also highly appreciated by the beneficiaries. The responses indicated
that 53%­94% considered this activity very important because it was generating benefits for their
communities. Moreover, 80% of the beneficiaries stated that they actively participated in the
design of the project. They also affirmed that the project increased their capacity to design and
manage this type of initiative. However, they requested more training in other complementary
activities. The case of the Leoncio Prado Community (Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve)
illustrates the value of productive projects as a means to resolve conflicts over natural resource
use. Strategically located, this community has been the center of conflicts with the Reserve
Administration. The project was an opportunity for the administration to identify productive
projects that can meet local needs and conservation objectives. Thus, four projects were designed
and implemented. The survey showed that 65% of the 24 interviewees perceived benefits from
the implemented project (creating job opportunities, providing training, generating income);
furthermore, it created a friendly relationship with the Reserve Administration and promoted a
better attitude toward biodiversity conservation. It is important to note that 58%­66% of
beneficiaries felt that they can sustain the projects without external intervention because they are
better organized and have the necessary training. People who responded negatively claimed that
they still need technical assistance to resolve problems that may arise in the near future.

Overall, the surveys corroborated the positive judgment on the implemented strategies and results.
Beneficiaries confirmed the positive effect on biodiversity conservation from the encouragement
of local participation, training, the strengthening of community organization, and the provision of
ecologically sound alternatives to the inadequate use of natural resources.

Annex 6. Stakeholders' Workshop Report and Results

Two Stakeholders' Workshops were held in December 2006 (Pacaya-Samiria and Güeppi) and
another one in March 2007 (El Sira). These workshops brought together representatives of
beneficiaries, their grassroots organizations, local and regional authorities, social researchers, and
NGOs linked to the target areas. Most of the participants were also members of their respective
PAMC. These workshops aimed at assessing project results, impacts, and lessons learned. Forty-
eight people attended the Pacaya-Samiria workshop; 38 people participated in the Güeppi event;
and 43 attended El Sira workshop.

Exhaustive reports were produced, detailing the analysis of the results and lessons learned. These
events were a long-awaited opportunity to share ideas on problems and limitations encountered
during implementation, validated the results from beneficiary surveys, and gathered
recommendations. The principal findings of the workshops may be summarized as follows:

Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve:

The project highlighted the benefit obtained from a State­civil society partnership, particularly
with local communities. The Communal Surveillance Systems proved to be an adequate tool to
improve biodiversity conservation. Along this line, productive projects emerged as important
complements to control communal surveillance activities. For this purpose, building local
capacities and acknowledging community efforts to protect their environment should be included
by future projects to assure project sustainability.

Güeppi Reserve Zone:

The State is ultimately responsible for resource conservation. However, it has a good ally in local
communities. Thus, the community surveillance system was both a means to improve resource
control and increase interest and local participation to protect biological diversity. Taking into
account indigenous interest in the categorization process, it is a time-consuming process; however,
it produces better results because it creates solid constituencies in the protected areas.

Sira Communal Reserve:

The systematization of lessons learned emphasized that conservation of natural resources is a
prime objective within local communities around the Sira Communal Reserve. The transparent
flow of information to the communities proved to be an effective way to build trust between
project personnel and local people. Following a strategy to approach the communities and their
organizations based on intercultural dialogue was the basis to develop comanagement
mechanisms that were later extended to other project sites. The participants agreed that these
comanagement mechanisms had a positive effect on strengthening ECOSISA (the indigenous
organization that signed the agreement with IANP to manage the Sira Communal Reserve), as
demonstrated by the key role played during the preparation of Sira's Master Plan.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

El presente documento es un resumen de la evaluación del INRENA como ejecutor del proyecto
"Participación de las Comunidades Nativas en el Manejo de las Áreas Naturales Protegidas de la
Amazonía Peruana" - PIMA, los aspectos tratados están relacionados al diseño y la
implementación del proyecto y a las lecciones aprendidas durante su implementación.

1. Cumplimiento de los objetivos del proyecto

Se ha evaluado el cumplimiento de los objetivos de proyecto según los indicadores establecidos
en el marco lógico del proyecto: i) La pérdida de la biodiversidad esta detenida en cinco áreas del
proyecto y ii) Los pueblos nativos co-administran las áreas naturales protegidas en cinco zonas a
través de su participación en los correspondientes Comités de Gestión de sus Áreas Naturales
Protegidas. Para el cumplimiento del Indicador 1 se han establecido los siguientes criterios
indirectos i)creación de áreas naturales protegidas con estatus de protección legal definitiva,
ii)representatividad de la biodiversidad en las ANP establecidas con categoría definitiva,
iii)impactos ambientales positivos de la ejecución de los proyectos productivos y las
iv)propuestas de las áreas naturales protegidas por establecerse.

1.1 Establecimiento definitivo de Áreas Naturales Protegidas

El aumento de la cobertura de protección legal ha sido positiva, sumándose al SINANPE un total
de 2 599,171.00 has. correspondientes a la categoría II de la UICN,                y 921,414.09 has.
correspondientes a la categoría VI de la UICN, áreas que son creadas para ser comanejadas por
las comunidades indígenas beneficiarias.

a) Representatividad de la biodiversidad en las ANP establecidas con categoría definitiva
De cuerdo a la Estrategia Nacional para las Áreas Naturales Protegidas del SINANPE ­ Plan
Director (1999), se han identificado en el Perú 31 zonas prioritarias para conservación de
diversidad biológica, entre las que encontramos la zona 20: Cordillera del Sira, la zona 28: Alto
Purús y la zona 2: Cordillera del Cóndor, las cuales han sido cubiertas con la creación de la
Reserva Comunal el Sira; el Parque Nacional Alto Purús y la Reserva Comunal Purús y el Parque
Nacional Ichigkat Muja Cordillera del Cóndor y la Reserva Comunal Tuntanait.

Asimismo, se establecieron sobre Áreas de Aves Endémicas EBA (Endemic Bird Areas)4, los
Andes Tropicales "Hotspots de biodiversidad andes tropicales" y de la ecorregión Yungas
Peruanas5 ó "bosques montanos de la vertiente oriental de los andes peruanos" en los que
encontramos especies endémicas del país y en peligro de extinción.

b) Evaluación de los impactos ambientales de los proyectos productivos
Los 43 proyectos productivos han sido elaborados buscando generar impactos ambientales
positivos como repoblamiento de flora y fauna, disminución de la erosión, captura de carbono,
disminución de la deforestación, entre otros.

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



De los cálculos realizados para evaluar los impactos ambientales positivos se ha proyectado en
18777.0 ha la superficie que se dejaría de intervenir, tanto dentro como fuera de las ANP ya que
se estaría utilizando las especies reforestadas y manejadas. Con la disminución de la erosión
anual de los suelos estimada en 34 465 ton se mantiene la fertilidad y calidad de sitio que influye
directamente en una mayor productividad si hablamos de cultivos asociados y de recuperación de
flora y fauna silvestre y para el caso de la captura de carbono se ha estimado una captación de
CO2 de 2 969 toneladas anuales en 713 ha.

Por otro lado los impactos positivos de los 20 proyectos con recursos hidrobiológicos que abarcan
345 ha. de espejo de agua de piscigranjas y cochas manejadas, se ha calculado se dejen de extraer
estos recursos de 775 ha de espejo de agua con lo cual se                       espera lograr contribuir al
repoblamiento de         peces y quelonios, disminución de la depredación de los recursos
hidrobiológicos, disminución de la eutrofización, y mejora de la dieta alimenticia de las
comunidades beneficiarias

La evaluación de los criterios definidos nos permiten concluir que el establecimiento de las áreas
naturales protegidas en zona de alta diversidad de especies de flora y fauna silvestre amenazadas
y endémicas y cubriendo parte de la Ecorregión Andes Tropicales y de las Yungas Peruanas, la
generación de impactos ambientales positivos a través de la ejecución de los proyectos
productivos han contribuido a detener la pérdida de cobertura vegetal                     por lo que    la
implementación del proyecto ha favorecido la conservación de la diversidad biológica en la
Amazonía Peruana.

Si bien existen experiencias nacionales que han aplicado diversas formas de participación, la
participación directa y organizada de las comunidades indígenas en la gestión de áreas naturales
protegidas es relativamente reciente. Fue en el año 2001 cuando se impulsó un nuevo enfoque en
la relación Estado- áreas naturales protegidas-comunidades indígenas , a través de la "Mesa de
Diálogo y Cooperación para las Comunidades Nativas" creada mediante Decreto Supremo Nº
015-2001-PCM encargado al INRENA y al ese entonces SETAI (Secretaría Técnica de Asuntos
Indígenas) ahora INDEPA. El resultado de dicho esfuerzo fue la definición de un "Plan de Acción
para los Asuntos Prioritarios de las Comunidades Nativas de la Amazonía" que entre sus
diferentes temas presentó recomendaciones para ser incorporadas en el Reglamento de la Ley de
Áreas Naturales Protegidas.6


Para la evaluación del cumplimiento del presente indicador se han identificado los siguientes
criterios: a) desarrollo de instrumentos legales, b) desarrollo de proceso y de espacios de
participación, c) Formalización de mecanismos de participación y d) Condiciones necesarias para
la gestión de las ANP.

c) Desarrollo Normativo
La incorporación de la participación indígena en el manejo de las áreas naturales protegidas se
establece en el Reglamento de la Ley de Áreas Naturales Protegidas aprobado mediante Decreto
Supremo Nº 038-2001-AG con fecha 22 de junio de 2001, el que en sus artículos reconoce los
derechos como el consentimiento informado previo para el establecimiento de áreas naturales
protegidas sobre tierras tituladas de comunidades, el respeto a los usos ancestrales de las
poblaciones locales y comunidades campesinas o nativas, el derechos de los pueblos en

aislamiento voluntario y el manejo participativo estableciendo el Régimen Especial para la
Administración de Reservas Comunales, generando condiciones políticas y legales para construir
las bases del comanejo con comunidades indígenas y por ende la implementación del proyecto
PIMA.

En el marco de la implementación del Proyecto PIMA y teniendo como principales insumos las
experiencias de procesos participativos desarrollados en la Reserva Comunal el Sira, la IANP en
el año 2002 inicia la elaboración de una propuesta del Régimen Especial y lidera un proceso de
consulta con el conjunto de representantes de las organizaciones indígenas, conservacionistas,
especialistas y la sociedad civil. En el año 2005 se aprueba a través de la Resolución de
Intendencia Nº 019-2005-IANP-INRENA el "Régimen Especial para la Administración de
Reservas Comunales". La característica y profundidad de este proceso son únicas en Perú y en
Latino América por haberse construido y consultado descentralizadamente con todos los
interesados, con este proceso se marca el hito para el comanejo de las áreas naturales protegidas.

d) Desarrollo de procesos y espacios de participación
De las seis áreas naturales protegidas involucradas en el proyecto, la Reserva Nacional Pacaya
Samiria en respuesta a las necesidades imperantes para el control y vigilancia y con el apoyo de
otros proyectos inicio hace muchos años el trabajo participativo con los grupos de manejo de
recursos, principalmente hidrobiológicos. En las otras áreas naturales protegidas involucradas en
el proyecto, creadas a finales de la década de los noventa, es en el marco de proyecto PIMA, que
se iniciaron los procesos de planificación y gestión que permitieron implementar conceptos,
herramientas y metodologías participativas e interculturales, los cuáles en algunas ANP se vieron
complementados con otros esfuerzos de la cooperación internacional. Estos procesos y espacios
de participación dependieron de una u otra forma de las características político/sociales de los
actores, de la dinámica de la gestión de las ANP, del liderazgo de cada Jefatura y de las políticas
y estrategias nacionales que enmarcaron estos procesos.

En este contexto, a fin de realizar un análisis cualitativo para medir los niveles de participación en
la gestión de estas ANP durante la implementación del proyecto se ha elaborado una matriz de
evaluación que presenta dos entradas: procesos y espacios de participación implementados en el
marco del proyecto versus las áreas naturales protegidas e identificado cuatro niveles de
participación: i)sin información, ii)con información, iii)consulta y iv)consenso y compromiso
como se presenta en el Anexo Nº 04. Matriz de evaluación de la conservación participativa de la
biodiversidad con comunidades

Como resultado de esta evaluación se concluye que los niveles de participación de las
comunidades en la gestión de las áreas naturales protegidas involucradas en el proyecto PIMA se
han dado al nivel de consulta y de consensos pudiéndose resaltar tres casos: i)el proceso para la
conformación del contrato de la Reserva Comunal el Sira ­ ECOSIRA y la elaboración del Plan
Maestro por sus características han significado que en esta área natural protegida se han dado
mayores avances en el diseño y construcción del modelo de conservación participativa con
comunidades, concretándose a través de la coadministración del área natural protegida con el
Estado. ii)los procesos de categorización de las áreas naturales protegidas los cuales se han
desarrollado con la población y sus organizaciones representativas han tenido como su principal
característica la búsqueda de consensos y acuerdos como ejemplo se puede mencionar el Decreto
Supremo de la creación del Parque Nacional Alto Purus que hace explicito el reconocimiento de
los derechos indígenas en aislamiento voluntario y iii) Los proyectos productivos realizados con
las comunidades indígenas donde debemos resaltar su participación desde su planificación hasta
la responsabilidad de la ejecución, en este marco en la Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria,
retomando los esfuerzos de otros proyectos, e instituciones, el PIMA ha podido formalizar los


                                                    59

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



acuerdos de aprovechamiento para la vigilancia comunal y los permisos para desarrollar
actividades menores al interior del área natural protegida, siendo esta área natural protegida un
ejemplo a seguir en cuanto a estas experiencias.

Respecto a los espacios de participación debemos mencionar la importante función del Comité de
Coordinación Zonal (CCZ) para la implementación del proyecto donde principalmente se
tomaron decisiones acerca del otorgamiento de becas y pasantías y la selección de los proyectos
productivos, luego este espacio de participación es absorbido por el Comité de Gestión de las
Áreas Naturales Protegidas.

e) Formalización de mecanismos de participación
El desarrollo de la normatividad y los resultados de los procesos de construcción de consensos se
consolidaron con la firma del Contrato de Administración de la Reserva Comunal el Sira, el 18 de
diciembre del 2006, conjuntamente con el de la Reserva Comunal Yanesha y la Reserva Comunal
Amarakaeri, existiendo actualmente un efecto cadena en las otras Reservas Comunales y viene
significando un gran reto para el SINANPE.

f) Condiciones necesarias para la gestión de las 06 áreas naturales protegidas (julio 2001-julio
2006)
La IANP como parte de las herramientas para le monitoreo a la gestión de las ANP del SINANPE
ha diseñado la matriz que mide las condiciones necesarias para la gestión de las ANP, la cuál
identifica como principales criterios de evaluación los aspectos administrativo, legales,
institucionales y de manejo del ANP, sin embargo este último no presenta criterios limitados para
la evaluación de la gestión participativa.

Los resultados de la corrida de la matriz desde el año 2001 al 2006 nos indican lo siguiente con
respecto a cada ANP del proyecto; la Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria, en la que intervienen un
conjunto de proyectos estaría muy próxima a alcanzar las condiciones óptimas, es decir a contar
con todos los medios para un manejo efectivo del ANP, la Zona Reservada Santiago Comaina, la
Zona Reservada Güeppí, la Reserva Comunal el Sira, el Parque Nacional Alto Purús y la Reserva
Comunal Purús posee ciertos recursos y medios que son indispensables para su manejo
relacionados principalmente a herramientas de planificación y gestión participativa, pero aún les
faltan muchos elementos para alcanzar un nivel mínimo aceptable.

De acuerdo a los criterios de evaluación seleccionados para el presente indicador se concluye que
el proyecto ha trascendido sobre las expectativas de involucrar en el manejo de las áreas naturales
protegidas a las comunidades indígenas, sentando las bases para la co administración y
convirtiéndose en un reto el modelo de conservación participativa de la biodiversidad con
comunidades a ser institucionalizado en el SINANPE.

2. Evaluación del diseño del proyecto

2.1 Manejo del ciclo del proyecto

El ciclo del proyecto es uno de los enfoques metodológicos mas utilizados por la mayor parte de
organizaciones para la gestión del proceso de programación, identificación, formulación,
implementación y evaluación de proyectos.

a) La fase de programación y de identificación del ciclo del proyecto, en el caso del proyecto
PIMA se refiere a las negociaciones y firma del acuerdo con el GEF y el Banco Mundial para el
financiamiento del proyecto.

      ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)




b) La fase de formulación del proyecto, se refiere al desarrollo del Bloque B del proyecto, el que
se desarrollo en consulta con los beneficiarios sin embargo la forma de intervención y los
alcances de los acuerdos tomados en esta etapa como por ejemplo la definición de categorías de
ANP por establecerse, entre otros, generaron expectativas distorsionadas y sobre dimensionadas
de los alcances del proyecto. En esta etapa, el proyecto PIMA no fue incluido en el Sistema
Nacional de Proyectos de Inversión, debido a los vacíos con el tema de donaciones lo que ha
generado problemas de contrapartida durante su ejecución.

c) La fase de implementación, diseñada para estar a cargo de una unidad ejecutora dentro del
INRENA y con 05 unidades desconcentradas llamadas Unidades Técnicas Zonales y que a su vez
eran las Jefaturas de las ANP. Asimismo, a fin de generar un espacio de rendición de cuentas
apropiado con otros representantes de instituciones públicas y la sociedad civil principalmente
con las organizaciones indígenas nacionales se conformo el Comité Directivo del proyecto
encargado de la conducción del mismo.

d) Evaluación del proyecto, si bien es cierto el sistema de monitoreo y evaluación del proyecto ha
sido implementado limitadamente por que rebasó las capacidades financieras y operativas del
mismo, las Jefaturas de las Áreas Naturales protegidas y la IANP promovieron la evaluación del
proyecto teniendo como principales criterios la ejecución presupuestal y las estrategias de
intervención. En este contexto, la principal evaluación se dio a medio término del proyecto
durante la evaluación del Banco Mundial.

2.2 Pertinencia del proyecto

Conceptual, el proyecto presenta como objetivo a la participación como estrategia fundamental
para la conservación de la diversidad biológica, buscando la eficacia en la gestión de las áreas
naturales protegidas. Entendiéndose que la participación como proceso social debe apuntar a
resolver las necesidades fundamentales del individuo. La participación es un derecho humano
fundamental que debe ser aceptado y promovido tanto como herramienta cuanto como finalidad
de la democracia.7En este sentido, el marco conceptual del diseño del proyecto busca generar las
bases para construir ciudadanía y aportar a la gobernanza del SINANPE a través de la gestión
participativa y el comanejo.

El proyecto encierra una propuesta de cambio integral (enfoque ecosistémico) que relaciona las
actividades humanas con el funcionamiento de la naturaleza, que sienta las bases para el
desarrollo de modelos de gestión de áreas naturales protegidas distintos integrados a la realidad
ambiental, social y económica y que contribuyan al desarrollo sostenible regional. Para generar
espacios de participación, no solo en la gestión de las ANP sino también en la implementación
del proyecto se consideró la conformación de diferentes estructuras formales (establecidas en la
normatividad) y no formales, así como agentes de cambio como los promotores indígenas que
permitió la activa y real participación indígena a nivel de comunidad, organizaciones locales,
regionales y nacionales en la ejecución del proyecto y durante la planificación y gestión
participativa de las ANP.

2.3 Estructura organizativa para la ejecución técnica y administrativa

En el diseño del proyecto PIMA, el INRENA es el responsable técnico y administrativo del
proyecto y considera una unidad ejecutora del proyecto en INRENA conformada por un equipo
de proyecto central y cinco equipos de proyecto de campo los que a su vez son las Jefaturas de las
ANP. En este diseño también se concibió que la ejecución administrativa del proyecto se diera a
través de esta Unidad Ejecutora.

Asimismo, en el diseño del proyecto se concibió que el equipo de apoyo para la ejecución del
proyecto se incorpore como equipo de especialistas de la IANP, no estando considerados como
parte de la Unidad Técnica Central (Ejecutora) ya que se esperaba dotar al ente rector de
capacidades para la gestión participativa con comunidades indígenas.

3. Evaluación de la ejecución del proyecto

3.1 Eficiencia

a) Eficiencia de la implementación del proyecto, el proyecto PIMA en los inicios de su
ejecución presentó problemas de ejecución presupuestal sin embargo en los últimos tres
años logró equilibrar su nivel de gasto. Asimismo, se ha cumplido con el tiempo
programado para la ejecución del proyecto, existiendo una ampliación del mismo por
cinco meses a fin de garantizar el logro de los resultados con mejor calidad. Por otro lado,
respecto al cumplimiento de metas si ha ejecutado al 100% en algunos casos ha
sobrepasado las metas establecidas en el marco lógico del proyecto.

b) Eficiencia de la ejecución técnica y administrativa, el proyecto PIMA ha tenido como
responsable de su ejecución al INRENA, por la concepción del proyecto era necesario el
fortalecimiento institucional para la construcción de confianza y la generación de alianzas
estratégicas con las comunidades indígenas, en este sentido debido a la experiencia
institucional generada por años como ente rector del SINANPE ha resultado de vital
importancia y trascendencia su ejecución por el INRENA a través de una unidad
ejecutora y de las Jefaturas de las ANP, lográndose la presencia institucional y el
fortalecimiento institucional mínimo para llevar cabo proceso de construcción de
ciudadanía y generación de condiciones para la gobernanza ambiental como los llevados
a cabo.

El proyecto fue diseñado para ser administrado por una unidad ejecutora del INRENA,
con el cambio de gobierno y políticas se decidió hacer un contrato con PROFONANPE
para la administración del proyecto. Esta decisión probó ser positiva, dado que el
PROFONANPE había tenido experiencias de ejecución de fondos GEF y otros de
cooperación internacional. El aspecto negativo ha sido que el INRENA perdió la
oportunidad de fortalecer sus capacidades para la administración, por lo que su
experiencia y aprendizaje para la ejecución de este tipo de proyectos se ha visto limitado.

3.2 Las funciones de la gestión

a)      Planificación, los Planes Operativos Anuales (POA) del proyecto tuvieron como base las
propuestas de cada área natural protegida en el marco de los objetivos del proyecto y elaborados
con los Comités de Coordinación Zonal, (conformados por representantes indígenas para la



                                                    62

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



implementación del proyecto), la Unidad Ejecutora realizaba la compilación y organización de
estos POA para el logro de los objetivos del proyecto, para luego ser presentado a la IANP para
su revisión y presentación ante el Comité Directivo de Proyecto para su respectiva aprobación.
Además de los POA el proyecto contó con documentos de planificación que fueron
complementados con estrategias específicas como la de capacitación y la de interacción con
organizaciones indígenas, que fueron requeridos por el Comité Directivo. Todo este proceso
significó que los tiempos para la aprobación del POA del proyecto se extendieran más de lo
programado

b) Ejecutar los gastos, la ejecución del proyecto depende de un ciclo financiero que
debería garantizar que los fondos de la donación y contrapartida estén oportunamente en
el lugar indicado para la ejecución de las actividades, además de contar con procesos
transparentes.

Para completar el ciclo financiero del proyecto se requiere coordinar oportunamente con
el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas, el INRENA, el Banco Mundial, el
PROFONANPE y la ejecución local a través de las Unidades Técnicas Zonales del
proyecto ó Jefaturas de las ANP. El conjunto de estas medidas, que obedece a intereses
institucionales distintos, con propósitos como ordenar y hacer una previsión del gasto
fiscal o lograr transparencia en la gestión, hace que las posibilidades de coordinaciones
eficientes sean muy limitadas y que la regla sea más bien la incertidumbre, sin que ello
dependa generalmente de la administración del proyecto, sino de la normatividad vigente
y los métodos seleccionados para la ejecución. En consecuencia la ejecución del proyecto
sufrió constantemente de interrupciones y retrasos, que tuvieron su impacto en algunas de
las metas, que fueron modificadas y en los contratos que tuvieron que adecuarse, aunque
ello no implicó nunca la esencia del proyecto. Por otro lado, desde el punto de vista de la
ejecución el sistema tiene también complicaciones que son inherentes al hecho de que
quien paga, quien aprueba el gasto y quien formula la necesidad son tres personas
distintas carentes de un procedimiento fácil que unifique el accionar.

Otro aspecto importante de mencionar es el rol del PROFONANPE, quien para la
dimensión del proyecto y como encargado de la ejecución administrativa de otros
proyectos sobrepaso sus capacidades, optándose por apoyar con la contratación de
personal especifico para el proyecto PIMA. Por otro lado, el PROFONANPE aportó con
su experiencia de haber ejecutado fondos GEF, contratando profesionales con experiencia
en este tipo de ejecución y apoyando a detectar problemas administrativos y a prevenirlos.
Sin embargo a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados no se logró en su oportunidad la compra
de bienes y contratación de servicios lo que finalmente pudo ser regularizado.

c) Seguimiento y evaluación, el proyecto planteó un sistema de monitoreo y seguimiento
no pudiéndose levantar todos los datos por la complejidad del accionar del proyecto y las
limitaciones financieras y operativas para la realización de esta actividad. Sin embargo,
se realizaron ajustes de metas aprobadas en las misiones de evaluación identificándose las
que no son aplicables y priorizándose las metas que en ningún caso afectaron el
cumplimiento de los objetivos del proyecto.

d) Eficacia y Efectividad, para el logro de los objetivos y metas del PIMA, la ejecución
del proyecto requeriría del fortalecimiento de las capacidades de gestión, administración
y operación del INRENA y más propiamente de la Intendencia de Áreas Naturales
Protegidas (IANP), debido a la integración de la gestión de nuevas ANP al SINANPE, la
administración de la donación y la coordinación de los equipos operativos. Para este fin
se dispuso como condición de efectividad la creación de una unidad ejecutora a nivel
central y unidades regionales que fueron las Jefaturas de las ANP para la ejecución del
proyecto y realizar la vinculación permanente con las poblaciones y comunidades
involucradas.

Respecto al fortalecimiento de la IANP se optó por la contratación de coordinadores de
ANP que en toda la ejecución del proyecto han cumplido un rol de nexo entre las
actividades del proyecto, las políticas y estrategias de la IANP y la realidad de la ANP, se
considera por una lado una decisión positiva porque permitió incorporar experiencias de
otros procesos de planificación y gestión de ANP del SINANPE al accionar del PIMA así
como también permitió trasladar a otras áreas del SINANPE la experiencia de manejo
participativo, co manejo, monitoreo participativo ,entre otros. Sin embargo, el realizar la
doble función generó una recarga de trabajo que a veces desbordó las capacidades
humanas para el cumplimiento de las funciones encargadas. En este punto es importante
mencionar que la decisión de que los otros especialistas a contratar como sociales y
legales no se hayan incorporado a la IANP y conformen parte de la UTC ha sido una
perdida de oportunidad para contribuir al fortalecimiento del ente rector.

Por otro lado, un aspecto a resaltar respecto a la estructura orgánica de la UTC del
proyecto fue la incorporación de los enlaces indígenas, los cuales cumplieron un papel de
interlocución entre las organizaciones indígenas y el ejecutor del Proyecto PIMA. De
hecho, las personas que ocupan estas posiciones han sido propuestas directamente por las
dos organizaciones indígenas nacionales representativas de la Amazonía, como son
AIDESEP y la CONAP.


Autoevaluacion del INRENA Como Ejecutor del Proyecto

La ejecución del proyecto significo una sobre exigencia a la IANP, en aspectos sociales,
ambientales, administrativos, operativos y de capacidades humanas para la gestión de las áreas
naturales protegidas, sin embargo su capacidad de respuesta estuvo basada principalmente en la
experiencia del personal de campo, experiencia institucional en trabajos participativos, en la
incorporación de capacidades y experiencias de otros proyectos a través de los coordinadores de
ANP y personal directivo de la IANP encargado de monitorear las actividades del proyecto y el
soporte técnico ­ administrativo del PIMA. En este marco se han identificado un conjunto de
lecciones aprendidas entre las que tenemos las siguientes:

1. Elaboración e implementación
Los procesos de elaboración e implementación de un proyecto deben tener una mayor
interrelación por lo que un aspecto importante es capitalizar las experiencias obtenidas durante el
proceso de diseño.

2. Organización presupuestal




                                                    64

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



En relación al aspecto presupuestal es importante la incorporación de los proyectos en el marco
del Sistema Nacional de Presupuesto Público tanto en Gastos Corrientes como en el Sistema
Nacional de Inversión Pública con la finalidad de garantizar su ejecución con el cumplimiento
adecuado de la contrapartida así como su sostenibilidad. En este sentido, en la etapa de
formulación e inicio del proyecto el Estado Peruano estaba construyendo este sistema
dificultándose su aplicación principalmente al tratarse de una donación.

3. Implementación del proyecto
Relacionado a la conformación de los equipos para la ejecución del proyecto, una dificultad que
se ha tenido es la selección de cuadros técnicos que permitan una ejecución eficiente y eficaz del
proyecto por su experiencia en los temas, en este sentido por ser un tema nuevo ha sido muy
limitado la opción de encontrar estos profesionales, por lo que es importante evaluar la
contratación de profesionales de otros países y mejorar los procedimientos para selección de
personal.

Como se ha mencionado en los párrafos anteriores la ejecución del proyecto tenia muchos
profesionales nuevos en el tema de gestión de áreas naturales protegidas y su normatividad por lo
que es necesario planificar en las actividades de proyectos innovadores un proceso de inducción a
todo el personal orientando de forma y aporte profesional para los objetivos del proyecto y las
políticas institucionales.

Respecto a la contratación de consultorías especializadas, como producto de la experiencia
obtenida se considera que para la ejecución de actividades se debe analizar las características de
la intervención que pueda definir si se ejecuta a través de un tercero o se fortalece el equipo con
la contratación de consultores individuales, para el presente proyecto considerando la necesidad
de construir procesos participativos se ha tenido mejores resultados con la contratación de
consultores individuales que permitan la conformación de equipos técnicos que puedan
involucrarse y vivir en las áreas donde se realiza el trabajo.

Respecto al Monitoreo y Evaluación del proyecto, la Intendencia a través de las Direcciones de
Planificación y la Dirección de Operaciones han realizado el seguimiento a la ejecución del
proyecto sin embargo es importante fortalecer y sistematizar esta actividad de forma que nos
permita tomar mas acciones preventivas que correctivas. Se considera de vital importancia definir
una estrategia de intervención del proyecto, con una línea base que permita ir monitoreando el
resultado de esta intervención. Asimismo, en el tema de monitoreo y evaluación es necesario
medir los indicadores relacionados a la conservación de la diversidad biológica que nos permitan
establecer la relación ente las estrategias de participación y su contribución a la conservación de
la diversidad biológica.

Por otro lado, considerando la riqueza de los aprendizajes durante la ejecución de proyectos como
el PIMA es importante institucionalizar la practica de sistematización de experiencias que apoya
a la capitalización de las experiencias y construcción de conocimientos.

Una de las fortalezas aprendidas en los procesos participativos es haber expresado con claridad y
transparencia los conceptos de conservación y gestión de áreas naturales protegidas y
paralelamente ir construyendo con todos los niveles de representación indígena las bases para el
comanejo reflejado en el Régimen Especial de Reservas Comunales, lo que viene permitiendo dar
legitimidad a este modelo de gestión.

Respecto a los cambios institucionales, durante a implementación del proyecto de forma resumida
podemos mencionar que ha existido cuatro administraciones diferentes del INRENA, tres


                                                    65

     ICR for Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in the Peruvian Amazon (GEF)



diferentes Intendentes de Áreas Naturales Protegidas y tres Jefes del Proyecto no habiendo
cambios desfavorables para su ejecución respecto a sus principales líneas y estrategias. La
existencia del PAD del proyecto y la permanencia del equipo técnico de la IANP y las Jefaturas
de las ANP permitió que no existieran desajustes temporales ni contradicciones durante su
ejecución.

Se han desarrollado capacidades de diálogo intercultural, existiendo en el mismo equipo de
profesionales     condiciones mixtas, mientras algunos tenían experiencia y aptitud para la
concepción y ejecución de un proyecto intercultural, en otros casos, se encontraron resistencias
fuertes al modelo de conservación participativa con comunidades indígenas, o carencia de
experiencia en negociaciones con organizaciones indígenas. Por ello, para poder ejecutar el
proyecto la IANP tuvo que construir y fortalecer su capacidad de diálogo intercultural,
incorporando a sus equipos a profesionales indígenas y enlaces indígenas como nexos o agentes
de cambio que permitiría el trabajo con las organizaciones nacionales y regionales. Parte de
generar este dialogo en los diferentes procesos y espacios de participación entonces evidenció la
importancia de incorporar a promotores indígenas y técnicos indígenas como personal de apoyo,
sin cuyos aportes no se hubieran podido marcar la diferencia durante la implementación del
proyecto. Sin embargo, se considera aún que se tiene que poner mayor énfasis en los procesos de
planificación y gestión en el tema de interculturalidad.

Finalmente, y lo mas importante como principal lección es la satisfacción obtenida durante la
implementación del proyecto que ha permitido valorar la capacidad y compromiso de las
comunidades indígenas que están directamente relacionadas con las áreas para desplegar su
fortaleza a favor de su visión de desarrollo y de la conservación de la diversidad biológica que
nos animan a continuar generando esfuerzos para continuar con esta alianza estratégica para la
conservación y desarrollo sostenible bajo el modelo del comanejo y que consideramos es el
mayor legado de la ejecución del proyecto PIMA.
