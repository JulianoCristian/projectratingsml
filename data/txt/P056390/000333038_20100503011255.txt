Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The developmental objective of the project is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by
reducing ODS consumption level in key sectors like domestic refrigeration, foams,
sterilization, MeBr, and chillers. Achieving this objective helps Ecuador to comply with
its commitment with the Montreal Protocol.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

The Second Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Project assisted Ecuador in phasing
out Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) in the country. The project financed the
incremental costs of conversion to non-ODS technology for a group of priority cost-
effective sub-projects in key industrial sectors as well as the cost of institutional
strengthening initiatives that helped Ecuador meet its commitments under the Montreal
Protocol.

This project was the second Bank-implemented ODS phase out operation in Ecuador.
The first phase addressed the rigid foam (ECASA, MAFRICO, INDURAMA), and
aerosols (LABORATORIOS WINDSOR, CAMPOSA), with a total USD 1,566,000 grant
for industrial conversion of equipment. The OTF Grant was closed on September 30,
1998. The first phase helped to establish a local implementation mechanism at the
Ministry of Industries, which not only focused on reducing ODS at the companies
included in the project, but also on setting a regulatory framework to enable Ecuador's
compliance with the Montreal Protocol phase-out targets.

The Second Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Project (ODS II) was approved on
October 17, 2000 for an amount of USD3.406 million. Its anticipated closing date was
September 30, 2004. The closing date was extended to September 2009, to include
Ecuador's National CFC Phase-out Plan, which was expected to eliminate all remaining
CFC consumption in Ecuador by the end of 2009. This Plan was approved by the
Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (MPMF) at its 41st meeting in Montreal, on
December 2003, and allocated USD1,679,800 for a period of six years 2004-2009.

The sections below describe the country context at project appraisal and the objectives,
components, and main outcomes of ODS II, including Ecuador's National CFC Phase-out
Plan.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Montreal Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in
1987 as an international treaty to eliminate the production and consumption of ozone-
depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride
(CTC), methyl chloroform (TCA), and methyl bromide (MeBr). Scientific theory and
evidence suggest that these compounds, once emitted to the atmosphere, could
significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that shields the planet from damaging
UV-B radiation. Under this treaty, developed countries must phase out ODS by the year
2000 (2005 for TCA and MeBr). Developing countries, also known as Article 5 countries
in the context of the MP, benefit from a 10-year grace period. Table 1 below shows the
phase-out schedule for Article 5 countries.

Ecuador ratified the Montreal Protocol (MP) on April 30th, 1990 and the London,
Copenhagen and Montreal Amendments in 1993, 1993 and 2007 respectively. Under the



                                           1
    MP umbrella agreement adopted for Ecuador in 2000, the Government of Ecuador (GOE)
    committed to a) freezing 1999 CFC consumption at average 95-97 consumption levels, b)
    reducing CFC consumption by 50 percent by 2005, c) reducing CFC consumption by an
    additional 35 percent by 2007, and d) phasing out CFC consumption by 2010. The
    country's commitments under the MP are summarized in Table 1 below.

    In 1992, the GOE launched its first initiative to eliminate most of the consumption of
    CFCs (calculated at the time on approximately 12,000 tons) by the year 2000. The plan
    was structured in two phases (each of four years, starting in 1992) and established
    targeted ODS consumption reduction goals in key sectors, including domestic
    refrigeration, halons, foams, sterilization, methyl bromide and chillers, according to the
    phase-out plan determined by the MP.

    ODS Phase out Institutional Structure and Project Background

    Ecuador committed to achieve ODS phase out according to the MP schedule for
    developing countries. The country developed its Country Program (CP) in February
    1992, which was approved by the Executive Committee of MPMF at its March 1992
    meeting. The Country Program reflects Ecuador's commitment and plan to comply with
    the Montreal Protocol, and sets the ground for obtaining MPMF grants to help meet the


                                                      2
CP objectives. As part of the document, Ecuador established its baseline consumption
level for Annex A Group I substances at 301 ODP tons (average consumption of 1995-
1997); and for Methyl Bromide at 66 ODP tons (1995-1998 average). As a net importer
of MP controlled substances, the GOE also expressed its intention to ban the import of
CFC-containing equipment and to implement a license system for CFC imports.

GOE established an implementing unit for the first ODS Phase-out Project implemented
by the World Bank at the Ministry of External Trade, Industrialization and Fisheries
(MICIP)1, the Unidad de Gestión Ambiental (UGA)2. This unit has become the official
focal point for all related topics and matters regarding the implementation of the
Montreal Protocol in Ecuador. Sub-grant agreements, which are also part of the
implementation strategy of the Bank, would be signed between MICIP and sub-project
beneficiaries and administered by the PU.

ODS Consumption and Production

Table 2 below shows yearly consumption3 of ODS at time of initial project preparation
(Phase Out I, in 1995) by type of chemical. Ecuador's main consumption at the time, was
centered in Annex A, Group I substances (CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CFC-114),
which was approximately 314.7 MT in 1995 and 320 in 1997. Corresponding figures for
Annex A, Group II substances (halons) were 16.5 MT in 1995 and 0 MT in 1997 and for
Annex E (Methyl Bromide) 66.2 MT in 1995.Additional lower consumption of CTC and
TCA as solvents was present at very low levels of ODP (Ozone Depleting Potential).

 Consumption, as defined by Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol, means production plus
imports minus exports of controlled substances.

Ecuador has never been a producer of ODS and therefore, its consumption is calculated
on the basis of its imports. Total 1995 consumption (approximately 5,000 ODP tons), was
mainly distributed among the following three sectors:

   ·    Refrigeration, air conditioning and foaming: approximately 84%
   ·    Halons 4%
   ·    Methyl Bromide: 11%

By 1995 domestic refrigeration use and servicing were the predominant consumers of
ODS in Ecuador.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The developmental objective of the project was to protect the stratospheric ozone layer
by reducing ODS consumption level in key sectors like domestic refrigeration, foams,
sterilization, MeBr and chillers. Achieving this objective helps Ecuador to comply with
its commitment with the Montreal Protocol.

The original PDO's key indicators established by the Bank at ODS Phase II appraisal, to
monitor performance were:




                                                      4
      (a) ODS in MP's Annex A Group I4 to be reduced from the baseline level of 301
          imported MT ODP by 57% to 129 MT ODP by the year 2004; target consumption
          for 2006 at 80 MT ODP and target consumption for 2009 of less than 46.56 MT
          ODP;
      (b) ODS in MP's Annex E5 to be reduced from 91 tons ODP at 1998 consumption
          level to 51 tons ODP in 2004.


1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The project was financed through grants approved by the MPMF and channeled through
the Bank in the context of the umbrella agreement adopted for Ecuador in 2000. The
grants were linked to specific subprojects that were approved on a regular basis at the
meetings of the MPMF Executive Committee (ExCom), that took place three times a
year. The OTF Grant in Ecuador was signed for US $ 3,406,000, which corresponded
only to an indicative ceiling. This implied that, as an implementing agency, the World
Bank could present individual sub-project proposals on behalf of the Government of
Ecuador for a combined maximum value of US $ 3,406,000.

At the project preparation stage, it was known that developing countries had until January
1st , 2010 to completely phase-out the use of CFCs. The initial completion period for the
Grant Agreement signed in October 17, 2000, was established with the understanding that
extensions would be required to comply with the Montreal Protocol schedules and were
subject to acceptable implementation performance. At that time, it was widely
acknowledged by the Bank and other implementing agencies that the indicated timeframe
to complete phase-out activities in all sectors was not possible and the full treaty period
through 2009 was needed.

Under this context, the project closing date was extended once, from September 30, 2004
to September 30, 2009. The umbrella agreement adopted for Ecuador in 2000 remained
as the appropriate instrument for channeling the Bank's support on ODS phase-out
implementation, and its extension was a cost-effective means of continuing to support
Ecuador's program. The extension followed the pace at which the industrial sector
adopted the Montreal Protocol commitments and also the volatile political situation of the
country, which affected progress in legislation and implementation of new institutional
frameworks.

The Project Development Objective remained the same. However, the PDO's key
indicators and components were updated, to enable a complete CFC Phase-Out by the
end of 2009. The allocated grant amount remained the same, but the balance of the funds

    (i) Industrial conversion in enterprises in the foam and refrigeration sectors whose
            productive processes involve the use of CFCs;
    (ii) Implementation of Refrigerant R&R Plan;
    (iii) Regulations that guarantee compliance with the MP and achievement of the
            National Phase-out plan;
    (iv) Training of service workshops and customs officers;

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiary of this grant was the global population, as the negative effect over
the stratospheric ozone layer was reduced. Global benefits resulted from the elimination
of ODS, as depletion of stratospheric ozone could lead to significant increases in UV
radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Increased UV radiation could in turn lead to
adverse human and animal health effects, as well as ecosystem impacts. The ozone layer
protects the biosphere from this type of radiation.

The direct beneficiaries were private sector industrial and commercial enterprises and
selected private/public institutions from Ecuador that were introducing ODS-reducing
technologies approved by the Bank's Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) and
the ExCom. Technicians and small service workshops that used ODS during their service
also benefited, as they were trained in alternative technologies.

The specific number of enterprises that benefited from the project included:

    (i)      2 large companies (ie. Indurama, Ecasa), in the domestic refrigeration and 4
             large companies (ie. Elasto, Industrias Verton, Rojas Hermanos, and M
             Refrigeración) in the flexible foam sectors;
    (ii)     130 R&R Service Workshops for air-conditioning in motor vehicles and
             domestic refrigeration;
    (iii)    1010 technicians in 20 provinces trained in best refrigeration practices;
    (iv)     1 large flower growing company (ie. Plantador), and
    (v)      Additional companies that are part of the flower growing industry that
             benefited from the MeBr alternatives demonstration research (ie. Sande del
             Ecuador and others).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

To support Ecuador's phase-out schedule, a grant amount was calculated according to the
country's ODS consumption levels from 1995 to 1997, the thresholds per sector
established by the Montreal Protocol and estimated demand growth. The project was
signed for USD 3,406,000, as an investment grant from the Montreal Protocol's
Multilateral Fund. Two components were approved as follows:

1.6 Revised Components

Additional Activities

When the project got extended, the main subproject implemented over the 2004-2009
period was the National CFC Phase-out Plan, the main objective of which was to
completely eliminate consumption of CFC by the end of 2009. Table 7 below shows a
summary of the activities developed and related budget under the National CFC Phase-
out Plan. During implementation, the budget was reallocated according to needs, actual
costs and findings from feasibility studies. At the end, the Plan disbursed $1,188,135, as
some sectors and activities were not carried out.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The first Ozone Depleting Substance Phase-out Project helped set up targets for the
different ODS industries, under realistic timeframes. Also, this phase built an important
trust base between industry and MICIP, which was important to collaboratively set the
phase out schedule. The first phase included the largest ODS consumers, after a long
public awareness campaign. The success of this phase was key for the industries to rely
on the national authorities to advance to the phase-out targets, and to implement their
own industrial conversion activities. The first phase helped MICIP know the ODS
consuming sectors, consumption levels, and stakeholders, so that feasible and cost
effective industrial conversion activities could be devised for the second phase.

The second Ozone Depleting Phase-out Project was oriented to completing the work
initiated with the first operation on the market, especially regarding the ODS consuming
companies which has already engaged in some conversion projects in the past. In
addition, the project wanted to expand the base of potential companies to be converted to
non ODS technologies, mainly in the refrigeration and foaming sectors. By the time the
project was prepared, there was clarity on the levels of consumption of ODS and on the
ODS using sectors. Aware of the phase-out schedule to be complied with, goals for
phase-out were set by the time the project was designed. These original indicators were
later revised to accommodate to the realistic ODS phase-out process that was taking
place. In addition, Methyl Bromide consumption was increasing as a result of the new cut
flower industry growth. Therefore, the second operation had also some activities and
resources oriented to phase-out the consumption of this other substance.

2.2 Implementation

The GOE has shown a strong commitment to adhere to its Montreal Protocol phase out
schedule. The GOE carried out different activities in connection with the diffusion of
ozone layer depletion issues. Additionally, the GOE complied with the revised Montreal
Protocol by committing to (a) freezing 1999 CFC consumption at 1995-1997
consumption levels, (b) reducing CFC consumption by 50 percent by 2005, (c) reducing
CFC consumption by an additional 35 percent by 2007, and (d) phasing out CFC
consumption by 2010.

There was no official mid-term review (MTR) before extending the project to 2009,
although the key implementation indicators set up at the project inception were adjusted
when the National CFC Phase-out Plan was approved by MPMF in December 2003.

In 2005, thanks to the CFC National Phase-out Plan, Ecuador was already in compliance
with the MP phase-out targets. By the end of 2005, ODS consumption was reduced from
147.8 ODP in 2004 to 138.48 ODP tons in 2005. Methyl Chloroform (MC) consumption
decreased from 2.5 ODP tons in 2004 to 0.817 ODP tons in 2005. The implementation of
the licensing system was essential to this task, by setting import quotas according to the
desired phase-out schedule. Complementary collaboration with the Customs Corporation
was also very important for this success.

Despite the good results attained with the CFCs, Ecuador experienced difficulties in
enforcing the MeBR phase-out targets in 2005 and 2007. Part of the problem in 2005 was
related to the lack of custom classification. The issue was corrected through a correct
custom classification of substances containing MeBr, so that the approval could work as
efficient as with the other ODS procedures. In 2007, the problem was that MeBr imports
were approved for pre-shipment and quarantine use, uses that are not controlled by the
Montreal Protocol. To prevent that situation to happen in the future, MIPRO led an
institutional agreement with the agriculture and custom entities to control MeBr imports
at reasonable levels. In addition, the project financed activities to raise awareness on
MeBr alternatives, and to eliminate the use at one of the former large MeBr consumers.
By 2008 the consumption was already at 102 ODP MT of MeBr, including 17 ODP tons
for pre-shipment and quarantine. In 2009, the level had descended to 85 ODP tons MeBr.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Performance indicators as originally designed, included ODP to be phased out,
disbursement, cost effectiveness, and time needed to complete activities (signing sub-
grant agreements, physical completion, and financial completion). Information on these
indicators is included in the Project Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the
GOE and submitted to the MPMF Secretariat after each subproject was completed.

Since reporting ODS consumption levels is mandatory, in order to achieve compliance
with the MP phase-out targets, monitoring and evaluation is directly linked to the project




                                           10
objectives. Monitoring investments was relatively easy, since there are obligations to
destroy replaced equipment, and since ODS imports were progressively reduced.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Grant funding was extended under the project to sub-projects to phase out ODS in all
sectors for which the ExCom approved sector guidelines. Under these guidelines, the
ExCom evaluates and approves replacement substances. The project was classified as of
Category B. All expected environmental impacts were positive. The project dealt with
existing enterprises and relatively small quantities of ODS. Safety issues that might have
been associated with some of the substitute chemicals were properly addressed project by
project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The MPMF finances incremental operational and capital costs for sub-projects. In the
cases where anticipated sub-projects took place, equipment purchased was fully paid for
each company (in some cases, firms contributed their own resources). Sustainability of
the project as a whole has been guaranteed by establishing a Law for the Control of
Ozone Depleting Substances (2007), to limit the imports of ODS, together with the
allocation of economic resources. Companies were given incentives to phase out ODS,
and when ODS sectors were clear of ODS consumption, the issuing of the Law a norm
prohibiting the consumption of these chemicals is being passed to prevent new companies
from coming into the market and resuming the use of these substances. In any case, the
licensing system and the import quotas generate a barrier to avoid ODS imports outside
the MP phase-out targets. Although the country has faced an unstable political period and
timelines for project implementation and institutional strengthening activities have been
postponed, activities have advanced and concluded.

UGA-MIPRO has been strengthened enough to implement and monitor the MP phase-out
for the years to come, provided institutional strengthening funding from MPMF is
available. UGA's salaries and overheads are fully paid by GOE. Once the country has
complied with the phase-out of CFCs, it is now committed to start a new phase for the
elimination of HCFC (Hydrocloro-fluorocarbons). The United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) will the new Implementing Agency for the Institutional Strengthening
activity, which will be important to undertake controls, training and awareness on HCFC
gradual phase-out. The MPML has allocated US $ 150,000 for the preparation of this new
phase.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project development objectives were in line with the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS). Most important, the project was developed at a time when Ecuador needed the
most assistance to meet its commitments to the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol,


                                            11
developing countries were expected to reduce their consumption of CFCs by 50 percent
by 2005 and 85 percent by 2007. The project helped Ecuador meet these objectives.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environment Objectives

Project success is deemed Satisfactory, as measured by the three main indicators. The
fundamental objective of the project was to ensure that Ecuador could meet its Montreal
Protocol targets to phase out ODS by 2010. Under ODS II Ecuador's CFC consumption
decreased from a baseline of 301 tons to zero at the end of 2009, as anticipated. The
project was able to build institutional capacity to bring long-term benefits to Ecuador,
guaranteeing sustainability.

Ecuador and its Montreal Protocol Obligations

Data on ODS consumption in Ecuador have shown positive decline since 1997. Although
the descent in annual consumption has not been consistent, the year 2004 marked a clear
tendency to ODS phase out in the country, as seen in Table 8 below. The GOE called for
consumption of CFCs not to exceed 129 MT in 2004 and the Montreal Protocol
established a baseline consumption of 242.95 tons in 2002. Under the 2004 Annual Plan,
the GOE implemented the licensing system, together with import quotas. These two
activities, enabled the country to reduce CFC consumption to 28.33 ODP tones in 2007
(33% below the target consumption) and to 8.19 ODP tones in 2008, 61% lower than the
maximum allowed consumption for that year (21 ODP tones).

The Montreal Protocol phase out commitment established three main reduction targets:
the 1999 ODS consumption freeze (national average consumption 1995­1997), a 50
percent reduction in ODS consumption from a 1999 freeze level by 2005, and a complete
phase out by 2010. Ecuador has complied with these targets.

The MPMF allocated to Ecuador US $ 3.4 million to meet the above indicated targets,
however only US $ 2.8 were spent to fully achieve them. The cost-effective activities
developed to phase-out ODS at the different ODS consumption sub-sectors, resulted on
the overall project's cost-effectiveness.

3.3 Efficiency

Not applicable

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of ODS II is rated satisfactory for a number of reasons: (i) the
GEO was achieved because the country has been meeting its consumption reduction
commitments under the Montreal Protocol through a series of activities including the
projects mentioned above in which the Bank was involved; (ii) the project eliminated the
consumption of CFCs in the refrigeration and foams sectors, leading consumption to
zero; (iii) it built substantial capacity in terms of R&R and service workshops nationwide,
providing a base for adequate service and recovery techniques; and (iv) the project helped
get MeBr to compliance levels.

4. Assessment of Risk to Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low or negligible

The risk to the global environmental outcome is minimal; project sustainability is rated as
likely. Ecuador has shown to be committed to adhering to its Montreal Protocol


                                                13
obligations and has completely phased out CFC by 2010. The 2009 data show that the
country has been meeting its obligations and has already met the 2010 deadline. On
MeBr, the level of consumption has decreased to levels that are fully into compliance
with the MP. Also, the GOE has raised public awareness of the need to protect the ozone
layer, and consumers are interested in purchasing non-ODS products. Companies that
received MPMF funding disposed of their CFC equipment, under MIPRO supervision.
The import licensing system enables MIPRO to set quotas that are on track with the MP
phase-out schedules. Finally, the issuing of the Law for the Control of ODS approved in
2007, has become a substantial contribution to control the imports of these substances.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Throughout the project life, Bank staff worked closely with MICIP to ensure proper
identification, preparation, and implementation of sub-projects. Local consultants were
hired for project preparation and implementation. The Bank also provided valuable
support to the GOE in the strategic policy design and during its negotiations at the
ExCom meetings and hired highly specialized consultants to support the GOE in key
sectors.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was adequate, as Bank staff worked closely with MICIP/MIPRO to conduct
periodic supervision missions during the project. The Bank visited the companies with
projects under implementation and provided guidance and technical support. At the same
time, MICIP/MIPRO supervised and assisted the companies throughout implementation.
Continual reports, including Implementation Status and Results Reports and Project
Completion Reports, were prepared and submitted to the Bank and the MPMF
Secretariat.

To mainstream Montreal Protocol operations, Project Supervision Reports (PSR), which
were not required earlier, were properly introduced. At the end, MP projects follow both
the WB's and MPMF's reporting and monitoring requirements. An audit conducted by a
consultant hired by MPMF showed that the Plan was being implemented according to the
project proposal objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory



                                          14
The project helped Ecuador meet its ODS consumption commitments under the Montreal
Protocol. ODS consumption was eliminated according to the National CFC Phase-out
Plan. MeBR consumption, which was at high levels at the beginning of the project
extension (2004) has reduced to compliance levels. Additionally, the activities
undertaken in terms of training and capacity building at the local level, met the goals,
reaching more than 1,000 technicians nationwide.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The GOE was responsible for identifying the sub-projects and industrial sectors that
would request funding from the MPMF. The government was able to establish a clear
strategy to create awareness of ozone depletion and prepare sub-projects in different
industrial sectors. The GOE's leadership and vision ensured that the program developed
was appropriate to adhere to the ODS phase out schedule of the Montreal Protocol.
Hence its performance is assessed as satisfactory. This was done through the Ministry of
Industries and Competitiveness. An ozone management unit (UGA) was created, and has
been financed out of the national budget (ie, salaries and overhead). This has guaranteed
continuity and consistency.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

UGA-MICIP's role as implementing agency was satisfactory as the project documents
prepared were done on time and were of high quality. In addition, supervision reports for
ongoing projects were also of high quality and always submitted on time to the World
Bank. The team at MICIP/MIPRO worked very closely with the World Bank during the
whole project. The logistics for Bank missions were prepared on time by MICIP/MIPRO
for the World Bank, which made supervision easier.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the government during the project is assessed as satisfactory
for the reasons mentioned above. The objectives of the grant were met, and Ecuador is
well on its way to phase out ODS completely by 2010.

The project was successful because of the following main reasons:

   a. Ecuador reduced its consumption of ODS Group I by about 57% from 2000 to
      2005. Consumption of CFC during 2008 was 61% below the allowed quota, and
      at the end of 2009 was zero. These reductions have met the objectives of the


                                           15
      National CFC Phase out Plan and have ensured that Ecuador adheres to its MP
      phase-out commitments.
   b. The World Bank implemented projects in Ecuador phased out about over 200
      ODP tones, counting CFCs, MC, and MeBR. Capacity was built in key sectors
      that included refrigeration and recovery and recycling.

6. Lessons Learned

The main lessons that can be drawn from this project are:

Sectoral Approach
The project successfully contributed to eliminate consumption of ODS. Consumption of
CFC was mostly present at the refrigeration and foam sectors Sub-projects were aimed at
completely phasing out consumption of ODS in these sectors. This approach proved very
successful because it gave the country the flexibility to implement the project using the
technology of its choice and the responsibility to meet any additional costs involved. As a
result, the costs of eliminating ODS were lower than expected, making the cost
effectiveness higher than initially estimated.

Import Control
In addition, by establishing a well managed and enforced ODS Import Licensing System,
GOE was able to set import quotas according to the ODS phase-out targets. These levels
of imports, coupled with the industrial conversion, and training activities proved the need
to collaborate amongst sectors (ie, industry and commerce) to ensure compliance and
sustainability.

Institutional strengthening
The project effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening of MICIP/MIPRO,
and other GOE institutions such as the Customs Office. While the ozone unit gained
considerable experience in negotiation techniques at the international level and a better
understanding of the mechanisms of several agencies of the United Nations,
MICIP/MIPRO gained extensive capacity on project management and the Bank's
procurement and financial management procedures.

Capacity Building
Training was very important for the technicians actually dealing with ODS at the
refrigeration sector. Conducting this activity trough SECAP, the training and capacity
building national service, was effective in allowing the program reach nationwide.

Government Commitment
Government commitment played an important role in the project implementation success.
GoE kept the same team working on the project from the beginning to the end. The team
was GoE's regular staff and its financing also came directly from the Government.

Availability of alternative technologies




                                            16
Inducing and facilitating industrial conversion to non-ODS technologies was possible
because there were replacement technologies in the market, and because MPMF pais for
the incremental costs. Without the project, ODS using companies would have had to
compete with international companies that were receiving grants elsewhere. In many
cases, the market was already restricting consumption of goods manufactured with ODS.
The financial and technical assistance resources provided by MPMF, helped companies
in Ecuador to ease the transition to the new technologies and market orientation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I ­ Technology Conversion Subprojects

Domestic refrigeration sub-projects

Sub-projects sought to completely eliminate the use of CFCs in the manufacturing of
domestic refrigerators. The companies were using CFC-12 as refrigerant, which was
replaced by HFC-134a. The projects were implemented retroactively, as the companies
had already begun conversion processes during ODS Phase Out I and had made
investments to guarantee adequate technology conversion. Table 5 below describes the
projects' main features. Cost-effectiveness thresholds were established by MPMF for the
financed subsectors, in order to determine the maximum grant per sub-project.

        Ecasa. This subproject was approved by MPMF in January 1998 during the 24th
        ExCom's meeting. With this sub-project, an annual amount of 15.73 MT CFC-12
        was eliminated, by replacing it with HFC 134a. The plant, located in Quito,
        belonged to Ecuatoriana de Artefactos S.A. ­ ECASA. ECASA produces
        domestic refrigerators, freezers, stoves and other domestic appliances. It produced
        69,810 domestic refrigerators in 1997. The enterprise carried out part of the
        industrial conversion of its equipment with its own resources and asked for
        retroactive reimbursement from the Multilateral Fund. The technology conversion
        included the purchase of conversion kits, pumps, refrigerating gas charging
        equipment, retrofit kits, PCU couplings, leak detectors, as well as testing and
        training of ECASA personnel.

    ·   The company began to use HFC-134a as refrigerant in October 2000. It had
        already converted its foaming operations to HCFC-141b in 1995 through another
        MLF project. All equipment and accessories used to produce with CFC-12 were
        destroyed and the final disposal of such equipment took place on May 24, October
        30 and November 20, 2001, under the inspection of UGA-MICIP officers and
        ECASA personnel. Although the project's completion was expected to take place
        in February 2000, full implementation did not take place until November 2001.
        The company faced some difficulties in calculating the costs of prototyping and
        trials, mainly as a result of the logistics involved in these processes. This
        constraint and the lack of appropriate information from the foam project affected


                                               19
       the approval process from the ExCom and influenced the level of funding that
       was finally approved by the MLF, which was smaller than anticipated. Delays
       were also the result of political and institutional changes at the government level
       that hindered timely reimbursement to the company. Despite these constraints, the
       project was implemented in an efficient manner. By October 2003, the company's
       production had been affected by Ecuador's economic situation and only 14,862
       units were being manufactured with consumption of 2.12 HFC-134a tons.

   ·   Indurama. This CFC-12 domestic refrigeration project was approved in November
       1998, by MPMF's ExCom at its 24th meeting. The objective of this project was to
       assist Indurama, a domestic refrigeration manufacturing company located in
       Cuenca, in acquiring all necessary equipment to replace the use of CFC-12
       refrigerant with HFC-134a. The company had already converted its foaming
       operations to HCFC-141b in 1995 through another MPMF project. Indurama
       phased out 28.38 tons ODP with $174,792 funded by MPMF. It started
       production with the new technology in June, 2002. Part of the equipment was
       retrofitted as part of the conversion process (vacuum pumps) and part was
       replaced (ie, charging stations and leak detectors). Old CFC using equipment was
       destroyed in August 28, 2002, in presence of officers from UGA-MICIP and
       Indurama.

   ·   Although the project closure was delayed (from 06/2001 to 09/2002), this was
       mainly due to the learning on procurement processes. Political changes at ministry
       level and governmental instability also contributed to delaying the signing
       capacity of the official entities, which was necessary for grant agreements,
       disbursments and overall project implementation. Despite a later than anticipated
       closing date, the project was implemented in an efficient manner, as a result of
       good coordination between Bank staff, MICIP and the company.

Flexible Foam Sub-project
The ELASTO S.A. subproject eliminated 32 ODP tons of CFC-11 and Methylene
Chloride used in the fabrication of flexible foams, by replacing them with HCFC-141b.
ELASTO S.A. is an automobile and furniture component manufacturing plant located in
Quito. The funds were utilized to acquire new foam injection equipment and training.
The project, approved in November 1998 and completed in October 2002, received a
MPMF grant of $187,286. The baseline equipment (Admiral injecting machine and
Elastogram F-50) was destroyed in the presence of ELASTO and UGA-MICIP officers
on October and December 2002. Implementation delays were mainly the result of
changes at the institutional level.

Methyl Bromide
There were two subprojects implemented in this sector. The first subproject had as its
objectives to test and demonstrate viable and cost effective replacement alternatives to
the use of Methyl Bromide in the flower growing industry. A potential investment project
was also foreseen at a later stage, as a practical application of lessons learned from the
demonstration project.


                                           20
GOE was in non-compliance in 2005, as total MeBR imports totaled 255 MT while the
quota established for that year was 88 MT. The demand of the flower growing industry
for ODS, the main reason of the increased consumption of MeBr, was on average 187
MT per year. Flower growing companies are critical to Ecuador from a social
perspective, as they employ over 90,000 people in rural areas and 90% of them are
women. As of 2007, the GOE began working on an Action Plan to ensure compliance
with the MP and implement the use of alternatives to MeBr in the flower sector before
2015. All interested parties (flower producers, MeBr importers, research facilities and
international organizations) participated in the program's design, which was presented to
the MP Meeting of the Parties in September 2007.

Following approval, MIPRO entered into an agreement with the Escuela Politécnica del
Ejército (ESPE) to carry out research and testing on alternatives to MeBr. Agrocelone
testing was conducted in January and July 2008, and physical treatments such as
steaming and substrate management were also evaluated.

The second subproject was approved in June 2003 by MPMF, and consisted of a project
to replace MeBr with coconut substrates and managed temperature and moisture
conditions at PLANTADOR. The project received a grant of $597,945 (total cost reached
$1.18 million), which helped phase out 72 MT BrME. PLANTADOR is a large flower
growing industry, specialized in producing genetically improved varieties, and in
commercially selling seedlings and flowers to foreign clients.

Sterilization of Hospital Instruments
The project sought to replace the use of CFC-12 in sterilization processes at hospitals,
with alternative technologies. However, when funds were made available, MIPRO found
that all potential grant beneficiaries had already phased-out their CFC consumption, and
the sub-component was cancelled.

Halons
Although the PAD included some resources to explore potential Halon 1211 phase-out,
MIPRO found out that there was no consumption. Therefore this sector had no activities
funded by the project. Since 1995 there have been no imports of halons.

Component II ­ Institutional Strengthening

Institutional Strengthening
There were four (4) Institutional Strengthening Activities approved by MPMF since the
approval of ODS II. These activities are regularly approved by MPMF for Annex 5
countries to ensure institutional capacity to promote and implement the policies and
projects required to comply with the Montreal Protocol. The activities approved and
implemented totaled $450,900, and included: (a) Fifth national and provincial children
painting contest ("Ecuador Protects the Ozone Layer"), which was part of the
institutional framework sub-project; (b) Quito gathered of the meeting of the Ozone
Action Networks of Central and South America , Mexico, the Caribbean and Spanish

speaking countries, organized by UGA-MIPRO in June 2009; (c) ODS awareness
material production (ie, UNEP manual, poster, pens, brochures); and (d) audits and
accounting, and consultants.

Additional Activities:

Investment Subprojects
The investment allocation for refrigeration subprojects was not used, due to a shift in
business strategy of the identified enterprises, which now import the refrigeration
equipment and does not manufacture in Ecuador, or because they had already converted
to new alternative refrigerants. At any rate, there was no interest from companies in this
subsector to participate of the Plan.

As per the Foam Investment Subprojects, a total of $173,754 was finally disbursed, to co-
finance the replacement of foam injecting machines and mixers to the following
companies: (i) Verton ($103,172); (ii) Rojas Cepero Hnos ($18,087); and (iii) Transfrio
($52,495).

Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and Reuse
This sub-project provided Refrigerant Recovery and Recycling (R&R) equipment to
maintenance workshops. Oriented to reduce CFC leakage during maintenance practices,
it focused on two main areas:

-        Automobile air conditioning: the project sought to finance CFC-12 recycling
         machines at 35 auto-service stations. Training would also be provided to
         technicians at each of the stations.
-        Domestic Refrigeration: provide recycling equipment and the necessary
         accessories to 95 service centers across the country. The equipment would be
         used to collect and recycle refrigerant during the maintenance or repair of
         domestic and industrial refrigeration units. Training would also be provided to
         technicians on the use and maintenance of the equipment.

On July 16, 2007 Contract Number 07-078 for $676,736.20 was signed between MIPRO
and Suministros Industriales Petroleros SIPETROL S.A., to render MIPRO 130 R&R
equipment that would be donated to qualified refrigeration service workshops in three
phases: (i) Phase 1: 25 TX600 and 23 RCC770a machines; (ii) Phase 2: 36 TX600 and 12
RCC770a machines; and, (iii) Phase 3: 34 TX600 machines. Despite some delays caused
by changes in the equipment accessories, which had to be returned and exchanged for
new, adequate replacements in February 2009, all 130 R&R machines were distributed
among service workshops in October 13, 2009. Full payment for the equipment
distributed in the three phases was made to SIPETROL on January 20, 2009. Payments
were confirmed by an external audit conducted by ENYA, a local consulting firm in
December 2009. Accordingly, the GOE met with the anticipated component of the R&R
National CFC Phase Out Plan.

Good Refrigeration Practices for Authorized Training Centers (SECAP)

On September 2006, MIPRO and the Ecuadorian Professional Training Service (SECAP,
Servicio Ecuatoriano de Capacitación Profesional), signed an institutional cooperation
agreement (number 06-025) to provide 84 training sessions (40 hours each) in good
refrigeration practices to 1,008 technicians nationwide. This sub-project was completed
in full in 2008, with 78 training sessions (3,200 hours) conducted and 1,010 technicians
trained throughout the country. Total disbursements for this project concluded on April
27, 2009, according to the schedule described in Table 8 below. Funds were re-
distributed from the Training activities initially considered for chiller maintenance and
service.

Strengthening of Customs (Corporación Aduanera Ecuatoriana, CAE)
This sub-project had foreseen building a laboratory with a chromatographer. The
equipment was purchased by the government in September 2007 at a cost of $39,565, and
testing and calibration followed in 2008. In addition training to CAE personnel was
conducted for a total of $58,038. The sub-project fulfilled the foreseen results.

Chillers
This sub-project, preliminary foreseen as an ODS Phase II component, was approved as a
key component of Ecuador's National CFC Phase Out plan in 2004. Its objective was to
replace CFC-11 and CFC-12 based chillers for energy efficient technologies using HFC
134a as refrigerant. According to a survey carried out in 2005, a set of 11 units
consuming approximately 1.78 ODP tons were identified as potential candidates for
substitution. Later in 2008 and after numerous approaches from MIPRO, only two
institutions expressed interest to participate in the project: Hospital Luis Vernaza (part of
the Junta de Beneficencia de Guayaquil- JBG) and Finansur Building.

       (i)     Hospital Luis Vernaza (HLV). The hospital operated two chillers with a
               250 ton capacity each. The project had foreseen replacing this equipment
               with two alternative chillers of 350 ton capacity each, for which HLV
               sought MIPRO's support. The organizations signed an agreement on
               October 2008 to guarantee adequate implementation. However, HLV did
               not follow the terms of the agreement regarding the purchase of the
               equipment as established by the bank and disregarded its Limited
               International Bidding obligations. As a result, the Bank communicated
               MIPRO in April 14, 2009 that Hospital Luis Vernaza was no longer



                                                 23
              eligible for the chillers substitution project, as the process followed by the
              beneficiary did not follow the Bank's procurement policies.
       (ii)   FINANSUR Building. The building was using two 250 ton chillers for
              refrigeration at its facilities. It had planned to replace this equipment with
              window air conditioning units and other partially centralized equipment
              that would be installed on every floor. ENYA, an independent consulting
              firm, was hired by the Bank to analyze the project's feasibility in 2008.
              Although the study concluded the project was viable from an economical
              perspective, the Bank decided it was not eligible for support because the
              CFC based equipment was no longer in use when the study took place as
              FINANSUR had partially replaced it with other smaller equipment.
              Additionally the project's implementation would require additional studies
              regarding the new demand for refrigeration and the electric system of the
              system. As a result, on April 14, 2009, the Bank communicated MIPRO
              that the project was not eligible for funding.

Implementation and Monitoring
This activity was initially approved for $110,000. It included the financing of
Dissemination and Public Awareness activities ($20,000); and of a Consultant to
supervise the CFC National Phase-out Plan.

   (i) Dissemination and public awareness of CFC phase-out governmental policies: a
           number of public awareness campaigns was undertaken, including publicity
           and press releases at radio and local news papers covering two main topics:
           (a) Industrial Conversion invitation ($13,671); and (b) invitations to
           Workshops on Refrigeration Good Practices ($6,332).
   (ii) Implementation and Monitoring consultant. A consultant was hired to overview
           implementation of the CFC National Phase-out Plan from 2004 to 2009. A
           total of $84,130 was spent on this activity.

Complementary Activities
Other activities carried out by MIPRO in order to comply with the MP phase-out targets,
included:

   (i) Import/Export Licensing System and CFC consumption: according to CFC import
           data of 2009 that was registered by Ecuador's Central bank, consumption of
           CFC substantially decreased over the 2007-2009 period. CFC imports were
           9.3 MT during the period January-September 2009, or 55.7% lower than the
           allowed quota for the year (21 MT).
   (ii) Ratification of the Beijing Amendment to the MP: unfortunately, this anticipated
           goal was not reached during the year 2009, as a result of the country's
           unstable political situation and Congress dissolution. The Legislative agenda
           has focused on approving only a number of specific laws and disregarded
           treatment of international agreements. A new National Assembly was installed
           in July 2009 and will be in force for two years. The amendment has been
           included as a priority item in its agenda. Although the amendment has not



                                           24
been ratified, Ecuador continues to operate under the targets set by such
Amendment.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Montreal Protocol projects do not apply an economic analysis. The criteria applied was
the Cost-Effectiveness Threshold (CER=Grant Amount (US$)/Kg ODP eliminated)
calculated for each sub-project funding proposal. The cost effectiveness (or efficiency)
of the financial mechanism is a measure of how efficient it has been in utilizing funds put
at its disposal to meet its objectives. The mostsimple method used to calculate cost-
effectiveness of subprojects calculates total incremental costs of a subproject, excluding
cost of safety where applicable, divided by the amount of its Ozone Depleting Potential
(ODP) to be phased out. Cost effectiveness is defined by the following formula:

C=       IC+ 10
         M [ODP]
where:

C = Cost-effectiveness
IC = Incremental capital costs (covered by the Fund)
10 = Net incremental operating costs (covered by the Fund)
M [ODPI = Amount of ODS to be phased out annually (weighted kg ODP)

The following sector and subsector cost-effectiveness threshold values (measured in
US$/kg ODP) were applied to determine the maximum eligible OTF Grant amounts for
subprojects:

  In October 17, 2000, the Ozone Project Trust Fund Grant Agreement No. OTF 24359
  was signed between the Government of Ecuador and the World Bank, for a total amount
  of $3,406,000.00. In September of 2003, the Ministry of Industries and Productivity and
  the World Bank, acting as implementing agency, presented the Ecuador's National CFC
  Phase-out Plan to the Executive Committee of the Montreal Protocol. The plan was
  approved in December of the same year.

  Following the approval of the National CFC Phase-out Plan, the World Bank notified to
  the GoE about the approval of the extension of the project, establishing September 30,
  2009 as the new closing date.

  The GoE and the World Bank agreed on the financing of the following sub-projects:

SUBPROJECT FOR THE ECUADORIAN APPLIANCES COMPANY ­ (ECASA,
S.A.)

ECASA

The main commercial activity of this company is the production of domestic appliances
including, among other things, domestic refrigerators, and freezers.

In May of 2001, the company started to gradually introduce the refrigerant 134a, in the
production of their refrigerators. By October the company was operating at 100% with
this new alternative. With this change in technology the company stopped using 15.83
MT of dichlorodifluorocarbon (Freon-12), in their refrigeration systems.The total cost of
the Project was US$ 429,135 of which $188,545 was financed by the Montreal Protocol
Multilateral Fund.

INDURAMA

The primary commercial activity of this company is the manufacturing of refrigerators
for domestic use, stoves, freezers, refrigerated display cases, washing machines, dryers,
air conditioners and water heaters.

INDURAMA began using the CFC 134a in 80% of its production in August 2001. By
2002, they were using this new alternative at 100%. Through this change in technology
the company stopped using 28.38 MT of dichlorodifluorocarbon (Freon-12), in their
refrigeration systems. The total cost of the Project was US$ 373,748.90, of which US$
174,792.00 was financed by the Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund.

ELASTO

The primary commercial activity is the production of polyurethane foam, with a
production capacity of 390 gr/s for flexible foam, 400 gr/s for double density foam and
200 gr/s for integral skin foam. Given the characteristics of the products they
manufacture and the level of CFC imports made by this company, it was considered
eligible for the technological conversion process.

This company carried out the required technological changes and replaced
chlorofluorocarbons in their production processes. The total cost of the Project was US$
294,896.30; the amount of financing approved was US$ 187.286,00.

PLANTADOR CIA LTDA.

The objective of this sub-project was the total elimination of the 72 MT of Methyl
Bromide used in the Ecuadorian rose plant nursery sector. Methyl Bromide is used to
control a wide range of pathogens, insects, nematodes, herbs and fungi, in the soil used
for rose production. This harmful chemical was to be replaced by a coconut based
substrate.


                                           32
The total value for the Project reached US$ 1,188,863, of which US$ 579,945.00 was
provided by the Montreal Protocol Trust Fund.

METHYL BROMIDE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT

The objective of the project was to determine the economic and technical feasibility of
seven alternatives to the use of methyl bromide as a soil fumigant for control of pests in
flower plantations. The Technologies evaluated were: 1) production of organisms that
attack soil pathogens, 2) chemical control, 3) control of pathogens by incorporating
organic material into the soil, 4) combined studies with a focus on Integrated
Management of Pests and Diseases (IMPD), and 5) study of substrates that allow
producers to obtain plants with higher quality.

The research lasted 27 months, with the field analysis phase coming to an end on June 30,
2005. The results were made public at an international seminar that took place on July
20, 21 and 22 of 2005 in the Swiss Hotel in the city of Quito. During the seminar, similar
experiences developed in this field in other countries, such as Spain, Argentina and Cuba,
were presented. In addition, given the importance of the study, the results of the research
were publicized and distributed to all the participants in CD format. This included flower
farmers and all those who attended the international seminar. The amount used for this
project was US$ 161,075.75.


Additional Research with Agrocelhone

On April 18, 2005, a new research was initiated with the objective of determining the
technical and economic feasibility of agrochelone as an alternative substance to replace
methyl bromide for pest control. The total cost of the project was $199,525.75.

Additional Activities under the National CFC Phase-out Plan

With the approval of the Plan, the Government committed to the implementation of
additional activities including:



   1. A public awareness campaign was developed at the national level through the
      media, including written press, radio spots and press bulletins.

   2. Implementation of a Licensing System to control ozone depleting substances,
      with the goal of total elimination of CFCs by the 1st of January, 2010, in
      accordance with the stipulations of the Montreal Protocol. The country
      committed to reducing CFC consumption, as follows:

   3. The Ecuadorian Service for Professional Training, SECAP, was selected for the
      training program for technicians working in domestic refrigeration and vehicle air
      conditioning maintenance and repair facilities. Afterwards, more than 1,000
      technicians working in the domestic refrigeration and vehicle air conditioning
      maintenance and repair workshops were trained. Additionally 130 recycling and
      recharging machines (R&R) were delivered to the workshops where the trainees
      worked, resulting in a reduction in the consumption of CFCs and compliance with
      the established goals.

   4. The training for the Officials from the Ecuadorian Customs Corporation (CAE)
      was carried out in the City of Guayaquil and lasted 3 days. The courses were then
      replicated by those already-trained technicians, and given to 60 customs officials
      in the cities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. It was also agreed to supply a gas
      chromatograph in order to improve the control of substances that damage the
      ozone layer, under the condition that the CAE would construct a laboratory where
      this device could be installed and operated. The laboratory was finished in
      September, 2007. The total cost for institutional strengthening the CAE was US
      $58,038.88.


PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Fulfillment of the Montreal Protocol Obligations

The Ecuadorian government has been fully committed to comply with the obligations
agreed under the Montreal Protocol. It has been successful in reducing and eliminating
CFCs, in accordance with the National CFC Phase-out Plan.

In 2004, the Ecuadorian Government introduced the Import Licensing System for ozone
depleting substances (ODS), thus complying with provisions set out in the amendments
to the protocol, in addition it established maximum national consumption levels of
controlled ODS.

The technological conversions were successfully completed for the industrial companies
that had been using CFCs in their production processes (ECASA, INDURAMA,


                                          34
ELASTO, etc.). The country also complied with the control components, with training of
Customs officials to optimize control procedures in primary areas, and the controlled
gases identifiers were delivered as established by the Montreal Protocol.

Even though the Plan has fulfilled its commitment, the Government of Ecuador remains
concerned about the remnants of CFCs in the country, especially with respect to the large
numbers of older refrigerators that use CFCs and other appliances still producing CFC
gases.

Even though the elimination of CFCs has been carried out successfully, control of methyl
bromide experienced some difficulties in reaching the goals set for reducing consumption
of this product, in both 2005 and 2007. In 2005, this was due to problems with customs
classifications, which were resolved by making appropriate and clear inspections on
imports of methyl bromide.

The project unit was adequately staffed and incorporated into the Ministry of Industries'
institutional structure. The operation of this unit was fully financed by the GoE.


EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK

The World Bank contributed with its valuable assistance to the project unit in identifying,
preparing and executing the subprojects implemented to reduce and eliminate the
consumption of CFCs.

The World Bank worked in conjunction with the unit in the following areas: the design of
strategic policy, accompaniment in negotiations with the Montreal Protocol's Executive
Committee, contracting of specialized experts that provided technical support in key
sectors; and the periodic supervision of the project.
