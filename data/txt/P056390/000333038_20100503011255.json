Some lessons learned included: the\n            project successfully contributed to eliminate consumption of\n            ODS. Consumption of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) was mostly\n            present at the refrigeration and foam sectors Sub-projects\n            were aimed at completely phasing out consumption of ODS in\n            these sectors. This approach proved very successful because\n            it gave the country the flexibility to implement the project\n            using the technology of its choice and the responsibility to\n            meet any additional costs involved. As a result, the costs\n            of eliminating ODS were lower than expected, making the cost\n            effectiveness higher than initially estimated. In addition,\n            by establishing a well managed and enforced ODS Import\n            Licensing System, GoE was able to set import quotas\n            according to the ODS phase-out targets. These levels of\n            imports, coupled with the industrial conversion, and\n            training activities proved the need to collaborate amongst\n            sectors (ie, industry and commerce) to ensure compliance and\n            sustainability. Training was very important for the\n            technicians actually dealing with ODS at the refrigeration\n            sector. Conducting this activity trough SECAP (Servicio\n            Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional -Ecuadorian\n            Professional Training Service), the training and capacity\n            building national service, was effective in allowing the\n            program reach nationwide. Government commitment played an\n            important role in the project implementation success. GoE\n            kept the same team working on the project from the beginning\n            to the end. The team was GoE's regular staff and its\n            financing also came directly from the Government."}, "docdt": "2010-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
