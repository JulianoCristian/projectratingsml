Under the project,\n            6,000 families, of which 98% fall below the poverty line,\n            would benefit directly. Increased production of rice and\n            food crops on about 75,500 acres of cultivated land would be\n            achieved through rehabilitation and improvement of\n            irrigation and drainage systems, and roads and on-farm\n            development and improvement of agricultural supporting\n            services. The project includes establishing new pumping\n            plants, enlargement of main canals and distributaries,\n            construction of rice drying and storage facilities, supply\n            of farm machinery and maintenance equipment, applied\n            research, seed production, training of extension agents and\n            farmers, establishment of an extension service, and\n            consultant services for design and construction of civil\n            works and for strengthening agricultural development."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
