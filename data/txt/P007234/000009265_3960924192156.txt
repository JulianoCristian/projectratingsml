BLACK BUSH IRRIGATION PRO,ECT
(CREDIT 820-GUA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        The Black Bush Irrigation Project was the fourth Bank group
operation in Guyana. It was appraised in March-April 1977, and an IDA
credit for US$10.0 million was approved on June 6, 1978. The credit
became effective on April 3, 1980. The total estimated cost of the project
was US$42.8 million, of which US$36.1 million was to be provided by
external financing. Cofinanciers were: IFAD, US$10.0 million; USAID,
US$8.9 million; and IDB, US$7.2 million.
2.        The project was designed to benefit 75,000 acres of irrigated
land, mainly for rice production. The project area was already settled by
some 6,000 farming families, 98% of whom had incomes below US$180 per
head. The project included works to increase the flow of water in the
Canje River (the main source of water to the project area); rehabilitation
and improvement of the irrigation and drainaj7 systems; on-farm
development; and improvement of agricultural sl,pport services.
The principal area of new irrigation was to be the Black Bush Frontlands,
where total annual cropping of rice was expected to rise from 14,200 acres
to 32,320 acres. Elsewhere (in the Black Bush Polder and in Block III),
the main benefits were to be derived from increased cropping intensity
resulting from more reliable dry season water supplies, and improved crop
yields, derived from better drainage, water management, crop varieties and
agricultural services.
3.        The main implementing agency for engineering was the Rydraulics
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, under the direction of the
Drainage and Irrigation Board. The agricultural development program,
including extension, applied research, seed production and provision of
equipment for rice production and processing, was to be the responsibility
of the Guyana Rice Board. Agricoltural credit was to be provided by the
Guyana Agricultural Bank.
4.        From the beginning, project implementation was affected by the
failure of the Government to comply with the conditions of loan
effectiveness, the most Important of which was the appointment of
consultants to carry out detailed design and costing of the civil works.
It was only in March 1980 that the Government signed a contract for
professional engineering services.
5.        In September 1981, the engineering consultants presented a
technical proposal for the construction of a barrage as an alternative to a
1,000 cusec pumping plant on the Berbice River, which had been proposed at
appraisal. Meanwhile, three international firms presented proposals for a



- li -
pumping plant costing approximately double the original appraisal
estimate. On February 3, 1982, IDB stated that it would not be prepared to
finance any contract resulting from adjudication of this tender unless the
total project were redefined and financing (both local and foreign) were
fully assured.
6.        As a result of the long delays, the project cost estimates rose
from US$42.8 million at appraisal to US$72.1 million by early 1982. On
account of this and of the country's critical financial situation, the
Government decided to cancel the project on April 20, 1982. Following
further discussions, the Government reversed this decision and in December
1982 requested a review by IDA of a diminished project, costing US$23.4
million. The review mission, which visited Guyana in January 1983, was
unable to recommend proceeding in the absence of major polity reforms. The
project was cancelled on February 8, 1985, before any eng'Ieering works had
been undertaken. The only significant actions under the project were
carried out by consultants, namely: (a) final engineering design and
costing; (b) agricultural research and field demonstrations, seed and
fertilizer trials; and (c) O&M review and organizational design. Total
expenditures on the project at cancellation were: IDA, US$0.3 million;
USAID, US$5.5 million; and IDB, US$0.5 million. There were no measurable
ben6fits.
7.        The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Region. The Operations Evaluation Department has decided not to audit
the project. The draft report was sent to the Borrower on December 2, 1986
for their comments. However, no comments have been received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA BLACK BUSH IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 820-GUA)
EVALUATION SUNMARY
Introduction
During the 1950s and 1960s, Guyana became, the main rice produeer
and  exporter  of  the  Caribbean.    The  introduction  of  high-yielding
varieties in 1969 brought with it a need for improving irrigation and
drainage facilities, and  subsequent  development  plans  gave priority to
three drainage and irrigation projects, including the Black Bush project,
to meet this need. However, Government sought to hold down the price of
rice to domestic consumers, and it also gSave monopoly powers for a wide
range of rice industry matters to the Guyana Rice Board (GRB) in 1973.
Oblectives
The project, which was the Bank's second irrigation operation in
Guyana, ws. to rehabilitate and improve irrigation and drainage systems
serving 48,800 acres in the southwestern region, and to assist on-farm
development and agricultural support services serving 75,500 acres. Total
project costs were  estimated  at  US$42.8 million.    Tha 8ank credit of
US$10.0 million was to be disbursed over six years. Cofinanciers (IFAD,
USAID, and IDB) were to provide an additional US$26.1 million.
Implementation Experience
Credit effectiveness was delayed by 1-1/2 years until the
Borrower complied with conditions involving the accounts and financial
management  of  GRB,  monitoring   and   evaluation,  and  appointment  of
consultants to carry out detailed design and costing of civil works. The
report of these consultants, in September 1981, proposed construction of a
barrage as an alternative to the proposals for a pumping plant on the
Berbice River  that  had  been  examined  at  appraisal.    This and other
contracts for agricultural consulting services were financed by USAID and
IDB. Subsequently, IDB called for a reappraisal, and Government sought to
cancel the project in April 1982, partly because of rapidly inflating cost
estimates.   However,  a  revised  proposal  costing  US$25.4 million was
submitted to  IDA  in December  1982.    IDA  evaluated  this proposal as
technically feasible, but sought far-reaching assurances on marketing
policies, credit, the role of ORB, and institutional arrangements for
irrigation O&N. Nost of the credit was cancelled in February 1985 after
IDA disbursements of only US$0.34 million, a mere 3% of the credit.



Revsl
The project had no impact on irrigation or production, but had
some small benefits in the form of trained personnel. Its ERR would be
negative instead of the 132 estimated at appraisal, although it should be
noted that most project expenditures were concerned with preparation
activities for an Irrigation project that was never implemented.
SustainabilitZ
There is nothing to sustain.
Findings and Lessons
The experience illustrates once more the serious dangers of
approving projects before obtaining detailed designs to confirm both feas-
ibility and cost estimates in this regard, the project Was approved a few
months before OPS issued its guidelines for project preparation (OMS
2.28). It also illustrates the severe risks of undertaking infrastruc-
tural investments that are formulated without due concern for institu-
tional and policy constraints, especially when such investments are
complicated by cofinancing.



GUYANA
BLACK BUSH IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 820-GUA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Guyana became a republic in 1970.  Its population is 800,000,
most of whom live along a narrow coastal strip. Its economy depends on
three products: bauxite, sugar and rice. Of these, rice is the least
important in relation to GDP (52) and exports (10%). However, the rice
industry employs 30% of the country's labor force and rice is the country's
main staple food.
1.02      The heyday of the Guyana rice industry was in the 1950s and
1960s, during which time Guyana became the main rice producer and exporter
of the Caribbean. In 1965, there were 80,000 acres of irrigate4 (double
cropped) rice and 160,000 acres of rainfed rice. By 1982, the irrigated
area had risen to 110,000 acres, but rainfed rice had virtually
disappeared.
1,03      The introduction of high yielding varieties, initiated in 1969
under the USAID-financed Rice Modernization Program, brought with it a need
for improving irrigation and drainage facilities. In the Second
(1972-1976) and Third (1976-1980) Development Plans, the Government gave
priority to three big drainage and irrigation projects to meet this need.
They were: (a) the Tapakuma Irrigation Project, with 41,750 acres in the
northwest coastal area; (b) the Mahalca/Mahaicony/Abary (NMA) Project,
with 126,000 acres in the central coastal area; and (c) the Black Bush
Frontlands Project, with 75,500 acres in the southern coastal area. With
these three projects the Government hoped to raise the total area under
irrigated rice to 280,000 acres by 1985, compared with about 80,000 acres
in 1970. Of the three projects, only Tapakuma has been (nearly)
completed. The failure to achieve this ambitious target for the rice
industry resulted from: (a) severe cost overruns in engineering works;
(b) lack of financial resources; (c) inadequate management within
Government agencies; and (d) a poor policy environment.
1.04      The policy shortcomings were engendered partly by the
Government's desire to hold down the price of rice to domestic consumers
and partly by the monopoly powers granted in 1973 to the Guyana Rice Board
(GRB). The GRB was given a very broad mandate and became involved in
almost every aspect of the rice industry. By law, all paddy, except that
retained by farmers for their own consumption, had to be sold to GRB at
fixed prices, with credit repayments deducted from paddy receipts. GRB was
also vested with most of the modern drying, storage, and milling facilities
In the country, and was a major contractor of farm machinery services.
These powers were resented by farmers, especially since GRB was perceived
as a wasteful, high-cost operation, offering low prices for paddy and



-2-
producing low quality milled rice. By the late 1970s, most of the GRB's
plant and equipment, including its farm machinery, was in disrepair, its
accounting system was primitive, and the institution was clearly in need of
radical reform.
Bank Group Operations in Agriculture
1.05      The Bank group has financed four projects in the agricultural
sector, of which the Black Bush Irrigation Project was the fourth. The
first was an IDA credit of US$2.2 million for ranch and livestock
development (221-GUA), signed in November 1970 and closed in June 1979, two
and a half year after the original closing date, with a small amount
cancelled. This project suffered from management, i w titutional, and
technical problems, and the Performance Audit Report concluded that the
project had a minimal impact on beef production in Guyana.
1.06      The second was a Bank loan of US$12.9 million to help finance the
Tapakuma Irrigation Project (1016-GUA), with a cost estimated at appraisal
at US$18.5 million. The project became effective on May 22, 1975, two
years after appraisal, and closed on December 31, 1980. By closing date,
costs had risen to US$47.4 million, with a part of the civil works still
incomplete. The Project Completion Report (July 1982) pointed to the
success of the project in achieving its productive goals, but the Project
Performance Audit Report (August 1982) made strong reference to the policy
issues affecting the project, especially those concerning rice pricing,
marketirg, water charges and project O&M. It drew attention to the failure
of the-Government in most of the policy areas affecting the project.
1.07      The third operation in the sector was a Bank loan of US$10.0
million to finance the Upper Demerara Forestry Project, with a cost
estimated at appraisal of US$30.5 million. The loan was signed in December
1978 and became effective in May 1979. Implementation of the project
suffered from financial, managerial and marketing problems. Nevertheless,
a supplementary IDA credit of US$8.8 million was approved in 1985 to help
complete the project. The project is still under supervision and continues
to suffer from severe technical and managerial problems.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND FINANCING
Project Area
2.01      The Black Bush Irrigation Project is in the southwestern region
of Guyana between the Berbice and the Corentyne rivers.  The area is a low-
lying coastal plain, parts of which are below sea level. Precipitation in
the area occurs mainly as high intensity showers, with an annual average of
about 80 Inches. The average monthly temperature at New Amsterdam, the
largest urban area in the region, is 820F. The region has more than
200,000 acres which have been, or could be, developed for irrigated
agriculture, mostly lying on the right bank of the Canje river, from which
water supply is obtained for those areas presently under irrigation. At
the time of appraisal, approximately 38,500 acres were irrigated for rice
production, and 44,000 acres for irrigated sugar.



- 3-
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.02      The first irrigation scheme in the region (Block III), was
developed in the 1940s and 19509 by private farmers to provide full water
control for 19,400 acres. The adjacent Black Bush Polder Scheme was
completed by the Government in 1963, providing 26,500 acres of new
irrigation, but its construction ctut off water supplies from an area known
as the Frontlands (29,600 acres), which had previously taken water for
supplementary irrigation from the Black Bush swamps. At the time, it was
the intention of the Government to proceed with the development of the
Frontlands, based on increased water flow in the Canje River.
2.03      Over the 20 years following the completion of the Polder, a
number of schemes were proposed for the expansion of irrigation into the
Frontlands. The most ambitious of these was the Upper Canje Reservoir
Scheme, which would have irrigated 200,000 acres by creating a large
upstream reservoir. The scale of this project was beyond Guyana's
financing capacity, and in 1973 a new study (by Harza Engineering) was
undertaken for a reduced project based on improvements in the Polder and an
extension of irrigation into the Manarabisi cattle pasture (the
Backlands). This study was completed in November 1975. A supplementary
study by Harza, completed in February 1977, considered improvements to
Block III and an extension of irrigation into the Frontlands. The
resulting Black Bush Frontlands/Block III Small Farm Development Project
was appraised by the Bank in March-April 1977, and the appraisal report was
issued in May 1978. Negotiations were held from March 10 to 16, 1978. An
IDA credit was approved on June 6, 1978, and the credit agreement was
signed on December 4, 1978. After two extensions of the deadline, the loan
became effective on April 3, 1980. The total estimated cost of the project
(Annex, Table 2) was US$42.8 million, of which US$36.1 million was to be
provided by external financing.
Cofinancing
2.04      The Project was cofinanced by IDA (Credit 820-GUA) for US$10.0
million and by IFAD (Loan 3-GUA) for US$10.0 million, under a joint
financing agreement for funding civil works; US$7.5 million loan by USAID
for consultant services in engineering, farm development, extension and
applied research, rice marketing facilities and equipment; US$1.4 million
grant by USAID for agricultural support services, technical assistance in
farm development, seed production, testing, extension, and applied
research; and US$7.2 million loan by IDB for funding of pumps and related
civil works and consulting services for studies on Black Bush water
management, O&M and water rates.
Project Description
2.05      The project Included works to increase the flow of water in the
Canje River; rehabilitation and improvement of the irrigation and drainage
systems; on-farm development; and improvement of agricultural support
services. Rehabilitation works were to be carried out mainly in the
Frontlands, where total annual cropping of rice was expected to rise from
14,200 to 32,320 acres. The existing irrigation systems in Block III and
in the Black Bush Polder were to benefit mainly from improved primary water



-4-
supplies and agricultural services, which would have increased average
yields and cropping intensity (from 120% to 140% in Block III and from 90%
to 170% in the Polder). The total a.ea to benefit directly from t'.a
irrigation works was 48,800 acres. The area to 14enefit from agricultural
services was 75,500 acres, supporting 6,000 farm families, 98% of whon, were
living on an income of less then US$180 per person. The main benefits from
the project were projected to be 21,000 tons of incremental milled rice
production (33,000 tons of paddy equivalent), mainly for export, and 5,200
tons of incremental food cr- production for the domestic market. The
project was estimated, at appraisal, to have an internal rate at return of
13%.
2.06       The main project components were:
(a) Civil works (appraisal estimate, US$23.6 million) including
three pumping stations, canal improvements, rehabilitation
of the polder and extention of the Frontlands;
(b) buildings (appraisal estimate, US$1.2 million), including
project headquarters, seed testing laboratory drying yards
and paddy storage;
(c) equipment (appraisal estimate US$4.1 million), including O&M

processing equipment; and
(d) management and technical services (appraisal estimate,
US$5.3 million)o including project administration and
supervision, consultants services, extension, research, seed
production, further project preparation and stage II
feasibility studies.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Plan of Operations
3.01      The implementing agency was the Ministry of Agriculture, which
was also responsible for implementing Tapakuma and for planning MMA.
Within the Ministry, the Hydraulics Division, under the direction of the
Drainage and Irrigation Board (DIB), had responsibility for engineering
planning, construction and OM. The agricultural development program,
including extension, applied research, seed production and provision of
equipment for rice production and processing, was to be launched in the
early phase of the project. GRB was to cooperate with the project
consultants in implementing this program, since GRB had hitherto had the
main responsibility for extension, credit and input supply. Extension was
to be handed over to the Extension Division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
and credit to the Guyana Agricultural Bank (GAIBANK). The early launching
of the agricultural development program was expected to improve rice yields
by 1981, with benefits valued at US$1.0 million per year. Civil works were
due to begin in 1981 and to be completed by 1983. Full agricultural
development was projected for 1985.

Early Delays
3.02      From the beginning, project implementation was affected by the
failure of the Government to comply with the conditions of loan
effectiveness. The most important of these conditions were: (a) a
requirement that GRB put into effect a plan., satisfactory to IDA and IFAD,
for the improvement of its accounting system and financial management and
furnish audited statements of its accounts for FY75, FY76 and FY77 (this
requirement was finally met at the end of 1979); (b) establishment of a
satisfactory monitoring unit for the project (this unit was formally
established before th_ November 1979 supervision mlssion, but subsequent
delays in staffing it meant that it was never successfully implemented);
and (c) appointment of consultants to be financed by USAID to carry out
detailed design and costing of the civil works. It was only in March 1980
that, with the agreement of USAID, the Government signed a contract for
professional engineering services.
Final Design
3.03      In September 1981, the engineering consultants presented a
technical proposal for the construction of a barrage as an alternative to a
1,000 cusec pumping plant on the Berbice River, which had been proposed at
appraisal. Meanwhile, in response to the call for bids for the supply of
pumping plant, three international firms presented proposals ranging in
price from US$6.7 million to US$8.2 million (a cos% overrun of almost 100%
from original appraisal estimates). On February 3, 1982, IDB stated that
it would not be prepared to finance any contract resulting from
adjudication of this tender unless the total project were redefined and
financing (both local and foreign) were fully assured. With mounting
financing difficulties, the execution of the project became increasingly
difficult, and on Augutst 31, 1982, the Government terminated Its
engineering contract with PRC. The consultant finished designs and tender
documents for all contracts tncluded in the project.
Agricultural Support Services
3.04      In August 1980, the Government signed a contract for agricultural
consulting services. Under this contract, financed by USAID, five experts
in agrLctllture, applied research, water management, farm management,
extension and agricultural engineering (farm machinery) started work in
November 1980. Progress was made in the fertilizer and varietal trials,
on-farm water management and land preparation, demonstration of land
levelling and assistance in farm machinery operation and maintenance. The
State Farm was in the process of rehabilitation for seed production and a
seed testing laboratory was installed. By the end of 1982 this contract
was completed, however, before any action had been taken on the
rehabilitatton and improvement of the irrigation and drainage systems.
3.05      In December 1981, the Government signed a consulting contract for
US$445,000, fininced by InB. These services included: (a) an evaluation
of the ability of the Hydraulics Division of the Ministry of Agriculture to
carry out the (&M of the irrigation and drainage systems; (b) an evaluation
Of the effecttveness of existing administrative, financial and accounting



- 6 -
procedures for collecting water charges; (c) the study and design of a
water charging system; and (d) the design of water delivery and drainage
systems according to different cropping patterns. The consultants'
diagnosis report was presented in June 1982, and the planning and design
phases continued through the end of 1982 and into 1983.
Cost Overruns
3.06      As a result of the long delays, the project cost estimates rose
from US$42.8 million at appraisal to US$72.1 million by early 1982 (Annex,
Table 3). On account of this and of the country's critical financial
situation, the Government decided to cancel the project on April 20, 1982.
However, on June 18, following further discussions with IDA, the Government
asked that a modified project be considered, to make use of the outstanding
IDA and IFAD funds. It was agreed by IDA that the Hydraulics Division of
the Ministry of Agriculture should prepare a proposal outlining a much
reduced project concentrating on the rehabilitation of Block III and the
Polder. A "pre-investment" report, dated December 1982, was submitted to
IDA and was reviewed by a mission which visited Guyana in early February
1983.
Actions by Cofinanciers
3.07      In April 1983, IFAD decided to cancel its participation in the
joint IDA/IFAD loan agreement and formally wrote to the Government and to
IDA to that effect. At the same time, IFAD verbally indicated its
willingness to enter a new agreement in support of a revised project which
may arise out of the on-going discussions between the Government and IDA.
By this stage, the willingness of the remaining donors (USAID and IDB) to
continue with the Black Bush Project was in serious doubt. USAID had
already spent US$5.5 million of its original commitment of US$8.9 million,
mainly on consulting services, and relations between the Agency and the
Guyana Government were under strain for other non-project reasons. IDB
expenditures on Black Bush had been limited to US$0.5 million out of US$7.3
million, and given its gr)wing commitment to the MMA project, IDB expressed
a desire to reallocate its remaining US$6.8 million from Black Bush to MMA.
Project Redesign
3.08      The reduced project presented to IDA by the Government in
December 1982 (Annex, Table 4) had a total cost of US$25.37 million, of
which foreign costs were US$15.92 million. Its components were: (a)
rehabilitation of Block III and the Polder with associated pump stations
and main canals; (b) on-farm development in Block III and the Polder;
(c) establishment of an O&M unit; and (d) further studies. The Frontlands,
which had been the primary reason for the original project, were no longer
included, for lack of resources.
3.09      An IDA mission reported on these proposals in June 1983, and
reached the following conclusion:



-7-
"The technical proposals put forward are relatively simple; the
agricultural assumptions are modest: the objective (to
rehabilitate an existing and settled irrigation scheme) is
intrinsically worthwhile; and the potential economic return is
acceptable. Nevertheless, it must be said that any further
investment in rice irrigation in Guyana at the present time will
necessarily be risky. The past deterioration and current
problems of the project are due to institutional and
administrative deficiencies which show little sign of improvement
and, in some cases, are actually getting worse. Therefore,
before proceeding further with the project, the main focus of
attention should be on the resolution of important institutional
issues."
3.10      The issues referred to were:  (a) milling and marketing (also
dealt with in a separate policy paper produced in April 1983); (b) rice
research, which had all but ceased; (c) extension services, which were
non-existent; (d) agricultural credit, 'vhich was in only sporadic supply
(the GAIBANK was lending to only 600 out of 6,000 farmers in the region);
(e) machinery services and other inputs had been severely curtailed for
lack of foreign exchange; and (f) O&M, which had virtually ceased for lack
of equipment, spare parts or qualified personnel.
Cancellation
3.11      Further discussions were held with the Government, but it became
clear that the Government was unable to give any assurances concerning
marketing policies, credit, the role of GRB or changes in the institutional
arrangements for O&M. The project was cancelled on February 8, 1985, at
which time IDA disbursements amounted to US$0.34 million. No disbursements
had been made since January 1982.
Performance of Consultants
3.12           The supervision reports contain no adverse comments on the
performance of the consultants. Though the consultants were eventually
dismissed by the Government, there is no indication that they had failed to
carry out their design work diligently and professionally. Their full
obligations under their terms of reference were completed before leaving
Guyana. The project implementation problems were related to the excessive
delay in appointing the consultants in the first place, but this appears to
have been entirely the responsibility of the Government. The change in
project design recommended by the consultants was, in their judgement, a
more cost-effective way of meeting the requirements of the project. The
substantial difference between final cost estimates and appraisal estimates
is a reflection of the high rate of international inflation which prevailed
during the years of project delay (1979/81); it may also reflect the not
uncommon tendency for initial engineering estimates (at. feasibility study
stage) to understate the true costs which emerge during final design.
IV. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      The project was a failure.  Financially, it has created a burden
for Guyana, which can ill afford to spend scarce foreign exchange on



- 8 -
consulting services and project design without any productive result. The
total loans disbursed on account of the project were: USAID US$5.5 million;
IDB US$0.5 million; and IDA US$0.3 million.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The institutional objectives of the project were:  (a) to develop
the design, supervision and maintenance capabilities of the Hydraulics
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture; (b) to assist the GRB in improving
its financial management and in rationalizing its activities in rice
milling and input supply; (c) to develop the extension, research and seed
supply facilities of the Black Bush region; (d) to develop a monitoring
unit; and (e) to develop a project preparation facility.
5.02      Very little of this was achieved.  In design and costing, soma
benefits accrued through the use by PRC of counterpart staff from the
Hydraulics Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Supervision and O&M
and maintenance functions never materialized. The work sponsored by USAID
in rice research and seed production may have left some permanent benefit
in the form of trained personnel, but no permanent institutional benefit
accrued. The efforts to rationalize and reequip GRB were fruitless on
account of the entrenched bureaucratic inertia of the Board. Neither the
monitoring unit nor the project preparation unit ever materialized.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      The failure of the Black Bush project contrasts with the
relatively successful experience in Tapakuma. At appraisal, the Black Bush
project might have appeared to be a good candidate for financing, based as
it was on a settled farming population, a proven technology and familiar
institutions. Nevertheless, at the time of appraisal, there were serious
doubts over the institutional and financial capacity of the Government to
implement the project, which merited much greater attention than they
received.
6.02      In the President's report (May 19, 1978, para. 65), three
principal risks were noted, as follows:
"Project implementation would be exposed to three basic risks.
Firstly, the Government's ability to provide local currency on a
timely basis to meet the project's requirements is limited. The
amount of external financing of the local currency costs of the
project recommended herein should ensure availability of funds to
meet local cost needs. The second element of risk relates to the
ability of the GRB to properly manage the rice industry on the
production and processing side as well as the marketing side.
External technical assistance to the GRB to strengthen its
management and marketing capabilities would be arranged by the
Government to overcome this risk. Assurances designed to
strengthen the GRB have been obtained by the Association. A
third risk is shortage of experienced professional and technical
staff for implementation and management of the project. This



-9-
would be partly overcome by the in-service training the project
consultants would be required to provide,"
6.03      Clearly, the risks were well recognized.  The remedies proposed
for mitigating them, however, were largely cosmetic. For example,
in-service training of technicians by consulants is no remedy for the
problem of a heavily overstretched and underfunded implementing agency (the
Hydraulics Division), whose energies were also being diverted towards the
much larger MMA project. Furthermore, seeking assurances from the
Government to strengthen GRB did not address the problem presented by a
monolithic and inefficient state bureaucracy, whose existence was a buiden
on the entire rice industry. At the time of credit approval, GRB was not a
suitable agency to place in charge of the agricultural development program
of the project, even with a substantial input of technical assistance.
What was needed was not technical assistance, but major reform, if not
complete dissolution, of GRB.
6.04      The problems of the project were substantially complicated by the
cofinancing arrangements. Relations between USAID and the Government
deteriorated rapidly after credit approval, and it was their failure to
agree on the consultant selection which seriously damaged the project at
its outset.  At the same time, IDB was committed to the MMA scheme, and its
enthusiasm for Black Bush declined rapidly as problems set in. Finally,
the institutional and policy aspects of the project, which were critical,
might have been addressed more effectively, if there had been a united
approach by the cofinanciers. Though efforts were made to coordinate
views, IDA was reluctant to be publicly associated with USAID on policy
issues, and IDB was determined not to complicate its relations with the
Government for fear of jeopardizing MMA.
Lessons Learned
6.05      The main lesson to be drawn is not specific to Guyana and may
already have been drawn for a wide range of agricultural projects appraised
and implemented around the world during the 1970s. The experience of these
years shows both donors and borrowers anxious to press ahead with complex
infrastructional investments without due concern for the institutional and
policy constraints to successful implementation. The Black Bush Irrigation
Project serves as an extreme example of this. It was a derelict project at
the time of appraisal, in need of rehabilitation. However, Its very
dereliction was symptomatic of the basic institutional and political
weaknesses, which were not properly addressed either before or after credit
approval. As it turned out, the extensive efforts made by IDA to correct
them subsequently were complicated by disagreements between the
confinanciers and the Government, and between the cofinanciers themselves
over what were the most suitable remedies.
6.06      A more cautious approach would have insisted on addressing some
of these weaknesses as a condition of Board approval, even if that had
meant a significant delay in approving the project. To be specific:
(a) By 1978, there were strong grounds for believing that the
accounts in GRB were not properly kept and for doubting the



- 10 -
techiacal and managerial capacity of the Board. The extent of
the GRB monopoly over all phases of the rice industry should
itself have been a cause for deep concern. By 1981, the
constraints being placed on the project and on the rice industry
by the GRB monopoly were openly recognized by IDA, IDB and USAID,
each of which was conducting a separate dialogue with the
Government on rice policy reform. Efforts to coordinate this
dialogue failed.
(b) The apparent success of Tapakuma did not extend to the creation
of satisfactory O&M unit. Nor was there a satisfactory extension
service. As late as 1982, three years after the closing date of
Tapakuma, a review mission from IDA found that the O&M services
were inadequate and extension and water management services were
practically non-existent. The inclusion in the Black Bush
project of a contract (financed by IDB) for consultants to
recommend a suitable organization for O&M, water charging and
water management (para. 3.05 above) was itself an acknowledgement
of these weaknesses. In the event, the consultants' report on
these key issues was not finally available until 1983, four years
after appraisal.
(c)  Tapakuma costs were running far above appraisal estimates, which
they eventually exceded by 150%. The high risks and bureaucratic
difficulties of operating in Guyana were well-known to
contractors, whose bids almost invariably exceeded appraisal
estimates. At the very least, it might have been prudent to
commission some of the basic design and costing work before
credit approval.
(d) The completion of Tapakuma and the beginning of the much more
ambitious MMA scheme, to be financed by IDB, imposed intolerable
strains on the implementing institutions, whose capacity was
extremely limited. Since the capacity of GRB and the Hydraulics
Division was overstretched in Tapakuma alone, the prospect of
successfully implementing and operating all three projects
simultaneously might have been more seriously questioned.
(e) There appears to have been a reluctance on the part of IDA to
cancel the project, even when requested to do so by the borrower
in 1982. Given the evident disarray of the rice industry and of
the public administration at that stage, IDA might have welcomed
the opportunity of extricating itself from an exceedingly
difficult situation.
