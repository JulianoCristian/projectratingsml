1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
Development Challenges
.
Namibia is a low middle income country whose success in transitioning to middle 
and high income levels heavily rests on the availability and sustained supply of highly skilled labor among other 
factors. Despite very high levels of investment (For 2007/2008, the sector account for 7.3% of the GDP), the 
education and training system is unable to produce the number, quality, levels, and types of human resources 
requi
red to meet current labor market demands, and to support the government’s economic growth and social 
development strategy. This is in spite of impressive levels of access to general education – 85% adult literacy rate, 
and 93% and 51% primary and secondary net enrolment ratios respectively. Skills shortage consistently ranks 
high among binding constraints to the country’s capacity to apply technology, productivity growth, 
competitiveness, investment climate, agility to do business, creation of productive employment and the reduction 
of income inequalities. Unemployment rates rose from 33.8 percent in 1993/1994 to 36.7 percent in 2003/2004. 
Unemployment is even higher for rural (44.7%) relative to urban areas (29%), and for youth (40% for 15 to 19 
year olds and 47% for 20 to 24 year olds). Key causes of unemployment include structural economic changes that 
do not favor low skilled workers, labor market rigidities, the cost of labor and limited opportunities for training. 
People with post-basic education and training have a 60 to 80 percent chance of being employed.
1
Unemployment 
rates are highest for people without post-basic education and training. Basic education graduates are less likely to 
gain employment than even people with no education at all! Primary education has a negative return on raising 
employees’ earnings while basic education has only marginal returns.
2
Unemployment is lowest for those with 
secondary education and training and for those with tertiary education and training. Given that lack of skills is a 
key contributor to unemployment, equitable increase to quality post-basic education and training would contribute 
to employment creation.  
Income inequalities are declining, albeit still intolerably high for a LIMIC of US$ 3861(est. 2008)

per capita 
income. The Gini coefficient declined from 0.7 to 0.6 between 1993/1994 and 2003/2004. Within the same 
period, the proportion of poor households

declined from 38 to 28 percent; while the extremely poor

households 
declined from 9 to 4 percent.

However, the income share held by the highest quintile is 78.7 percent, relative to

About 34.9 percent of the population lives on US$ 1 per day and 
55.8 percent on US$ 2 per day (2005 est. UNDP).  
The incidence of HIV/AIDS is declining, but is still high, estimated at 19.6 in 2006.  
 
2. Proposed objective(s) 
DPL2 seeks to develop: (i) specific policies, legal and institutional frameworks to reinforce those developed 
during DPL1; (ii) specific systems and tools required to operationalize policies, legal and funding instruments 
developed under DPL1 to  improve education access, equity, quality, relevance, and efficiency; (iii) institutional 
capacities for more effective implementation of sector reforms. 
 
3. Preliminary description 
This loan is the second of two single-tranche sector Development Policy Loans (DPLs) of US$ 7.5 million each. 
The DPL series supports the first implementation phase of Namibia’s 15-year Strategic Plan for the Education and 
Training Sector Improvement Program (SP-ETSIP 2005-2020).  
 
SP-ETSIP seeks to heighten the sector’s contribution to: (i) accelerated and shared growth; (ii) competitiveness in 
a
global knowledge-based economy; and (iii) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is implemented through three 
medium term sector programs (ETSIP1-2-3).  
 
The first program (ETSIP1 2006-2011) was developed with support from 13 international development partners 
(DPs). It seeks to: (i) equitably accelerate the immediate supply of high level skills required to meet current labor 
market demands and to facilitate Namibia’s transition to a knowledge-based economy. Key means entail equitable 
expansion of quality and market-relevant senior secondary, VET, tertiary education and training, and expanded 
opportunities for life-long learning; (ii) lay a strong foundation for a sustainable supply of skills through equitable 
improvement of the quality and efficiency of basic education.   
 
DPL2 supports the development of: (i) specific policies, legal and institutional frameworks to reinforce those 
developed during DPL1; (ii) specific systems and tools required to operationalize policies, legal and funding 
instruments developed under DPL1 to  improve education access, equity, quality, relevance, and efficiency; (iii) 
institutional capacities for more effective implementation of sector reforms. 
 
4. Environment Aspects 
DPL2 and the parent program (ETSIP1) are not likely to have significant negative environmental and social 
impacts. On the other hand, the DPL series is expected to have significant positive social impact as outlined 
above. Where negative environmental impact may arise from the civil works component of ETSIP, efforts will be 
made to avoid ecological and socially sensitive areas. This should be feasible given the availability of land in 
Namibia and the already existing policy, legal and institutional frameworks that guide land acquisition and the 
rich country experience in applying these frameworks.
