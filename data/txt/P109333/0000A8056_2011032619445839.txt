                         DPL2 supports the three pillars of ETSIP1 by reinforcing DPL1 efforts to develop: (i) specific policies, legal and financing frameworks that underpin planned
                         sector reforms; (ii) specific systems and tools required to give effect to policies, legal and funding frameworks intended to improve education access, equity,
                         quality, relevance and efficiency; (iii) specific institutional capacities that are critical for effective implementation of planned sector reforms.

                         The ETSIP program which the DPL2 supports is progressing well. In certain cases the DPL2 targets have been achieved or close to being achieved. However, the issue of quality of
                         education, in particular at higher grades (grade 8 and 10) appear to remain a concern. This can be a consequence of increased access to education, however, the Ministry of
                         Education as well as the World Bank remain concerned about this outcome and aim to focus on the issue of quality for post-basic education as we move forward.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mid-term review of the ETSIP1 program is planned over the next six months. Although the World Bank DPL will have closed in June 2011, the World Bank in collaboration with
                         the Development Partners and the MoE in GoN will continue to support the review and re-prioritization of ETSIP as the GoN moves towards the start of ETSIP phase 2.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Operations
                         There are no related projects.
