"With the Power Rehabilitation Project,\n            the Government of Bolivia hopes to (i) rehabilitate Empresa\n            Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDE)'s power system and\n            (ii) to improve sector regulation, planning and\n            institutional framework.  To accomplish this, the project\n            involves (a) acquisition of spare parts and equipment for\n            the 1987-1989 maintenance program of ENDE's facilities,\n            mainly the overhaul of its generating units; (b)\n            construction of Alalay and Urbana Sur new substations and\n            modifications in Potosi and Telemayo substations; and (c)\n            construction of 8.5 km subtransmission line 69 kV\n            Huaracachi-Substation Sur to close the subtransmission loop\n            of Santa Cruz.  In addition, the project provides for (d)\n            preparation of a Power Expansion Master Plan defining the\n            least cost expansion program for the power sector up to year\n            2010; and (e) technical assistance involving:  (i)\n            engineering consultants to help ENDE in the execution of the\n            project; and (ii) management consultants to prepare a\n            methodology for revaluation of ENDE's assets, and to\n            develop an information system for accounting, financial\n            management, inventories, construction and maintenance."}, "docdt": "1987-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
