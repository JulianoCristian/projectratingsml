IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
CREDIT 1818-BO
1. PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Rehabilitation Project in
Bolivia, for which Cr. 1818-BO in the amount of SDR 5.3; it was approved on June 9, 1987 and
made effective on January 28, 1988. The Borrower was the Republic of Bolivia, and the
executing agency was Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE).
The final closing date was December 31, 1994, as originally planned. The last
disbursement took place on August 25, 1994, and the unused balance equivalent to 3.78% of the
Credit reverted to IDA.
The ICR was prepared by Jorge Gorri6 (LA31N) and Enrique G6mez (Consultant), and
reviewed by Peter Ludwig (Division Chief, Infrastructure Operations) and Robert Crown (Project
Adviser). The ICR is based on material in the project file, interviews with IDA staff involved in project
preparation and implementation, and additional information requested from the Borrower to facilitate
IDA's review of the Project. The Project Executing Agency ENDE prepared the Project Review from
the Borrower's Perspective (Appendix II) and interviews with Borrower's Staff'in Bolivia. Preparation
of the ICR was begun during November 1995, and the Bank's final supervision/completion mission, in
March 1996 (see Aide Memoire in Appendix I) during which a field review of all the physical facilities
included in the Project's scope was carried out. No comments were received from the Borrower
review of IDA's draft ICR carried out during May 1996. The ICR incorporates the comments
provided by ENDE.

2. EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background.
(i)    Bank experience with the Bolivian power sector has in general been satisfactory. The first
IDA credit to ENDE was granted in 1964. Since then, the Bank and IDA have made six credits
and one loan to the Bolivian power sector.
(ii)  In 1966, ENDE started commercial operation. IDA was instrumental in providing support
to ENDE since its creation.
(iii)  In 1995, ENDE became the first public enterprise to undergo the capitalization process.
As a result, all generation facilities within the National Interconnected System were transferred,
albeit partially, to three private generating companies. Only small isolated systems as well as the
transmission system remain under ENDE's control.
(iv)  In 1985, the Bolivian government laid the foundations for economic growth formulating
an economic stabilization program. It also requested IDA's support for its efforts to revitalize the
economy and particularly the power sector. In May 1986, IDA approved the Reconstruction
Import Credit RIC 1703/BO which signaled the renewal of flow of investment funds from
international lending institutions to Bolivia, interrupted during the period of economic crisis
(198 1-1986). While such credit funded the most urgent needs of the sector, further rehabilitation
of existing facilities and institutional changes were urgently needed. The rationale of Cr. 1818-
BO was to respond to such needs.
Project Objectives and Description.
(v)   The project was conceived to rehabilitate ENDE's generating units, strengthen its
transmission system, improve its operational efficiency, and develop a Power Expansion Master
Plan.
(vi)   The project consisted of physical and institutional components. The physical component
included the overhaul and maintenance of generating units and improving the transmission system.
The institutional component included studies for an integrated Management Information System,
a Power Expansion Master Plan, and a fixed assets revalorization.
Achievement of Objectives.
(vii)  It is apparent that the objectives were well defined with the information available at the
time. It was later necessary to make some adjustments due to the unforeseen high electricity
demand growth in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba and slower growth in the mining areas. Such
development resulted from the structural and economic reforms instituted by the Bolivian
government which closed government mining operations and caused subsequent population
migration towards fast growth regions like Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.



- iii -
(viii) An ex-post rate of return calculation for ENDE's investment program yields a satisfactory
value of 12.3%, which correlates well with the 13.5% figure estimated during Project appraisal
(see Table 9). The IRR based on actual Government-constrained tariffs charged by ENDE drops
to 7% reflecting both the econornic transfer from ENDE to the national economy, and a possible
element of economic inefficiency caused by a price averaging 15-20% below economic cost.
(ix)   Sales growth averaged 10.5% a year between 1987 and 1994. Such growth was above
the average rate of 9.1% estimated in the SAR (Staff Appraisal Report) for the 1986/1990 period.
(x)   It was expected that ENDE would take over COBEE's facilities from 1991. This event did
not materialize and, not foreseen during project appraisal, all ENDE's generating units in the
Interconnected System were capitalized in 1995 as three separate companies under privately
controlled management. ENDE's sales and productivity grew faster than forecast with sales
growing at an average annual rate of 10.5% between 1987 and 1994 while the number of
employees grew at a rate below 2% p.a. reaching 507 employees in 1994.
(xi)   Annual Rate of Return on revalued assets improved but the targets were not reached. This
requirement was waved by IDA since ENDE's Debt Service Coverage was satisfactory, and over
30% of investment was financed with ENDE's internal cash generation.
(xii)  Default for ENDE's receivables was to be reduced to 60 days. The value was actually
reductd below the targeted value, reaching levels of about 40 days since 1991.
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting Implementation.
(xiii) The only factor which affected implementation was slow bureaucratic procedures within
governmental institutions which delayed supply of parts and equipment by about six months
during the first year of Credit effectiveness, Nevertheless, the overall Project time schedules were
complied with as originally established. In some cases, the execution of investments was
completed earlier than expected: construction works, and engineering, financial and managerial
consultant studies (see Table 5).
Project Sustainability.
(xiv)  Quality of service in the electric sector under ENDE's responsibility was enhanced by the
Project since all objectives were achieved. The execution of consulting studies strengthened
ENDE's management providing a system that processes information in a systematic and integral
manner, As a result, there is a high probability of maintaining the achieved Project goals.
Bank Performance.
(xv)  ENDE was visited by twelve Bank Missions between 1985 and 1993. IDA officials widely
cooperated with the executing agency in the Project appraisal, implementation and supervision,
and through the prompt execution of Credit administration and procurement procedures. During
Project execution, ENDE and particularly the Project Unit received valuable and timely
collaboration from Bank officials from different areas. Such cooperation was instrumental for the
adequate completion of works and Credit management so that Project objectives were
successfully reached.



- iv -
Borrower Performance.
(xvi) ENDE's overall performance was satisfactory. Credit management and coordination with
different ENDE offices, governmental institutions and the Bank were assigned to a Project
Executing Unit (PEU). The PEU was responsible for pursuing and monitoring the effectiveness
and execution of the Project. The PEU's early organization, its highly qualified personnel, and its
continuity during Project implementation (it had only one Project Head throughout the Project
life) allowed it to properly flulfill its obligations.
(xvii) "Work Orders" (WO) were opened for each Project component, identifying the estimated
amounts of local and foreign costs of various categories. All of these WO were fully executed,
closed, and registered for accounting purposes.
Assessment of Outcome.
(xviii) Project outcome was satisfactory since it contributed to the rehabilitation of the Power
Sector and ENDE's institutional strengthening. All generating and transmission facilities of
ENDE, rehabilitated under the Credit, are operating satisfactorily. The conclusions and
recommendations produced by the consulting studies were or are being implemented by ENDE.
Key Lessons Learned.
(xix) Experience gained from the IPower Sector Rehabilitation Project applicable to future
operations includes:
*  the efficacy of staffing the PEU with qualified personnel and maintaining personnel
continuity throughout Project implementation,
*  the cost savings from using Credit funds to pay foreign suppliers directly rather than
through Letters of Credit;
*  the reduction of potential risks by the requirement to conduct environmental studies
at various execution stages of each Project component; and
*  the development of information management systems is not only essential for modern
and effective enterprise management, it also becomes crucial to enable eventual
institutional changes, such as privatization of public enterprises.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
CREDIT 1818-BO
3. PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.    The Power Rehabilitation Project in Bolivia was financed through Credit 1818-BO in the amount
of SDR 5.3 million, equivalent to US$ 6.8 million which was approved on June 9, 1987 and made
effective on January 28, 1988. The Borrower was the Republic of Bolivia. The Executing Agency was
the Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDE).
2.    The closing date was December 31, 1994. The amount of the credit was almost fully disbursed.
The cancelled remaining balance was SDR 200,577.15, equivalent to 3.78% of the credit. The last
disbursement was made on August 25, 1994.
BACKGROUND
3.    Since 1964, and prior to this credit, the Bank and IDA had made six credits and one loan to the
Bolivian power sector.
4.    Bank experience with the Bolivian power sector had in general been satisfactory and devoid of
major project execution problems. COBEE-BPC received one credit, the remaining credits and loans
were assigned to ENDE as executing agency. The first IDA Credit to ENDE (61/BO) in 1964 financed
the construction of the Corani hydroelectric plant. It was executed satisfactorily. Projects financed by
IDA Credits 148/BO (1969) and 433/BO (1973) experienced some cost overruns and completion delays,
due to international market price instability, unforeseen adverse geological conditions in the construction
of Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant, and ENDE's relatively short experience in gas turbines. The
interconnection project financed by IBRD's loan 1238/BO (1976) was carried out with only minor
problems, but with delays. Loan IBRD 1865/BO (1980) allowed ENDE pay its debt during a period of
hyperinflation. Credit RIC-IDA 1703 (1986) financed the purchase and installation of the 7th gas turbine
in Santa Cruz.
5.    During the 1981-1986 period Bolivia underwent an econornic crisis. During this period GNP fell
at an annual average rate of 2.5% and inflation reached an annual rate above 10,000% in 1985. As a
result, electricity demand remained almost constant between 1982 and 1987. Also, IDA and other
international agencies discontinued financing expansion projects in the sector.
6.    In 1985, the Bolivian government laid the foundations for economic growth formulating an
economic stabilization program. It also requested IDA's support for its efforts to revitalize the economy
and particularly the power sector. In May 1986 IDA approved the Reconstruction Import Credit RIC
1703/BO which signaled the renewal of flow of investment funds from international lending institutions
to Bolivia, interrupted during the period of economic crisis (1981-1986). while such credit funded the



-2-
most pressing needs of the sector, further rehabilitation of existing facilities and institutional changes
were urgently required, hence the need and rationale for Cr. 1818-BO.
7.    The Borrower. ENDE was created on February 9, 1962 by Supreme Decree 5999. It started
commercial operation by the end of 1966, with the operation of the Corani hydroelectric plant. IDA was
instrumental in providing support to ENDE since its creation.
8.    ENDE managed in the past to remain isolated from the high turnover of personnel which
characterized most public institutions in Bolivia. Since it began operations thirty years ago, it has had
only seven General Managers and a stable work force, which averaged 507 people in 1994. The
company's staff was in general well qualified and competent.
9.    ENDE became in 1995 the first public enterprise to undergo the capitalization process. As a
result, all generation facilities within the National Interconnected System were transferred, albeit
partially, to three private generating companies. The small isolated systems as well as the transmission
system, still under ENDE's control, are expected to be privatized or capitalized in the near future.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
10.   The Project objectives were to rehabilitate ENDE's generating units, strengthen its transmission
system, improve its operational efficiency, and develop a Power Expansion Master Plan. The following
interventions were included:
(a)   Rehabilitate existing ENDE's generating units, mainly overhaul and subsequent
maintenance;
(b)   Improve ENDE's transmission system, relocating existing transformers and installing new
ones, according to the identified requirements of the system;
(c)   Improve ENDE's operational efficiency, strengthening its information system in the
financial and management areas; Develop a Least-Cost Power Expansion Master Plan for
the Electric Sector based on the energy strategies proposed by a study that had been
recently sponsored by the UNDP/World Bank.
11.   The Project funds were to finance the following components:
(a)   Acquisition of spare parts and equipment for the 1987-1989 maintenance program of
ENDE's facilities, mainly the overhaul of its generating units;
(b)   Adaptation of substations to present needs and of the subtransmission system in Santa
Cruz by the following improvements:
* Construction of Alalay substation (Cochabamba) -115 kV/ 10 kV- 25 MVA;
* Construction of the Urbana Sur substation (Santa Cruz) 69 kV/lO kV - 25 MVA;
* Change of voltage (from 69 kV to 115 kV) of the transmission line Potosi -
Telamayu (insulated for 115 kV but operating in 69 kV) modifying and adding
transformers in Potosi and Telamayu substations;



-3-
*  Increase the capacity of the Montero substation (Santa Cruz) adding a transformer
(69 kV/25 kV - 12.5 MVA); and,
* Construction of subtransmission line (69 kV) Guaracachi - S/E Sur to close the
subtransmission loop of Santa Cruz,
(c)   Preparation of a Power Expansion Master Plan, based on the conclusions of the
UNDP/World Bank energy exercise, to define the least cost expansion program for the
power sector, up to the year 2010;
(d)   Engineering consultant services to help ENDE in preparing specifications and
procurement of equipment, cost estimates and bid evaluation, as well as the preparation
of the Power Expansion Master Plan and distribution studies;
(e)   Management consultant services to:
* Define the criteria and prepare a methodology and carry out the implementation for
future revaluation of ENDE's fixed assets, investment and inventories;
* Develop an Integrated Management Information System consisting of
*  design of an Integrated Information System for ENDE, mainly for
accounting, financial management, inventories, construction and
maintenance;
*  acquisition of hardware (mainframe and micro computers);
*  acquisition and adaptation of software; and
*  implementation of the new system.
CREDIT AMENDMENT
12.   During the Project execution it became necessary to modify the original scope, basically due to
the lesser than expected electricity demand growth in the mining area (Potosi), coupled with an increase
of demand in the Santa Cruz and Cochabamba areas. There were two amendments to the Credit
Agreement. The first Amendment, signed on December 9, 1988, dealt with substations in Santa Cruz
and Cochabamba, sub-transmission lines in Santa Cruz and acquisition of software and hardware for
Power Expansion Planning and the Integrated Management Information System. The second
amendment, requested by ENDE on October 16, 1989, enabled IDA financing for the feasibility studies
of the proposed Puerto Suarez Power Plant to export electricity to Brazil. As agreed with IDA, the
effect of this amendment on the allocation of the Credit proceeds was incorporated during closing of the
Credit.
13.   Purchasing at prices below original estimates allowed the acquisition of additional substation
parts and materials and prompted a second amendment to accomodate such modifications. The
Association agreed to examine this amendment at Project closure, once the final figures were known for
each investment category.
14.   The various Project components were properly and promptly executed between 1988 and 1991.
By December 1991, processed disbursements equaled 92% of total Credit; by December 1992, they



-4 -
equaled 95%. ENDE and IDA agreed to maintain the Credit effectiveness until December 31, 1994, as
established in the Credit Agreement, to finance some additional purchases. On December 31, 1994 the
unused Credit was reduced to only 3.78% of total Credit.
15.   The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$ 8.73 million, before interest during construction
(IDC); including IDC, the expected cost increased to US$10.69 million. The project was expected to be
executed over a period of seven years. The programmed completion date December 31, 1994 coincided
with the actual closing date. The Bank's U$ 6.80 million loan was designed to cover 100% of foreign
currency costs.
ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
16.   The Project objectives were satisfactorily achieved, strengthening the operation of the electric
sector and ENDE's management. The Project did not present any environmental problems nor any
particular physical risks. In general, the Project was implemented within the time schedule established in
the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the Credit Agreement. The works and activities were concluded
closing ENDE's "Work Orders" within the estimated budgets and in reasonable time periods.
17.   During Project Appraisal an economic rate of return (ERR) of ENDE's investment program was
estimated at 13.5% using tariffs based on LRMC. The ex-post ERR, with also LRMC based-tariffs,
was estimated at 12.3%, showing a good correlation between the ex-ante (projected) and ex-post
(actual) economic costs and benefits of the project. The ex-post economic analysis with the current
Government-constrained tariffs charged by ENDE yielded an ERR of 7%. This lower ERR reflects, on
the one hand, the economic inefficiencies of an overblown demand and higher supply requirements from
pricing below cost recovery tariffs, as electricity users were being subsidized by an average of 15-20 %
of the economic cost of supply. On the other hand, this lower ERR may also reflect some economic
inefficiency during project execution. However, the ERR based on actual projected tariffs is likely to
approximate the 12.3% value on account that the sector has been reformed and is now operating under
LRMC based tariffs.
18.   It was expected that ENDE would take over COBEE's facilities since 1991. This event did not
materialize and, unforeseen during project appraisal, all ENDE's generating units in the Interconnected
System were capitalized in 1995 as three separate companies under privately controlled management.
ENDE's sales and productivity were better than forecast. Sales continued growing at an average annual
rate of 10.5% between 1987 and 1994 while the number of employees grew at a rate below 2% p.a.
reaching a total of 507 employees in 1994. (prior to 1991, ENDE's electricity sales were expected to
grow at an annual average rate of 9.1% and employees at a rate higher than 2% p.a.)
19.   Rate of Return targets were not reached. This requirement was waived by IDA since ENDE's
Debt Service Coverage was satisfactory and over 30% of investment was financed with ENDE's internal
cash generation.
20.   ENDE's account-receivables ratio was to be reduced to an equivalent of 60 days of sales. The
value was actually reduced below the targeted value reaching levels of about 40 days since 1991.



IMLEMENTATIoN RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION.
21.   The Project Agreement was signed in July 1987, but its effectiveness was delayed until January
1988, and the initial disbursements were received in July 1988. Such delays were caused by slow
bureaucratic procedures within governmental institutions. As a result, the initial supply of parts,
materials and equipment for substations and lines was delayed. In spite of such initial difficulties, the
overall Project time schedules were complied with as originally established. In some cases, the execution
of investments was completed earlier than expected: construction works, and engineering, financial and
managerial consultant studies (see Table 5).

22.   Quality of service in the electric sector under ENDE's responsibility was enhanced by the Project
since all objectives were achieved, particularly timely acquiring of parts to overhaul and maintain
generating units, as well as the supply of substation and transmission line equipment and materials to
upgrade transmission capacity.
23.   The execution of consulting studies strengthened ENDE's management, providing a system that
processes information in a systematic timely and integral manner. The system allowed ENDE to
institutionalize a corporate culture based on management by objectives and close to real time results.
The monitoring of yearly goals for managerial and economic efficiency was facilitated by the improved
follow up of indices such as utilization of installed capacity, operating costs, reliability of service,
execution of investment, debt service coverage and labor productivity. As a result, of the much
improved management early warning system, there is a high probability of maintaining the achieved
Project goals.
BANK PERFORMANCE
24.   ENDE was visited by twelve Bank Missions between 1985 and 1993. IDA officials cooperated
with the executing agency in the Project appraisal, implementation and supervision, and through the
prompt execution of Credit administration and procurement procedures. Because of ENDE's
satisfactory operational and financial results, IDA showed flexibility in waving covenanted ROR targets
for ENDE which, if met, would have produced surplus cash flow, and various covenants not complied
with by the Government (Table 10).
25.   Given the importance of the Project for the Bolivian Power Sector, the visits were extended to
government authorities and sector officials (Ministry of Energy, "Direcci6n Nacional de Energia", etc.).
26.   During Project execution, ENDE and particularly the Project Unit received valuable and timely
collaboration from Bank officials from different areas. Such cooperation was instrumental for the
adequate completion of works and Credit administration so that Project objectives were successfully
reached.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   The Project became effective in January 1988. During 1988, most of the bids were processed,
and the contract and disbursement process started.
28.   ENDE's performance can be considered satisfactory. Credit management and coordination with
different ENDE offices, governmental institutions and the Bank were assigned to a Project Executing
Unit (PEU), organized according to contract requirements. The PEU was responsible for pursuing and
monitoring the compliance of conditions for the effectiveness and execution of the Project, disbursement
handling, preparation of periodical execution advance reports, general supervision of contracts, etc. The
PEU' s early organization, and the continuity of its highly qualified personnel (it had only one Project
Head throughout the Project life) allowed it to properly fulfill its obligations.
29.   To achieve a better control, and monitor the supplies and works included in the Project, "Work
Orders" (WO) were opened for each Project component, identifying the estimated amounts of local and
foreign costs of various categories. All of these WO's were fully executed, closed, and registered for
accounting purposes.
30.   DINE suffered from insufficient Government funding which caused staffing constraints and poor
performance in reviewing sector investment programs and rate increase requests, not just by ENDE.
The Government was not diligent in handling negotiations with COBEE and timely reporting to IDA on
progress achieved. It also slowed down ENDE's procurement processes by imposing the use of
procurement Agencies. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated as satisfactory, largely
because of the robust overall performance by ENDE.
ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
31.   Project outcome was satisfactory since it fully met its objectives of contributing to the urgently
needed rehabilitation of the Power Sector productive assets and ENDE's institutional strengthening. It
could be argued that the project could have been supported by non-concessionary financing and export
credits. Such financing however, right at the end of a period of hyper-inflation would not have been
readily forthcoming and would have caused a project delay of one or two years. Increasing power
outages would have made such delays extremely costly to the whole economy. The SAR's sensitivity
analysis did not include the economic cost of likely power outages caused by project delays.
Consideration of these costs from without-project or delayed-project scenarios would have rendered a
higher ERR to the project. The immediate beneficiary of the project was the whole productive economy
of Bolivia due to the avoidance of power outages and higher operating costs of beddraggled assets.
The longer term beneficiaries have been equally the investors who purchased 50% of rehabilitated assets,
run by an institutionally robust utility ENDE, at an average 40% over book value. The beneficiaries of
the other 50% of the value of the sector assets were the Bolivian people who received them from the
Government through the capitalization process in Bolivia.
32.   All generating and transmission facilities, rehabilitated under the Credit, are operating
satisfactorily.
33.   The conclusions and recommendations produced by the consulting studies are being implemented
by ENDE:



(a)   The value of ENDE's assets in service and/or operation was identified as a result of the
Study on the Revaluation of ENDE's Fixed Assets.
(b)   The Power Expansion Master Plan was concluded and approved by DINE. It allowed to
identify the least cost Expansion Program both for ENDE and the power sector. Based
on the above Plan, the Electric Energy Generation, Transmission and Distribution
Program was designed. This program currently is the most important investment program
under implementation in the Power Sector (US$ 163.2 million), with the participation of
ENDE (main Executing Agency) and other sub-executing organizations.
(c)   The results and recommendations of the Integrated Management Information System
allowed ENDE to automate its administrative and financial procedures (accounting,
inventories, and maintenance).
34.   One of the Agreement covenants stipulated that ENDE should gradually raise its Rate of Retum
(ROR). The original ROR levels were not reached as agreed in Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement,
but since ENDE achieved satisfactory Debt Service Coverage Ratios, and was able to contribute to more
than 30% of the annual investment program with its internal cash generation, IDA waived compliance of
the ROR requirement.
35.   On July 2, 1990, ENDE signed its first Contract Plan (Contrato de Rendimiento) with DINE,
setting duly quantified efficiency goals. Unlike the poor Bank experience with Contract Plans in other
countries, ENDE complied successfully with the goals established in this contract and subsequent ones.
Such achievements show the relatively high level of efficiency reached by ENDE in its overall operation.
FUTURE OPERATION
36.   In 1995 ENDE underwent a capitalization process involving the transfer of all its generating
facilities in the Interconnected System, to three private generating companies. ENDE still remains in
charge of its isolated systems and the transmission network which are expected to be capitalized or
privatized in the near future.
37.   Future operation of the Project, currently under ENDE's control, is guaranteed since ENDE
periodical inspection of all facilities is carried out following previously designed programs. Each facility
and/or equipment has its own preventive maintenance program specifying the tasks to be carried out and
execution periods. These tasks are carried out according to international standards, manufacturers'
recommendations, and the experience of qualified personnel from ENDE.
38.   It is reasonable to expect that all remaining Project related facilities, transferred from ENDE to
the private sector, will continue to be operated and maintained properly since it is in the interest of the
new owners to minimize operating costs, and maximize profits.
39.   ENDE adequately applies all recommendations and results obtained from the consulting studies
made in the Project. In the management area, some of the procedures are subject to constant
optimization and improvement.

KEY LESSONS LEARNED
40.   The main lessons learned from the Power Rehabilitation Project are:
(a)   The PEU maintained only one Project Head throughout the entire Project life cycle. Such
person was able to develop personal relationships with IDA officials responsible for the
Credit. This relationship allowed to speed up all bureaucratic procedures.
(b)   As a result of the Project, ENDE improved its procedures to pay suppliers, particularly in
the case of purchases through international bidding. A significant portion of the Project
purchases were paid by means of direct transfers to the suppliers rather than through
Letters of Credit. This procedure generated considerable savings to ENDE by avoiding
Central Bank commissions charges for opening the Letters of Credit. ENDE is currently
using this procedure whenever applicable.
(c)   Interventions and conditions to minimize negative environmental impacts during
operation and construction of substations and transmission lines were identified early in
the project, and were dealt with in a timely, low risk and cost effective fashion.
(d)   The implementation of the Integrated MIS enabled faster decision making and more
sophisticated and effective management of all ENDE's operations. The improved data
base and information systems proved to be instrumental to the prompt institutional
preparation for the capitalization of ENDE's generation assets in July 1995.
FINAL COMMENTS
41.   Originally the Credit amounted to SDR 5.3 million, equivalent to US$ 6.8 million. Actual
disbursements equalled US$ 6.8 million even though they represent only SDR 5,099,422.88. The
remaining SDR 200,577.12 are basically the result of changes in the exchange rate between SDR's and
US$'s. The remaining unused credit funds were cancelled.
42.   Overall project execution and the institutional strengthening of ENDE was clearly a team effort
within ENDE. All the operational management units participated from the start until project completion:
planning, engineering, operations, finance and administration. It was the team approach that enabled the
ad-hoc Project Implementation Unit in ENDE to successfully coordinate, follow-up and monitor all
project activities with a very small core team at a relatively small direct cost.

*~~~~~
a/ The satisfactory rating, despite non compliance with covenanted ROR levels (formally and timely waived by IDA) responds
to the fact that the debt service coverage indicators and contribution to investment levels were robust, and higher revenues would
have caused surplus cash-flow. Also the low accounting ROR was possibly due tO gradual overvaluation of depreciated fixed
assets which were revalued yearly in strict accordance overall dollan based iRnlation indices.
b/ The development of the private sector was not a declared objective. Nevertheless, the improvements in the
management informnation system and the orderly operation of ENDE facilitated the privatization process of the Bolivian
power sector.

Una misi6n conformada por el Sr. Jorge Gorri6, Task Manager de la AIF y el Sr. Enrique
G6mez, Consultor de la AIF, visit6 la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. el dia 25 de
marzo de 1996 con objeto de cerrar la operaci6n de credito AIF 1818-BO.
1.    Revisi6n del Informe ICR Preparado por ENDE
Durante esta misi6n, se revis6 y se encontr6 satisfactorio el informe elaborado por la
Unidad Ejecutora de ENDE, correspondiente a la Parte II del Implementation Completion
Report (ICR), que fue remitido a la AIF en fecha 22 de febrero de 1996 (ver el Anexo I).
2.    Verificaci6n de los Componentes del Proyecto
El Sr. G6mez extendi6 su misi6n hasta el 29 de marzo con objeto de verificar in situ los
principales componentes del proyecto. En el curso de las visitas de inspecci6n se verific6
que las subestaciones Alalay, Cochabamba y Arocagua, en la ciudad de Cochabamba estan
en operaci6n y su propiedad ha sido transferida a la empresa distribuidora ELFEC. La
linea de transmisi6n Corani - Valle Hermoso es actualmente operada por ENDE.
Las turbinas a gas natural de Guaracachi, en la ciudad de Santa Cruz, han sido transferidas
a la empresa generadora Guaracachi S.A. Las subestaciones Urbana Sur, Warnes y Parque
Industrial, tambien en la ciudad de Santa Cruz o pr6ximas a ella son actualmente de
propiedad de la empresa distribuidora CRE.
Otro componente importante del Credito fueron los estudios de consultoria. El Sr. Gomez
verific6 que el estudio de Revalorizaci6n de Activos efectuado por la firma consultora
Lahmeyer Int. constituy6 la base para continuar con el proceso de valorizaci6n de los
activos de ENDE. Este proceso fue completado por ENDE en el aflo 1995. En opini6n de
ejecutivos de ENDE, el estudio tuvo resultados positivos y proporcion6 informaci6n
importante para la capitalizaci6n del sector electrico.
El estudio de disenio de un Sistema Integrado de Informaci6n Gerencial, tambien realizado
por la firma Lahmeyer Int. formul6 una propuesta metodol6gica basica que fue
posteriormente desarrollada por ENDE. Como resultado, actualmente ENDE utiliza
sistemas informaticos de Contabilidad, Planillas, Existencias y Mantenimiento. De acuerdo
con el criterio de funcionarios de ENDE el estudio fue exitoso.
Finalmente, el programa de computaci6n diseniado por ENDESA (Chile) para optimizar el
despacho de carga es utilizado actualmente por el Centro de Despacho de Carga.

OPERATIONAL PLAN TO MONITOR ENDE'S FUTURE OPERATIONS
On March 25, 1996 took place the Bank's final supervision/completion mission. During
the meetings conducted as a result of the above mission and discussions with ENDE's
personnel from the Project Executing Unit (PEU) agreements were reached regarding the
use of performance indicators to monitor ENDE's future operations.
Starting in 1995, all ENDE generating facilities within the National Interconnected System
(NIS) were transferred to three privately controlled companies. Henceforth, it was agreed
that the operational indices of ENDE as of December 1994, contained in Table 6 of the
ICR report, shall be used to examine the Project outcome.
It is assumed that thereafter the private sector will maintain or even improve those indices,
induced by their profit maximization drive. Also, it is assumed that ENDE will continue to
adequately maintain and operate its transmission facilities (lines and substations), and its
remaining generating units installed in isolated systems. Therefore, ENDE will also
maintain or improve upon the operational indices recorded in December of 1994.
It was agreed that the Total Electric Service Interruption Time (IT) corresponding to
ENDE as a whole, and the Thermal Efficiency factor of the Guaracachi thermoelectric
power plant would be used as additional performance indicators of ENDE even though
these parameters were not used in the Appraisal Report. These two indicators are justified
since the most important expenditures financed by the Credit consisted of the purchase of
spare parts and materials for substations and lines (US$3.88 million) and rehabilitation and
acquisition of spare parts for gas turbines installed at the Guaracachi plant, in Santa Cruz
(US$ 0.77 million).
The TI seeks to evaluate the quality of the delivered product, that is to say, the reliability
of the combined generation, transmission and subtransmission systems at high voltage bus
bar level.
The thermal efficiency measures the quantity of BTU's required to generate each kWh of
electric energy. The time series obtained for the 1984 - 1994 period appear in the Table
below.
It can be observed that electric service Interruption Time (IT), for ENDE's entire national
operation, grew to 81.9 minutes per year in 1986, just before the Project started.
I



Appendix I
Annex I
page 2 of 2
Beginning in 1987, pre-1986 levels are again attained, with an slight tendency to diminish.
The average TI for the 1984-86 period equals 71.6 minutes per year. The average for the
1987-94 period dropped to 66.9 minutes per year.
Thermal  efficiency  (TE)  of the      Performance Indicators of ENDE's Operation
Guaracachi gas turbines remained
between 13.0 and 13.5 thousand BTU
per kWh generated. During the years      Year   TI (minutes) BTU/kWh(OOO)
1987 and 1988, thermal efficiency        1984       66,7         13,13
dropped to 14.7 and 14.9 thousand         1985       66,2        13,11
BTU per kWh, respectively. In the         1986       81,9        13,47
absence of a rehabilitation program, it   1987      68,7         14,72
is likely that this indicator would have  1988       66,4        14,94
deteriorated even further during the      1990       7139        13,28
Project execution years. Nevertheless,    1991       63,0        13,26
it is observed that since 1989 TE         1992      65,8         13,28
levels reached are similar to levels     1993        66,0        13,48
registered in earlier periods (1984-      1994      60,1         13,01
86), gradually improving to finally
reach 13.0 thousand BTU per kWh in 1994.
In conclusion, the above indicators provide evidence that the Project was conducive to
maintain the quality and efficiency of the power sector in Bolivia at levels similar or
slightly improved in relation to the period before the social and economic crisis
experienced between 1982 and 1987.

2.    GENERAL PROJECT OBJECTIVES
To rehabilitate some generation units; improve the transmission system; improve ENDE's
operational efficiency and develop a Power Expansion Master Plan.
3.    SPECIFIC CREDIT DESTINATION
On the one hand, acquisition of spare parts, equipment and materials for substations and
lines, construction of Alalay and Urbana Sur substations and expansion of Montero
substation, voltage change in the Potosi - Telamayu line and construction of the
Guaracachi - Substation Sur. On the other hand, preparation of a Power Expansion
Master Plan, contracting consulting services in a) engineering, b) revaluation of ENDE' s
fixed assets, and c) design of an integrated information system, and acquisition of devices,
computers, software, etc.
Requests to modify the project scope were presented to the Association, the First
Amendment being approved on December l", 1988. A Second Amendment requested by
ENDE will be considered by the Association at the time the Project is closed.
4.    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The attained project objectives and results are satisfactory. The Project improved the
development of the Power Sector and strengthened ENDE. Due to its scope, the Project
did not have any environmental problems, nor any particular physical risks. The Project
was executed, in general, within the time schedule established in the Staff Appraisal
Report and the Project Agreement. The Project is considered to be closed on October 31I
1994. The amount of Credit not used and cancelled is SDR. 200,577.17 (3.78%).
5.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  AND  MAIN  FACTORS AFFECTING
THE PROJECT
Credit implementation was delayed due to bureaucratic procedures at the level of
Government Institutions and others. Nevertheless, an overall evaluation of the Project
shows that the original time schedule has been fulfilled. Regarding the Association, some
activities required more time than what ENDE estimated, such as the "no objections" to
the bidding documents, publications, awards of bids, contracts and expansion of contracts.
6.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
Fulfillment of the Project objectives is reflected in their contribution to the electric sector
expansion in the areas of generation and transmission of electric energy. The
implementation of studies for ENDE's institutional strengthening have improved the
efficient and automatic flow of information. There is a high probability of maintaining
these achievements over time.



7.  BANK PERFORMANCE
ENDE was visited by five Bank missions between 1987 and 1991, receiving ample
cooperation for the Project evaluation, effectivity, implementation, and supervision.
Because of the importance of the Project for the Bolivian Power Sector the visits were
extended to Government authorities. Also, during the Project implementation, ENDE
received valuable and decisive collaboration from Bank officials from the different
sections, to successfully reach the objectives previously mentioned.
8.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
The Borrower (ENDE) performance can be considered satisfactory since the Credit
management; the coordination with the different ENDE units, Government institutions and
the financing organism were carried out by the Project Executing Unit organized
according to contractual requirements.
9.    ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
Following the execution of the Project, the obtained results are highly satisfactory, having
contributed to the rehabilitation of the Power Sector and ENDE's institutional
strengthening.
10.   FUTURE OPERATION
Future Project operation is guaranteed since ENDE carries out periodic inspections of its
facilities, according to internationally established norms. In addition, the results and
recommendations of the studies made by consulting firms are being properly applied by
ENDE.
11.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS
i. To value the importance of the environment.
ii. Improve the payment procedure and others.
iii. A change in the energy policy of Brazil canceled the feasibility of a project (Puerto
Suarez Thermoelectric).
