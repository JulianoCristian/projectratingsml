1. CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Country,               BOLIVIA
Borrowert              The Republic of Bolivia
Beneficiary:           Empresa Nacio;al de Electricidad S.A. - ENDE
Amount:                SDR 5.3 million (US$6.8 million equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard IDA
Relending Terms:       8.5%, 20 years including 4 years of grace.  The
beneficiary would bear the foreign exchange risk to
the US-dollar.
Proiect Obiectives
and Description:     The power sector in Bolivia faces serious
difficulties arising from sector policy weakness and
the deterioration of the Bolivian economy during
1981-1986. To prevent further decline in the
quality of service, a general rehabilitation of
ENDE's generating units and elimination of
transmission bottlenecks are required. The
Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) approved by IDA
in May 1986 provided financing for a first phase of
rehabilitation and the proposed project would help
meet the balance of rehabilitation needs. The
elimination of bottlenecks in the transmission
system would be achieved through the construction of
small transmission links and the installation of
strategic transformers under the proposed project.
ENDE's organization would be improved through
consulting services for a management information
system. The project would also assist in improving
the power sector organization through better
definition of responsibilities of the various
agencies of the sector: Direccion Nacional de
Electricidad (DINE), a department of the Ministry of
Energy and Hydrocarbons, would: (a) review the
investment programs of the companies, (b) regulate
the sector, (c) set tariffs in accordance with the
National Electricity Code; ENDE woulds (a) plan the
expansion of the sector, (b) construct generating
plants only over one MW capacity and operate only
plants over 5MW, (c) construct and operate the
transmission system; the regional distribution
companies would be responsible for all other
activities. Power sector planning would be greatly
improved by the preparation of a Power Expansion
Master Plan, which would define the least cost long
range expansion program for the sector taking into
account the conclusions of an energy strategy

exercise that is under way, financed by UNDP, with
the Bank as executing agency. This plan would
minimize future cost of electricity and would be the
basis for the preparation of the Public Investment
Program for the power sector.
Benefits and Risks:    The proposed project would help to rehabilitate the
power sector, eliminating a constraint to production
recovery. The elimination of the transmission
bottlenecks and the rehabilitation of existing
generation facilities would provide the adequate
electricity supply to support the recovery of the
Bolivian economy. The reorganization of the power
sector, which the project would support, would allow
a better overall planning for the public sector
investments. DINE would be the repository of all
the necessary data for the Government to implement a
Public Investment Program in the power sector, which
now lacks data and plans. Due to the nature of the
project no particular physical risks or negative
environ- mental consequences are expected.

2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Resources
2.01     Bolivia's domestic energy resources are not yet fully known as
large portions of the country have not been sufficiently studied. This
notwithstanding, commercial energy resources are estimated at 1,230 million
metric tons of oil equivalent (t.o.e.), which at the present rate of
domestic consumption would be sufficient for the next 400 years. The known
resource base includes 18,000 MW of economically feasible hydro potential
(84%), 6.7 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas reserves (14%) and 187
million barrels of oil (2%). Bolivia also has a geothermal zone, deposits
of uranium in quantities not yet defined and indications of coal and
lignite. However, this relative abundance glosses over potentially severe
supply constraints because of the unequal rate at which resources are
currently being exploited. Above all, the use of gas compared to petroleum
is very small, given the availability of the two resources.
Energy Deman. and Supply
2.02     In 1984, the Bolivian net production oc commercial energy was 4.4
million t.o.e. of which 48.2% from natural gas, 24.7% from oil, 20.7% from
fuelwood, 4.1% hydroelectricity and 2.3% bagasse. Overall, Bolivia is a
net-exporter of energy. Most (82%) of the gas production was exported to
Argentina. The national energy consumj:.ion is very low: in 1984, the per
capita energy consumption was 0.4 t.o.e. (Argentina 1.8, Brazil 0.95, Peru
0.6). In 1984, residential, commercial and governmental users consumed
54.9% of all energy, transportation 26.5%, and mining and industry 19.6%.
Ilore recent data is not available in a consolidated form. Annex 1 shows
t:ae demand and production of natural gas and petroleum for the period 1978-
1985.
Ererpy Sector Institutional Structure
2.03     The Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons is responsible for
formulating energy policies, coordinating plans and monitoring the
execution of projects by the energy corporations. However, the Ministry
has not been able to fully discharge these responsibilities due to lack of
a strong and capable plTnning unit. In April 1983, UNDP/World Bank
prepared an Energy Assessment which recommended the preparation of a
minimum cost expansion plan for ENDE's system. This assessment also
recommended relative price changes for oil products and natural gas to give
the right incentives to interfuel substitution and that the gas price
should reflect its opportunity cost or its supply cost. The present
Government has agreed with UNDP and the Bank to undertake an energy
atrategy exercise to recommend policies and strategies for the energy
sector in the context of a first Energy Master Plan. Energy pricing is one
of the most important policies to be defined. It is also the most relevant
for the power sector as the choice between future hydro or gas based power
generation projects is highly dependent utpon the opportunity cost of
natural gas, which in turn depends on a sale agreement with Brazil still to
be negotiated, and the continuation of sales to Argentina after 1992, when
the present sales agreement ends.



- 5 -
2.04     The UNDP/World Bank energy strategy exercise will follow-up the
work carried out by the energy assessment of April 1983, with the objective
of ranking investment alternatives in the energy sector, improving the
financial viability of the key en .gy institutions and the coordination
within the energy sector. Work started in November 1966 and is expected to
last six months. The te .ms of reference for this work include the
evaluation of the macroeconomic impact of the energy sector; analysis of
the supply and demand of petroleum, natural gas and electricity; analysis
of the institutional and organizational aspects of the Ministry of Energy
and Hydrocarbons; and definition of options and strategies for the energy
sector. The results of this exercise will be the basis for the preparation
of a Power Expansion Master Plan by the power sector to be initiated as
soon as the exercise is completed.
Power Sector Oraanization and Regulation
2.05     The Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons is responsible for
formulating the policies for the power sector as well as for regulating
power system operations. The National Electricity Code of 1968 established
the Ministry as the regulatory agency for the electric sector, with, inter
alis, the responsibility of authorizing the installation of power plants,
the concessions to power companies, regulating the operation of the
companies and approving tariffs through the Direccion Nacional de
Electricidad (DINE).
2.06     DINE's power and organization have been weakened In recent years
eue to the low salaries paid to its technical personnel and to Decree No.
21,060 of August 1985 which established that electricity tariffs for
domestic use should be negotiated between ENDE and the utilities which in
turn would negotiate distrilAtion tariffs with the consumers represented by
the city councils (para. 2.17). DINE's strengthening and reorganization
would allow the Government to review the investment programs presented by
the companies and to consider them in the preparation of the Public
Investment Program. During negotiations it was agreed tl.at the Government
will revise Decree 21,060 to abolish the system of tariff negotiations and
to reassign to DINE the responsibility for setting the rates of ENDE and
the distribution companies based on the National Electricity Code. It was
also agreed a plan of action to strengthen DINE's organization, staffing
and functions in order to allow DINE to set tariff review investment
programs for the power sector and give adequate support for sector policy
preparation.
2.07     The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity is
carried out by the power companies. Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
(ENDE) is responsible for generation and transmission and regional power
companies for distribution. ENDE is in charge of planning the expansion of
the electric sector and developing, constructing and operating new
generation and transmission facilities in the whole country, except in the
cities of La Paz and Oruro. ENDE, besides selling bulk power to the
distribution companies, serves directly mines and factories in various
departments,
2.08     The eight existing regional power companies provide mainly for
power distribution in the cities. With the exception of the Bolivian Power



Company, COBEE-BPC, and the Empresa de Luz y Fuerza Electrica do Oruro,
ELFEO, which operate their own generation facilities, the regional power
companies buy their energy - even in small isolated systems - from ENDE.
The generation of electricity at remote locations in small generation
plants has burdened ENDE with very expensive operating costs and the
obligation of maintaining administrative services in various places. ;le
operation of the small generation plants by regional distribution companies
would reduce the operating cost for the sector improving the overall
efficiency. Therefore ENDE should be responsible for the oparation of only
large (above 5 MW) generation plants. This distribution of
responsibilities, however, should be accompanied by a planning coordinatlon
of the preparation of t'he regional companies expansioa programs by ENDE,
and by a more strict revier of the investment programs by DINE when
preparing the tariff studi^es. Accordingly, during negotiations it was
agreed that: (i) DINE will review the investment programs of the power
companies and control the sector in addition to setting tariffs; (ii) ENDE
will be responsible for planning the expansion uf the generation and
transmission system in coordination with the distribution planning of the
regional companies; (iii) ENDE will construct and operate generation plants
over 5 MW and only when approved by DINE will construct the power plants in
the range 1 to 5 MW; (iv) ENDE will submit to the Associaticn by October
31, 1987 a program to transfer the operation of the generation facilities
under 5 MW to the Distribution Companies.
2.09     The largest distribution company is COBEE-BPC, a private foreigrn
owned company responsible for generation and distribution in the city cf La
Paz and 'hrough its subsidiary ELFEO in the city of Oruro. COBEE-BPC's
concession will expire in 1990 and responsibility for electricity supply in
these areas after that date has not yet been defined. COBEE-BPC first
offered to the Government to withdraw by the end of 1990. Recently,
however, the owners of COBEE-BPC indicated their willingness to continue
providing power service under certain conditions to be agreed upon with the
municipality of La Paz.  The Cfvernment has not yet defin-d its position.
Because of this lack of definition, investments in the distribution system
have been postponed with the consequent decline of quality of service (it
is estimated that around 20,000 houses are not connected to the electricity
distribution system in the area of La Paz). A final definition of the
responsibility for electricity supply in La Paz and Oruro cities should be
taken before COBEE-BPC's concession expires. During negotiations the
Government agreed to furnish to the Association, on a quarterly basis,
begining in January 1988, a report on the progress of negotiations with
COBEE-BPC and, by not later than December 31, 1988, to furnish to the
Association a ,lan of action, with respect to the provision of power in
such cities after the expiration of COBEE-BPC contract.
2.10.    The second most important distribution company is the Cooperativa
Rural de Electrificacion Ltda., CRE, a cooperative responsible for power
distribution in the Department of Santa Cruz. Empresa de Luz y Fuerza
Electrica Ae Cochabamba, ELFEC, serves the third most important market in
the city ot Cochabamba and its department; ENDE is its major shareholder.
There are four more distribution companies (CESSA, SEPSA, SETAR, COSERELEC)
which serve the departments of Chuquisaca, Potosi, Tarija, and Beni.
Service is basically limited to the respective capitals. CORDEPANDO, the
regional development corporation is responsible for power generation and



- 7 -
distr0ution in the department of Pando. Corporacion de Fomento Energetico
Rural, COFER, is responsible for planning and conftruction of rural
electrification projects which are then handed over to cooperatives for
ojeratikn. After two US-AID loans, which were fully disbursed by 1981, no
major Investment has been made for lack of funds. The existing rural
electrification cooperatives have not succeeded. Recently the Government
has transferred responsibility for financing of rural electrification to
the regional development corporations. Rural electrification is not a
priority in the present economic context.
Existing Power Supply System Facilities
2.11     Bolivia has a total installed capacity of 600 MW, of which only
485 MW are effective (see Annex 2), and the annual production in 1985 was
1715 GWh. Of the installed capacity, 29? MW (49%) are hydroelectric and
303 MW (51%) thermoelectric. Four zones: North (La Paz), Central
(Cochabamba and Oruro), South (Potosi, Uyuni and Sucre) and Eastern (Santa
Cruz) account for 460 MW and the remaining installed capacity (140 MW)
corresponds to isolated regions. In 1985, ENDE owned 48% of installed
capacity and generated 47% of energy, the rest was shared between auto
producers (20X, mostly in mining) and regional companies (32%, above all
COBEE-BPC). Annex 2 lists details of existing installed capacity.
2.2     Most of ENDE9s transmission system consists of single-eircuit
lines which are operated at 115 kV and 69 kV. At the end of 1986 ENDE had
910 km of 115 kV (of which 203 km are insulated for future operation at 220
kV), 488 km of 69 kV lines and 277 km of 25 kV or lower voltage lines. The
North, Central and South systems are actually interconnected by ENDE's
traxnsmission lines (see Map). ENDE is initiating the construction of the
trtnsmission line from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz to include the Eastern
system into the interconnected system (planned to be in operation by 1989
and financed by %orporacion Andina de Fomento, CAt, and suppliers).
Electricity Demand
2.13     With 90 watts of installed capacity per capita (1985), annual per
capita consumption of 270 kWh and a coverage of 40% of the country's
population with access to electricity, Bolivia is among the countries with
lowest electricity usage in South America. Total consumption in 1985 was
1513 GWh and maximum demand 360 MW. In the decade of the 70's, eleotricity
consumption grew at an average annual rate of 7.3%. However, after 1981
when it reached 1503 GWh total consumption has stagnated mainly due to
reduction in industrial and mining activity. The following table shows the
average annual growth rates of electricity consumption by sectors:
Annual growth rate (%)
1975-e8      1982-55       1975-85
Mining                            3.7          -3.2          0.9
Industry                         14.1         -4.2           6.4
Residential                      10.0          6.3           8.5
Commerce                          7.8          2.0           5.4
Public Lighting                  15.3          0.9           9.3
Others                           18.6          13.9         16.7
Total                           8.5          0.2           5.1



- 8 -
2.14     At present, economic prospects are still uncertain and, therefore,
growth of electricity demand cannot be forecasted with confidence. An
enalysis of the different consumption sectors reveals that:
(i) Consumption by the mining sector will de rease further because of
the fall in tin prices and other minerals. COMIBOL is closing some
of the inefficient mines and the private mining companies will
reduce their production even more. However, some gold mines are
becoming attractive and could increase their power consumption.
The medium term prospects are to achieve by 1995 the same level of
electricity consumption ocurred in 1985.
(ii) Industrial consumption is expected to start growing in 12-18
months;
(iii)  Residential consumption is steadily growing in pace with population
growth and extension of population attended. Residential demand in
the city and the Department of Santa Cruz is increasing rapidly
because of internal migration attracted by its economic potential.
Electric consumption in Santa Cruz is estimated to have grown 11.9%
in 1986.
2.15     ENDE forecasts electricity demand in Bolivia to grow during the
period of the proposed project by the following annual growth rates for the
different sectors (Annex 3):
Sector                  Annual growth rate (2)
1986-1995
Mining                            -0.1
Industry                           2.6
Residential                        9.2
Commerce                           7.8
Public Lighting                    8.4
Total                            5.5
The above growth rates may be considered adequate because they
consider the expected tendency of the different consumption sectors as
commented in detail in Annex 3.
Tariffs
2.16     In the first half of the eighties, rates were not sufficiently
adjusted to take into account the effects of inflation and continuing
capital investment accompanied by a reduction of growth of sales. In
addition, a basically sound regulation was replaced by a far less
satisfactory one. The National Electricity Code of 1968 provides that
electricity rates should be set so as to achieve, after covering cost of
operation including depreciation, ar. average rate of return of 9% on
revalued net fixed assets in operation plus ce;tain parts of working
capital (page 4 of annex 4 gives details on the relevant principles in the
Electricity Code). The sector achieved those rates of return until 1978.
Since then they have been greatly reduced. According to preliminary data,
ENDE obtained in 1986 a rate of return of only 2.72, while rates of return
of distribution companies varied between 71 for COBEE-BPC and 32 for



- 9 -
smaller ones. The tariff structure is biased towards domestic consumption.
In 1986, high voltage consumers from industry and mining whose average rate
was US-Cents 8.0/kWh, paid over three times more than the distribution
companies which purchased energy from ENDE at ar?oximately the same
voltage level and were charged only US-Cents 2.5/kWh.
2.17     The Electricity Code provided that DINE was responsible for
setting rates in the power sector. In August 19859 the new Government
published Decree 21,060 which defined the basic outlines for its economic
policy. As par; of that regulation, it established that electricity rates
for domestic use should be negotiated between ENDE and the distribution
companies which in turn would negotiate their rates with the consumers
represented by the city councils. It further established for ENDE a
maximum average rate of US-Cents 4.5/kWh for sales to industrial and mining
customers which was changed to US-Cents 7.5/kWh in Decree 21,072 of
September 1985.  Since then, most. distribution companies have not been able
to reach agreement with the city councils on rate increases. This causes
the distribution companies to reject any rate increases that ENDE wants to
implement thereby transferring their financial problems to the generation
and transmission level. Annex 4 contains detailed information on the tariff
situation.
2.18     These issues should be addressed through a step-by-step approach.
In the credit documents for the RIC (Credit 1703-BO) signed in June 1986,
the Bolivian Government and the Association agreed to revise the level and
structur.i of electricity rates taking into account the provisions of the
Electricity Code. As a first step, on February 26, 1987, the Government
approved a decree (Decreto Supremo No. 21,527) increasing by 1.5% (in US$)
per month ENDE's rates for distribution companies. During negotiations the
Government agreed that this decree will be implemented in accordance with
its terms and that a condition of effectiveness would be that DINE issue a
resolution changing ENDE's rates in line with Decreto Supremo 21.527.
These rate increases for distribution companies will help to improve slowly
the financial situation of ENDE changing at the same time the ratio ',etween
rates for distribution companies and ENDE's bulk rates for mining and
industry which would remain unchanged. The re-establishing of DINE as a
regulatory agency for the power sector and its renewed responsibility for
tariff setting on the basis of the National Electricity Code will provide
the necessary institutional and legal framework. However, the 92 target
zate of return of the Electricity Code will be achieved only gradually. In
the medium term, the UNDP/World Bank energy strategy exercise (para. 2.04)
will also include an updating of the marginal cost study which was made
during 1980/81 under IDB sponsorship. In the longer term, the Power
Expansion Master Plan and the study to revalue ENDE's asset, (paras. 3.17
and 3.18) will improve the data basis for the definition of tariffs.
During negotiations it was agreed that the Government will discuss with the
Association the results of each of these studies and after their completion
will furnish to the Association a satisfactory implementation program for
such recommendations then agreed with the Association.
Power Sector Development Objectives and Strategy
2.19     The future strategic objectives of the Bolivian Power Sector
should be the following:



- 10 -
(i) rehabilitation of existing facilities by the acquisition of spare
parts, overhauling of equipment, small improvements and
optimization of use of existing facilities;
(ii) interconnection of Eastern System (Santa Cruz) to the
interconnected grid of ENDE;
(iii) establishment of a planning system for the sector based on a least
cost expansion program which should be periodically updated aiming
at minimizing future cost of electricity and serving as the basis
for the Power Sector Investm3nt Program.
(iv) re-establishment of sound policies and practices for rate setting.
To achieve that, DINE should have its structure reinforced with a
team of high skilled technicians;
(v) definition of the responsibilities of the various agencies of the
sector to improve its organization: DINE for the review of the
investment programs of the companies, for setting tariffs, and for
control of the sec.or; ENDE for planning the expansion of the
generation and transmission system in coordination with the
distribution planning of the regional companies, for construction
and operation of only large generation plants (over 5 MW), for the
construction and operation of the transmission system and the power
dispatch center; the Regional Distribution entities for all other
responsibilities.
-sank Group Participation in the Power Sector
2.20     Since 1964 the Bank and IDA have made four credits and one loan to
the sector. These weres three credits and one loan to ENDE totalling
US$48.4 million and one credit to COBEE-BPC of US$5.0 million. The most
recent loan was signed on 06102/76. Bank participation, through the First
Power Project (Credit 61-BO/IDA) was instrumental for the creation of ENDE
and through subsequent louns, contributed to sector organization and
planning. The last loan ('238-BO) helped finance thA interconnection of
the Central (Cochabamba) and Southern (Potosi) systems. In FY82 the Bank
appraised a power project to finance the construction of the transmission
line from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz, but this project was not processed due
to the economic situation of the country. In 1986 Bank/IDA resumed its
activities in Bolivia and the power sector was included in the
Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) with and allocation of US$1.8 million to
buy spare parts for generating and transformer units.
2.21     Bank experience with ENDE has in general been satisfactory; no
major problems have been encounteLed during the execution of projects. The
first IDA Credit to ENDE (61-BO) in 1964 which financed the construction of
the 27 SlW Coranl hydroelectric power plant, was executed satisfactorily.
Projects financed by IDA Credits 148-B03 (1969) and 433-BO4 (1973)
experiered some cost overruns and completion delays, due to internrstional
I/ PPAR dated March 7, 1977.

market price instability, some unforeseen technical difficulties (adverse
geological conditiors in Santa Isabel), and ENDE's relatively short
experience in new fields such as gas turbines. The interconnection project
financed by IBRD's Loan 1238-BO (1976) was carried out with only minor
problems, but with delays. The preparation of the proposed project took
into account the lessons learnt in these projects mainly the implementation
time which was considered as the IDA's standard time of seven years.

3. THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
3.01     The Government of Bolivia has requested IDA's support for its
efforts to revitalize the economy. An important factor in accomplishing
this is t2ie rehabilitation of the Power Sector. In May 1986 IDA approved
the Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) of US$55 million equivalent which
includes an allocation of US$1.8 million equivalent for the power sector.
This allocation covers a first program of acquisition of spare parts and
materials for repair and maintenance of generating units and transformers
for substation enlargements of which US$0.3 million has been disbursed.
ENDE has already submitted to IDA various procurement documents and is
issuing bidding documents, it being expected that the rest of the credit
allocation will be disbursed during 1987.
3.02     ENDE initially proposed a power engineering project to finance the
final design of the next generation project as well as spare parts and
equipments. Further analysis showed that the final design should only be
started after the completion of a least cost expansion program. During the
visit of an IDA mission to Bolivia in July 1986, the components of the
proposed project were adjusted accordingly. The project was so modified
and during the appraisal mission in December 1986 final agreement was
reached for all project components.
3.03     The objectives of the proposed project, as redefined are:
(i)  tc  Ahabilitate some of ENDE's existing generating units mainly by
overhauling them and carrying out delayed maintenance;
(ii) to improve ENDE's transmission system by relocating existing
transformers or installing new ones in accordance with the system's
actual loads eliminating present restrictions for transmission of
energy, as well as, the construction of small transmission links to
eliminate bottlenecks;
(iii) to improve ENDE's operational efficiency by strengthening its
information system, mainly in the financial and administrative
fields;
(iv) to develop a Power Expansion Master Plan to define the least cost
long range expansion program for the sector taking into account the
conclussions of the UNDP/World Bank energy strategy exercise.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.04     The most urgent needs for rehabilitation of the sector were funded
through the RIC. The proposed credit now addresses further rehabilitation
needs and institutional changes. IDA's continued involvement is expected
to serve as a catalyst for the participation of otter interested donors in
the sector's rehabilitation and expansion. The reo:ganization of the power
sector, which the project would support, would allot better overall
planning for the public sector investment program. The rationale of future
capital investment from external and internal sources will be closely
monitored through this project and IDA's public expenditure program review
in the country.



- 13 -
Implementation Agency
3.05     ENDE was established in 1965 as a stock corporation in charge of
planning the expansion of the power sector and developing, constructing and
operating new generation and transmission facilities, independent of their
size, in the whole country. The cities of La Paz and Oruro, however, were
in fact excluded a.s there was already a foreign concessionary.   The
company, besides selling bulk power to the distribution companies, serves
directly mines and factories outside the main towns in various departments.
Until 1985, Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento, CBF, owned 87% of the shares
and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, YPFB, and Corporacion
Minera de Bolivia, COMIBOL, the rest (6.5% each). The present Government
dissolved CBF and its shares have provisionally beer. transferred to the
Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons. Although this arrangemptnt has so far
not hindered the decision making process with ENDE's Board of Directors,
diring negotiations the Government committed itself to submit to the
Association by December 31, 1987 a satisfactory proposal for the
distribution of ENDE's shares previously owned by CBP in a way that allows
ENDE to operate with satisfactory autonomy.
3.06     ENDE's organization follows the general pattern for stock
corporations in Bolivia. The Shareholder's Assembly elects five members of
the Board of Directors and the General Manager, and approves the company's
financial statements. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is appointed
by the President of the Republic who has traditionally entrusted this task
to the Minister of Energy and Hydrocarbons. The major responsibilities of
the Board include approval of annual budgets, major capital investments and
credit and loan operations. The General Manager is in charge of managing
the day-to-day operations of the company. ENDE changed its organizational
structure at the beginning of 1987 (Annex 5). Overall, ENDE's organization
can be considered adequate fer its present responsibilities. Annex 6
contains supplementary information about ENDE.
3.07     ENDE managed in the past to remain isolated from the high turnover
of personnel which characterized most institutions in the Bolivian Public
Sector. Since it began operations twenty years ago, it has had only five
General Managers and a stable workforce, which averaged 440 people in 1986.
The company's staff is in general well qualified and competent. Although
in 1985, high rates of inflatioh eroded the salaries paid by EN?E, in the
second semester of 1986 the situation began improving and further salary
adjustments are envisaged for 1987. Therefore, the managemant and
personnel situation is considered satisfactory.
3.08     ENDE is covering its needs for external training through bilateral
technical cooperation with governmental agencies of foreign countries. As
a result during the last three years, 48 of the present staff of 130
professionals (mainly engineers and economists) were trained in foreign
courses. ENDE has also routine In-house training as well as training in
local institutions. As a consequence 67 of the 250 technicians (middle
level) were trained during 1986. For the futuret ENDE has an adequate
training program following the same orientation.



Past Financial Performance
3.09     1978 was the last year when ENDE achieved the 9% rate of return
requirement of the Electricity Code. Although ENDE's growth of sales in
1982 started slowing down and since 1984 has almost come to a standstill,
the capital Investment program could not be reduced at the same pace. As a
result, between 1978 and 1986 the rate base increased by more than 4501,
while sales grew by only 65%. During the same period ENDE's operating cost
net of depreciation per kWh more than doubled (US-Cents 0.55/kWh in 1978
compared to US-Cents 1.30/kWh in 1986) while the average rate was adjusted
by only 352 (from US-Cents 2.66/kWh in 1978 to US-Cents 3.59 in 1986). As
a consequence, ENDE's rate of return was reduced from 9.2% in 1978 to 2.7%
by 1986. Financially, due to a favorable debt structure (1986s average
interest rate on long term debt 7.8X, average amortization period 8.9
years) EDE in principle could have uaintained a satisfactory liquidity
p,osition. However, as tho economic situation in the country worsened and
inflation rates soared ENDE's clients delayed payments more and more
(receivables increased from 83 days equivalent of sales to 128 days in
1985) and the value of their psyments (in real terms) when finally made was
only a fraction of what they initially owed as bills outstanding were not
adjusted for inflation. At the end of 1986, ENDE had accumulated overdue
debt for US$18.3 million, of which US$15.7 million was owed to comercial
banks. In addition, an overdue amount of US$42.7 owed to Bolivian
creditors in accordance with Decree 21,527 of February 26, 1987 was
provisionally capitalized (Annexes 7 and 13 contain details).
3.10     Due to hyperinflation and overvaluation of the Bolivian currency,
past figures, especially for the years 1984/1985, have to be regarded with
caution. The proposed management consultants for revaluation of assets
(para 3.18) will help ENDE in establishing the value of its assets and in
devising a methodology for future revaluation. During negotiations it was
agreed that ENDE will use that methodology in the future for its annual
financial statements.
3.11     The proposed management consultants for a management information
system (para 3.18) would help ENDE in its financial planning and
forecasting. In the last three years, annual audits have been carried out
by the national firm Telleria, Ormachea and Troche, representatives of the
international firm Deloitte, Haskins and Sells, and audit reports have
normally been issued within three months of the company's fiscal year end.
In general, these reports did not include major qualifications. At
negotiations agreement on the standard audit clause was rea-hed, i.e. that
ENDS will continue to engage independent auditors satisfactory to the
Association and that their report would be submitted to the Association not
later than four months after the end of the fiscal year.
3.12     Accounts receivable have in the past fluctuated between 90 and 140
days, depending mainly on the financial situation of COMIBOL and Empresa
lacional de Fundiciones, ENAF, two of ENDE's major clients. In 19869 they
have improved considerably (to 76 days). As the Government with assistance
from the Association is concentrating on improving the efficiency of those
Institutions, a reasonable assumption is that this will also be reflected
In prompt payment of ENDE's bills.

Power Market
3.13     ENDE's present load forecast for the electric power market was
derived taking into account historical statistics and economic trends, and
is based on separate forecasts for the interconnected system and for each
isolated area, as well as, for each category of consumption. Electricity
consumption is expected to grow at an average rate of 5.93% for the period
1987-1990 and at a rate of 6.72% for the period 1990-1995 (Annex 3). The
interconnected system plus Santa Crua, are expected to have the following
energy generation and peak capacity requirementes

(a)  Santa Cruz is considered to be integrated to the interconnected system
at the end of 1989.
3.14     The power balance (Annex 8) shows that the interconnected system
will need additional generating capacity by 1989. Santa Cruz, however,
will have deficits of 1.8 MW in 1987, 13.1 MW in 1988 and 28.1 MW in 1989.
To eliminate these deficits ENDE is acquiring a 20 MW gas turbine (to be
financed by German bilateral assistance) to be in operation by the end of
1987 and will process a similar operation to have a second 20 MW gas
turbine to be in operation by mid 1988.
3.15     The power balance (Annex 8) shows that after 1990 (when Santa Cruz
will be included in the interconnected system) the interconnected system
would have the following expected deficits:

1995                     205.0                          167.0
3.16     In the absence of a long term power sector generation expansion
plan beyond 1990, ENDE has prepared a satisfactory tentative capital
investment program for 1987 to 1989. It includes only investments needed
for ongoing project, the gas turbines for Santa Cruss small substations and
transmission expansion to enable development of the productive sectors,
rehabilitation of existing generation units, and studies. Ende is planning
to cover the deficits in the period 1990-1995 by installing additional gas
turbines and through modification of existing hydropower facilities this,
however, will be reviewed according to a Master Plan, yet to be prepared.

ENDE's Investment Program
3.17     A well-defined mster expansion plan for the power sector is not
available. For the near future expansion of generation is required only in
Santa Crux. The long-range generation expansion will be studied in a Power
Expansion Master Plan which will will follow terms of reference to be
prepared by ENDE and to be submitted to the Association. This plan is to
be ready by September 1988 and will define a generation and transmission
expansion program aimed at minimizing future electricity costs. The
preparation of the Power Expansion Master Plan should be followed by a
rationalization of the investments in the power which should be guided by
the least-cost program proposed in the plan. This would go further than
the RIC covenants which refrains ENDE from initiating the construction of
new poser generation facilities which would increase the national
generation capacity by more than 25 megawatts. To accomplish that, by
negotiations, ENDS agreed to submit by May 1988 the draft of the Power
Expansion Master Plan to the Association for comments and by September 1988
the final version as approved by all agencies concerned. Henceforth,
unless otherwise agreed with IDA, all future generation and transmission
investment in the power sector will follow the program defined in the Plan.
Project Description
3.18     The project consists of:
(i) Acquisition of spare parts and equipment for the 1987-1989
maintenance program of ENDE's facilities, mainly the overhaul of
its generating units;
(ii) The adaptation of substations to present needs and of the
subtransmission system in Santa Cruz by the following improvements
(Annex 10):
- Construction of Alalay substation (Cochabamba) -115 kV/10 kV-25
MVA
- Construction of the Urbana Sur substation (Santa Cruz) 69 kV/10
kV-25 MVA
- Change of voltage (from 69 kV to 115 kV) of the transmission line
Potosi-Telamayu (isolated for 115 kV but operating in 69 kV) by
modifications and addition of transformers in Potosi and Telamayu
substations
- Increase in the capacity of Montero substation (Santa Crus) by
the addition of a transformer 69 kV/25 kV -12.5 MVA
- Construction of subtransmission line 69 kV Huaracachi -S/E Sur to
close the subtransmission loop of Santa Cruz
(iii) The preparation of a Power Expansion Master Plan, based on the
conclusions of the UNDP/World Bank energy exercise, to define the
least cost expansion program for the power sector up to year 2010;
(iv) Engineering consultant services to help ENDE in preparing
specifications and procurement of equipment cost estimates and bid
evaluation as well as the preparation of the Power Expansion Master
Plan and distribution studies;



- 17 -
(v) Management consultant services tot
- define the criteria and prepare a methodology and carry out the
implementation for future revaluation of ENDE's fixed assets,
investments and inventories;
- develop an integrated Management Information System consisting
of:
- design of an integrated Information System for ENDE, mainly
for accounting, financial management, inventories,
construction and maintenance;
- acquisition of hardware (mainframe and micro computers);
- acquisition and adaptation of software; and
- implementation of the new system.
The Consultant services included in the proposed project would be engaged
by ENDE under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. It is estimated that
the following manpower would be required: (i) 20 staff-month for
engineering consultant services; and (ii) 45 staff-month for management
consultant services.
Prolect Cost and Financing
3.19     Annex 10 shows a detailed estimate of the expected cost for the
substation and transmission part of the project. The total project cost,
including physical and price contingencies amounts to US$8.45 million of
which US$6.51 million in foreign exchange. Project costs are summarized in
the following table (in US$ million).

3.20     The project base costs were estimated at December 1986 price
levels. The cost estimate was prepared by ENDE's staff using the most
recent costs obtained by ENDE in acquisitions and constructions and were



- 18 -
considered within reasonable cost levels by IDA mission. The cost
estimates for consultant services were based on average staff-month costs
using IDA's experience for similar services.
3.21     Physical contingencies were calculated on the basis  of 10% for
transmission lines and spare parts, and 5% for substations aad consultant
services, which were considered to be reasonable given the accuracy of the
above estimates. Price contingencies, for both foreign and local
components, were applied to the base cost plus physical contlngency using
the following annual escalation factorst 3.0% for 1987; 1.O for 1988;
1.0% for 1989; 1.0% for 1990; 3.5Z for 1991; 3.5% for 1992; 3.5% for 1993;
3.5% for 1994. For calculation of the price contingency the project
implementation was considered to occur based on the expected disbursement
schedule (Annex 12) which reflects IDA standard disbursement profiles.

the proceeds of the IDA credit to ENDE for a 20-year term, including a 4-
year grace period, at a fixed interest rate of 8.5%, which is approximately
10% higher than the present Bank rate, and at a commitment charge of 0.75%.
As ENDE's rates are fixed in Bolivianos applying the current exchange rate
to the US-dollar, the loan to ENDE would also be denominated in US-dollars.
The signature of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of
credit effectiveness.

3.25     Procurement of goods and works to be financed from the proposed
credit would be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with IDA's guidelines for procurement, except for spare parts
which will be purchased through Direct Contracting, because they are
obtainable only from one source, the equipment manufacturer. Local
manufacturers will receive a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable
import duties, whichever is lower, for bid evaluation. Consultants for
engineering and management would be selected from a short list of
consulting firms following IDA guidelines. All contracts for goods
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more would be subject to
IDA's prior review of bidding documentation in a coverage of about 95% of
the total estimated value of contracts. The balance of contracts would be
subject to ex post review by IDA after contract awards.
Prolect Supervision and Implementation
3.26     The project is well advanced. For the spare parts a list of the
nvwcessary parts was prepared. For the new substations (Alalay and Urbana
Sur) ENDE has already completed the design, equipment specifications and
acquired the land. For the substations that would have their capacity
increased, the present area of the substations is adequate for the
*nlargement, MDE has design for all substations Bidding documents for
goods are available and bidding documents for works are at final stage of
preparation.

3.27     Terms of Reference for the Power Expansion Master Plan and for all
engineering services and studies are expected to be ready by June 1987 for
IDA review.
3.28     Terms of reference for consultant services to define the criteria
and prepare a methodology for future revaluations of ENDE's fixed assets,
investments and invontories are available and IDA has already reviewed them
and found them adequate. Terms of referente for man4gement consultant to
develop a Management Information System are at final stage of preparation.
3.29     ENDE's engineering staff, with the assistance of consultants would
be capable of executing the project adequately, as demonstrated by the
successful completion of other projects. The executing unit of the project
within ENDE's organization (Annex 5) would be under the General Manager and
a project manager satisfactory to IDA would be indicated by ENDE as a
condition of effectiveness ef the proposed credit. The project manager
would work within the framework of ENDE's organization with the assistance
of the procurement, construction, finances, and planning and engineering
areas to provide the required technical and project management guidance to
ensure that design, procurement and construction would be executed in a
timely and orderly manner.
3.30     A program implementation schedule is shown in Annex 11.  Project
completion is expected by June 1994. Consultanit services, procurement,
manufacturing, installation and construction of the works included in the
'roject are expected to be carried out between August 1987 and June 1994.
Disbursements
3.31     The proceeds of the IDA Credit are expected to be disbursed over
seven years (Annex 12). The disbursement schedule reflects IDA standard
disbursement profiles which are based on IDA's experience in similar
projects. Proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be used to finance.
(i)  100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures (ex-
factory cost) for goods
(ii)  100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for
construction works
(iii)  1002 of foreign expenditures for consultant services
3.32     Disbursements requests would be fully documented except for goods
and services whose value is less than US$100,000 equivalent. Claims for
expenditures of these lesser amounts would be subject to presentation of a
statement of expenditures for which the supporting documentation would not
be sent to IDA but would be retained by ENDE for periodic inspection by
IDA. A special account would be established in the Central Bank of Bolivi
with a deposit of US$500,000. Periodic replenishment would be made to this
special account against withdrawal applications received from ENDE and
supported by such documents as the IDA would require. The Central Ba&k of
Bolivia would be required to have annual audits for this special account
and withdrawals based on statements of expenditures. Retroactive financing
for up to US$200,000 is proposed for payment of most urgent spare parts

that ENDS is needing to purchase and are expected to be bought by June
1987. The closing date would be December 31, 1994, six months after
estimated completion of the project.
Financial Prospects
3.33     ENDE's future financial trend will be influenced mostly by the
gzowth of sales and the change in its sales mix which is forecast to
increase the weight of sales to distribution companies (with lower rates)
at the expense of sales to mines and industry (para. 2.15 and 2.16). To
compensate for the decline in average revenues and to satisfactorily
improve net internal cash generation in line with ENDE's financial
requirements, the Government enacted an increase of 1.5% per month of
ENDS's rates to distribution companies (para. 2018). As a result, ENDE'S
average rate would increase from US-Cents 3.6/kWh in 1986 to US-Cents
5.0/kWh in 1990. With these increases, ENDE9s rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation would improve from 1.2% in 1987 to 9.0% in 1991. It
has been assumed that after 1990 ENDE would be responsible for generation
and transmission for the cities of La Paz and Oruro. To comply with ENDE's
financial commitments from the past and to assure a sufficiesnt self-
financing of future expansion programs, it was agreed during negotiations
that ENDE's average rate would be maintained et a level sufficient to earn
a rate of remuneration on the rate base as defined in the Electricity Code
of not less than 2% in 1988, 42 in 1989, 72 in 1990, and 92 thereafter (in
accordance with the Electricity Code). It was also agreed that before
September 1 each year, ENDE will fu:nish to the Association a preliminary
estimate of its rate of return for the current fiscal year and a forecast
for the next five fiscal years. It was agreed further that, if the
estimates indicate that ENDE would not meet the rate of return
requirements, it will promptly take all necessury measures to meet such
requirements. It was also agreed that the Government via DINE would
authorize any tariff increases required to meet the agreed rate of return.
3.34     ENDE's overdue debt is being dealt with in three different ways,
depending on the origin (see attachment 3 to annex 7). In Section 3.10 of
the Credit Agreement for the RIC, the Bolivian Government agreed to convert
the debt due to Bolivia's Central Bank, the Government and YPFB into
equity. Decree No. 21,527 of February 26, 1987, establishes that half of
ENDE's overdue debt to YPFB will be assumed by the Government and the total
be converted into shares to be owned by the Government and YPFB,
respectively. The remaining overdue debt to the Central Bank and the
Goverzment as of December 31, 1986, will also be converted into shares
owned by the Government. The Paris Club Agreement of June 26, 1986, has in
principle rescheduled overdue debt (principal and interest) to bilateral
donors and for Government insured Export Credits up to June 30, 1986, for
six years (amortization to start June 30, 1990), and overdue debt
(principal and interest) due between July 1, 1986 and June 30, 1987, for
five years (amortization to start June 30, 1992). Details will have to be
negotiated with each country. Prospects for reaching agreement on
Bolivia's commercial debt are encouraging. It is being assumed that ENDE
will reach agreement with its foreign creditors about overdue debt at
December 1986 dtring the course of 1987.



- 22 -
3.35     To protect ENDE's financial viability, it was agreed during
negotiations that ENDE would not incur any new debt (other than for tke
project) without the prior approval of the Association unless its future
debt service coverage ratio is 1.5 or higher snd would not pay cash
dividends to the Government or its Government-owned stockholders nor make
loans to distribution companies unless previously agreed with IDA.
3.36     Annex 13 contains ENDE's historical and projected income
statements, sources and uses of funds statements, balance sheets and key
financial indicators.
Economic Justification
3.37     As ENDE has not yet completed the least cost power expansion plan,
during appraisal the investment program of ENDE was reviewed and different
alternatives were considered and compared resulting in an optimized program
for the expansion (Annex 9) for the period of implementation of the
proposed project (1987-1994).
3.38     The proposed project is part of ENDE's investment program, and so,
a separate evaluation of its benefits would be meatAngless. Instead, the
rate of return on ENDE's overall investment program for all projects for
the period 1987-94 was computed. The rate of return on the investment was
estimated as the discount rate which equalizes the present values of the
cost and benefit streams associated with the investment program. The cost
stream includes the incremental capital investment and the associated
operational and maintenance costs of the expansion program for generation,
transmission and distribution. The net benefits were measured by the
forecast revenues from incremental sales of electricity associated with the
incremental investment program at present retail average rates. The
internal rate of return of the proposed program is 13.5% (base case)
(Annex 14).
3.39     Standard sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the
impact on the base case rate of return as a result of variations on the key
parameters. The results of these analyses weres
Rate of
Scenario                                Return (%I

6.  Benefits considering the
proposed tariff increase                      17.3
Environmental Aspects
3.40     No environmental problems are expected in the Power Sector as a
whole becausw no major expansions are under way. The project, by Itself,
is not expected to have environmental problems because it comprises only:



- 23 -
(i) spare parts for existItng generation units where presently no
negative environmental erfecXt  xist;
(Ui) extensions and conversions or upgradings of substations and
transmissions lines which shall follow established rights-of-way
and limit visual impact to a minimum; and
(ilL)  consulting services
Risks
3.41     No particular physical risks are expected as ENDE has implemented
smilar projocts in the past without major problems. The main risks would
arise from failure to implement the institutional reforms sought, from
unfavorable economic development affecting Bolivias's prospects, and from
failure to coutinue with the program of tariff increases.
Performance Indicators
3.42     Project exectution will be monitored against targets shown In the
implementation schedule (Annex 11). ENDE's operational, financial and
managerial performance would be monitored through indicators shown in
Annex 15.

THE POWER MARKET
Historic Power Market
Bolivia Power Market overall historic data for the period 1975-
1985 is show in table A.3.1. The analysis of this data shows that during
this decade Bolivia had the following growth rates of electricity
consumption:
1976   1977  1978  1979  1980  1981    1982    1983   1984  1985
Annual     9.3   11.1   7.6   6.1   9.2   7.4   (-1.1)  (-0,6)   1.7   0.6
rate (%)
The total consumption grew at very high rates up to 1981 when it
reached 1503.4 GWh and from there on has been stagnated reaching 1512.6 GWh
in 1985, This was mainly due to the economic recession that occurred in
Bolivia which has reflected in the electricity consumption as can be shown
by the following table:
Electricity Consumption growth rate (Z)
1975-1981           1981-1985           1975-1985
Mining               3.7                 -3.2                 0.9
Industry            14.1                -4.2                  6.4
Residential         10.0                 6.3                  8.5
Commerce             7.8                 2.0                  5.4
Pub. Lighting       15.3                 0.9                  9.3
Others              18.6                 13.9                16.7
Total              8.5                 0.2                  5.1
As ean be observed in the above table in the period 1981-85 the
growth of consumption in the residential and commercial sectors compensated
the decrease of consumption of mining and industrial sectors.
Future Power Market
At present, economic prospects are still uncertain and, therefore,
growth of electricity demand cannot be forecasted with confidence. The
present Bolivian Government is pursuing an economic policy aimed at
stabilizing the economy, to rehabilitate it, and to put it back on a growth
path. Accordingly with this strategy, the Government succeeded in 1986
with the stabilization of inflation and of the exchange rate to american
dollar.

Annex 3
Page 2 of 6
The future electricity consumption forecast prepared by ENDE
considers the available data for 1986 (the last month of the year was
estimated).
These projections, shown in table A.3.1 were prepared considering
the following:
(a) Mining - Consumption by the mining sector considers the closing of
various mines (mainly COMIBOL mines) in 1986 as well as the
decrease of production in 1987 and 1988 due to the fall of tin
prices in the international market. However, some gold mines
are becoming attractive and other minerals having its
exploration initiated which shall increase the future power
consumption. With these considerations the growth rates used
were: -10.72 for 1986-1988 and 4.81 for 1988-1995, which
results in an average rate of -0.1% for the period 1986-1995.
(b) Industry - Industrial consumption is expected to start growing slightly
in 12-18 months as the rehabilitation of the economy is
expected. In accordance with that, it was supposed that
industrial consumption would decrease in 1986 and 1987
initiating its recuperation in 1988. The growth rates used
weres -2.7% for 1986-1988, and 5.02 for 1988-1995, which
results in an average rate of 2.6Z for the period 1986-1995.
(c) Residential and Commerce - The historic data shows that in the past ten
years residential and commercial consumption continued to grow
with high rates despite the reduction of economic activity.
This can be explained by the low coverage of the electric
system. More recently the residential consumption has grown
ct very high rates (especially in the Santa Crus area where
1986 is expected to grow 11.9% over 1985). This is explained
by the migration to that area of mine workers that have
changed of activity. Accordingly, residential med commercial
consumption were assumed to grow during the period at an
average rate of 9.2% for residential and 7.8% for commerce.
Power Narket by System
The Bolivian power system is not totally interconnected and so the
total power consumption was divided by system considering the local
conditions, historic data and economic prospects. Table A.3.2 show the
market forecast for the period 1986-1995 for each system. For the power
balances load forecast are at generation level, that is losses included.
In 1985 the losses were 11.6% of gross generation. As this loss level is
acceptable losses were supposed to continue at that level in the future.
Table A.3.3 shows the corresponding generation requirements for the load
forecast (losses included) and Table A.3.4 shows the forecasted peak demand
for each system.

Tariff Princigles according to the
Bolivian Electritity Code
Tariffs are to be fixed in such a way as to permit a 92 rate of
return on the tariff base after covering all recurrent costs out of
ordinary income (article 122). The terms used in this basic statemont are
defined below.
1.       Tariff Bale
The tariff base is composed of average gross fixed assets in
operation less depreciation and amortization, plus up to 52 of intangibles,
plus one eighth of sales revenues, plus up to 32 of net fixed assets in
operation as equivalent for other parts of current assets (article 119).
DINE will decide from what moment on installations are considered in
operation. Included in the definition of gross fixed assets are civil
works, machinery and equipment, studies, interest during construction on
loans and credits according to their interost rate and on own funds at 62.
Intangibles include studies, rights, other service cost corresponding to
the establishment of the service or its reorganization up to a maximum of
52. Other current assets include fuel, lubricants, spare parts, other
materials required for operation, both in stock and ordered.
2.       Recurrent Cost
Recurrent costs include cost of operation, maintenance and
administration, taxes and duties (however, ENDE is not liable to income
tax), depreciation and amortization. Excluded are payment of interest and
principal for loans and credits, penalties for violation of national laws,
cost not related to power service, other unnecessary recurrent costs
according to DINE's opinion (articles 120 and 121).
3.       Ordinary Income
Included under ordinary income are sales revenues, fixed charges
for minimum consumption, other income for the use of the power
installations (article 123).

distribution of the paid-in capital among the shareholders was as follows

Organization
2.       MDE changed its organizational structure at the beginning of
1987. While the distribution unit which had been created for the execution
of rural electrification projects which were completed in 1981, was
dissolved, the tasks of personnal management and services were separated
from the financial operations. Besides, there are three more operational
units (Planning, Technical, Operations) and four staff units (General
Secretary, Systems, Advisory, Coordination La Paz).
TraininA
3.       ENDE has a specialized unit for training and industrial safety
operating within the Industrial Relations Department staffed by three
engineers. ENDE trains its personnel in three different ways: (i) abroad

Annex 6
Page 2 of 2
through on tho job training in other utilities or specific courses and
seminars; ($i) in-house training for ad-hoc teams which work with
consultants both in technical and management areas; (Wi) routine in-house
training for the operation, maintenance and administration staff. 48 of
ENDE'S 130 professionals (mainly engineers and economists) were trained
abroad in the last three years. 67 of ENDE'S 250 technicians (middle
level) were trained during 1986 in local institutions. For the next years
ENDE has already made arrangements for training at ENEL (Italy), ENDESA
(Spain), BITS (Sweden), Universite Flamende (Belgium). In addition, ENDE
normally obtains scholarships for courses at Fundacion Bariloche
(Argentina), Instituto Tocuato di Tella (Italy), Funda!ao Get'ulio Vargas
(Brazil), and Jica (Japan).

Supplementary Financial Information About ENDE
Operatint Results
1.       At year end 1986, the effective generation capacity in ENDE's
system reached 264.2 MW of which 161.8 MW in the interconnected system.
ENDE's energy requirements grew in 1986 only by il to 845 GWh and sales by
0.2% to 812.2 GWh (losses of 3.9%). This sluggish growth was caused mainly
by the recession in the economy.
Account_M
2.       ENDE has a satisfactory although somewhat old-fashioned accrual
accourting system based on the norms recommended by the Federal Power
Commission of the USA. Monthly financial and budgetary statements are
available without undue delay. ENDE does not operate a mainframe computer.
However, it recently acquired some WANG-equipment for the accounting
department and a few micro-computers for which a very limited number of
programs have been developed.
ENDE with the assistance of ENDESA, a major Spanish Power Company,
is presently studying the ex4sting Management Information System in order
to determine the terms of reference for the study on the improvements
required. Terms of reference are expected to be ready by the end of May
1987.
Asset Revaluation
3.       Since 1967, ENDE, with the approval of DINE, revalues its assets
and accumulated depreciation every year bys (a) assuming that all fixed
assets in operation and depreciation are composed of 70S in foreign
exchange and 302 in local component; (b) using the price index for
construction published by the US Bureau of Reclamation for the revaluation
of the foreign component of its fixed assets in operation, adjusted for
movements in the exchange rate; (c) applying the consumer price index for
the city of La Paz, prepared by the National Statistics Institute, to
revalue the local component of the fixed assets in operation. These
procedures are deficient in various ways. They refer only to fixed assets
in operation, but should also be applied to works in progress, inventories
and investment in distribution companies. The uniform ratio of 70/30
between the foreign and local component is arbitrary. Furthermore, the
indices used have very little relationship with the development of the
costs of ENDE's installations.  ENDE and the Association therefore agreed



- 42 -
Annex 7
Page 2 of 2
to include in the project a study to revalue the existing assets and to
develop a methodology which can be applied by ENDE in the future. The
terms of reference have already been agreed with the Association.
Financial Relations with the Distribution Companies
4.       ENDE's participation in the distribution companies varies within a
wide range, from 67Z in ELFEC to no participation at all in the
cooperatives (CRE and COSERELEC). ENDE also extends loans to these
companies. Except where it has a clear majority, it does not try to use
its rights as co-owner to influence the policy of the companies.
Furthermore, equity participation often has its origin in loans - sometimes
given to cover operating costs - which are later converted into equity,
when not being repaid. ENDE informed the Association that it will endeavor
to convince the distribution companies to distribute the revaluation among
the shareholders so that their value will reflect the increase in the value
of "ssets. ENDE should also abstain from lending to the distribution
companies and revalue its loans periodically. Attachment 1 gives an
ove view of some important data of the distribution companies.
Accounts Receivable
5.       ENDE' accounts receivable position which gave some reason for
concern in the past (up to 128 days equivalent of sales at the end of 1985)
improved in 1986 to 76 days which seems reasonable. The change was brought
about mainly by a more stringent application of ENDE's policies and a new
way COMIBOL encountered to pay its bills. Attachment 2 contains a
breakdown of this account by groups of clients and aging.
Overdue Debt
6.       Attachment 3 lists ENDE's overdue debt as per December 31, 1986.

The Power Balance
Peak Balance Without Generation Cavacity Additions
Table A.8.1 shows the peak balance based on the existing effective
capacity (Annex 2) and the peak load forecasted (Annex 3) for the
Interconnected system for the period 1986-1995, without any addition of
generation capacity.  Table A.8.1 considers Santa Crus included in the
interconnected system in 1990 and shows separately the peak balance for
Santa Cruz before 1990 as an isolated system.
The peak balance shows that the interconnected system will need
additional peaking capacity only after 1989. Santa Crux however will have
deficits of peaking capacity in the near future. To eliminate these
deficits ENDS is processing the acquisition of 20 MW gas turbines (to be
fimnaeed by German bilateral assistances a first one to be in operation in
1987 and a second one to be in operation in 1988).
The power balance with the acquisition of these two gas turbines
for Santa Cruz would be modified as follows:

Enety Balance without Generation Capacity Additions
The energy balance of the interconnected system and of Santa Cms
area based on the existing generation capacity and the forecasted energy
deand Is shown in Table A.8.2. The observation of Table A.8.2 shows that
with the intallation of the two gas turbines for peaking purposes (in 1987
S~~~~~~~~~~~~~    !

and 1988) additional generation for energy base supply will be required by
1993. In other words, up to 1993 the additions In generating capacity will
be governed by peaking requirements.
Additional Geeration Required
To properly supply the load, different alternatives were compared
during appraisal. The basic components weres
(a) for peaking supply:
(i)   gas turbines (20 mw units, 19 mw effective) with unit
prices of 371 US$/kw (based on actual offers by
manufacturers).
(ii)   Diesel electric units - of unit prices of 650 US$/kW
(based on market prices)
(b) for energy (base) supplys
(i)   combined cycle thermo power plant - with prefeasibility
study already done for installation in Santa Cruz with
unit cost of 1,400 US$/kw (based on prefeasibility costs
up-to-dated in a simplified manner);
(ii)   Hydropower plants remodelations and expansion of the
existing facilities in the Zongo River and Miguillas River
(based on feasibility study prepared by BPC and up-to-
dated in a simplified manner) considered to cost 1,000
US$/kw. These additions would increase the generating
capacity by 61 MW and 300 GWh the generating capacity.
As a result, a least cost program was prepared that would consist
of:
