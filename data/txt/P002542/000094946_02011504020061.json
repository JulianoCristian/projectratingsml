Most of the lessons highlighted by\n            the implementation of the project, are about project design,\n            seemingly the weakest aspect of the project. The erroneous\n            assumption that economic difficulties in the country were\n            temporary, limited the project; instead, the development of\n            a long-term multi-sector support approach, in coordination\n            with other donors, could have further improved success. And,\n            while the project scope should be comprehensive enough to\n            achieve expected impacts, the seeming success of the health\n            component, integrated to the malaria control program,\n            hampered the impact of the education component, which only\n            included select aspects, not addressing the severe\n            limitations of the quality of primary education. However,\n            while a multi-sector approach to project lending, is\n            efficient in a small country, ambitious project objectives\n            may hinder success; rather, attention should have been\n            focused on few priorities per sector. Moreover, to attain\n            significant, and sustainable impacts from the malaria\n            control program, it should have been complemented by\n            strengthening the broader health system to mainstream\n            interventions, for the incidence of malaria is still high.\n            Finally, construction works, namely the drainage works,\n            prove the need for a strategic framework plan, to include a\n            wetland master plan, an environmental assessment, and the\n            involvement of the community."}, "docdt": "2001-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
