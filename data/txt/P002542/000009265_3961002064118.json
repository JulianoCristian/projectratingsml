   Sao Tome and Principe in reversing the recent declines in\n            the health and educational status of the population. In the\n            health sector, the project supports a comprehensive program\n            to control malaria, the provision of essential drugs, and\n            the strengthening of health planning. In the education\n            sector, the project comprises the purchase of school\n            textbooks and educational materials, the strengthening of\n            school inspection at the primary school level, and the\n            improvement in education planning. In both sectors, the main\n            institutional reform goals are to improve efficiency in\n            service delivery and utilization of existing resources as\n            well as mobilization of additional resources. These goals\n            are to be achieved through the improvements in planning,\n            management information, external assistance coordination as\n            well as through the cost recovery program from the\n            distribution of essential drugs and school textbooks. The\n            project includes a limited number of studies in very high\n            priority areas, such as nutrition, family planning and\n            community involvement. The studies are aimed at improving\n            the understanding of the issues and constraints, and\n            recommending suitable interventions."}, "docdt": "1992-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
