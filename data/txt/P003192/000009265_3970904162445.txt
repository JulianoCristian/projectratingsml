FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SIAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.  CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                     Republic of Zambia
Amount:                       Development Credit of SDR 20.5 million
(US$20.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                       Standard
On-Lending Terms:             The credit will be on lent to Zambia Railways for
20 years including five years of grace at 12% per
annum. Zambia Railways will bear the foreign
exchange risk.
Project Description:          The proposed project is a continuation of the
Third Railway Project which will be completed in
June 1986. The project's orientation is firmly
towards improved utilization of existing assets.
The exceptions are the purchase of a small number
of new wagons, to make up a deficit which cannot
be filled by rehabilitation of the existing fleet,
and the substitution of radio communications for
"open-wire", which is essentially a changeover to
improve technology. The project also contains
studies leading to long-term improvements in the
efficiency of the railway services, continued
support of ZR training program and technical
assistance in specific areas critical to the
rai!way's operations, and for project implementa-
tion.
The project will enable the transport sector to
fulfill its function of transporting domestic and
external traffic at minimum cost, by enabling the
railway to maintain and slightly expand its
capacity and, thus, avoid the need of the
productive sectors to have recourse to trucks for
the movement of bulk commodities.



- 2 -
The physical and economic risks of the project are
minimal. The project concentrates on the highest
priority items, and the most cost-effective means
of maintaining, not expanding, the railways
capacity to handle traffic on offer. There is
little likelihood that traffic will not, on
average, reach forecast levels. Equally,
productivity improvements have been forecast at a
modest level. Institutional and financial
improvements could be slower than expected.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic and Geographic Background
2.01      Zambia is a land-locked country in the southern half of Africa,
depending for its international surface routes on its neighbors--Tanzania,
Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola and Zaire. With an area of
750,000 km2, the country consists of a high plateau ranging in elevation from
1,000 m to 1,500 m, intersected by the valleys of the Zambezi River and its
tributaries. It has a population of six million (1982) and a population
density of only eight per km2. GNP per capita was US$640.0 in 1982 (World
Bank Atlas).
2.02      The dominant feature of the Zambian economy is the mineral wealth in
the northern (copperbelt) region, with its reserves of copper ore. The mining
of copper ore and its processing into copper, with colbalt as a bi-product,
constitute the country's most important economic activity. Both the copper
and cobalt produced are almost entirely exported. The mineral industry
accounted for about 20 percent of GNP and, with refining for over 90 percent
of export earnings in 1982. Zambia Railways is the prime mover of domestic
traffic in volume terms. It handles up to 3.3 million tonnes per year, mainly
minerals and agricultural products and inputs. Trucks handle up to two
million tonnes per year, including most of the higher value general goods
traffic.
2.03      Since exports and imports each constitute around 35 percent of GDP,
the country is highly dependent on its transport network and its access to
seaports through neighboring countries. To maintain current levels of
economic activity, about 1.4 million tonnes of goods (excluding petroleum and
petroleum products) must move in and out of the country each year. As a
natural corollary, considerable emphasis is placed on external trade routes in
transport investments. The evacuation routes options and the costs and
benefits associated with them have been subject to several studies. The most
recent was undertaken by UNCTAD/UNDP1/ which, in turn, drew on an earlier
"coastal links" study by Consultants7, Coopers & Lybrand (UK). The thrust of
these studies has been that Zambia should concentrate on efficiently utilizing
the existing access routes rather than attempting to develop new routes. This
is also shared by the Southern Africa Development Coordination Committee
(SADCC).
2.04      In recent years, the price of copper has failed to keep pace with
the price of imports and, consequently, there has been a severe shortage of
1/ Operational assistance in the Dar-es-Salaam Transit Corridor "UNCTAD/UNDP
Project, RAF/77/017, Sattelite "All, 1981.

foreign exchange. Recent Bank projections show copper prices increasing from
US$1,589 per tonne in 1983 to US$2,602 per tonme by 1990, but the recovery is
not yet in evidence. Unless a recovery of this order of magnitude does occur,
the balance of payments and, through it, the level of economic activity in the
country will improve only slowly. This background determines the focus of the
proposed project.
B. The Transport System
2.05      The transport system within Zambia comprises approximately 35,000 km
of roads, 2,000 km of railways, 150 airports, and a 1,700-km oil pipeline from
Dar-es-Salaam to Ndola in the copper-producing areas.  The bulk of external
traffic is carried by rail. In 1982, 79 percent of imports and 69 percent of
exports were carried by rail, with the TAZARA system carrying most exports,
and the southern route (Zimbabwe, Republic of South Africa--RSA) the bulk of
imports. Internally, rail primarily carries bulk traffic--coal, minerals and
agricultural inputs and products--while road transport handles most inter-
mediate and consumer goods. This pattern is quite natural as the main
consuming centers are within the 375 km from Lusaka to Nkana/Kitwe which are
connected by an essentially straight flat road, as well as by rail. The
transport sub-sectors excluding Zambia Railways, are described in Annex 1.
(i) Railways
2.06      Zambia has two railways operated by two different entities.  Zambia
Railways (ZR) extends from Victoria Falls Bridge on the Zimbabwe border to the
copperbelt area in the north where it links up, via Zaire, with the Benguela
Railway to the Angolan Port of Lobito. ihe Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA)
links up with ZR at Kapiri Mposhi and extends to the port of Dar-es-Salaam in
Tanzania.
(ii) Zambia Railways
2.n7      ZR is part of what was known as the Unitary System which served the
then Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. ZR extends from the junction with
Zimbabwe Railways at Victoria Falls to Lusaka (474 km), Kapiri Mposhi
(junction with IAZARA, 658 km) and then to the copperbelt CNdola, 782 km,
through Chingola, 916 km) with a total track length of 1,273 km. Most of the
traffic is within the copperbelt and south to Lusaka. Traffic volumes have
varied in recent years from 5.1 to 4.5 million tonnes, of which domestic
traffic has accounted for about 60 percent. ZR employs about 8,000 people,
and its rolling stock presently comprises 6B mainline locomotives and 12
shunters, and 6,300 wagons of which the 2,800 formerly in the Unitary System
are more than 30 years old and in poor condition. ZR also owns 83 passenger
coaches of which only 50 are in service. The total fleet, when brought up to
a reasonable standard of service by the proposed project, should be adequate
to carry freight and passenger traffic expected in the medium term (to about
1990).

C. Foreign Trade Routes
2.08      The relative importance of Zambia's trade routes has varied over the
years due to political factors. In particular, the closure of the Zimbabwe
route after (Rhodesia's) Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, the
closure of the Benguela route to Lobito as a result of political unrest in
Angola, the construction of TAZARA, and the reopening of the Zimbabwe route in
1979, have been major factors. The main effects are indicated in the
following lable, and the past, present and future routes analyzed in more
detail in Annex 2.

1/ Based on eight months traffic.
2.09      The Dar-es-Salaam route is clearly cheaper for the export of copper
than the southern route. A 1981 UNCTAD study showed rail/port costs via Dar-
es-Salaam as Kwacha 149 per tonne, about Kwacha 58 less than via East Londorn.
The ratios are unlikely to have changed significantly since. For imports, the
Dar route is also theoretically cheaper. However, (i) despite improvements in
recent years, there is a greater chance of delay over the Dar-es-Salaam than
the East London route; (ii) there is an incressing volume of import traffic
originating in Zimbabwe (and indirectly in RSA), these sources being
increasingly preferred to the more expensive, though perhaps higher quality,
products of Europe and North America, in view of Zambia's foreign exchange
shortage. This situation may well persist for many years. Ihe existing
balance between the two main routes is likely to continue.  Equally important-
ly, there is rio need in terms of actual and potential capacity availability,
for Zambia to actively encourage the development of new routes, such as the
proposed Trans-Kalahari through Namibia.
D. Transport Policy and Planning
2.10      Government of Zambia (GOZ) does not have a clearly defined policy
for the transport sector. It is concerned to avoid reliance on one or two
evacuation routes and, thus, encourages the development of alternatives to the
dominant Tanzanian and Zimbabwean corridors without, however, making any firm



commitments to such alternatives. This pragmatic approach is understandable
in view of recent experience; however, it does lead to a lack of direction and
consequent loss of efficiency.
2.11      Similarly, capital expenditure on internal transport, particularly
on highways, has been dominated by strategic considerations. This has
resulted in all roads linking provincial capitals being designed to paved-
standard even where the volume of present and prospective traffic does not
justify such investment economically. Partly as a result of this, capital
expenditure on highway investment was very high until 1982, both absolutely
and relative to that on maintenance with, however, a reduction in capital
expenditure in 19B3 arid prospectively 1984, with increased maintenance
allocation.
2.12      lhe lack of an economically based ternsport policy is reflected in
imprecision regardirnq responsibility for transport planning. Ministry of
Power, Transport and Communications (MPTC) has nominal responsibility, but has
limited staff resources -- presently, one economist (serviniq the three
Departments; Power, Iransport and Communications) arid a transport adviser
technical assistant, financed by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).
Perhaps more importantly, MPlC's theoretical powers seem significantly greater
than its actual: the main transport parastatals come urder the Zambia
Industrial and Miting Corporation IZIMCO) "umbre]la", and ZIMC0 exerts
what little pressure there is on them to operate efficiently while critical
hiqhway investment decisions are made at a high level in the Government
machinery with the technical advice provided by staff of Ministry of Works and
Supply (MWS), which acts as executing agency, often disregarded.
2.13      Until very recent'y, the National Commissior for Developmetit
Planning (NCDP) appeared tc, offer some scope for a coordiniated approach to
transport investmenit and operation.  It was and is the seat of a Transport
Coordination Committee (I':C) which has representatiotn of Coritirngency Plarning
Unit (CPU), MPTC, NCDP, '4WS the national transport companies and ad hoc
representation of Ministry of Agriculture (MA) and other Ministries involved
with transport. However, the lCC has rarely met arid, cotisequeritly, has little
influence.
2.14      With a view to improvirg transport plannirqir. GOZ has decided, as an
initial step, to strengthen the existing planiilrig unit in MPIC.  lo ensure
that this strenrgtherninq would take place In a timely fash;.an, it was aqreed
durinq neqotiations that terms of reference for the revitalized planning unit,
including estimated traininq, technical assistarce and, consequently,
budgetarv requirements would be agreed prior to, arid would be a cordition of
credit effectiveness. GOZ indicated that it would ensure that the appropriate
budgetary allocation was made to MPTC commericirig rn the 1986 financial year.
ti)   lhe Competitive Environment
2.15      ZR and the trucking companies are basicall% not in competition with
each other for freight traffic. ZR primari]N handles bulk traffic and the
trucking companies--both parastatal and private--intermediate arid finished

goods. Both handle agricultural inouts and outputs but during the short
agricultural season, capacity of both rail and truck is fully utilized. lhus,
there is only a residual amount of traffic, approximately 10 percent for which
the two modes are in competition. The determinant of ZR traffic is thus
overwhelmingly the overall level of economic activity and, in particular, of
the mining and agricultural sectors.  Details of traffic distribution are
given in Annex 2. However, the distribution of margirial traffic, essentially
intermediate goods, could be influenced by Government's policy in the fields
of taxation and regulation. Ihe existing arid prospective situations are
discussed below.
(ii) Regulation
2.16      lhere is little effective control over entry to the trucking sector
in Zambia, or atte'dt to control the distributiorn of traffic between rail and
road or between parestatal and private trucking companies. Ihis laissez-faire
approach is satisfactory to the Association.  Ihe exception to this latter is
on the Zambia-Tanzania road route, where ZIRS has a monopoly and employs sub-
contractors as necessary.  Elsewhere, the Road Iraff'ic Commissioner (RIC) has
theoretical powers of control through his responsibility for the issuance of
licenses to operate over specific routes. In practice, his staff is small
and, in a situation of overall shortage of trucking capacity, issues licenses
freely.
2.17      ZR tariffs are still subject to Goverrimerit approval through ZIMCO,
and reluctance of Government to allow timely arid appropriate increases has
contributed to ZR's declining financial performance (see Chapter IV).  iruck
tariffs, however, are generally the subject of niegotiations on a consigrnmenit
basis (again with the exception of ZIRS where rates are publLshed), with the
rate annually negotiated with National Milling Board (NAMBOARD), the biggest
customer, settinq the trend.
(iii) Taxes and Duties
2.18      ZR pays taxes on diesel fuel as do truckers.  Ihe Bank Report
"Zambia: Issues arid Optionis in the Energy Sector" (ZES)2/ shows that taxes
are heavy on both diesel and gasolirie NKwacha 1.0 arid 1 7 per US gallon) arid
themselves yielded about Kwacha 60.0 million irn 1981, (includirig about Kwacha
3.0 million on railway diesel consumption). Additioriall), road vehicle import
duties and license fees vield about Kwacha 11.0 mill.on per year. Thus, the
annual expenditure on highway maintenance currently about Kwacha 20.0 million
annually is amply covered by road user taxes. lhe ZES coricluded that the fuel
tax system was highly distorted arid recommernded that the relative prices
(after tax) be brought into line with relative world (Bahrain) prices.
Assuming this was done, arid total tax yield maintained, diesel prices would
decline by about Kwacha 0.40/gallon (15 percent;.  This would reduce road user
tax yield by about Kwacha 9.0 million to a fully adequate Kwacha 59.0 milliaori.
2.19      Iwo additional means of generatirng revenue from road users have been
proposed by Government. A tax of Kwacha 100.0 is being imposed on foreign
trucks on each entry to Zambia.  The ostensible reason for this is to
compensate for the more rigid enforcements of starndards (axle loading, etc.;
on vehicles operating in neighboring countries, niotably Zimbabwe, compared
2/ Zambia Issues and Options in the Energ> Sector, January 1983,
Table 5.1 (ZES).

with Zambia. More important may be a desire to obtain compensation for the
large proportion of Zambian external traffic, on the southern route, carried
by non-Zamnbian trucks. CH is estimated to carry about 15 percent and private
truckers probably significantly less. This imbalance largely reflects the
fact that virtually all southern route road traffic is import. Assuming 75
percent is carried by foreign trucks, the annual yield of the tax can be
expected to be about Kwacha 150,000 per annum, and represent under one Ngwee
per tkm. The imposition of the tax (or its removal) would have little effect
either on the yield from road user charges or the relative cost 3f road to
rail transport.
2.20      The second proposal was for the taxation of internal vehicle
movement by the erection of toll gates at 17 points on the main road system,
mainly along the line of rail. The proposed maximum charge was to be Kwacha
3.0, cumulative, and theoretically, a truck travelling from e.g. Lusaka to
Ndola would pay Kwacha 9.0. The cost would have been about Ngwee 0.1/tkm with
imperceptible effect on transport costs. The potential yield is impossible to
predict with acceptable precision in the absence of detailed origin/destina-
tion studies. However, on the evidence so far available, the proposal makes
little economic sense in view of the potential costs of traffic disruption.
The measure has already encountered strong opposition within Zambia and has
effectively been abandoned.
2.21      The conclusion from the above analysis is that neither Government
revenue nor overall truck transport costs will be signficantly affected by the
proposed toll system, and that any reduction in diesel fuel tax is likely to
marginally reduce the relative cost advantage of rail over truck, but unlikely
to be significant in affecting the demand for rail (or road) freight services.
E. Past Bank Group Projects in the Sector
2.22      The Bank Group has exten'-:d assistance to Zambia for six projects in
the transport sector: three for railways (Loan 74-ZA for US$14.0 million in
1953, Loan 197-ZA for US$9.5 million in 1958, and Loan 1790-ZA/Credit 973-ZA
for US$40.0 million in 1980); and three for highways (Loan 469-ZA for US$17.5
million in 1966, Loan 563-ZA for US$10.7 million in 1968, and Loan 798-ZA/
Credit 1566-ZA for US$22.5 million in 1978). The last railway and highway
projects are on-going.
2.23      An Audit Report (292-ZA) was produced in 1973 on the First and
Second Highway Projects. Although it concluded that the costs were largely in
line with or below appraisal estimates and the expected economic rates of
return materialized, the report noted, inter alia, that development of highway
maintenance capability under the project was not up to expectations. The
increasing concern with maintenance compared with new investment has been
reflected in subsequent projects, not only the Third Highway but also the
Third and proposed Fourth Railway Projects. The on-going Third Highway
Project is almost exclusively concerned with improving maintenance capability,
while the Third Railway and, to an even greater extent, the proposed Fourth
Railway project, shifts the emphasis from provision of new equipment and track
to rehabilitation of existing assets, technical assistance and training.



_ 10 -
2.24      The First Highway Project financed engineering, reconstruction and
paving of the Great East and Great North roads (600 km total) and associated
consultancy services, and was satisfactorily completed in 1969. The Second
Highway Project financed some further reconstruction on the Great North road,
weigh-bridges and consultant services. The physical objectives were attained,
but institutional improvements, particularly related to highway maintenance,
were much slower to materialize. This problem extended into the Third Highway
Project, which concentrated upon the provision of equipment and services
necessary to improve maintenance standard and capability. The failure of
Government to adhere to the level of local funding of maintenance agreed at
appraisal led first to delayed effectiveness of the project, and then to very
slow implementation. The probJem was finally addressed by a substantial
increase in budgetting provisions in 1983 and 1984, and procurement of
equipment and spare parts is now proceeding satisfactorily. The Loan/Credit
has now been extended to June 30, 1985, to enable project objectives to be
substantially met.
2.25      The First and Second Railway Projects executed in the 1950's
concentrated on provision of workshop equipment, track improvements and
rolling stock, and were satisfactorily executed on time. The Third Railway
Project continued assistance in the above-mentioned areas but, additionally,
concentrated on improved communications and upgrading of skills through
training and technical assistance. Effectiveness of the project was delayed
due to lack of IDA funds, but implementation is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Operational objectives are expected to be generally met by
closing date, extended to September 30, 1985, but the economic recession in
Zambia has affected ZR financial situation and the rate of return objective
will not be met.  The major lesson to be learned from this is not to set
unrealistic financial targets for railway projects which are vulnerable to the
effects of economic recession particularly in an economy prone to pronounced
cyclical influences.
2.26      Institution building has been more successful in railway projects,
particularly the Third, than in highways. This appears to be 'ue to the
comparatively large scale of ZR management, which has provideG a technically
well educated cadre of counterparts to the substantial technical assistance
provision, and to fairly well developed training programs. Highways have not
had the same counterpart base and, as a result, technical assistance has
largely had to perform in-line functions.
2.27      The ongoing Third Railway Project has provided the analytical
capability to determine investment priorities, and the basic infrastructure
requirements for ZR to become a reasonably efficient railway. The proposed
Fourth project complements this and builds upon it by pluviding the mears of
improving the availability of rolling stock, further improving communications,
and enabling continued technical assistance in key areas, and training.

III. ZAMBIA RAILWAYS AND PROPOSED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Zambia Railways
ti)    General
3.01      Zambia Railways is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Zambia
Industrial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO) and is headed by a managing director
(Para 3.04). The operations are divided into three regions, and each regional
manager reports to the managing director.
3.02      The total staff numbers about 8,000, of whom 22 are expatriates
holding specialized technical positions, a reduction from 50 as a result of
the training undertaken under the Third Railway Project. Training has a high
priority in ZR with a training center responsible for all internal and
external training.
(ii)   Organization, Management and Staff
3.03      During the period 1964 to 1967, the railway system in Zambia was
operated by the "Unitary S'stem" which was owned jointly and equally by Zambia
and Rhodesia. ZR was incorporated by the Zambia Railways Act, 1967 which
became effective July 1, 1967, to replace the Unitary System in Zambia. In
return for certain assets transferred to ZR, the Government received an equity
of Kwacha 35.0 million in permanent capital and Kwacha 35.0 million in
redeemable capital. In December 1978, the Government announced that effective
January 1, 1979, ownership of ZR would be transferred to ZIMCO, a Government
holding company. While in practice ZIMCO has acted as the holding company,
the necessary legal formalities were not completed until December 19, 1983,
when ZR was incorporated as a private company under the Companies Act.
Operations under ZIMCO bucame effective in April 1984. This will result in
more autonomy for ZR including a decrease in the time required for tariff
adjustments. During the period 1979 until the actual incorporation in
December 1983, ZR regularly consulted with the Bank Group on all matters
related to the incorporation. The incorporation will not affect ZR's
suitability to continue to borrow from the Association.
3.04      ZR is organized mainly along functional lines.  The managing
director is appointed by ZIMCO and reports to a board, also appointed by
ZIMCO. He is assisted by two assistant managing directors in line position,
one in charge of Operations, the other in charge of Administration. Also
reporting to the managing director are three regional managers and the heads
of the following functions: Finance, Marketing, Public Relations, Railway
Police, and Internal Auditing. Reporting to the divisional manager of
Operations Division are the chiefs of the three Engineering Departments:



- 12 -
Mechanical, Civil, and Signalling and Telecommunications; the chief of
Transportation and the chief of Safety. Reporting to the divisional manager
of Administration Division are the managers of Corporate Planning, Data
Processing, Supplies, and Personnel, and the Legal Counsel. The Training
Section reports to the Personnel Manager.
3.05      Most of the 22 expatriates with ZR hold specialized technical
positions; however, two head Technical Departments. During the Third Railway
Project, the number of expatriates was reduced, and will be eliminated within
the next five years, as a result of the training included in the projects.
However, for implementation of the proposed project and for studies, an
additional 13 expatriates will be employed.
3.06      ZR staff are generally well qualified.  However, some weaknesses
exist which will be addressed by provision of technical assistance and
training. Areas of concern are the corporate planning and the related
information system required for follow-up of the operational performance.
Manpower Development and Training
3.07      Manpower development and related training is considered a high
priority within ZR. Recently, a manpower study was carried out with the
purpose of identifying ZR's manpower and related training needs, and ZR is now
in the process of establishing a manpower development function within the
Personnel Department to continuously monitor its manpower requirements. This
new function will work closely with the ZR training center to implement
training courses as required.
3.08      The training center is responsible for all training programs
including external courses in Zambia and overseas. At present, training
programs offered in the center comprise training of artisans, technicians,
operational staff, supervisors and managers. Facilities in the training
center are adequate except for the workshop which needs rehabilitation and new
equipment. The center employs about 50 instructors and can be considered to
be overstaffed. Training programs and courses need to be reviewed and revised
in most cases, and links between on-the-job and off-the-job training require
considerable strengthening.
Track
3.09      ZR operates a total of 1,273 km of 3'6" (1,067 mm) single track, of
which 84B km (Nkana-Kitwe to Victoria Falls Bridge) are main line and the
remaining 425 km are branch lines. It is organized into three operating
districts as follows:
a) Northern District (Kishitu and north): 358 km divided into
seven sub-divisions, with headquarters in Ndola;
b) Central District (Kafue - Kishitu): 261 km divided into two
sub-divisions, with headquarters in Kabwe; and



- 13 -
c) Southern District (Kafue and south): 654 km divided into four
sub-divisions, with headquarters at Livingstone.
3.10      The standard weight of rail for ZR main-line operation is 91 lb/yd
and 90 lb/yd. ZR is progressively replacing the lighter 80 lblyd rails on the
main-line, and 678 km will have already received the heavier ra.l at
completion of the Third Railway Project. The branch lines have 80 lb/yd and
60 lb/yd rail in varying conditions.
3.11      Except for 47 km of track north of Choma, where there are steel
sleepers, and on the sections relayed under the Third Railway Project which
have concrete sleepers, the main-line has wooden sleepers whose corndition
varies from fair to poor. Branch lines have a mixture of wooden and steel
sleepers, but steel predominates. Sleeper spacing varies from 1,340 to 1,394
sleepers per km on the main-line and from 1,293 to 1,394 sleepers per km on
branch lines. Nearly 120,000 wooden sleepers have been in service for up to
25 years. The average life of wooden sleepers in use is about 15 years. A
brief outline of sleepers installed follows:
1955 or earlier                15% of total;
1960-1965                      559 of total;
1965-1970                      20% of total; arid
1971 or later                  10% of total.
3.12      On some portions of the main-line, there are a large number of sharp
curves (radius 200 m) along with continuous steep gradient. As a result, the
rails require renewal at least once a year after transposing the inner, and
the outer rail every five to six months. There are frequent derailments on
these sections leading to serious disruption of traffic, not only during the
time of restoration but also for a considerably longer period thereafter, due
to the severe speed restrictions that have to be imposed until the track
has stabilized to permit normal speed. The number of derailments have
increased from 148 in 1979 to 270 in 1982. To reduce the number of derail-
ments, the maximum speed for freight trains has been reduced from 65 km/h to
40 km/h on the weaker sections and, in addition, there are speed restrictions
of 20 to 15 km/h on some sections. The Third Railway Project concentrated on
strengthening the track in the south to allow for future higher axle loads.
The proposed project will place emphasis on general track improvements to
avoid derailments and eliminate temporary speed restrictions.
3.13      The track maintenance is supervised by four track superintendents,
one each for the northern and central districts and two for the southern
district. Each superintendent is assisted by two permanent-way inspectors.
This arrangement is satisfactory. The staff are well trained and the
department will be fully Zambianized by the end of the project period.
Mulobezi Line
3.14      ZR operates, on behalf of GOZ, a branch line which extends from
Livingstone to the northwest via the small townships of Makinga and Ngwezi to
Mulobezi, a distance of 163 km. The line was opened in 1930 for the specific
purpose of evacuating sleeper timber.



- 14 -
3.15      The traffic volume is low but not insignificant; about 1,000
passengers per week and equivalent of one mixed freight train of goods
traffic. The revenue generated, however, is very low (Kwacha 142,000 in 1982)
and an operating deficit of over Kwacha 700,000 per annum is incurred, which
is covered by Government of Zambia grant.
3.16      There are three main alternative possibilities in addressing the
problem. The line could be closed, which would effectively cut off about
10,000 people from all-weather communication. A road could be built along
the line of rail, or the earth road from near Sesheke reconstructed which
would be an expensive solution, or minimal railway repair work could be under-
taken.
3.17      In the course of studying these alternatives, consultants estimated
in 1981 that a minimum rehabilitation program would cost about Kwacha 2.0
million, of which about one third is in foreign exchange. Some of the
required material and the labor is probably available within ZR surplus to
requirements but other costs will probably have increased.  On balance, the
consultant estimate is probably still valid. Prior to negotiations, ZR
submitted a request to GOZ to cease operations of the line. However, GOZ
considered the proposal but in view of the social importance of the line it
has accordingly instructed ZR to continue to operate the line and undertake
the necessary capital expenditure. In return ZR will be allowed to introduce
a special Mulobezi component in its tariff increase proposals during project
implementation, while the line is expected to be rehabilitated. Thereafter,
ZR will apply the same criteria to freight and passenger tariffs for the line
as it will apply to the rest of the system. This is satisfactory to the
Association. However, GOZ shall supply to the Association a policy statement
confirming the foregoing arrangements. This is a condition of effectiveness.
Signalling and Telecommunications
3.18      The main-line between Nkana-Kitwe and Livinqstone is equipped with
Centralized Traffic Control (CTC), which was renewed under the Third Railway
Project. The branch-lines operate by electric token instruments, by manual
tokens or on a "one-train-only" system.
3.19      The telecommunications system was renewed under the Third Railway
Project and its capacity was also Lncreased.  No changes were made. however,
in the point-to-point overhead wire communications system which is servicing
both the CTC and the telecommunications system. This system is exposed to
frequent break-downs which interrupt the train operations as well as telecom-
munications. The average monthly interruptions of the CTC-system in 1982
numbered 14, and the total hours that the system was out of service were 91.
The telecommunications system had 44 interruptions monthly and the system
was out of service 325 hours. The Third Railway Project included a study on
the overhead communications system which recommended replacement of the
overhead wires by radio. This will be implemented in the proposed project.
The staff are well trained and only the department head is an expatriate, who
will be replaced by a Zambian in due course.
Locomotives and Rolling Stock
3.20      The locomotive fleet is made up of 68 main-line locomotives and 12
shunters which are also used in main-line service in combination with the



- 15 -
main-line locomotives. Ihese are all of the same make with a rating of 2,150
hp and 1,650 hp, respectively. Of these, 43 are less than 10 years old and a
further 37 less than 16 years old. Four locomotives are heavily damaged and
awaiting scrapping orders.
3.21      The average availability has, in the last five years, been rather
low (60 percent) except for 1982 when it reached 70 percent due to delivery of
10 new locomotives in 1981. The availability dropped again in 1983 to 60
percent but has recently improved to about 70 percent as a result of delivery
of spare parts, financed under the Third Railway Project. The utilization is
low, about 90,000 km per available locomotive per year, and could be improved
considerably by improved operational procedures. lhis has been studied by
consultants and will be introduced in the proposed project after actions
proposed in this project have been taken to increase the reliability of the
locomotives. With improved availability and utilization, the fleet of 76
locomotives is adequate for ZR's need during the project period.
3.22      The wagon fleet consists of 6,300 wagons of which 2,800 belong to
the Unitary System. All Unitary System wagons are more than 30 years old,
some are more than 60 years old, and all are in poor condition. ZR plans to
scrap about 1,000 of these wagons during the project period.
3.23      The ZR-owned wagons were all acquired after independence and are all
in good condition. About 1,100 wagons have been delivered in the Ihird
Railway Project. In addition, some 1,500 wagons from the South African
Railways are operating in Zambia.
3.24      The wagon availability is rather low, 82 percent, as is the utili-
zation, about 220,000 net tonne-km per available wagon per year. to improve
the availability and utilization, financing of spare parts and facilities to
control the utilization of wagons will be included in the proposed project.
The number of new wagons required will, therefore, be limited to 170 during
the project period.
3.25      For its passenger traffic, ZR has 83 passenger coaches, of which
only 50 are in service. The balance are under repair, awaiting spare parts.
All coaches were delivered from Japan and their electrical system is too
complicated for use in a developing country with a lack of qualified
technicians and a shortage of foreign exchange for procurement of the
necessary spare parts. It is, therefore, proposed to modify the electrical
system in the coaches and thereby increase the availability and reliability.
Workshops and Depots
3.26      The workshop for the overhaul and major repair of locomotives,
coaches and wagons is located at Kabwe. It was put into operation in 1971.
Depots for running maintenance of locomotives are located at Kabwe, Ndola,
Kitwe and Livingstone; only the Kabwe depot can undertake 60,000 km servicing,
the other three being limited to 30,000 km servicing. For all other services,
the locomotives have to be sent to the Kabwe workshop. Minor repair of wagons
is carried out at repair track locations in Ndola, Kabwe and Livingstone, but



- 16 -
for all other repairs, wagons must be sent to the Kabwe workshop. Passenger
coaches are serviced at Kitwe and Livingstone terminals.
3.27      The Kabwe workshop is well equipped and has adequate capacity for
present and future traffic. The shop capacity has been increased by improved
work methods implemented in the Third Railway Project, and specialized
equipment for improved locomotive maintenallce has been acquired. Some equip-
ment will be life-expired at the end of the proposed project period and some
additional equipment will be required for efficient equipment maintenance.
The capacity of the foundry for manufacturing of brake blocks also has to be
increased.
3.28      The capacity of the Kabwe running depot has been increased in the
Third Railway Project. However, some equipment will be life-expired and will
have to be replaced. Minor improvements are also required to the loco-sheds
in Ndola and Livingstone.
3.29      Improvements to repair tracks in Ndola and Kabwe will continue and
further track repair will be required at Choms and Kafue which are the end
stations for coal trains and trains to the industrial district in Kafue.
3.30      The functioning of the department responsible for the equipment and
equipment maintenance is very critical to the railway as a whole. Training is
complicated and time consuming. Work planning and quality control are
important and the project will provide for technical assistance in these
areas.
Operations
3.31      ZR facilities and equipment are adequate for the estimated traffic
provided the utilization is satisfactory. The wagon turnaround time is too
long and the on-line timc for the locomotives is too short. Delays at
terminals and at border stations contribute to the long turnaround time. The
Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) is taking action
to improve the border situation and the Bank will continue to monitor the
situation. The operations at the yards will be studied and actions will be
taken to reduce the terminal time. Actions will also be taken to reduce the
loading and unloading time of wagons.
3.32      The information on wagon handling is not sufficient for the
management to take actions to improve the wagon utilization. A study,
financed under the Ihird Railway Project, has identified the problems and
actions will be taken under the proposed project by installation of a wagon
monitoring control system.
3.33      The quality control of the maintenance of locomotives and wagons
will be improved and a maintenance planning system will be installed resulting
in increased availability and utilization of the equipment.
3.34      The Corporate Planning Branch will be strengthened, and a new
Management Information System installed.

Freight Iraffic
3.35      ZR total traffic has fluctuated between 4.5 and 5.1 million tonnes
since 1977 with, however, an increase in tonne-kilometers from an estimated
1.26 billion in 1977 to 1.56 billion in FY82 and 1.40 billion in FY83. The
increase in average haul resulted from the reopening of the southern route
through Zimbabwe in 1979 and from the increased importance of international
transit traffic in total (from 30 percent in 1977 to 35 percent in FYB2 and
FY83).
3.36      The distribution of traffic in future is urnlikely to change
significantly from that of the last two years, unless there are unpredictable
political developments which again close borders. Also, the only classes of
freight traffic likely to grow, irndependenit of a rapid recovery in economic
activity, are agricultural inputs and outputs (an expansiorn which GOZ is
placing considerable emphasis in its development plan) and coal.  The Maanba
colliery production is likely to expand significantly as a result of new
equipment and to be absorbed by the rehabilitated Kafue fertilizer plant and
later, by substitution of coal for oil in mining. With virtually static
tr., fic in other classes, aggregate traffic is forecast to increase in tonnage
by 8 to 13 percent in FY83-FY89 and a further 5 percent by FY94. Recent
volumes and forecasts are summarized below and detailed in Annex 2.

Passenger Traffic
3.37      Passenger traffic has grown at about eight percent p.a. since 1976.
Tariff increases appear to have had little effect. The main determinant
appears to be the decline in the standard of livinq which has resulted in a
relative decline in automobile ownership and, presumably, automobile use.
3.38      Traffic is forecast to continue to grow at a somewhat slower rate of
five percent p.a. Total passengers carried should thus be at least 2.2
million by FY89. This growth should be accommodated by better utilization of
the existing coach fleet and longer passenger trains, or an improved distri-
bution of traffic which presently exhibits strong seasonal patterns (see Annex
2).
B. The Proposed Project
3.39      The proposed project is a continuation of the Third Railway Project
which will be completed in June 1986. The Third Railway Project which
included, inter alia, the supply of 10 new locomotives aimed at preventing
deterioration of ZR operations which would have resulted in reduced railway
capacity. The implementation has been successful and ZR's carrying capacity
has been kept at an approximately constant level during the project period.
Still many problems remain to be solved and these are addressed in the
proposed new project which does not include further locomotive purchase, but
instead will rehabilitate the existing fleet. The basic problems are (i) low
equipment availability and utilization, and (ii) poor planning and execution
in both Operations and Maintenance Departments. The Project comprises part of
the Government's 1984-86 Expenditure Program (Consultative Group), and was
identified in July 1983. The project was appraised in February 1984 and
negotiations were held in Washington in January 1985. Ihe Zambiarl delegation
was led by Mr. G. A. Zaza, Senior Undersecretary in the Ministry of Finance.
A loan and project summary is given at the beginning of the report.
Rationale for Bank Support
3.40      The Project's orientation is firmly towards improved utilization of
existing assets, rather than investment in new ones. The exceptions are
purchase of a snmall number of new wagons to make up a deficit which cannot be
filled by rehabilitation of the existing fleet, and the substitution of radio
communications for "open-wire" which is essentially a changeover to improve
technology.
3.41      The Project, thus, accords well with general strategy of the Bank
Group to Zambia, which focusses on rehabilitation of existing assets. lhis
strategy has recently been exemplified by the Export Rehabilitation and
Diversification Project (Loan 4624-ZA) which is assisting in finaricing rehabi-
litation of the mining industry. The project will enable the transport sector
to fulfill its function of transporting domestic and exterrial traffic at
minimum cost by enabling the railway to maintairn and, indeed, slightly expand
its capacity and, thus, avoid the need of the productive sectors to have



- 19 -
recourse to trucks for the movement of bulk commodities. The railway's
institutional and technical expertise will be improved under specific
provisions of the project, and the Project will be a vehicle for initiatirng a
dialogue with GOZ on means of improving its capability to plan transport
sector investment and establish priorities.
Identification aid Preparation
3.42       The Project was identified during implementation of the Third
Railway Project and will continue to improve the maintenance and operations of
the railway. It was prepared by ZR and the appraisal mission from material
presented by ZR as its medium-term investment proposals and represents the
highest priority items within these proposals.
Objectives and Description of the Project
3.43       The project would continue to improve the operational efficiency of
the railway by providing for replacement of life-expired materiel and
equipment needed to meet the traffic demands, providing materiel and spare
parts for maintenance of ZR's equipment and facilities, and providirig modern
operational facilities. The project would also contain studies leading to
long-term improvements in the efficiency of the railway services, continued
support of ZR training program and technical assistance in specific areas
critical to the railway's operations and for project implementation. The
project would comprise the following components. Details are given in Annex
3.

3.44      A.  Track:  The rail is heavily worn on curves in the main-line and
sleepers are life-expired. The branch line from Kitwe to Chingola, will
require extensive maintenance for safe railway operations. The project will,
therefore, provide funds for improvements to the above sections which includes
replacement of 1,400 tonnes of rail (15 km of track) and 80,000 sleepers.
Funds for maintenance equipment and spare parts are also included.



- 20 -
3.45      B.  Signalling and Telecommunications:  Ihe outmoded CIC-signalling
system was replaced under lhird Railway Project (Credit/Loan 973-ZA/1790-ZA),
and the telecommunications equipment modernized and its capacity increased.
Ihe open-wire pole system supporting the signalling arid telecommunications
system is outdated and does not have sufficierit capacity for the railway's
needs since it also has to support data circuits. In addition, it is
unreliable and is subject to vandalism. ihe project will, therefore, provide
for the replacement of the open-wire system by radio communicatiorns. lhis has
been studied and recommended by consultants under the lhird Railway Project.
Ihe project also includes maintenanice spare parts and improved mainteniance
facilities. Replacement over the whole system is envisaged. However, should
comprchensive financing riot materialise, staged replacement could be
undertaken without sigr1ificarit eff-ect on either the economic rate of return or
ZR's financial situation.
3.46      C.  Locomotives arid Rollinig Stock:  lhe present fleet of locomotives
is sufficient to meet the estimated traffic demand fur the iiext five years,
provided, however, there is improved locomotive availability, reliability arid
utilization. Funds are included in the project to achieve this goal. Ihe
locomotive Fleet is relatively new; half of the fleet should have at least a
further ten years serviceable life. However, some of the locomotives suffer
from deferred major maintenance due to shortage of furnds for replacement
components.  These locomotives will, therefore, require major overhaul.  An
overhaul program will commerice under this project and prospectively continue
under future projects.
3.47      ZR operates some 6,300 wagons, of which 2,800 belorng to the Unitary
Railway System arid cannot be used outside Zambia. Most of these wagons are
old and life-expired arid need to be replaced. In addition, about 1,500 wagons
from other countries operate in Zambia for export, import and transit
traffic. A review of ZR's wagon requirements shows that about 1,000 of the
Unitary System wagons should be scrapped during the project period arid that,
as a result of actions to be taken to improve the wagon availability and
utilization, an adequate total supply of wagon capacity can be maintairned with
the purchase of 170 new wagons.  In addition, 24 new brake-vans are required.
3.48      D.  Workshops and Equipmerit:  Ihe workshop in Kabwe will need
further machinery to efficiently maintain ZR's equipment.
3.49      E.  Spare Parts:  Spare parts are required to increase ZR's
locomotive availability from the present 62 percent of 80 locomotives to an
expected 1987 level of 75 percent of 76 locomotives remaining after four are
scrapped. Thereafter, each locomotive will require spare parts for about
US$39,000 annually to maintain the availability at 75 percent.  In addition,
spare parts are required for maintenance of wagons and other transport
equipment.  Based on a mainteriance program prepared by ZR, the total foreign
exchange requirements for spare parts is estimated at US$21.1 million, for
which funds are included in the project.
3.50      F.  Operations Facilities:  For improved equipment utilization, ZR
will require a modern wagon control system and a system for production
planning and control connected to the new data processing facilities provided
for in the Third Railway Project. Some software is also required.



- 21 -                  p
3.51      G.  Traininq:  A manpower study has been financed under the ongoing
project with the purpose of identifying ZR's manpower needs and related
training on which the training program has been based.  Ihe project provides
for repair arid rehabilitation of the training workshop, workshop equipment and
tools, technical assistance for meeting training objectives and fellowship
training.  Details of the training components are given in Annex 4.
3.52      H.  lechnical Assistance and Studies:  Presently, ZR employes 22
expatriates, of which 12 are financed by the Bank and 10 by ZR. ZR will
retain its expatriate staff durinq the project period and require additional
assistance for project implementation and operational advisory services. In
total, the project will provide for 574 man-months of technical assistance.
3.53      Ihe project will also irclude funds to study the means by which
lonq-term improvements in the efficiency of railway services can be achieved.
This study will comprise about 108 man-months of technical assistance.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Cost and Financing
4.01      lhe total cost of the project, including taxes (1984 prices), is
estimated at US$-3.1 million equivalent, of which US$66.8 is in foreign cost
and US$16.3 million in local cost. Cost estimates for goods procurement are
based on recent contracts for similar services and goods financed under the
Third Railway Project.
4.02      Price contingencies have been provided for local costs on the basis
of arnual increases of 15 percerit for 1985 and 1986 and 10 percent for the
following years, and for foreign costs on the basis of 8 percent for 1985 and
9 percent for following years.
4.03      The Association will finance 30 percent of the foreign exchange
component, US$20.0 million, and the balance will be financed as shown below.
GOZ will finance local costs either directly or through ZR. Financing from
other agencies, except for KfW, Belgium, and SIDA, are not firm. Signing of
the aqreement with USAID for the provision of locomotive spare parts required
for essential maintenance is a condition of effectiveness. Association funds
will be on-lent to ZR at 12 percent with repayment over 20 years inclusive of
a grace period of 5 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by ZR: the
conclusion of a satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Aqreement is also a condition of
credit effectiveness.

B. Implementation
4.04      The Project will be implemented over a period of three years and be
completed by December 31, 1988, with a closing date of June 30, 1989.  ZR
will be responsible for the implementation of the project. A project manager
will be appointed to supervise the implementation of the Fourth Railway
Project. In addition expatriate staff will be employed to assist ZR in
implementation. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank Group. The
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5. To measure progress in meeting
anticipated improvements in ZR's efficiency and productivity, ZR has agreed to
a comprehensive set of operational targets for the project period (Annex 6,
page 1). The major goals include (i) increasing average diesel locomotive
availability from 62 percent in 19B4 to 75 percent in 1987; (ii) improving
average wagon availability from 82 to 90 percent during the same period; (iii)
increasing the average locomotive utilization from 92,000 km per available
locomotive per year to 105,000 km; and (iv) increasing the average wagon
productivity from 220,000 to 300,000 net tonne-km per available wagon per
year. These Largets will be regularly reviewed by the Bank. The actions
required to achieve the targets are summarized in a bar-chart (Annex 6 page
2). Agreement was reached at negotiations on the implementation schedule and
on project monitoring procedures.

4.06      Goads:  Equipment and goods are expected to be financed both under
the proposed credit and by co-donors. Such equipment and goods, financed
under the proposed credit, would be procured by ICB in accordance with the
Association's Guidelines. Eligible domestic bidders would be afforded a
preference of 15 percent or applicable duty whichever is lower under ICB
procurement. An exception to the above will be made (i) in cases where the
borrower can show to the Association's satisfaction that the items required
are clearly established manufacturers parts, in which case they may be
obtained directly from the original suppliers through negotiated contracts;
and (ii) where small orders are under US$100,000 eachi, up to a maximum of
US$1.0 million in total for which limited international bidding through
obtaining at least three price quotations will be applied. Goods financed by
co-donors will be procured in accordance with the procedures of the respective
agencies.  All documentation for equ.pment procurement under ICB and financed
by IDA will be subject to IDA review prior to issuance of tenders and award of
contracts.
4.07      Technical Assistance:  Technical Assistance will be provided by
specialist consultant firm(s) who will be appointed in accordance with the
Association's Guidelines. Ihe proposed training courses will be reviewed by
the Association.

The estimate is based on expected delivery time for goods and se-rices taking
into account disbursement experience under the Third Railway Project, In view
of the almost exclusively equipment and institution-building nature of the
project, the standard Zambian disbursement profile is not employed in this
case. The proceeds of the credit will disburse:
100 percent of foreign expenditures or 75 percent of local
expenditures for imported equipment, material, spare parts and
services locally procured.
E. Project Monitoring
4.09      ZR will submit Quarterly Progress Reports in the same format as has
been adopted under the Third Railway Project covering, inter alia, the
following aspects:
(a) progress of the project work with cost data;
(b) training and technical assistance;
(c) ZR financial performance; and
(d) ZR performance in meeting operational targets shown
in Annex 6.
F. Budget, Accounts, Audit and Evaluation
4.10      ZR prepares annual operating and capital budgets before the
commencement of each fiscal year which are submitted to the Board. In prior
years, they were then sent to the Minister of Power, Transport and
Communications for his final approval. This procedure, however, will be
altered as the ownership of ZR has been transferred to ZIMCO effective April
1984 (Para 4.19). The accounting system is computer-based and is being
revised and refined under the Ihird Railway Project. Annual acounts are
preparcd in a commercial format and are subject to audit by independent
auditors. The current auditors are Coopers & Lybrand (Zambia) who are
acceptable to the Association. Audited accounts are to be submitted to the
Association within six months following the end of each fiscal year. This
was confirmed at negotiations. Until recent years, the audits were completed
on time. However, due to computer problems, the accounts have not been closed
promptly with the resultant delay in the audit.  This is in the process of
being corrected.  No later than six months after the Closing Date, ZR will
provide the Association with a Completion Report which evaluates the
operations, execution, costs and benefits of the project; the performance of
ZR and the Bank Group, and lessons learned. This was agreed during
negotiations.

G. Economic Costs and Benefits, and Project Risks
4.11       The economic costs of the project are derived from the financial
costs, excluding taxes. The main benefits derive from increased efficiency in
the use of rolling stock which will result in the avoidance of traffic
diversion to more costly road transport. In deriving benefits, a conversion
factor (c.f.) of 0.83 has been applied to the local project costs and
estimated value of railway services derived from the project, and of 0.76 3/
to the alternative road services. To test the effect of this differential in
conversion factors, the results of assuming that the more precisely defined
c.f. for trucks also applies to rail are also shown. Details of the
methodology and the full cost and benefit streams for the total project and
the components for which benefits can be separately attributed, are given in
Annex 7.
4.12      The ERR on the total project lies between 21.8 and 24.3 percent,
while on the individual components between 43.5 and 16.5 percent, as
summarized below. Ihe lower benefits are expected on new equipment, where the
lack of dynamism in traffic growth will mean the benefits from improved
communications and equipment will take somewhat longer to materialize than
from the urgently needed rehabilitation inputs.

2) Camum c.f. for trucks and rail enployed.
4.13      To test the sensitivity of the results, two assumptions were made:
i)   benefits would decline by two percent p.a. 1988/89 - 1998/99.
This broadly reflects the effect of copper and directly
associated traffic ceasing by the latter date--a possible
though unlikely event. On this scenario, the ERR on the total
project declines to a minimum of 19.9 percent; and
ii)  the combined effect of traffic decline and costs 10 percent
higher was also assessed. The cost increase is unlikely to
exceed 10 percent as they are substantially for equipment, with
the uncertainty limited to the current estimates of component
prices. Under these scenarios, the ERR drops to 17.4 percent,
an acceptable rate of return.

Project Risks
4.14      The physical and economic risks of the project are minimal.  lhe
project concentrates on the highest priority items in ZR's investment program
and the most cost-effective means of maintaining--not expanding--the railway's
capacity to handle traffic on offer. There is little likelihood that traffic
will not, on average, reach forecast levels although fluctuations can be
expected as in the past. Equally, productivity improvements (reflected in
availability and utilization of capacity) have been forecast at a modest
level. However, the institutional and financial improvements could be slower
than expected to materialize. Changing management attitudes is a slow
process, while increasing tariffs in real terms particularly for passenger
services is politically unpopular when living standards seem, in any case,
likely to continue to decline.
H. Financial Evaluation
4.15      ZR's financial performance in the past has been erratic.  After
operating with annual net losses during the early 1970's, profits were
recorded from 1976 through 1980. Commencing in 1981 to date, losses have been
recorded ranging from Kwacha 6.0 million to Kwacha 19.1 million. The major
cause of this decline has been the lack of timely approval of tariff increases
by the Government to offset inflation. Operating statements in summary are
given below:
(K Millions)

1/ Year end rhanged from December 31 to March 31 and, thus, includes 15
months.
4.16      During 1979, ZR received under CIDA-financing two traffic costing
experts to establish a new Traffic Costing Unit to continually monitor and
update cost data for tariff and operational purposes. With the exception of
passenger fares, all tariffs are cost-based and the intention is that no goods
will be carried at less than total cost.  However, due to delays in Government
approval of increases, costs in recent years have risen above tariffs.



- 28 -
4.17      The decline in profitability materially affected the liquidity of ZR
and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined from 2.5
(FY80) to 0.8 (FY84).  During FY84, ZR implemented a financial recovery
program which included certain cost saving measures as well as tariff
increases.  The tariff increases were partially introduced during FY84 but the
major increases became effective in April 1984 (FY85).  Consultants were also
retained to reorganize the marketing organization and to train staff on the
job.
4.18      The projections for the project period do not anticipate major
increases in traffic to be carried. Using the existing tariff schedule,
including the increases implemented in April 1984, revenues would not be
sufficient to cover the cash flow requirements. As a result, further
increases in the nature of 25 percent for passenger service and an average of
20 percent for goods traffic in real terms are required to produce an
operating profit and create a cash flow sufficient to cover working expenses,
debt service requirements, and the local costs of the investment program. In
addition, the present debt/equity ratio places too heavy a burden on the cash
requirements. During negotiations the Association was advised that Ci) Kwacha
138 million of ZR debt to Government (including accrued interest) had been
capitalised and that (ii) freight tariff increases averaging 35'0 would be
approved to become effective April 1, 1985. Confirmation of such approval has
now been received. The combined effect of these actions is sufficient to meet
the cash flow requirement described above.
4.19      In December 1978, the Government announced that effective January 1,
1979, ownership of ZR will be transferred to the Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation, Limited (ZIMCO). While in practice ZIMCO has acted as the
holding company, the necessary legal formalities were long delayed until the
incorporation of ZR under the Companies Act was completed on December 19,
1983. Operations under ZIMCO became effective in April 1984.
4.20      Subject to the tariff changes and the capitalization referred to in
Para 4.18, ZR will generate sufficient profits and positive cash flows to
regain its financial viability. Details are given in Annex 8.
4.21      The Third Railway Project called for an eight percent return on net
fixed assets in use commencing FY81. This objective was not attained due to
delayed tariff increases to offset inflation. In order to return ZR to a
financially sound base in a reasonable time, it was agreed during negotiations
that the covenant be changed to a requirement that ZR, GOZ and ZIMCO take all
measures appropriate to achieve revenues sufficient to cover all working
expenses (before depreciation), taxes, debt service charges of principal and
interest, and 20a of the total investment program.



- 29 -
4.22           In order to safeguard ZR's cash flow during the implementation
of the proposed project, ZR should obtain the approval of the Association
whenever investments beyond those included in the proposed project are
estimated td exceed US$2.0 million equivalent in any one year. This was
agreed during negotiations.
4.23      ZR should maintain a reasonable relationship between its operating
surplus and debt service requirements. During negotiations, it was agreed
that, unless otherwise agreed with the Association, ZR will not incur any debt
if its operating surplus for the fiscal year or the 12 consecutive months
immediately before the date of occurrence, whichever is greater, would be less
than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding fiscal
year.
4.24      During negotiations it was confirmed that, if and when necessary,
ZIMCO will continue its practice of issuing documentation required to ensure
that ZR is provided with the necessary finance to maintain its operations at
the level of the previous year.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following items,
with the Government and/or ZIMCO:
(i)      that Government will submit terms of reference for the
revitalized planning unit and consequently, budgetary
requirements would be agreed prior to and would be a condition
of effectiveness (para 2.14).
(ii)     that Government will supply the Assoc:.ation with a policy
statement in regard to the Mulobezi Line. This is a condition
of effectiveness (para 3.17).
(iii)    that signing of an agreement with USAID for the supply of
locomotive spare parts would bew a condition of effectiveness
(para 4.03).
(iv)     that it will execute a subsidiary loan agreement with ZR,
acceptable to the Association. Execution of this agreement will
be a condition of Credit Effectiveness (para 4.03);
(v)      that it will annually review ZR's operational results and
approve adequate tariff increases as necessary to achieve the
required cash flow (para 4.21);
(vi)     that Government and ZR will obtain approval from the Association
prior to any capital investment during the period of project
implementation, by ZR, in excess of US$2.0 million equivalent
(para 4.22).
(vii)    that ZIMCO will arrange financing when required to enable ZR to
maintain at least its present level of operations (para 4.24).
5.02      Agreement was reached with ZR:
Ci)      that ZR will bear the foreign exchange risk (para 4.03);
tii)     on the project implementation schedule (para 4.04);
(iii)    on the project monitoring format and data systems (paras 4.04
and 4.09);
(iv)     that ZR will be responsible for the preparation of a PCR
(para 4.10):
(v)      ZR will submit audited accounts to the Association for its
review within six months of the end of each fiscal year
(para 4.10);



- 31 -
(vi)     on the cash flow requirements and capitalization of long-term
debt (para 4.18); and
(vii)    that ZR will not incur any debt if its operating surplus would
be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement of
any succeeding fiscal year (para 4.23).
5.03      On the basis of the above, the proposed project provides a suitable
bases for an IDA Credit of US$20.0 million equivalent to the Republic of
Zambia on standard terms, with "on-lending" of the total credit to Zambia
Railways for 20 years with a five-year grace period, at 12 percent per annum.

Annex 1
TRANSPORT SUB-SECTORS AND ORGANIZATIONS
INVOLVED IN TRANSPORT POLICY AND PLANNING
A. Tanzania-Zambia Railway
1.        TAZARA commenced operations with 85 locomotives and over 1,800
wagons. The availability of locomotives quickly declined due to a number of
causes including an insufficient number of trained local personnel to take
over when the Chinese experts left after 1977. As a result, TAZARA interna-
tional traffic declined precipitously from a peak of 937,000 tonnes in 1977 to
452,000 tonnnes in 1979 but has, since, recovered to 622,000 tonnes in 1982 as
a result of new and rehabilitated locomotives, supplied arid financed by
Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). lhe underlying weaknesses in operations
and maintenance remain, however, and about 250 Chinese technicians have since
been brought back to assist. An Assocation-finariced study of operations and
staffing, designed to identify longer term problems arid suggest remedies, is
now under review.
B. Roads and Road Transport
2.        Zambia has about 35,000 km of roads, of which 19,000 km are primary
and secondary roads under the responsibility of the Roads Department of the
Ministry of Works and Supply, and 16,000 km are tertiary roads administered by
Rural Councils. Of the former 4,600 km are asphalt-paved, 7,600 km are all-
weather gravel, and the remainder earth.
3.        The total number of vehicles operating in Zambia is uncertain.  The
nunber registered was 113,000 in 1981 but the number insured was only about
50,000. The discrepancy is believed to be largely caused by the lack of a
systematic mechanism for removing inoperative vehicles from the register. Of
the registered vehicles, 60 percent were automobiles, 11 percent trucks, 17
percent vans, and the rest are motorcycles, buses, construction vehicles and
tractors/trailers. The two parastatal trucking companies, Zambia Tanzania
Road Services (ZTRS) and Contract Haulage, Limited (CHL) in 1981 had about
1,000 vehicles (since reduced through non-replacement to about 650). United
Bus Company, also a parastatal, has an operational fleet of about 500 buses.
4.        Data on the size of the private trucking fleet is imprecise but it
appears to consist of 1,000 to 1,200 vehicles, mainly of large capacity (up to
30 tonnes); of this total, somewhat over half are Zambian owned. The average
fleet size is about 10 overall, but under eight for Zambian owners. Private
firms mainly handle domestic traffic as their small scale inhibits long
distance international transport which is mainly handled by CHL. The average
vehicle utilization is reportedly only about 50 percent due to directionally
imbalanced loading. The reason for this in domestic transport is not obvious
but may be affected by the high concentration of activity on the four to six
months agricultural season.



- 33 -
Annex 1
Page 2 of 6
5.        The average age of the private fleet is estimated as aver eight
years. This compares unfavorably with the parastatals where vehicle retire-
ments have occurred particularly in recent years. Both private and parastatal
organizations have operated under severe forein exchange shortages, though
quantification of the effect on vehicle and spare part availability (and the
associated vehicle utilization) is very difficult.
Air Transport
6.        There are 150 airports and airfields in Zambia, 52 of which are
Government owned. Lusaka International Airport handles all international
traffic. The national air transport company, Zambia Airways Corporation (ZA)
established in 1967, has received assistance from Alitalia and, more recently,
from Aer Lingus under management contracts. Operating with four Boeing 707's,
one Boeing 737, and three Hawker Siddley 748's, the airline's traffic in 1981
comprised 262,000 passengers and 2,000 tonnes of freight. It purchased a
DC-10 in 19B3 in anticipation of phasing-out its Boeing 707s on international
services for environmental reasons.
Pipeline
7.        A 1,700 km pipeline, completed in 1968 and jointly owned and
operated by the Zambian and Tanzanian Governments, carries all of Zambia's
crude petroleum imports amounting to 700,000 tonnes annually, and a further
50,000 tonnes for Zaire.
8.        Summarized below are the main Government ministries and other
organizations involved with the determination and execution of policy and
planning in the transport sector. As will be seen, there are significant
weaknesses in the system, and to achieve an improvement in the efficiency with
which resources are utilized within the sector will probably require
structural reform combined with the upgrading of personnel. There are various
means by which these objectives could be achieved, but the most obvious would
involve placing responsibility for economic and technical analysis of all
major transport investment (which oversees highways and railways) under the
one ministry.
C. The National Commission for Development Planning
9.        Theoretically, the National Commission for Development Planning
(NCDP) represents the centralized planning agency of the GOZ. This would seem
the logical result of efforts to systematize planning especially in regard to
the multiplicity of institutions which are concerned with transport. The
evolution of the NCDP to this position has been the result of a series of
reorganizations, first from being the Central Planning Office under the Office
of the President at the time of independence, to the possession of ministerial
status but still linked to the Office of the President. Between 1978 and
19B3, the NCDP ranked above other ministries in that it was headed by a
director-general whose authority exceeded that of the permanent-secretaries of



- 34 -
Annex 1
Page 3 of 6
the other ministries. Following political shifts in mid-1983, the director of
the NCMP was retitled permanent-secretary. It is too soon to assess the
implications of this action on the planning process but, clearly, a shiFt
toward decentralization is implied.
10.       If the frequency of structural changes has represented a limit on
the growth of NCDP as an institution more specifically restricting on the
transport sector has been the role the NCDP was to play as chairman of the
Transport Coordination Committee (ICC). lhe 1CC was established in 1976 to
assist with the preparation of the Third National Developmnent Plan (INDP).
According to the 1NDP, national transport policy was to be developed by
planning units in each ministry, parastatal, and province. The use of the 1CC
to integrate this process has not resulted, and the 1CC had been largely a
paper entity since 1980. In part, this resulted from staffing problems within
NCDP, and it also reflects the lack of a systematic appruach to the roles to
be played by different institutions and a consequent ad hoc approach to the
resolution of problems.
11.       Ihe NCDP is responsible for the development of the annual plans for
transport in conjunction with the respective ministries. This is based on
requests to each ministry for specific information. A draft is then prepared
by the Department of Sectoral Planning of the NCDP. Ihe draft is submitted to
the Cabinet for comment and approval. lhe NCDP staff assigned to transport
does not have extensive experience in the field of transport. The number of
effective or even Operational Transport Planning Units upon which the NCDP
staff can draw is limited, and access mechanisms to data as well as general
communications show signs of stress.
12.      The NCDP is also responsible for the direction of the Central
Statistical Office (CSO). Much of the data processed by the CSO is obtained
from other saencies, and linkage between the CSO and the data collection
process needs to be assessed. This process could be carried out in conjunc-
tion with overall institutional analysis or independently. Associated with
the issue of data is the need for the establishment of a meaningful and
accessible library for the NCDP.
D. Ihe Ministry of Power, Transport, and Communications
13.       The Ministry of Power, Transport, and Communications (MPIC),
administratively, is responsible for the development of transport policy, and
the planning and development of transport infrastructure. Functions relative
to roads, however, have been assigned to the Ministry of Works and Supply
(MWS). lhe ability of the MPTC to participate in the planning process,
especially in regard to transport policy formulationi, is seriously restricted
by the lack of transport planning capability within the Ministry. Assistance
is being provided by the Federal Republic of Germany in the form of an
economic adviser for transport but, to date, little institutional growth has
resulted from this assistance.  In part, this is the result of staffing
problems. The MPTC does not possess an adequate data base for decision-making
much less for policy making and initiatives should be undertaken relative to
data collection, possibly in conjunction with the NCDP and the CSO.



- 35 -
Annex 1
Page 4 of 6
14.       Several sources have suggested t:e possibility of separating the
transport section as a separate ministry, with the absorption of the Roads
Department of the MWS or in conjunction with some other institutional
restructuring. Structural and functional issues will have to be resolved
before the ministry can efFectively participate in transport management and
planning.
15.       Jurisdiction over the Road Traffic Commission (RIC) was returned to
the MPTC in 1983. For several years, it had been placed under the Ministry of
Home Affairs. The RTC is responsible for the issuance of licenses relative to
road traffic including those for goods haulage. Relocation under the MPTC
would seem a good time to examine the RTC structurally and functionally with
specific consideration given to the process of granting licenses as well as to
data collection associated with that process.
E. Ihe Ministry of Works and Supply
16.       The Roads Department (RD) of the MWS is charged with responsibility
for highway construction and maintenance of the paved road system which most
directly relates to the trucking sector. In the performance of this
responsibility, the RD also assumes such tasks as traffic counting and the
regulation of axle loads. Ihe RD has undertaken serious efforts to improve
the validity and extent of road traffic counting, including a doubling in a
few years of the number of points at which data is collected. Traffic
forecasts ror the 1990s are under preparation. The RD hopes to be able to use
electronic data processing techniques to assist its analysis. Efforts to curb
axle overloading included the use of weigh stations but they are seriously
restricted by the lack of any enforcement policy much less means of
implementation or control. The data the RD had concerning the incidence of
overloading is very general and does not reflect the high incidence of
overloading easily seen by direct observation.
17.       The Mechanical Services Department (MSD) is a department of MWS
responsible for the procurement, maintenance and repair of Government
vehicles. As such, it is responsible for ensuring RD vehicles are kept in
goad order through the operations of its central workshop in Lusaka   J
provincial and district workshops. MSD has executive responsibilities only
and does not have or require an ana'ytical or planning capability beyond that
necessary to determine its financial and phys. al requirements to execute its
remit. It has a separately detailed budget wizhin MWS.
F. The Office of Contingency Planning
18.       The Office of Contingency Planning (CP), alternately the Contingency
Planning Unit, was established in 1973 after the closure of the border with
Zimbabwe. It was given responsibility for the movement of import/export
traffic including both the assignment of routing as well as of modes. CP
played an especially important role with the closure of the Benguela Railway
and shift to 1AZARA, with actions following the bombing of key road and rail
bridgeb by Rhodesian security forces in 1979, and in conjunction with the
trucking of maize from Lion's Den in Zimbabwe after the border opening
following the independence of Zimbabwe.



- 36 -
Annex 1
Page 5 of 6
19.       With the opening of the border with Zimbabwe, CP has continued to
play a role in import/export traffic as well as in assisting with maize
haulage even though the original rationale for its existence no longer
exists. As an institution, it has had considerable experience with transport
system linkage but reductions in staff have restricted this function in recent
years. CP is one of the few institutions which has been involved in meaning-
ful extramural data collection relative to transport. Although the utility,
rationale, and responsibilities of CP should be reassessed, such should be
done with an effort to continue its linkage function even if such is within
the context of association with some other existing institution. Focus on CP
could provide useful lessons for institution bualdirig relative to the Zambia
transport system.
G.  lhe Zambia Industrial and Miriing Corporation
20.       Ihe Zambia Industrial aid Mining Corporation (ZIMCO) was established
in 1976 as the central holdinig company for the majority of the parastatals but
is not involved in long-term plannirng arid development of the transport
parastatals.  Day-to-day operations are almost exclusively the responsibility
of the respective managements of the parastatals.
21.       Administratively access to the parastatals for the ministries,
including the NCDP, is through ZIMCO. Communication and coordination is
complicated by the intervening barrier represented by ZIMCO on the one hand
and by the indirect role of ZIMCO in day-to-day planning on the other.  ZIMCO
is a relatively dynamic institution and possesses resources which might be
mobilized to assist in the transport planning process. The use of system's
analysis for transport planning could also be advanced by ZIMCO. lhe use of
own fleet by the non-trucking parastatals under ZIMCO could be reviewed most
effectively under the supervision of ZIMCO. Particular campaigns could be
instituted relative to loading, operations and safety. Eventually, certain of
such initiatives undertaken by ZIMCD could be transfered to respective
ministries as part of an overall institution building process. Particular
consideration to ZIMCO's role in such actions should be undertaken.
H. The lruckers' Association of Zambia
22.       Ihe lruckers' Association of Zambia iJAZA), rirst orgarnized in 1980,
is the only group officially representirig private truckers in Zambia.  Its
evolution came from annual negotiations between the trL"king sector and
NAMBOARD over rates for each season.  NAMBOARD would arniually convenie a
meeting for all truckers interesEed in haulage contracts. lhese meetings were
relatively important since NAMBOARD has been the single largest employer of
truck transport. Ihese meetings became increasingly difficult since there
were more than 100 different transporters interested in NAMBOARD contracts and
since there was disagreerent amorg the private firms as to the appropriate
NAMBOARD rate. On the basis of an indirect suggestion from NAMBOARD, the
private truckers joined to form TAZA.



- 37 -
Annex 1
Page 6 of 6
23.       The role TAZA is to play in the trucking sector remains to be seen.
As an officially recognized organization, IAZA has elected officials but has
yet to establish an office or obtain full time staff. The vitality of the
organization is currently a function of the personalities of its leadership.
Moreover, not all private truckers belong to the association. According to
Zmbian law, however, only one association per interest is allowed to
officially organize. Private truckers, not interested in NAMBOARD contracts,
have prefered to remain independent. There is some evidence of cartel-like
organizations outside the framework of lAZA, especially among private truckers
in the copperbelt but private truckers were not willing to discuss such.
24.       TAZA has taken an active role in getting the NAMBOARD rate gazetted,
although the implications of this for the trucking sector, as a whole, remain
to be determined. It has also taken an active role in licensing and the
control of foreign competition. The future role of TAZA in relation to the
Road Transport Employers Association, under the Zambia Federation of
Employers, and in relation to the National Union of Transport and Allied
Workers could be a source of confusion and conflict but could also have
positive dynamics.
1. The Ministry of Cooperatives
25.       The Ministry of Cooperatives was established in 1983 from the former
Department of Marketing and Cooperatives in the Ministry of Agriculture.
Although it has been provided with some vehicles (under Japanese financing),
the potential role of the Ministry is as yet unclear. One area in which it
could have a useful function is in analyzing the suitability of the standard
heavy truck employed on paved highways for use on rural access roads, and
whether means could be devised to encourage use of more appropriate vehicles.

A. Past and Present Freight Traffic
1.        Fluctuations in aggregate ZR traffic have tended to parallel those
in economic activity over the last six or seven years. Ihe magnitude of
fluctuations has been greater than that of GDP, which is not surprising as the
service sector which contributes one third to GDP, but little to rail traffic,
has a much more stable output than agriculture, mining or construction - the
main users of rail services. It is also noticeable that ZR domestic traffic
has fluctuated more than aggregate Zambian, and that transit traffic has shown
some tendency (statistically not significant) to offset fluctuations in
aggregate Zambian. lhe exception has been 1982/83 when all traffic declined.
Indices of the main traffic componients and GDP in constant prices are shown
below:
1977     1978      79/80    80/81      81/82     82/83
Domestic Traffic      100        90       93        80        98         88
International         100      125       123       114       128        113
Transit               100       145      138       146       120        102
GDP                   100       102       97       102       104        102
2.        These traffic statistics refer to tonnages.  Net tonnne-kilometers
give a better, though not infallible, guide to the demands placed upon railway
capacity. Unfortunately, because of a decision by ZR to move from a manual to
computerized data collection system and prolonged difficulties with the
latter, tonne-kilometer data is suspect and has had to be checked manually.
It is, however, clear that because of the relative increase of transit
traffic, and the reopening of the long haul southern route for international
traffic, ZR net tonne-kilometers have increased in 1977-1982/83 by about 11
percent.
B. Future Freight Traffic
3.        A further significant increase in the average haul is unlikely, and
the future traffic level will depend largely upon developments within the
domestic market. The short term (i.e., to about 1988/89) growth in GDP is
unlikely to exceed 1.7 percent p.a. and could be much less, while one
component of particular importance to ZR--mining activity--is expected to
remain stable in output. However, considerable emphasis is oeing placed by
Government on agricultural expansion, and the substitution of coal for fuel
oil in mining operations is being advocated to save foreign exchange 1/.
Agricultural development is subject, to some extent, to climatic vagaries, but
prospects for a modest growth in output seem good and an increase in ZR
agricultural traffic of 100,000 tonnes (17 percent) over six years is
1/ Under the Indeni Refinery Project now in preparation.

forecast. This assumes no diversion from rail to road, or vice versa, which
seems generally consistent with the general experience that during harvest
time all available capacity road or rail is highly utilized. Associated with
this is an expansion of fertilizer and associated chemical production at the
Kafue plant, which is also the subject nf a project in which FRG is likely to
be prominent 2/. Finally, coal production is likely to increase as a result
of an African-Development Bank (ADB) loan/credit to Ma:nba Colliery for
equipment and a possible subsequent Bank-Group-firnanced project if the results
of the recently commenced Maamba Coal Engineering Project studies prove
favorable. The mine is opencast, the vein(s) are essentially horizontal, and
the reserves considerable (about 70 million tonnes). Thus, the constraint on
expansion of production are equipment and the managerial and staffing
capability, both of which are being addressed. The assumption is made that
the increase in output necessary to meet expanded fertilizer plant demands
(about 150,000 tonnes) will be realized by 1988/89 but that mining associated
expansion will take longer to materialize. No other traffic growth is
forecast.
4.        The results are that in aggregate ZR traffic in 1988/89 is forecast
to be nine percent higher in both tonnage and tkm than the 1980/81-1982/83
average. For sensitivity analysis, the assumption is made that only coal
traffic will experience any growth over the three-year average. This yields a
pessimistic growth of four percent in tonnage and zero in tkm. For 1993/94,
the assumption is made that there will be further growth in coal traffic, and
a recovery in international traffic, but no growth in other domestic traffic
over the 1988/89 levels. This yields a further increase of five percent in
tonnage and 10 percent in tkm over the five years 1988/B9-1993/94 to a high
estimate of 15 percent above the three-year average for tonnage, and 19
percent for tkm. As a pessimistic forecast, no growth from the 1988/89 high
is assumed, i.e. aggregate growth in traffic, both tonnage and tkm would be
only nine percent over 10 years. Given that specific traffics have been
identified with reasonalbe growth prospects (coal, fertilizer) arid that GDP is
expected to increase by up to 20 percent over the period, the aggregate low
forecasts are probably too conservative.
5.        Detailed traffic statistics and forecasts are given in Tables 1
and 2.
C. International Trade Routes
6.        In aggregate, Zambia is now well supplied with alternative trade
routes. These comprise (i) via Zaire/Angola (rail); (ii) via Tanzania
(rail/road); (iii) via Zimbabwe/South Africa (rail/road); and (iv) via
Malawi/Mozambique (road/rail combination) and via Botswana, which feeds into
the Southern African system. Assessing the capacity of these is a pointless
exercise as the determinants have changed substantially over time but if peak
traffic for each system within the 1972/83 period is added, it aggregates to
3.7 million tonnes compared with a peak traffic of 2.1 million tonnes and a
recent level of 1.3-1.4 milion tonnes.

7.        The different routes have different characteristics and, in some
cases, political uncertainties are the dominant feature. This applies
particularly to the Lobito/Zaire route which, for European and North American
traffic, have the attractions of avoidance of the Suez Canal and a shorter
distance especially to North America. Our understanding is that the Benguela
Railway is basically in reasonable physical condition, but that security is
poor. The port of Lobito, however, is reportedly in very poor condition and
physically incapable of handling a significant volume of traFfic without
substantial investment. Thus, on balance, the route is unlikely to afford a
reasonable alternative to the two existing dominant routes.
8.        The effective capacity of the southern route to handle Zambian (arid
Zairian transit) traffic is unlikely to change significantly, and the only
reason for a reduction in Zambian traffic would be a desire by Zambia to
lessen its dependence on this route. This would seem likely to occur only as
a deliberate measure as the proportion of traffic transmitting the Dar-es-
Salaam route has declined marginally 1980-83 despite the increase in lazara
capacity, i.e. the effect of this increase has merely tz'n to precipitiously
reduce the use of Tanzania Zambia Road Services.
9.        Thus, there seems little likelihood that the distribution of traffic
between the two major routes will change sigrnificantly in the forseeable
future. Equally, there is no reason for Zambia to actively encourage the
development of new evacuation routes (e.g. via Namibia).
D.  Passenger Traffic
10.       ZR passenger traffic 1976-1982/83 has exhibited three marked
characteristics: (i) growth at an annual average rate of eight percent p.a.;
(ii) an increase in growth during the recession since 1980; and (iii) a marked
seasonal pattern which can be largely eliminated by applying a four-month-
moving average to the monthly data.
11.       The recent traffic growth has occured despite tariffs having been
increased more rapidly than the consumer price index. This contrasts with the
real 1978-80 period when passenger tariffs declined but passenger volume
hardly changed. The conclusion to be drawn is that traf-fic has been much more
sensitive to the overall standard of living than relative prices--Zambians
have turned to rail travel when they found difficulty in affording cars.  It
should be noted that this may only be a partial explanation as bus transport
is much more important than rail (about 70 million compared with 2 million
passengers) and knowledge of the standard and availability of bus services is
very limited (Table 3).
12.       Nevertheless, two inferences can be drawn:  (i) passenger traffic
can be expected to continue to grow in the absence of a marked recovery in the
Zambian economy. ZR forecast a five percent p.a. growth rate which could be
conservative; (ii) a real increase in tariffs sufficient to increase tariffs
to equal the long run marginal cost of provision of passenger services by
project completion should have little effect on demand for such services.

Annex 2
Page  oT 5
The increase required would be about eight percent p.a. in real terms or with
inflation at 20 percent, 12 percent and 10 percent p.a. for 1984, 1985 and
1986 to 1987, respectively, at an average in current prices of 22 percent
p.a. The project includes provision for modification to coaches. Insuffi-
cient data is available to judge whether a growth of five percent p.a. in
traffic will place intolerable pressure on passenger accommodation but, if so,
the case for investment in passenger coaches will be considered in the light
of the financial implicatioris for ZR and the prospective source of financing
at the time.
E. Rail and Road Distribution of Freight Traffic
13.       The basic characteristics of rail and road freight traffic distri-
bution are that:
i)    rail traffic is up to 10 times the volume of the largest
trucking company (CH);
ii)   there is greater year-to-year variance in the volume of truck
traffic;
iii) rail traffic is preponderantly bulk while truck is mainly
higher value intermediate and finished goods; and
iv)   the main overlap is in the transport of agricultural products.
The seasonal pattern is clearly demonstrated by the heavy concentra-
tion on agricultural movements August-January. A private trucking
firm, which is believed to be typical, shows agricultural movements
accounting for 80 percent of total during these months (Table 4).
14.       Bulks 3/ typically account for two-thirds of rail traffic and high
value products only about four percent.  For trucks, CH shows bulks as about
13 percent, and high value as 45 percent. The area of overlap, actual and
potential, accounts for about 30 percent of rail and 40 percent of truck
traffic. However, agricultural and related movements are over a concentrated
period and although capacity utilization statistics are not available on a
seasonal basis, it appears clear that during the agricultural season virtually
all capacity is pressed into service. It is reasonable to assume, therefore,
that there is little effective competition but in fact considerably comple-
mentarity between rail and road for agriculturally related traffic. Exclusion
of these reduces the overlap area to about 10 percent for both rail and road.
15.       The prospects for increased competition for agricultural traffic are
not favorable. Increased storage capacity is being provided under bilateral
financing, but the effect is more likely to retain the existing relationship
3/ Defined as excluding agricultural products, petroleum, general goods
and 50% building materials and chemicals/fertilizer.

between storage and marketed production, rather than spread the agricultural
movements over a longer season. The basic report on storage 4/ recommended a
48 percent increase (of which 23 percent is underway). However, the demand
for marketed grains is likely to increase by nearly 60 percent by 1995 5/.
16.       It is, thus, reasonable to conclude that the volume of future rail
traffic will be little affected by truck competition, and heavily influenced
by the experience of the mining and agricultural sector.

PROJECI DETAILS
A. General
1.        The proposed project extends over the period 1986-1988 and is
specified below. The total cost of the project amounts to US$83.1 million, of
which US$66.8 million is in foreign cost. Details of the cost are given in
attachment to this annex.
B. Track
2.        About 700 km of the main line has track laid on wooden sleepers
varying in age from 15 to 25 years. Most of the sleepers are, therefore,
rotten and have to be replaced. Some sections have sharp curves and the rail
in these curves are worn out and also have to be replaced. Some parts of the
branch lines in the north, which is important to the movement of ore for the
copper production, are still in worse condition and have to be improved.
3.        Due to the poor track condition, speed restrictions have been
imposed for all freight trains from the original speed of 65 km/h to 45 km/h.
In addition, several sections have speed restrictions of 15-20 km/h on lengths
varying from 1 km up to 13 km. Before entering one section, the train has to
stop.
4.        In spite of all speed restrictions, derailments occured on the weak
sections, halting the operations for an average of approximately five hours.
During one incident, the line was blocked for 73 hours.
5.        About 30 km of rail and 80,000 sleepers will be replaced along with
fishplates, nuts and washers.
6.        Provision will also be made for acquisition of various track
maintenance equipment and tools.
7.        The strengthening of track will eliminate temporary speed restric-
tion and reduce derailments caused by the weakened track.
C. Signalling and Telecommunications
8.        The open-wire pole route of ZR was last overhauled in the 1950's
prior to the installation of the original Centralized Train Control (ClC). It
now has to support carrier telephone and d3ta circuits considerably beyond its
design capacity. After 30 years in service, the route requires major
rehabilitation to remain in use, also the socio-economic conditions have made
vandalism and theft an increasing cause of the system down-time. There is no



- 48 -
Annex 3
Page 2 of 7
prospect that investment in rehabilitation of the open-wire route would make
any significant improvement to the system reliability. There is also a
substantial demand for increased capacity which cannot be economically met by
an open-wire system.
9.        Under the Third Railway Project, ZR is investing in related works as
follows:
a)  renewal of CTC System throughout the line.  This work is in hand
under contract to Siemens AG of West Germany;
b)  installation of Train and Mobile Radio Communications, including
UHF links between Lusaka and Kitwe.  This work is in hand under
contract to Aydin Monitor Systems of USA;
c)  expansion of Telephone Exchange Network with provision for
extension trunk dialing. Contract let to Philips of Holland;
and
d)  installation of a Telegraph Network using a central message
switch, already completed by Philips of Holland.
10.       Various alternative possibilities for replacement of the open-wire
system have been studied and the alternative of using radio has been
recommended by consultants as the most suitable and cost-efficient system.
The Bank agrees with this proposal.
11.       The total estimated cost for renewal over the total system is US$9.0
million. The system can be replaced in three independent phases and,
depending on funds which can be made available in the project, one, two and/or
all three phases will be included within the overall project.
D. Locomotives and Rolling Stock
Locomotives
12.       ZR has 80 locomotives, of which 68 are main-line locomotives and 12
are shunters. Four locomotives have been heavily damaged and will be
scrapped. About 30 locomotives on average are constantly out of service,
including the four wnich will be scrapped. Ihis will give an average
availability of the locomotives of 62 percent. However, the availability
varies from 60 percent up to 75 percent which leaves the Railway with a
temporary locomotive shortage. Also, the traffic pattern affects the
locomotive requirements. To have sufficient number of locomotives available
for its traffic, ZR has to rent locomotives from South Africa. During the
past year, ZR has, therefore, rented between 6 to 15 locomotives.



- 49 -
Annex 3
Page 3 of 7
13.       ZR would not have had to rent locomotives to that extent if
utilization had been satisfactory. A study, financed under the Ihird Railway
Project, shows that the utilization can be increased by about 25 percent with
increased interval between trip inspections. ZR has tried to implement the
proposed procedures but has not been successful due to poor reliability as a
result of poor quality control after service and due to shortages of spare
parts.  However, the proposed project will include financing of spare parts as
well as technical assistanice for improved quality control. This will improve
the locomotive reliability and reduce the need for new locomotives.
Wagons
14.       ZR operates about 6,300 wagons, of which 2,800 belongs to the
Unitary System. In addition, ZR operates about 1,500 wagons from neighboring
countries. During the last five years, ZR has been able to scrap close to
1,000 wagons as a result of 1,100 new wagons provided under the Third Railway
Project, and another 1,000 wagons are due for scrapping during the next five
years.
15.       The availability of the fleet is low, 82 percent, and will be
increased to about 90 percent as a result of increased stock of spare ports,
to be financed under the proposed project, and the financing of Technical
Assistance in wagon maintenance.
16.       The utilization of the fleet is also low, 220,000 net tonne-km per
available wagons against expected 300,000 as a result of the introduction of a
computerized wagon control system, and improvements in operations to be
identified by a proposed study included in the project.
17.       The present fleet of 6,300 wagons is equivalent to 5,166 wagons with
the present availability of 82 percent and inclusion of rented wagons from
neighboring countries, gives an effective total of 6,666.
18.       After scrapping of 1,000 wagons, the delivery of planned 170 wagons
(to be included in the project), increased availability to 90 percent and also
increased utilization to 300,000 net tonne-km per available wagon, the
equivalent wagon fleet will amount to 8,186 units including those on hire.
This is a net increase of the number of effective wagons by 22 percent and
sufficient for ZR traffic needs.
Other Items
19.       Twenty four brake-vans included in the project are for the replace-
ment of 13 brake vans which have been scrapped recently arid for brake vans
which are planned to oe scrapped.
20.       Modification of coaches includes new electrical system for lighting
in the Japanese delivered coaches. The systems do not function in Zambia due
to complexity and need of spare parts.  ihe new system will be of simple
design, easy to repair, and require a minimum of spare parts.

E. Workshops Equipment
21.       ZR will require some additional workshops machinery and tools for
its maintenance services. The list of equipment includes crank-shaft grinder,
internal grinder, some minor machines and hand-tools amounting to approximate-
ly US$1.2 million.
F. Spare Parts
22.       The foreign exchange required for spare parts amounts to US$21.1
million, excluding contingencies, and is made up as follows:
us $ ('000)
i.    Replenishment of stores                       5,200
ii.   Locomotive maintenance                        8,500
iii.  Wagon & coach                                 4,000
iv.   Track maintenance                             1,500

vii.  Computer                                        100
Total                                        21,100
i.  Replenishment of Stores:  Recent inventory of spares in stock
shows the following fulds requiied for replenishment of stores.
Spares for passenger coaches have been excluded as investment for
passenger traffic is a low priority item. ihe present "Normal Stock
Level" has been reduced by 25 percent as a result of a new
Materials Management System under implementation:
Locomotives         Wagons        lotal
Normal Stock Level              6.0              1.9            7.9

Investment Required             3.6              1.6           5.2
ii. Locomotive Maintenance Spare Parts: ZR maintenance program
based on traffic projections is shown below. This program is agreed
to with the Bank. The costs show the foreign exchange requirements
for spare parts.

Total cost of spare parts for locomotive maintenance for the three-
year period, therefore, amounts to US$8.5 million.
iii. Other Spare Parts: The foreign exchange requirements for
other equipment is based on previous consumption, to which the
requirements for spare parts needed for the backlog in maintenance
is added.
G. Operations Facilities
23.       ZR will have to improve the maintenance quality control and the
maintenance planning, and schedule the spare parts requirements for the
preventive maintenance. For this purpose, a computerized production planning
control system will be introduced, using the existing computer facilities.
24.       Also, the wagon utilization will be improved with the intoduction of
a computerized wagon monitoring control system.
H. T-aininq
25.       Training is covered in detail in Annex 4.
I. Technical Assistance
26.       The technical assistance component, except for training, amounts to
US$6.65 million, of which US$5.2 million is foreign cost. All costs are
excluding contingencies.
i) Project Implementation (358 man-months)
27.       ZR require assistance in the following areas for project implementa-
tion:

a) Ihe Project Coordinator is required on a part-time basis for
project planning, coordination and follow up. He will also advise
the managing director on project modifications, on a priority basis,
prepare Quarterly Reports required by the Bank which will include
status of project cost and reviewed implementation schedule in
addition to information on operational, financial and traffic
performance.
b) For Overhaul of Locomotives, ZR will require two full-time
technicians: one with experience in the mechanical work on diesel
electric locomotives, and one with experience on the electrical
work. The two technicians will assist ZR in the planning of the
overhaul, the identifying and ordering of parts, components,
materials, and tools required, the scheduling of the supply of
above-mentioned equipment, and the assisting in the physical work
including quality control and testing of locomotives after
completion.
c) For Production Planning Control and Wagon Monitoring Control.
ZR will require system analysts and programmers with experience from
similar systems.
ii) Advisory and Operational Service (216 man-months)
28.       The Chief Civil Engineer will retain three of his operational
expatriate staff (engineers) during the project period. One will stay for the
full three-year period; one for two-year, and the other one for one-year.
After completion of the project, this branch will have been fully Zambianized.
29.       The Chief Mechanical Engineer will require three qualified
expatriate technicians during the project period basically to advise ZR in
equipment maintenance and to improve quality control. The three technicians
should be experienced in diesel locomotive maintenance. This branch will
require expatriate assistance also for the period after project completion.
30.       The Chief Signal and Telecommunications Engineer is an expatriate.
He will be required for the project period, during which time, a local
engineer will be trained to take over the services. This branch will be fully
Zambianized when the project is completed.

Man Months
a)  Component Rehabilitation                72
b)  Operational Improvements                36
TOTAL                                  108
a) The Component Rehabilitation Study is required to reduce ZR
future need of foreign exchange for procurement of spare parts.
A big portion of spare parts replaced due to wear and tear and
poor functioning can be recovered should ZR have suitable
facilities and experienced staff in restoring these parts. The
study will identify suitable parts to restore, on a priority
basis, the facilities required and staff training needed.
Future projects will include facilities and training for the
implementation. In addition to the introduction of the Wagon
Monitoring Control System, ZR will also have to improve its
operations. A study will concentrate on yard services to
improve the circulation and transit uf wagons at border stations
and at the Tazara connection station--Kapiri Mposhi.

OVERVIEW OF TECHNICAL/VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Proposed Training Component
1.        In contrast to many other African countries, in Zambia it was
realized soon after independence that development of technical/vocational
training and education is crucial to the expansion of the economy. As the
country relied to a large extent on the mining sector, it was only natural
that a large number of technical training institutions originated from there.
2.        At present, the University of Zambia (UNZA) is responsible for
engineering education (B.Sc. Courses) through its Schools of Engineering and
Mines. The total enrollment of UNZA is about 3,500 students, of whom about
390 are in the engineering streams. The output of about 80 engineering
graduates per year is not sufficient for the country's needs, and Government
departments and parastatals find difficulties to recruit new engineers as the
private sector pays higher wages.
3.        The responsibility for training of technicians and skilled workers
rests with the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training
(DTEVT) under the Ministry of Higher Education (MHE).  With respect to
technician training, there are two technical colleges covering a great variety
of technical specializations through a three-year diploma program.
4.        These colleges have a total enrollment of about 1,150 students and
are under-utilized because of a shortage of qualified teachers.
5.        Skilled workers training is carried out in the nine Trades Training
Institutes (TTI), presently enrolling about 2,300 trainees in a two-year
training program. Recently, the demand for this type of graduates has been
less than the supply and the intake has been reduced. Another reason for
lessening the intake is a shortage of recurrent funds to run the institutes at
full capacity.
6.        In the field of commercial education leading to a diploma, DIEVI is
also responsible for two institutes with an enrollment of about 1,400
students. There is a great demand for these graduates who are employed
immediately upon graduation.
Training in Zambia Railways
7.        Zambia Railways (ZR) employs a total of about 8,000 staff.  ZR is
divided according to functions and under the Managing Director (MD). There
are two Assistant Managing Directors (AMD), each responsible for the
operations and administration, respectively. The Operations AMD is in charge
of the engineering and traffic functions, while the Administration AMD handles
Departments of Administration, Data Processing, Supplies and Personnel. The
principal of the Training Center, previously reporting directly to the MD, now
comes under the Personnel Department.

Annex 4
Page 2 of 6
B.        The Training Center, being responsible for all training in ZR and
headed by the principal, is organized with two assistant principals For
engineering courses and operations related program, respectively. For coordi-
nation and cooperation with users departments and branches, four training
coordinators have been appointed. At present, the instructor staff is 48, of
whom 9 are at the level of senior. Only a few of the instructors have
undergone a formal instructor training. As for the present number of trainees
enrolled and courses offered, the instructor staff is under-utilized.
Iraining Proqrans
9.        The overall training program within ZR consists of training artisans
(civil, mechanic21 and electrical), technicians (signals and telecommunica-
tions), operations and commercial staff, supervisors and managers.
10.       The artisan program enrolls graduates from the ITIs and is of four-
year duration, comprising a sandwich-type course with 10 months of on-the-job
training coupled with two months of off-the-job, mainly theoretical training
in the Training Center. After each off-the-job training session, trainees are
given a trade test and, if passed, they will be promoted to a higher artisan
level. This system suffers from several weaknesses like (i) lack of integra-
tion between off-the-job and on-the-job training, (ii) little supervision
during the extensive on-the-job training periods, (iii) too theoretical
content of off-the-job training; and (iv) the absence of a well-equipped
workshop in the Center.
11.       Technician training exclusively for the Signals & lelecommunications
branches have recently been established with the help of technical assistance
and equipment, provided under the Third Railway Project. The course is of
six-month duration aimed at specializing electrical engineering graduates from
the technical colleges in signals and telecommunication techniques relevant to
railway operations. The program has been quite successful and appreciated by
the users departments.
12.       Operations training encompasses training of drivers, guards,
shunters, station masters, commercial clerks, etc. To qualify as an engine
driver, the trainee has to follow a route with a number of shorter courses and
lengthy on-the-job training in various positions. The average total time
involved to progress from a fresh entrant in ZR to a qualified driver is more
than six years. Although the driver training program appears to be quite
comprehensive, the rather high rate of accidents within ZR indicates that the
training is not adequate and the course needs revision, perhaps, including
more time for actual driving arid less as an observer. Other operations
training programs are in-service and of short duration (two to six weeks) and
appear to instill appropriate skills.
13.       Supervisory training for foremen and junior managers is offered as
short courses or seminars. This training focusses on lecturing and makes
little use of role playing and other practical exercises.

1raining Resources
14.       The ZR Training Center operates on two sites:  (i) a purpose built
training center dating from 1964 being used for operations, supervisory and
signals/telecommunication training; and (ii) an engineering trades training
school consistino of a store converted to classrooms and offices and a
deserted steam locomotive running shed used as a training workshop. The
training center is adequate for its purpose and with some additional equipment
presently under order, it will be adequately equipped. As regards facilities
for engineering training, the temporary workshop is in urgent need of major
repair and rehabilitation to be able to serve its purpose. Ornly some
mechanical machinerv is in good working condition while other equipment, i.e.
for welding, diesel and electrical traction courses, need to be replaced.
Training Outside Zambia Railways
15.       ZR does not always make use of external training sources within
Zambia for upgrading training even though suitable training institutions are
available. It would be possible to use such institutions for training in
workshop management and in typing, clerical skills and general administration.
16.       With respect to training abroad, about 200 persons 1/ have been
trained during the period 1981-83 for an average of five montWs each, covering
the areas af general management, engineering, marketing, data processing,
accounting, etc.
Financing of Training
17.       Recurrent costs for training during this and previous years was not
available in ZR. However, ZR has estimated that the likely training expenses
for 1983/84 would be a total of Kwacha 1.2 million, with salaries for
instructors and trainees amounting to about Kwacha 900,000, training abroad
Kwacha 130,000, and instruction related expenditures Kwacha 130,000. This
budget appears reasonable when compared with other African Railways.
lraining Component
18.       Manpower Situation.  Financed under the Third Railway Project, ZR
engaged consultants to carry out a Manpower and Training Study to review
manpower requirements and related training needs.  The consultants' report,
inclusive of comments by ZR and the Bank, forms the basis for the proposed
training component. The consultants have also carried out a manpower planning
survey with the aim of establishing a manpower plarning function within ZR.
19.       As mentioned previously, the total authorized manpower complement in
ZR of about 8,000 is on the high side for a railway of this size. However,
certain job categories are understaffed while others are overstaffed.
Manpower projections, covering the period 1985-1990, show the requirements in
terms of pre- and in-service training for the most crucial staffing positions.
1/ About 500 man-months financed under the Third Railway Project.

Proposed Component
21.       Objectives.  To remedy the shortcomings experienced with training,
the proposed project would aim at further strengthening the relations becween
the training center and users departments including a review of existing
programs to better integrate off- and on-the-job training in order to
ultimately suit the needs of the recipients.
22.       The component would encompass:
a)  civil works for repair and rehabilitation of the training
workshop;
b) provision of equipment and vehicles in terms of workshop
machinery and hand tools, training aids, etc., and one minibus
for trainees' transportation;
c) technical assistance for implementation of training objectives;
and
d) fellowship training inside Zambia and abroad.
Civil Works
23.       Provision for civil works includes financing of modification and
repair of the existing steam locomotive running shed to make it more suitable
as a training workshop. This will comprise major repair of the roofing,
construction of external and internal walls, coverage of the inspection pits
and improvement of lighting. In addition, provision will be made for
construction of new administrative offices for engineering instructor staff
comprising about 200 m2.

Equipment, Training Aids and Vehicles
24.       Workshop equipment would be provided for the training workshop in
terms of hand tools and machinery for the specializations of diesel/electrical
and diesel/mechanical fitters, electricians, welders and carpenters. Also,
there is a need for simple audio visual aids, additional books for the
technical library, and demonstration models for artisan training. A minibus
would be provided for transportation of trainees to the maini railway
workshops, located about 6 km from the training center.
lechnical Assistance
25.       A rather large technical assistance component (216 man-months) would
be necessary to implement a revised training program. It would cover organi-
zation, management and planning for all training activities including
integration of on- and off-the-job training, curriculum review and revision,
instructor and supervisor training and evaluation and assessment of on- and
off-the-job training involving trade testing also. The technical assistance
would consist of specialists in management training, manpower planning, data
processing training, drivers and operators training. As for engineering
training, specialists in organization, planning and management on- and
off-the-job training (signal and telecommunication) would be required. For
workshop management including production control and industrial engineering,
two specialists would be needed. For certain assignments like curriculum
revision, trade testing procedures, equipment procurement, etc., it is
anticipated that short term consultants could be used for two or more shorter
visits to ZR rather than making use of long term experts.
Training Outside ZR
26.       In the future, ZR plans to use existing training institutions in
Zambia for general training rather than setting up its own courses. This
will, in particular, apply to commercial training, secretarial studies,
management training, etc. Certain training needs, however, cannot be
satisfied within the country and, therefore, about 100 man-months of
fellowships for overseas training would be provided. These fellowships would
be in the areas of general management, manpower planning, accounting,
industrial training, production planning, data processing, etc. Every effort
would be made to ensure :hat local or regional training programs are available
before proposing candidates for overseas training.
Cost of Training Component
27.       The training component, also including assistance to workshop
management and operation and manpower plarning, has been estimated at a total
base cost of US$3.39 million, out of which US$2.70 million constitutes the
foreign exchange to be financed under the proposed project.

Implementation
28.       In order to establish an efficient training system as soon as
possible, all training facilities should be available and operational.
Therefore, it is important that ZR start planning for execution of civil works
early (before loan effectiveness) and likewise prepare equipment lists so that
complete training facilities are available early in the implementation
period. Technical assistance personnel need to be recruited so as to be in
the field when facilities are near completion. With respect to fellowship
training, this component should be evenly distributed over the project period
to avoid critical manpower shortages in key positions.

ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFI1S
General
1.        Project economic costs are derived from financial costs, with taxes
excluded. For sensitivity analysis, costs are increased by 10 percent. As
there are virtually no civil works (track works are mainly rail relaying),
this is a reasonable worst case assumption. A conversion factor of 0.83 is
employed for railway local costs and to benefits. This has been derived from
the recommended 0.76 1/ for trucks, taking into consideration the different
cost characteristics of the two modes. For truck costs 0.76 is employed. To
assess the impact of the differential in the c.f.s, the results of assuming
the truck c.f. applies equally to rail is also shown. The streams derived
from analysis of the cost of rail transport and the (avoidable) alternative
cost of road transport are employed as a starting point for benefit
calculation which are then distributed between locel and foreign cust savings,
to the extent practical with available data. Two, alternative measures of
these benefit streams are employed: the first, based upon the best traffic
forecasts (described in Annex 2): the second, on the low growth traffic
scenario until FY90, and then employing the pessimmistic assumption that
traffic (and benefits) would decline at an average -2 percent p.a. FY90-FY99.
This decline would broadly reflect the result of complete elimination of
copper and direct copper inputs traffic by FY99, an unlikely occurrence.
2.        The results for the total project are shown below.  On the best
traffic forecasts, the ERR is from 21.8 to 24.3 percent depending on c.f.
assumptions. If increased coal traffic fails to materialize and copper
traffic declines rapidly after 1990, the ERR would decline to 17.4 to 19.8
percent.

3.        The individual project components are analyzed below, and the cost
and benefit streams shown in Table 1. There are two main sets of benefits;
increased availability and increased utilization of both locomotives and
wagone. To avoid any possibility of double counting of benefits, these were
established in aggregate for the whole project and then distributed between
the contributing project componernts. Ihe distribution between the locomotive
and wagon related components was 50:50. If the avoided investment cost hao
been employed, the attribution to wagons would have been higher, but if the
percentage capacity increase (of locomotives and wagons separately) were
employed, the locomotive attribution would have been greater than that to
wagons. While there is a certain degree of arbitrariness in the allocation of
benefits between components, the dividing line between an availability
improvement and utilization increase factor is a narrow one, the superior
benefit/cost ratios for rehabilitation compared with new investment is clear
to see and is what could be expected in an undynamic traffic situation. The
component analysis is confined for brevity to the basic cost estimates with
(i) no differential c.f.; and (ii) differential c.f. of 0.91.

Locomotives Spares and Rehabilitation
4.        The effective stock of locomotives would have declined by about six
percent p.a. 1974-81 in the absence of replacement. This is not excessive by
African standards, and has been largely offset by new purchases (1975, 8
percent; 1976, 8 percent; and 1981, 10 percent) and periodic borrowing from
RSA offset, from time to time, by lending to lazara. Presently, there are no
net loans/borrowings and ZR's own capacity and demand are understood to be
broadly in balance at present traffic levels.
5.        In the absence of the project, the above rate of capacity decline
would at least continue and could accelerate. At a continued six percent
p.a., the available fleet would fall to the equivalent locomotive availability
of 37 by FY-88 compared with the current 49. The locomotive spares program
and associated rehabilitation should increase the availability to 75 percent
(from 65 percent), i.e. 54 in-service locomotives. To move the traffic,
however, will also require wagons and the benefit is accordingly divided
between the locomotive and wagon programs (see below).

Wagons Spares and Purchase
6.        ZR has 6,300 wagons, of which 2,800 are from the former "Unitary"
system and are between 30 and 60 years old.  There is, thus, an unavoidable
program underway for wagon scrapping, for which the spares and purchase
program will compensate. ZR will need about the equivalent of 6,800 wagons at
the present level of availability and utilization by FY89. The calculation of
how this capacity will be obtained is shown below:
Initial stock                                 6300
Scrap                                         1000
Net                                           5300

Wagon Control Effect                           ;:15
Revised Utilization Equivalent                6300
7.        The benefits from increased wagon availability are distributed pro-
rata to wagon equivalent effect between the spares program and new purchase
(i.e. 530/700 to spares program) with additionally a reduced maintenance
effect attributable to the new wagons.
Signalling and Telecommunications
Radio Control System
8.        The substitution of the radio communications for the existing open-
wire system will have one major benefit; substantially improved reliability of
communications and, hence, reduction in the idle time of locomotives and
wagons due to management's inability to pass instructions along the line.  A
secondary, but unquantifiable benefit, will be improved managoritl efficiency
resulting from substantial elimination of time wasted in attempting to
establish contact.

Annex 7
Page 4 of 5
9.        Records show that, currently, on-line delay time is approximately 19
percent of operations time; that of the delay, approximately a quarter is
accounted for by poor communications and that the reliability of the
communication system will improve from the open-wire 85 percent (currently)
and anticipated 80 percent (in 10-15 years) to 99 percent by substitution of
the radio system. Thus, utilization of locomotives and rolling stock should
increase by an average of approximately five percent (4.43 percent rising to
5.64 percent) by the substitution of radio communications. Operational costs
for the existing and radio systems are approximately the same (somewhat higher
cost of materials, lower for labor) but elimination of open-wire will confer a
one-time benefit from the sale of copper wire, and a recurring benefit from
reduction of PTC charges.
Operational Facility Improvements
10.       Two sets of investments will result in increased locomotive and
wagon utilization; the radio control system previously analyzed and
operational facility improvements. These operaLions facilities comprise
workshops and track maintenance. As they both contribute to increased speed
of movement of trains, their benefits are analyzed jointly. The main features
are, however, separately described below.
i)   Movement of trains is inhibited by poor control facilities and
utilization by poor quality of maintenance, particularly of
locomotives and, hence, reliability after re-entering service. The
wagon monitoring control should enable managemet to keep track of
location of wagons and, with the assistance of the appropriate
computer program, identify abnormal delays and (hopefully) apply
remedies. This will apply primarily to wagon rotation, but to the
extent that mainline locomotives are idled through delays in the
makeup of trains, locomotive utilization should also be increased.
The improvements and additional equipment for the Kabwe workshops,
complemented by the (workshop) production planning control
facilities, should ensure that reliability of repair and servicing
is improved.
ii) Track renewal and maintenance equipment. About 25 km of track,
about half of it in the more heavily trafficked cooperbelt region,
is subject to speed restriction down to 17.5 kph. The spot renewal
program should substantially alleviate this problem, and the
potential effect is illustrated by the fact that a doubling of speed
in the affected sections (plus the deceleration/acceleration lead
in/lead out track portions) could enable the accelerated retirement
of about 60 wagons (one percent of total fleet), in addition to
those described under the wagon component analysis. These wagons
would be initially redundant under the low traffic growth scenario
(and would, thus, have a specific benefit confined to reduced
maintenance costs). However, under the high scenario, they would
probably be retained in use and enable the avoidance of temporary
hire of wagons particularly during the peak harvest season.
Allowing for this temporary hire characteristic and the lower than



- 68 -
Annex 7
Page 5 of 5
average quality of the wagons, the 60 wagons are valued at half
price (about US$20,000 each) to give a one-time benefit under the
high scenario of US$1.2 million. (The locomotive benefit from track
improvement--equivalent to about one-half locomotive--is ignored as
they are likely to be slightly in excess of strict requirements.)

FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past Financial Performance
Operating Results
1.        ZR's financial performance in the past has been erratic.  After
operating with annual net losses during the early 1970's, profits were
recorded from 1976 through 1980. During these latter years, the working ratio
averaged 78 percent. However, commencing in 1981 to date, losses have been
recorded ranging from Kwacha 6.0 million (1981) to Kwacha 19.1 million
(1984).  The major cause of this decline has been the lack of timely approval
by the Government of tariff increases to offset inflation. The result has
been an increase in amounts owing to creditors and a maximum bank overdraft.
Comparative operating statements are given in Table 1.
2.        During 1979, ZR received under CIDA (Canada) financing two traffic
costing experts to establish a new traffic costing unit to continually monitor
and update cost data for tariff and operational purposes. With the exception
of passen.-r fares, all tariffs are cost-based and the intention is that no
goods be carried at less than total cost. However, due to delays in
Government approval of increases, costs in recent years have risen above
tariffs by the date of their implementation. In regard to passenger fares, a
detailed analysis for FYBZ indicated that revenues covered only 63 percent of
the working expenses, 52 percent of total allocated costs, and approximately
85 percent of avoidable costs. Steps have been taken to improve this
situation, the most recent being a 25 percent increase in passenger fares
effective April 1984 (FY85). While important, the effect on total
profitability is not substantial as passenger revenues represent only 10
percent of total operating revenues.
Cash Flow
3.        The cash flow statements for FYBOu/FY84 are set out in Table L.
During FY82 and FY83, the cash flow remained positive despite declining
profitability primarily due to delayed payments to creditors. However, in
FYB4, the cash flow was negative in the amount of Kwacha 2.3 million despite
an increase in amounts owing to creditors of approximately Kwacha 14.0
million. The major reasons were the further decline in profitability, a
doubling of interest charges and the devaluation of the Kwac"ia.
Balance Sheets
4.        Comparative balance sheets are given in Table 3.  The decline in
profitability materially affected the liquidity of ZR. The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities declined from a satisfactory 2.5 (FY80) to O.B
(FY84). In FY84, amounts owing to creditors exceeded anounts due from debtors
by Kwacha 15.0 million. The debt/equity ratio increased from 36/64 (FY80) to
70/30 (FY84) as a result of both the losses and an increase in long-term
debt. The debt has increased due to further borrowings and as a result of the
devaluation of the Kwacha.

5.        The investment in subsidiary, as shown in the balance sheet,
represents the cost of shares purchased in Zambia Concrete, Limited (Kwacha
1.0 million) and amounts advanced for the construction of a concrete sleeper
plant. This company commenced operations during FY82. It is a wholly-owned
subsidiary. As shown in the operating statements, a provision for diminution
in value was charged to operations in FY82 through FY84. The audited accounts
of ZR contain the following note "in the opinion of the Board, the investment
is worth not less than the amount at which it is stated in the accounts".
6.        During the period 1964-1967, the railway system in Zambia was
operated by Rhodesia Railways (as the "iUnitary System"), which was owned
equally by Zambia and Rhodesia. Assets owned by the Unitary System, but
operated since 1967 by ZR, are considered to be still the property of the
Unitary System and are riot recorded in the accounts of ZR.  However, deprecia-
tion has been charged against operations to provide for their ultimate
replacement.
7.        In January 1970, as part of a capital reorganization, the GDZ
assigned to ZR its interest in loans to the Unitary System. The amount as of
FY84 is shown in the balance sheet at Kwacha 40.8 million. Discussions are
currently taking place between the two Governments with a view to dissolving
the Unitary System. It is likely that part of the amount due to ZR will be
settled by the transfer of fixed assets to ZR, some of which are already in
its custody and use (Para 6). Further adjustments in terms of cash or
liabilities may be necessary between the two countries.
8.        ZR has adopted the accounting policy of capitalizing in the cost of
Fixed assets the exchange losses arising from major devaluations of currencies
on borrowings for recent acquisitions. Unrealized exchange losses on lorng-
term borrowings are deferred and recognized in income over the period of the
repayment of the loans to which they relate. The amount of the deferred
exchange losses to March 31, 1984, are shown in the balance sheet at Kwacha
16.5 million.
B. Financial Recovery Program
Corporate Structure
9.        In December 1978, the Government announced that effective January 1,
1979, ownership of ZR would be transferred to the Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation Limited (ZIMCO). While in practice ZIMCO has acted as the holding
company, the necessary legal formalities were long delayed. The incorporation
of ZR under the Companies Act, as a private company, was completed on December
19, 1983, and operations under ZIMCO became effective in April 1984. This
will result in more autonomy for ZR including a cecrease in the time required
for tariff adjustments. It was agreed during negotiations that the amount of
Kwacha 116.5 million of long term debt plus accrued interest would be
capitalized.



- 73 -
Annex 8
Page 3 of 6
10.       Long-Term Debt.  The capitalization of part of the debt (para 9)
will broaden the equity base, improve profitability by reducing interest
expense, and improve the cash flow by reducing both interest expense and
principal repayments.
11.       Cost Savings.  ZR has, as a cost saving measure, reduced staff
numbers and effected reductions in administrative expenses. However,
inflation and devaluation have eroded the savings accomplished during FY83.
12.       Marketing.  Under the Third Railway Project, ZR retained Canadian
Pacific Railway as consultants to reorganize the marketing organization and to
train staff on the job. The new organization is now in place, and the
training completed as of February 1984.
C. Financial Forecasts
13.       The financial projections are prepared using a fixed monetary unit
(1984) under the following assumptions:
a) goods revenues are based on the traffic forecasts in Annex 2.
Passenger traffic, which has been increasing in recent years, is
projected at growth rate of five percent per annum. The tariff
structure used is the current one which includes increases
implemented in April 1984 (FY85);
b) salaries and wages are based on the actual costs for FY84;
c) most maintenance and running expenses are a function of traffic
carried. During the project period, traffic is not expected to
materially change, hence, maintenance expenses costs are
relatively constant. Wagon maintenance should decrease slightly
during FY86/ FY88 due to scrapping of 1,000 old units. Diesel
fuel, a direct function of locomotive kilometers, will increase
at about one percent per annum;
d) catering expense varies directly with passenger traffic;
e) as further investments will be required beyond the project
period to sustain ZR, these have been included in the years
1989- 1994 in the total amount of Kwacha 155.26 million;
f) the foreign costs of all investments are treated as long-term
debts repayable in 15 years after a grace period of 5 years,
with interest at 12 percent. Debt service payments are
calculated with fixed principal plus interest:
g) provision for depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated economic life of the assets;
h) all local costs are deemed to be paid from internally generated
funds;



- 74 -
Annex 8
Page 4 of 6
i) amounts owing to creditors will be reduced by 25 percent during
FY86; by a further 50 percent during FY87; and in subsequent years,
all amounts paid monthly;
j) the amount of Kwacha 109.5 million of principal owing by ZR to
the Government and included in the long term debt is capitalized as
equity, thus, reducing the annual interest expense and principal
repayments; and
k) a further tariff increase of 25 percent on passenger traffic and
20 percent on goods traffic effective in FY86.
D.  Projected Income Statement
14.       The tariff structure was revised and, effective April 1, 1984, the
tariffs were increased 25 percent on passenger traffic and an average of 15
percent on goods traffic. A projection using this rpvised tariff structure,
indicated that total revenues would not cover total costs including
depreciation and interest. As indicated in Para 13, the assumption has been
made that an amount of Kwacha 109.5 million owing to the Government is
capitalized, thus reducing the interest expense and principal repayments. As
a result of the foregoing, tariffs would still have to be revised upwards
effective during FY86 by a further amount as indicated in Para 13 (k). The
resultant projections show that ZR will earn profits during the projection
period. The projected income statement is given in Table 4.
E. Projected Cash Flow
15.       ZR entered FY85 with a bank overdraft of Kwacha 10.9 million and
creditors of Kwacha 42.3 million. Even with the tariff increases referred to
in Para 13, it will not be possible to reduce both the overdraft and
outstanding creditors immediately. The cash flow should be positive in all
years after FY85. The projected cash flow is given in Table 5.
16.       In order to safeguard ZR's cash flow during the period of implemen-
tation of the proposed project, it was agreed during negotiations that ZR
would not, without the prior approval of the Bank, undertake in any one year
investments beyond those included in the proposed project in excess of US$2.0
million equivalent.
17.       ZR should maintain a reasonable relationship between its operating
surplus and debt service requirements. During negotiations, it was agreed
that, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, ZR will not incur any debt if its
operating surplus for the fiscal year or the twelve consecutive months
immediately before the date of the occurrence, whichever is greater, would be
less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding
fiscal year.

Annex 8
Page 5 of 6
F. Projected Balance Sheets
18.       The projected balance sheets are given in Table 6.  Due to the
depressed tariffs in recent years and the consequent operating losses, the
projections start with current liabilities exceeding current assets by
approximately Kwacha 13.4 million. With the profits projected together with
positive cash flows, the liquidity improves during the project period. In
addition, the debt/equity ratio stabilizes at 54/46.
G. Future Financial Objectives
19.       The Third Railway Project called for the fixed assets to be revalued
at current replacement cost effective January 1, 1981 and annually thereafter,
and to achieve an annual rate of return on net fixed assets in use of eight
percent. The assets were revalued but the revaluation was not recorded in the
accounts as it was determined that this was contrary to Government's
regulations. As noted in Para 1 and shown in Table 1, the profitability of ZR
declined drastically in recent years due primarily to delayed tariff increases
to offset inflation. ZR has, effective April 1984 (FY85), taken steps to
return the railway to a sound financial base. However, it would be
unrealistic to assume that a 3-4 year shortfall can be redeemed immediately.
The Third Railway Project provided for the acquisition of a new computer, a
complete review of the accounting system, and the installation of a management
information system. The major thrust was to provide management with data on a
current basis. The existing system had deteriorated to the point that
financial information was nine months in arrears. In view of the adverse
liquidity position the emphasis during the implementation period should be
directed at attaining a satisfactory cash flow. For this reason it was
recommended that the existing rate of return covenant be changed to a cash
flow covenant. Accordingly it was agreed during negotiations that ZR, GOZ,
and ZIMCO take all measures appropriate to achieve revenues sufficient to
cover all working expenses (before depreciation), taxes, debt service charges
of principal and interest, and the 20% of the total investment program.
H. Impact of Inflation on ZR's Finances
20.       The projected cash flow is stated in constant 1984 values.  The
tariff structure has also been increased in the projections for the actual
increase implemented during April 1984 and for a required increase necessary
to insure a return to a profitable operation and a positive cash flow in all
years except FY85.
21.       The projections assume that tariffs will be increased at regular and
frequent intervals to offset the effect of inflation on working expenses. To
ensure that such action is taken on a timely basis, ZR, ZIMCO and GOZ should
review the tariff structure as it relates to most recent allocated traffic
costs and adjust the tariffs to conform with the cash flow requirement (Para
19).

Annex 8
Page 6 of 6
22.       If working expenses, provision for depreciation and debt service
charges are adjusted to reflect inflation, the required tariff adjustments to
increase revenue by an amount to cover the foregoing, and to provide an
adequate cash flow would be the following: 1986, 24 percent; 1987, 15 percent;
1986, 5 percent; and 1909, 10 percent.
23.       An analysis indicates that for the period 1986-1990, ZR would remain
at approximately a break-even point if goods traffic was reduced by four
percent. Revenues in total for the period would cover working expenses,
depreciation and interest expenses.
