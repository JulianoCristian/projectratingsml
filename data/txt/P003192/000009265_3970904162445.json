A radio\n            signalling and telecommunications system would be installed\n            to replace the outmoded \"open-wire\" system and\n            some modern operations facilities would be provided. Also\n            included are technical assistance (for critical operational\n            areas and for project implementation), training and studies\n            to improve efficiency.  A limited amount of new rolling\n            stock would be supplied under the project.  The project will\n            increase the operating efficiency of the railway in Zambia,\n            thereby lowering the cost of transporting goods within the\n            country as well as to and from the major ports handling the\n            country's imports and exports."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
