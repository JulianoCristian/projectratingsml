PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF FOURTH KARACHI PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        All Pakistan's imports and exports by sea (10.3 million tons in
1973) are handled through the port of Karachi, Pakistan's only major port.
The port is managed by Karachi Port Trust (KPT), which has received two
previous Bank Loans, 126-PAK for US$14.8 million in 1955 and 376-PAK for
US$17.0 million in 1964, and the proceeds of two Association Credits, S-9 PAX
for US$1.0 million in 1970 and Credit 422-PAK for US$18.0 million, in-
cluding the re-financing of S-9 PAK, in 1973. Credit 422-PAK, which
became effective in December 1973, will assist in financing additional
general cargo berths and reconstruction of the Napier Mole road bridge. KPT
has been responsible for the execution of these loans and credits and,
although execution of 376-PAK has been slow, KPT's performance has been
satisfactory. As the works are expected to be substantially completed
by the revised Closing Date of June 30, 1974, no further extension is
anticipated.
ii.       The three oil berths, one of which, built in 1910, is in a very
dilapidated condition, have very limited alongside depths of water, so that
imports of crude oil tend to be carried in small, old, tankers with low
discharge rates. A berthing accident could at any time destroy the dilapidated
berth, thus depriving the port of one-third of its present capacity for
berthing oil tankers with consequent serious disruption of Pakistan's imports
of crude oil and petroleum products.
iii.      A feasibility study undertaken by consultants, Frederic R. Harris
Inc. (USA) to determine the best solution for handling Pakistan's oil
traffic, reviewed a number of possibilities, including offshore solutions.
It recommended construction of a new oil berth on the East side of the
harbor entrance at Keamari, adjacent to existing installations.
iv.       Based on the consultant's recommendations as revised by Bank
staff following appraisal, the proposed project comprises, Part A, items
to be financed by the proposed credit - (a) construction of a new oil
berth No. 4 (O.P.4) capable of berthing 75,000 dwt tankers; (b) immediate
contract dredging of the approach channel to a depth of 37 ft; (c) purchase
of a dredger for maintaining and deepening the channel to 40 ft; (d) hose
handling equipment and common-user pipelines; and (e) consulting services for
supervision and technical assistance on dredger operation and maintenance;
and Part B, items to be undertaken by KPT and financed by them - (f) increas-
ing the alongside depth of one of the existing oil berths to 38 ft with the
present dredging fleet, and (g) deepening the approach channel from 37 ft to
40 ft depth with the dredger provided under Part A. The two parts of the
project are expected to be completed by September 1976 and June 1979,
respectively.
v.        The proposed credit of UJS$16.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of Part A of the project, the total estimated cost of which
is US$23.9 million. The local currency costs of the whole project, US$7.5



- ii -
million equivalent and the foreign exchange cost of Part B, US$0.4 million,
will be financed by KPT, who will also be responsible for the execution of
the project with the aid of consultants.
vi.       Contracts for major civil works, dredging in Part A of the
project and the dredger procurement would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Where appropriate, evaluation of bids
for civil works.will include a 7-1/2% domestic preference.
vii.      The proposed project would reduce the cost of imported crude
oil and is estimated to earn an economic return of 23%.
viii.     Although KPT's present financial situation is sound, implementation
of the proposed investment program will require considerable cash resourcae.
KPT has therefore agreed to maintain the financial rate of return on its
fixed assets at not less than 4% from 1976 to 1981 and 7% thereafter. KPT
has further undertaken not to incur additional long-term debt unless cash
revenue is at least 1.5 times the maximu- debt service requirement. To ensure
effective use of the oil berths, KPT will consider the introduction of time-
related berthing charges.
ix.       The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$16.0
million to the Government on the usual terms. The Government would relend
the proceeds of the credit to KPT for a term of 25 years, including a five-
year grace period, at the Bank interest rate current at the time of credit
approval.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Government)
has requested the Association's assistance in financing an oil berth and
deepening or the approach channel to handle larger tankers at Karachi. The
estimated total cost of the proposed project will be US$23.9 million of
which US$16.0 million would be financed by an Association credit; it is
based on studies made by consultants appointed for this purpose and financed
under Credit S-9 PAK. The proposed credit would be made to the Government
and would be relent to Karachi Port Trust (KPT) at the Bank interest rate
at the time the credit is approved, for a period of 25 years including a
five-year grace period.
1.02      KPT has received two Bank loans - 126-PAK for US$14.8 million
(1955) and 376-PAK for US$17.0 million (1964) and two credits - S-9 PAK
for US$1.0 million (1970), and 422-PAK for US$18.0 million (1973). After
some problems with KPT's supervision of the first loan completed in 1962,
its performance has been satisfactory. The closing date for Loan 376-PAK,
twice extended due to foundation problems and Indo-Pakistan hostilities,
is now June 30, 1974; disbursement as at March 31, 1974 was US$14.9 million.
Firnal disbursement of Credit S-9 PAK was US$637,000 and it has now been re-
financed in Credit 422-PAK, under which four additional cargo berths and
replacement of the Napier Mole road bridge will also be financed.
1.03      Other loans/credits for the transport sector in Pakistan have
included three for highways, six for railways, including three made in the
1950's which were joint loans for Pakistan Eastern and Western Railways,
and four for pipelines. One highway loan was cancelled in July 1971 be-
cause bids received were greatly in excess of original estimates. All
other loans have progressed satisfactorily.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
composed of Y. Akatsuka (engineer), J. Burns (financial analyst),
F. Higginbottom (engineer) and R. H. Roberts (economist) which visited
Pakistan in August 1973 and on a report by consultants, Frederic R. Harris,
Inc. (USA).
II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Pakistan covers an area of about 300,000 square miles; it
is crossed by five great rivers - the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and
Sutlej which, after their confluence, flow as the Indus southwestward
to the sea. These rivers occasionally overflow their banks and the floods
cause serious disruption of transport and the economy, as happened in 1973.
2.02      The population is about 64 million, about 70% of whom live in
rural areas. Some 50% of the urban population lives in the five principal
cities of Rawalpindi, Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore and Lyallpur. The popu-
lation is believed to be increasing at a rate of about 2.9% p.a.; the



- 2-
increase in urban areas is about 4.6% because of migration from the country-
side.
2.03      The economy is primarily rural, with about one-third of the
Gross National Product (GNP) stemming from agriculture, fishing and
forestry. Transport and communications account for about 7% of GNP.
Principal agricultural exports include rice, cotton and oil seeds which
move by rail from the producing areas to the country's sole deep sea port of
Karachi. Cement produced in Hyderabad is also exported through Karachi.
Petroleum and petroleum products are the largest single imported commodity.
Other imports, besides general cargo, include iron and steel, wheat, and
fertilizers.
2.04      Average annual per capita income in 1972 is estimated at less
than US$125. In the 1960's the economy maintained a growth of about 6%
p.a. However, as a result of the loss of the East Wing in 1971, and the
hostilities with India, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices
was practically unchanged in 1971-72. Labor unrest combined with inflation
and an uncertain business outlook resulted in a substantial drop in private
sector investment. In May 1972, Pakistan devalued the official Rupee rate
of exchange from PRs 4.76 to the US dollar to PRs 11.00 and considerably
liberalized import regulations (subsequent 10% devaluation .of the US
dollar changed the rate to PRe 9.90 to the dollar). These measures,
combined with vigorous and successful efforts to find alternative export
markets for products previously shipped to the East Wing, and assisted
by a good cotton crop, firm commodity prices, and a return to industrial
peace, have stabilized the economy and provided a base for a resumption
of economic growth. The 1S13 floods have again set back the economy but
recovery from the immediate difficulties appears to have been swift.
B.   The Petroleum Sector
2.05      About 15% (500,000 tons p.a.) nf Pakistan's present crude oil
requirements is supplied by domestic oil fields in the vicinity of Rawalpindi.
Development of these fields and new discoveries are adding only enough to
reserves to maintain the current production rate. Consequently, in the
absence of any significant new discoveries, the proportion of Pakistan's
crude oil requirements supplied by imports will continue to increase with
the demand for petroleum products.
2.06      Imported crude oil is refined at the refineries of Pakistan
Refinery Ltd. (PRL), owned by major foreign oil companies, and National
Refinery Ltd. (NRL), a Government-owned company, both located at Korangi,
five miles east of Karachi (Map 10170R). PRL's crude oil intake capacity
is 2.6 million tons p.a., and NRL's 0.6 million tons. Domestically
produced crude oil is refined at the Attock Oil Co., Ltd. (AOC) refinery,
at Rawalpindi, which has a capacity of 0.5 million tons p.a. Between them,
they provide a yield of refined products wnich meets most of Pakistan's
present requirements of middle aistillates but which, because of limitations
imposed by existing equipment and technology, produces fuel oil and naphtha
in excess of domestic requirements. PRL plans to add facilities at its



- 3 -
refinery to reduce the yield of fuel oil and increase that of middle
distillates, but strict limits on the degree of flexibility in yield patterns
will remain, and a continuing imbalance can be expected between refinery yields
and product demand. This implies a continuing need to import and export
substantial volumes of refined products, which amounted to 187,000 tons and
708,000 tons respectively in 1972.
2.07      The Government has approved plans for the expansion of NRL's
refinery to a capacity of two million tons a year by about 1976, and is
negotiating with the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Romania for technical
and financial assistance. Failing such expansion, imports of middle
distillates would exceed one million tons by 1976.
2.08      The Government plans construction of a new two million ton
capacity refinery at Multan (Map 10756) for about 1977; it will use
imported crude oil, and a pipeline from the coast is included in the
plans. The project will be a joint venture between the Governments of
Pakistan and Abu Dhabi, and will be operated by NRL. The refinery will
be designed to minimize the yield of low-value fuel oil, which could not
be economically exported, because of the refinery's distance from the port.
2.09      Consumption of fuel oil has been declining since 1966, because
of Pakistan Western Railways' dieselization program, and a switch of large
industrial energy consumers to natural gas. In view of the large surplus
of fuel oil, exported at a very small net benefit to the Pakistan economy,
the Government is now encouraging large industrial consumers located near
refineries, such as Karachi Electric Supply Company, to switch back to
using fuel oil. The effectiveness of this policy will be strenlthened by
a recent increase, effective August 1973, in Sui Northern Gas Pipelines'
tariff for natural gas.
C.   The Transport Sector
2.10      All forms of transport, ranging from camel train to jet aircraft,
are represented in Pakistan. The main traffic flows are between the
thickly populated area in the northeast, with Lahore as the center, and
the port and industrial area of Karachi some 700 miles away; west to the
industrial and agricultural areas around Lyallpur, Sargodha, and Khushab;
and northwest to the administrative centers in Rawalpindi and Islamabad,
and to Peshawar and the Afghan border bey ad. All these main routes are
served by rail, road and air transport and by a natural gas pipeline system
based on the Sui and Mari fields (Map 10756). Public expenditures in
the transport sector are being devoted increasingly to highways, which will
take about 53% of the total of PRs 446 million in FY 1973.  This pattern
is expected to continue for at least the next five years.
2.11      Karachi is Pakistan's only major port and handles all its foreign
trade.  The total of imports and exports has grown from 5.8 million tons in
1964 to 10.3 million tons in 1973.  The port is intensively used, with a
berth occupancy factor of almost 100%, achieved through double banking of
ships and at the expense of substantial ship waiting time. Each of the 19
deep-water dry cargo berths in use handled about 270,000 tons of dry cargo



- 4-
in 1973, one of the highest throughput rates in the world. This was achieved
with the aid of lightering from double banked ships. Throughput at the three
oil berths averaged 1.4 million tons per berth in 1973.
2.12      Pakistan's merchant marine in 1972 consisted of some 57 vessels,
about 600,000 dwt, which carried about 8% of the country's overseas trade
(15% if petroleum is excluded); the National Shipping Corporation (NSC)
accounted for about half the ships and 75% of the goods carried; except in
1971-72, its operations have been profitable.
2.13      Pakistan Western Railways (PWR) is Government-owned and operated
and constitutes one of the largest organizations in the country. For many
years the railways provided the main means of mechanized transport; how-
ever, an increasing proportion of transport is being carried by road, and
railway traffic has shown little overall growth; freight traffic in ton-
miles is now divided about equally between road and rail. PWR's operations
were studied in 1970/71 by consultants, SOFRERAIL (France), under Loan 621-PAX,
who made recommendations for improvements. SOFRERAIL are being retained
by PWR to assist in the implementation of the recommendations.
2.14      Motorized road traffic is growing at about 10% a year and is the
principal means of transport in urban areas. While truck transport has
been free of significant Government regulation for more than a decade,
bus regulation was liberalized only in 1970. Since then there has been an
increase in the number of buses in operation and a substantial improvement
in service. Animal-drawn traffic remains inportant in rural areas. The
overall condition of the road system ranges from fair to poor; total
length is about 48,000 miles, of which about 33,000 miles are unimproved.
2.15      Air transport is provided by the Government-owned Pakistan Inter-
national Airlines which operates international and domestic services. The
number of passengers carried on West Pakistan domestic routes showed an
average annual growth rate of 11% from 1962-1971. However, the loss of
East Pakistan caused serious disruption of services.
D.   Transport Planning
2.16      Problems of transport coordination which require attention include
the operation of many rail, bus and air services at less than long-run
marginal cost, which results in misallocation of resources. A Government
study carried out in 1971, with the help of individual consultants financed
under the Second Highway Loan 578-PAK, reviewed transport coordination in
Pakistan and recommended establishment of a permanent institution for planning
and coordinating trar.sporc. The loan conditions require the Government-to
consult with the Association on implementation of its findings. The
Government has recently asked an expert to review the study's findings;
following evaluation of this expert's recommendations, the Association
intends to ask the Government to disc.ss concrete steps for achieving
effective planning and management of the transport sector.
2.17      Referring to port planning ia particular, the latest traffic trends
indicate a need for additional general cargo berths by 1979. This will



- 5 -
require development of the Western Backwater area of the port (Map 10171R1);
alternative sites have been considered but cannot be developed in time. A
feasibility study has recently been completed by consultants, van Houten
Associates (USA), with UNDP financing and the Bank as executing agency, which
indicated the Western Backwater could also be used for deep drafted bulk carriers
of dry cargo, e.g., iron ore. However, the Government is considering the
desirability of developing alternative port facilities to Karachi for such
traffic, and the most promising location is at Phitti Creek (Port Qasim)
some 10 miles east of Karachi. The Asian Development Bank has indicated an
interest in financial assistance for a port project at that site. A site
at Sonmiani 50 miles northwest of Karachi is also being considered. The
feasibility of development at Phitti Creek depends upon the possibility of
maintaining a dredged channel 40 ft deep or more through the bar at the creek
entrance. Attempts are now being made to ascertain whether this is feasible.
The Government has agreed to undertake a proper evaluation of the technical
and economic factors relevant to a determination of the best alternative for
handling deep-draft bulk carriers. If the findings of the investigation
are favorable, bulk cargo and petroleum facilities could be completed at
Phitti Creek by about 1980. Whatever may be the outcome, interim measures
to handle growing oil importation requirements must be provided, and this is
the purpose of the proposed project.
III. THE PORT OF KARACHI
A.   Organization and Administration
3.01      While the port of Karachi has been efficiently managed and
operated, certain improvements in management, administration and operations
are being introduced and others proposed (paras 3.04, and 3.12).
3.02      The Karachi Port Trust Act of 1886, and its subsequent modifica-
tions, created a Board called "The Trustees of the Port of Karachi",
commonly known as the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). Section 79A of the Act
subjects all acts and proceedings of the Board to the control of the
Government.
3.03       ne Board is a body corporate with perpetual succession and is
vested with the property of the port. It consists of eleven trustees
representing shipowners, shippers, labor and the Government. The Chairman,
who is also a Trustee and Chief Executive of the port, is appointed by the
Government. He is responsible for day-to-day administration and operations
and for carrying out the general policy of the Board; his term of office
is for such period as the Government may prescribe, but is normally for
three years. The Trustees have a two-year term.
3.04      KPT has five functional departments assisted by service groups
and a secretariat. Of the service departments, the most important are
Accounting and Stores.  The accounting problems related to these departments
have been studied by management consultants retained under Credit S-9 PAK
and KPT has agreed that a new management and cost accounting system will be



implemented by June 30, 1975. KPT has further agreed that changes in the
organizational structure to ensure continuity in management and effective
coordination of administration and operations will also be effected by
June 30, 1975.
3.05      KPT has legal jurisdiction over the land, water and facilities
within the port boundaries, and powers which enable it to manage and operate
the port and waterways efficiently; to maintain, improve and regulate their
use; to provide terminal facilities for ships, cargo and passengers; and to
establish its rates and dues. The port area, including the Western Back-
water, is sufficiently extensive to meet all foreseeable future needs for
expansion if better solutions at other locations cannot be found.
3.06      The Board has far-reaching powers and, subject to the overriding
authority of the Government, may raise money, enter into contracts, alter
tariffs, buy equipment, undertake construction and sell assets. There has
been no Government interference in the Board's exercise of these powers,
which have been used prudently and to the benefit of the port and its
users.
B.   Staff and Labor
3.07      Sound procedures set up over many years are in operation for the
recruitment, promotion, welfare and discipline of KPT staff. KPT has had
difficulty in attracting and retaining high-caliber staff because it is
unable to offer salaries competitive with the private sector, although
such fringe benefits as housing, medical care, school and other welfare
benefits help. The Government has recently introduced new pay scales
for Government employees based on the National Pay Commission's Report
of December 1972 which should improve the situation.
3.08      Labor relations have been good, but recently have shown some
signs of deterioration. However, procedures for settling disputes are
sound and the port has been remarkably free from strikes. The total
strength of the establishment, including officers and supervisory staff,
is 10,100, and the average number of hourly employees has been about
1,700.
3.09      While KPT has a larger labor force than many similar ports in
developed countries, this reflects in part the use of labor-intensive
lighterage for a substantial volume of cargo, through which it achieves a
high cargo throughput per berth. Moreover, in view of high unemployment in
Pakistan, labor unrest in Karachi, and the strength of the labor unions, it
would be difficult to effect any reduction of the present labor force.
Therefore, although labor productivity might be improved, measures designed
to achieve this, such as increased mechanization, can only be introduced
gradually and to the extent that they are economically justified.
C.   Port Facilities
3.10      The three-mile approach channel to Karachi has a limiting depth
of 29 ft. The mean tidal range is about 7 ft, so that ships drawing 33 ft



- 7 -
(25,000 dwt) can enter port on any day of the year. The port entrance is
protected by the Manora breakwater and the Keamari groyne from which a
channel, about 1,100 ft wide, 34 ft deep and about two miles in length, leads
to the berths at East and West Wharves. There are 17 berths at East Wharf,
all reconstructed under Bank loans and seven at West Wharf, including three new
berths provided under Loan 376-PAK. The dry cargo berths are adequately
provided with transit sheds, open storage areas, electric portal cranes and
other cargo-handling equipment. Four additional general cargo berths are
being financed under Credit 422-PAK.
3.11      Oil traffic is presently handled in the lower harbor at three
berths connected by pipelines to tank farms at Keamari. One of these
berths, O.P.3, built in 1910, is in a dilapidated condition. Maintenance
of the structures of the other two berths is poor and KPT has undertaken to
remedy the position. Further details of the port facilities, ancillary
services, plant and floating craft are given in Annex 1.
D.   Dredging
3.12      KPT carries out maintenance dredging of the navigation channel
and alongside wharves with its own fleet of dredgers and barges. The overall
hydraulic regime of the harbor is continuously studied with the aid of a
model set up with assistance from the Hydraulic Research Station, Wallingford
(Ul). The quantities dredged in recent years have been increasing due to
some deepening and in 1973 amounted to over 1.5 million cu yd. However,
dredging carried out under the Second Karachi Port Project has taken much
longer than expected and this appears to stem in part from poor fleet manage-
ment and in part from poor dredging techniques. Technical assistance to
review dredging operations of the existing fleet and improve performance,
utilization of plant and managerial control is provided for in Credit 422-PAK.
Following from this the fleet's working hours may be substantially increased.
E.   Operations
3.13      The port normally works round the clock on a two-shift basis, and
on weekends and holidays as required. Stevedoring on board ship is performed
by private contractors but KPT personnel handle goods on shore and operate
the cargo-handling equipment.
3.14      All berths in the harbor are served by road and rail.  About 60%
of the port's traffic is transported by rail and the rest is moved by road
mainly to and from points in the Karachi area.
3.15      Congestion  at the dry cargo berths continues despite the commis-
sioning of four reconstructed berths in 1973. Average waiting time for each
of the six months to June 1973 was more than five days per ship, compared
with less than three days for the corresponding period in 1972. Recent
shipping reports indicate a waiting time of 12 to 15 days for a clear berth
and three to four days for a double-banked berth, i.e., where ships are
moored alongside one another. This situation is likely to continue for some
time, since considerable quantities of grain, fertilizers and other goods
will be required to replace the losses incurred in the August 1973 floods.



The completion of four dry cargo berths in December 1976 (Third Karachi
Port Project) should lead to some improvement, but if dry cargo traffic
growth continues, additional berths will be required.
3.16      Operations at the oil berths are slow and berth occupancy ex-
cessive, due to the 31 ft alongside depth limitation which only permits the
use of small, old tankers with poor pumping performance.
IV. INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A.   Investment Program
4.01      For the period 1974-79, KPT's investment program (Table 1) totals
about PRs 983.1 million (US$99.3 million) for new major works, including
the proposed project and development of the Western Backwater for six
additional general cargo berths and including PRs 132.0 million (US$13.3
million) for mechanical and floating equipment and minor works.
B.  Description of the Project (Maps 10171R1 and 8129)
4.02      The proposed project comprises:
Part A Items financed by the proposed credit:
(a)  Construction of an Oil Berth at Keamari and Installation of
Navigational Aids
{i)    a loading platform, two breasting dolphins, four
mooring dolphins capable of accommodating 75,000 dwt
oil tankers; causeway, walkways, and ancillary works.
(ii)    provision of hose handling equipment and common
user pipe-lines on the loading platform and causeway;
(iii)    navigational aids, including buoys and radar beacons;
(iv)    floating collars to contain spillage, and appropriate
means of disposing thereof; and
(v)    dredging alongs .-e the new berth to 44 ft depth for
45,000 dwt tanKers at all states of the tide.
(b)  Contract Dreding
(i)    the existing app ,jach channel to the oil berths
about 5,600 yd long, and 200 yd wide to 37 ft
depth (about 40,000 dwt tankers); and
(ii)    dredging a test section of the approach channel
to 45 ft depth.



- 9-
(c) Purchase of a Dredger
Purchase of an ocean-going trailing suction dredger
with 2,000 m3 hopper capacity fitted with a swell
compensator.
(d) Consultants' Services
(i)    supervision of civil works and installation of
navigational aids, and dredging of the approach
channel;
(ii)    naval architects' services for the specification
and inspection during building of the trailing
suction dredger; and
(iii)    technical assistance to KPT for training of local
staff in operating the new dredger and for
evaluating the results of the test dredging.
Part B Items not financed by the credit:
(a) Deepening the approach channel from 37 ft to 40 ft
depth (45,000 dwt tankers) with the dredger provided
under Part A.
(b) Deepening alongside the existing 0.P.1 to 38 ft depth
by KPT's existing dredging fleet to enable 35,000 dwt
tankers to be berthed at all states of the tide.
Details of the project are given in Anne, 2.
4.03      The oil berth and approach channel depth have been the subject
of a feasibility and preliminary engineering study financed under
Credit S-9 PAK and undertaken by consultants, Frederic R. Harris, Inc.
(USA), which recommended the oil berth as described above and immediate
deepening of the approach channel to 40 ft. However, the Association's
economic evaluation (Chapter V) indicates that immediate contract dredging
to 37 ft depth and purchase of a 2,000 m3 dredger for KPT adequate to
maintain the channel and deepen it to 40 ft over a period of about three
years (1976-1979) is a better solution. KPT has agreed to operate this dredger
at maximum output to provide channel depth of 40 ft by June 1979. Detailed
engineering of the berth is being financed under Credit S-9 PAK (refinanced
in Credit 422-PAK), and has been practically completed.
4.04      In order to eventually accommodate 75,000 dwt tankers alongside
the new berth, the approach channel will have to be further dredged to
45 ft depth; the feasibility of maintaining such a channel will be tested
by dredging a 2,000 ft long section of the proposed channel to that depth
(about 360,000 cu yd).



- 10 -
4.05      Existing O.P.1 has been designed to accommodate 35,000 dwt
tankers, but has not yet been dredged alongside to the required depth
(38 ft). It is proposed that this dredging should be undertaken at the
same time as the approach channel is being deepened, but because the bertl
will be in regular use, it would be uneconomic to include it as part of a
dredging contract; KPT can do this work with its existing fleet. KPT has
agreed to operate its existing dredging fleet to such extent and for such
periods as would be necessary to ensure that O.P.I. is available at 38 ft depth
not later than September 1976.
C. Proect Cost Estimates
4.06      The total estimated cost of the project is PRs 236.5 million
(US$23.9 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of PRs 162.0
million (US$16.4 million equivalent) of which PRs 158.4 million (US$16.0
million equivalent) would be financed by the proposed credit; the percent-
age of foreign exchange cost is about 60% for civil works and about 80%
for dredging and the procurement of the dredger. Foreign exchange for
Part B works is estimated to be about 25%. The project's local currency
cost, PRs 74.5 million, and the foreign exchange required for Part B of
the project, PRs 3.6 million (US$0.36 million equivalent), will be financed
by KPT. Details of the cost estimates are in Table 2, and are summarized
below:

4.07      For Part A of the proposed project, the cost estimates for civil
works are based upon final design and updated unit prices for similar
works in Pakistan and those for dredging and procurement of the dredger are
based on current world prices; they are considered adequate. Physical
contingencies are 10% for civil works and the hose handling equipment; price
contingencies are based upon 18%, 15% and 12% p.a.- for 1974, 1975 and 1976
respectively for foreign exchange cost and about 25% p.a. for local costs,
to cover increases from end-1973. The cost of imported items includes
customs duties as a local cost; port dues are not levied and are therefore
excluded. Part B costs are based on operating and maintenance costs of the
dredger; the foreign exchange cost comprises mainly fuel and spares; con-
tingency allowances as for Part A have been included.
D.   Project Execution
4.08      The project will be carried out by KPT with the assistance of
consultants.
E.   Consulting Services
4.09      Detailed engineering of the oil berth has been undertaken by
Frederic R. Harris, Inc. (USA), who will also supervise these works. Con-
sultants will be appointed by KPT (i) to undertake the required surveys,
to determine the quantities of dredging and to ensure satisfactory completion
of the dredging and (ii) to prepare an outline specification of the dredger,
to assess bid designs received and to inspect the dredger during building.
Technical assistance to train KPT staff in operating the dredger, which is
a type new to the KPT fleet, and to evaluate test dredging results, is also
included.
F.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.10      The contracts for civil works, equipment, dredging, except for the
dredging to be carried out by KPT's own dredgers provided for under Part B
of the project, and procurement of the dredger will be on the basis of
international conpetitive bidding in accordance with the Association's
guidelines for procurement. Evaluation of bids for civil works will include
a 7-1/2% preference for eligible domestic contractors. For Part A of the
Project all works and procurement are expected to be completed by September
1976, assuming effectiveness of the proposed credit by June 1974. Construction
schedules are in Table 3. The Part B works will be completed over the
period 1976-1979.
4.11      Disbursements for civil works and contract dredging financed by
the credit will be on the basis of 100% of direct foreign exchange costs
and 15% of local costs, representing :he estimated indirect foreign exchange
component.  For the procurement of goods, equipment and consultant services,
financing will be on t.he basis of the actual foreign exchange costs. Annual
estimated project expenditure is shown in Table 4 and the estimated schedule
of disbursements for the proposed credit in Table 5.

by KPT over a'considerable period without detrimental effects on the ecology.
The provision of floating collars for containing any spillage and means of
removing it are included in the project; KPT has agreed to use the collars
each time a tanker is handled at the berths and the disposal equipment as
necessary. Tanks are to be provided for dirty ballast discharge (para 4.13).
H. Existing Oil Tankage and Piping Arrangements and Required Improvements
4.13      Both PRL and NRL have existing tank storage at Keamari with
connections0to their individual refineries, but these would be inadequate
to handle the increased size of tanker foreseen on completion of the proposed
project and improvement to O.P.1. These companies have submitted proposals
to KPT for improvements to tankage capacity and pipelines, including continua-
tion of the common user pipelines from the port boundary, which are satis-
factory to the Associatibn. The Government has agreed that arrangements
to carry out the scheme of improvement would be submitted through KPT to the
Association not later than June 1975 and that, in the event the refinery
companies did not undertake the necessary work, the Government would take
such action as would be necessary to ensure completion of the required works
by September 1976. The improvements include the provision of tanks for
discharge of dirty ballast by tankers and necessary piping.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.  General
5.01      The dilapidated condition of O.P.3 makes its replacement a matter
of urgency. A berthing accident could, at any time, destroy the pier, thus
depriving the port of one-third of its present capacity for berthing oil
tankers. Since the number of tankers calling at the port is, in any case,
approaching the capacity of the three existing oil berths, the loss of one
of these would immediately result in serious ship delays and a rapidly
escalating cost to the Pakistan economy in the form of demurrage fees and
higher freight charges, as well as shortage of petiroleum products, with
far-reaching consequences for the energy sector and the economy. To
minimize this danger, only smaller tankers are presently being berthed at
O.P. 3, with consequent delays to others. In these circumstances, to do
nothing is not a feasible alternative, and the economic evaluation is based
on a comparison of the proposed project against the minimum cost alternative
of replacing O.P.3 with a similar facility. While this would minimize the
initial investment, it would necessitate construction of additional piers
by about 1978 and 1983, and would not yield the benefits to be derived from
use of larger tankers.
B.   Traffic Forecast
5.02      Crude oil imports in 1973 through the port of Karachi totalled
3.4 million tons and imports and exports of refined petroleum products a
further 0.9 million tons.



* 14 -
5.03      Consumption of petroleum products in Pakistan increased over the
period 1962-72 at an average annual rate of 5.6% (Table 6). The growth
rate varies substantially from product to product and from year to year,
making projection on the basis of these data difficult. However, consumption
of middle distillates, the principal product, increased fairly consistently
over the period 1962-70 at 9.7% p.a., two percentage points faster than
the growth of GDP over the same period. Following a period of relative
stagnation in 1971 and 1972 GDP has resumed its growth and is expected to
increase at about 7% p.a. over the next few years. Taking account of
expected petroleum product price increases, consumption of middle-distillates
is forecast to increase at 8% p.a., only one percentage point faster than
forecast GDP (Table 7).
5.04      The projected demand for middle distillates determines,the volume
of crude oil requirements,'and the pattern ef refinery yields determines
the volume of other products which will be manufactured from the forecast
crude oil intake. The forecast of demand for products other than middle
distillates is thereforesused only to determine the surplus or deficit
of products which has to be exported or imported. The projected growth in
consumption of light distillates and heavy fuel oil (Table 7) corresponds
with oil industry estimates. Since industry estimates were not available
for asphalt, lubricants and greases, the projections for these commodities
were based on past statistics and expected end-use demand. The forecast
assumes that the escalating cost of crude oil will have only a marginal
impact on consumption and that balance of payments considerations will not
result in Government action to restrict imports. Full details of the
forecasting methodology are contained in Annex 4.
C.   Project Scope
5.05      Numerous alternatives to the proposed project were considered by
the consultants for the project, including provision of offshore berths and
moorings, but the choice was ultimately narrowed to alternative sizes of
pier at the proposed site, and alternative depths of channel.
5.06      Tankers of 75,000 dwt, which the proposed pier would be capable
of handling, are about the maximum economic size for the short voyage from
the Persian Gulf and for the forecast volumes of crude oil. The cost of
such a pier is only about 10% more than that of a pier for 25,000 dwt
tankers, and provides more than three times the potential capacity.
5.07      To permit the entry of 75,000 dwt tankers, the approach channel
would require dredging to 45 ft. Present hydraulic data is insufficient
to determine with reasonable accuracy the annual cost of maintaining such
a channel; however, the best present estimates suggest that it would be
a less economic investment, at the forecast volumes of crude oil, than a
40 ft channel (Table 8). This uncertainty does not affect the validity of
the decision to construct a 75,000 dwt pier, which is the least-cost method,
at any positive discount rate, of providing capacity for the forecast through-
put of crude oil.



- 15 -
5.08      Channel deepening can be undertaken either by contract or by KPT
purchasing a suitable dredger. Contract dredging would achieve the desired
channel depth more quickly and would, therefore, reduce transportation costs,
through use of larger tankers, more quickly. However, purchase of a dredger
would, in any case, be necessary to maintain the resulting channel depth
and such a dredger would be capable, given sufficient time, of dredging the
present channel to a depth of 40 ft, thus avoiding the cost of contract
dredging. These trade-offs were calculated for channel depths from 34 ft
(35,000 dwt tanker) to 40 ft (45,000 dwt tanker) from which it was deter-
mined that the proposed project, with contract dredging to 37 ft (40,000 dwt
tanker) depth and a dredger capable of further deepening the channel to
at least 40 ft in about three years (Annex 3), provided the optimum solution.
All three sizes of tankers can be unloaded in approximately the same time.
The costs and benefits of the principal alternatives considered are shown
in Table 8. The proposed project will provide sufficient berthing capacity
to handle the forecast traffic until about 1981. It has the added advantage
of leaving the option of further channel deepening open until the results
of the proposed test dredging in the approach channel and the possibilities
of development at Phitti Creek are known.
D.   Economic Benefits
5.09      The economic benefits of the proposed oil pier and channel deepening
are derived from a comparison of tanker operating costs with 25,000 dwt tankers
and those with 35,000 dwt and 45,000 dwt tankers (Table 9). The benefits are
calculated on the reasonable assumption that limited availability of
45,000 dwt tankers would restrict their use to 50% of total crude oil
imports. The full project cost3 and benefits are shown in Table 10.
5.10      The economic benefits of channel deepening are calculated on the
assumption that the rate of siltation in a 37 ft to 40 ft channel will be
between 0.7 and one million cu yd per annum. Three separate consultants
who gave this as the most probable estimate, state that, given the uncertain-
ty of this type of assessment, the figure might be higher or lower; if it
is 30% higher, a 40 ft depth would take about 4-1/2 years to achieve instead
of three years; this would reduce the economic benefits by about US$200,000.
5.11      As noted in para 5.06, the proposed oil pier would only cost about
10% more than a pier designed to accommodate 25,000 dwt tankers. However, its
construction will mean that the cost of two piers for 25,000 dwt tankers,
which would otherwise have to be built in 1975 and 1977, is avoided. This
avoided cost is included as a benefit of the project. In addition, if deep-
ening of the entrance channel to 45 ft proves to be feasible, the proposed
pier would avoid the cost of a third 25,000 dwt pier in 1983. This has not
been taken as a benefit in view of the uncertain feasibility.



E.   Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.12      The economic analysis comparing the benefits discussed above with
the capital costs, including engineering services and physical contingencies,
produces an internal economic return of 23%.
5.13      The economic return as calculated is sensitive only to variation
in project benefits, a 25% decrease in benefits reducing the return on the
project to 14%. With a rate of siltation 30% higher than estimated, the
rate of return would not be significantly affected.
5.14      A 25% increase in capital costs would only reduce the return on
the project to 20%. A 15% increase in project costs plus a 25% decrease in
project benefits would reduce the return to 12%.
5.15      NSC has plans to acquire a 45,000 dwt tanker for service to Karachi.
Ahis, and other possible acquisitions and charterings of larger tankers by
Pakistan shipping companies, would ensure that a significant part of the
benefits of a deeper channel would accrue to the Pakistan economy. Further-
more, in order that Pakistan may recoup, unequivocally and as soon as the
project becomes operational an adequate proportion of those project benefits
accruing to foreign shipowners, the pricing of port services will be such
as to recover the project costs together with a reasonable return on the
invested capital, as required under Credit 422-PAK (paras 6.03 and 6.19).
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Tariffs
6.01      The level of charges levied in the past has been adequate for
all requirements.  In June 19733 She  r--nment approved KPT's application
for increases in rates a--- charg_, des!6ned to meet the impact of the May
1972 devaluation of the Rupee.
6.02      Wharfage and storage char-es are levied on the owner of the cargo,
and berthage, mooring, cr_nage, water supply and pilotage charges on the
shipowner.  Wharfage and storage charges represent the main income of the
port, about two-thirds of its tot.  operating revenue.
6.03      A review of the entire ->arif± structure will be undertaken, before
June 30, 1975, by KPT with ,le a,sistance of' consultants provided under
Credit S-9.  The introduction o^ ca:ras related to berth occupancy time, to

B.   Present Accounting System and Past Earnings
6.04      KPT's accounting system, which has many disadvantages, has not been
changed very much over the past thirty years. However, as result of recommen-
dations made under a study financed by Credit S-9 PAK, a new management
accounting and costing system is being introduced which is scheduled to be in
operation by June 30, 1975. Past earnings have been sufficient to provide
a satisfactory return on net fixed assets. The present financial position
is sound.
6.05      Income and expenditure for the years 1969 through 1973 are shown
in Table 11, from which it will be seen that debt service coverage has been
adequate and operating ratios satisfactory, falling from 77 in 1971 to 68
in 1973. Apart from 1971 when it was 4.9%, the return on net fixed assets
has exceeded 6%.
6.06      The balance sheet as at June 30, 1973 is attached as Table 12.  As
provided by the Karachi Port Trust Act of 1886, reserves amounting to PRs 253.0
million are invested in Government and municipal securities. Of these invest-
ments, PRs 228.0 million would be available for financing the project but
those for the provident and other welfare funds, totalling PRs 35.0 million,
would not. Cash amounting to about PRs 75.0 million is held in fixed depcsit
accounts in various banks. Investments and cash on fixed bank deposits for
the sinking fund amount to PRs 139.0 million against the outstanding long-
term debt of PRs 259.0 million. The debt/equity ratio is 24/76 and the cur-
rent ratio stands at 5.5 to 1.
6.07      By Government directive, a revenue reserve fund is kept at
two-thirds of the average revenue of the past three years; this reserve,
at June 30, 1973, stood at PRs 66.0 million with invested funds totalling
PRs 53.0 million.
C.   Financial Forecasts
6.08      The underlying financial position up to 1981, though showing some
signs of deterioration, is sound. Thereafter, much will depend on the
extent to which the Western Backwater is developed. Should the construction
of six berths be undertaken, then an overall tariff increase of 15% would
be necessary in 1982 to maintain the required rate of return on net fixed
assets of 7% from 1982 onwards (para 6.22).
6.09      Earnings expected to be attained during the period 1974-1983 are
given in Table 13. Operating revenues are calculated on the basis of KPT's
current tariffs up to 1981 but include the 15% increase thereafter. Dry
cargo traffic volumes are assumed to increase at 4.5% p.a. and oil traffic
at an average over the period of 6.7% (Table 7). Operating expenses are
estimated to increase by some 7% p.a. to reflect normal anticipated increases
in wages and salaries and other direct costs. Depreciation has been provided
as calculated by KPT and is adequate.

6.10      Allowance has been made for the service of long-term debt, in-
cluding (i) Bank Loans 126-PAK and 376-PAK, and Credit 422-PAK, (ii) loans
from consortium countries, (iii) the proposed credit for the present project
(relending terms assumed to be 7-1/4% interest for 25 years including a
five-year grace period) and assumed loans for other major works, on terms
similar to those recommended for the proposed project.
6.11      On the basis of these forecasts, the operating ratios will rise
from 61 in 1974 to 65 in 1983. The debt/service ratio will drop from 2.6 in
1974 to 1.7 in 1983 and the interest-earned ratio will decline from 5.2 in
1974 to 2.7 in 1983. The return on net fixed assets will decrease f:rom 9.3%
in 1974 to 7.4% in 1983. These trends are likely to be reversed after 1983,
as capital expenditures decline and revenues increase.
6.12      The balance sheet data (Table 14) reflect a sound financial posi-
tion during the entire 1974 to 1983 period. Current ratios range from 4 to
1 in 1974 to 12 to 1 in 1983 and the debt/equity ratio increases from 22/78
in 1974 to an acceptable 36/64 in 1981, thereafter declining to 34/66 in 1983.
D.   Financial Plan and Objectives
6.13      The capital investment program up to 1983 totals some US$155.3 mil-
lion (Table 1) and includes:
PRs                  US$
(million)            (million)

Fourth Port Project                          236.46                 23.88
Western Backwater                            693.00                 70.00
Other minor works, mainly
replacement and renewals:
hiopper barges and tugs      57.45                   5.80
Cargo-handling equipment    36.20                    3.66
Civil and mechanical works 116.51                   11.77

1,537.81               155.33   100%



- 19 -
6.14      The capital investment program up to 1983 includes US$70.0 million,
being the estimated cost of six berths in the Western Backwater, including
necessary dredging, reclamation and equipment, for which financing has yet
to be arranged. All other items in the investment program are fully
financed.
6.15      Other minor non-project items in the investment program include
US$5.8 million for hopper barges and tugs, US$3.7 million for cargo-handling
equipment and US$13.8 million for various civil and mechanical engineering
works.
6.16      The foreign exchange costs of the Second Karachi Port Project
are financed by Loan 376-PAK which is expected to be fully disbursed by
June 30, 1974. The foreign exchange costs of the Third Karachi Port Project
are being financed by Credit 422-PAK and those of the renewals and replace-
ment program are being financed by the supplier countries (UK, Japan,
Netherlands). The foreign exchange costs of the proposed project would
be financed by the proposed IDA credit (except as noted in para 4.06) and in
the financial plan it has been assumed that the foreign exchange costs of
the Western Backwater would be similarly financed.
6.17      The local currency costs of all the expenditures in the investment
program will be met by KPT from accumulated reserves and future earnings
and from a grant by the Government of 40% of the total cost of the Napier
Mole road bridge included in the Third Port Project, estimated to amount to
US$2.9 million equivalent.
6.18      The capital resources available to and utilized by KPT during the
ten-year period 1974 to 1983, which are detailed in Table 15, are summarized
below:
PRS '000
Investments and cash deposits realized           15,106
Internally generated funds                      959,176
Loans                                           865,575
Grant                                            28,692
1,868,549
Capital expenditure                           1,537,808
Repayment of loans                              328,012
Increase in working capital                       2,729
1,868,549
About 42% of the funds required for capital expenditure will be provided
from KPT's own resources, 2% from a grant and the remaining 56% from loans.
In assessing available resources, it has been assumed that the investments
and cash deposits in the various special reserve accounts (Table 12) other
than provident and welfare funds would be realized to the extent required
for the program.



- 20 -
6.19      A rate of return on net fixed assets of not less than 4% from
1976 to 1981 and 7% from 1982 onwards will ensure that sufficient cash will
be generated to provide, after meeting operating and maintenance expenditure,
full debt service coverage and make a reasonable contribution towards the
capital investment program; it will also recoup an adequate part of the
benefits arising from improved port facilities and operations for Pakistan
(para 5.15). The increase from 4% to 7% in 1982 is required to meet debt
service on the Western Backwater development, and KPT has agreed to achieve
these rates of return.
6.20      KPT has managed its finances well in the past.  However, to ensure
that a sound financial position is maintained, KPT has agreed not to under-
take further long-term borrowing without Association approval unless net
cash revenue is at least 1-1/2 times future maximum debt service require-
ments.
6.21      KPT has also agreed not to undertake, prior to the Closing Date,
capital expenditures exceeding US$2 million equivalent in any fiscal year,
other than those incurred in carrying out the approved investment program,
without Association agreement.
6.22      The agreements relating to the present project described in
paragraphs 6.19-6.21 substantially accord with those reached in respect
of Credit 422-PAK.
E.  Audit
6.23      The present Government audit of KPT's accounts is satisfactory
except that it should be carried out more expeditiously and its scope
broadened.
6.24      Section 68 of the KPT Act of 1886 provides for the receipts and
expenditure accounts to be audited and examined on a half-yearly basis by
auditors appointed by the Government. The audit is carried out by the
Auditor General's Department as is usual for Government agencies in
Pakistan. KPT has agreed that the audit will be carried out within six
months of the end of the fiscal year; the scope of the audit will be broad-
ened to embrace the commercial aspects of the new accounting system; and, if
necessary to achieve this, independent auditors, acceptable to the Asaocia-
tion, will be appointed in addition to the Auditor General.
F.   Insurance
6.25      KPT, with Government approval, carries its own insurance risks.
Past experience has shown that the cost of insuring assets against losses
would have greatly exceeded any losses sustained. In the event of any such
loss or damage involving foreign exchange, the Government has agreed that
the required foreign exchange would be made available.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement has been reached on the following matters:
(a) evaluation by the Government of alternatives for handling
dry bulk cargo in deep-draft ships (para 2.17);
(b) implementation by KPT of new management accounting system
and organizational changes by June 30, 1975 (para 3.04);
(c) operation of KPT's dredging fleet and new dredger to the
extent necessary to ensure completion of required dredging
by September 30, 1976 and June 30, 1979 respectively
(paras 4.03 and 4.05);
(d) submission through KPT, not later than June 1975, of a
scheme for improvements to tankage capacity and pipelines
and Government action to ensture completion of approved
works by September 30, 1976 if not undertaken by the
refinery companies (para 4.13);
(e)  revision of the KPT tariff structure by June 30, 1975 and
introduiction of any adjustments required to ensure achieve-
ment of specified financial objectives (para 6.03); and
(f) financial objectives, debt limitation and limitation of
capital expenditure (para 6.22).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for an Association credit to the
Government of US$16.0 million on the usual terms. The Government would
re-lend the amount of the credit to KPT for a term of 25 years including a
five-year grace period, at the Bank interest rate current at the time of
credit approval.

PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF FOURTH KARACHI PORT PROJECT
Description of Port Facilities and Equipment
1.   Description of the Port
The present port is located in the southern end of the city of
Karachi. The harbor is approached from the southwest through the approach
channel about three miles long. Inside the harbor the main navigational
channel is about two miles long, and main berthing facilities are located
along both sides.  Mooring buoys are located in midstream of the inner
harbor and the oil terminals at the entrance to the harbor on the Keamari
side. The present entrance channel provides 29 ft depth.
2.   Berthing Facilities
Berthing facilities consist of 24 deep-water berths, lighterage
wharves and three oil piers in addition to O.P.4 being provided under the
proposed project, but one of these (O.P.3) is in dilapidated condition and
will be phased out on completion of O.P.4. In addition, there are 15 mooring
buoys, two ship repair berths and boat wharves. Juna Bunder is the oldest
section of the port where goods are landed from and shipped on lighters
and barges. It is proposed to build four new dry cargo berths here under
the Third Karachi Port Project (Credit 422-PAK). The present main berthing
facilities include:

6.   Railway Facilities
KPT has provided a network of approximately 100 miles of broad
gauge railway tracks; by agreement the PWR operates the wagon and train
movements on this network.
The Keamari Yard, laid behind the East Wharf, facilitates receiving
up-country export cargo at the storage areas and direct delivery at the
berths is also possible. Similarly, import cargo is railed either to the
storage areas or directly to the local and up-country destinations.
The Thole Produce (T.P.) Yard about one mile from the port provides
storage and railway facilities to receive cotton and other export cargo, which
can also be railed to the ship-side whenever required.
The Mansfield Import Yard, laid during 1909 to 1912, provides ware-
houses and open storage facilities for import and export cargo. It is
obsolete and barely able to meet the present level of traffic demand at the
13 berths of the West Wharf and has been scheduled for remodeling under
Third Karachi Port Project (Credit 422-PAK).
The tank farms of the Pakistan Refinery Limited, Pakistan Burmah
Shell Limited and National Refinery Limited are located in the oil in-
stallation plot, immediately behind the Keamari oil terminal. KPT and PWR
provide them with sidings and railway connection with Keamari Yard.



ANNEX 1

7.   Land Connections
The East Wharf (Keamari) area contains 17 shipping berths, three
oil berths, two ship repair berths, one lighterage wharf, bulk oil installations
and boat basin. The Keamari area is connected to the mainland by:
(a)  The Pakistan Western Railway (PWR) bridge which
carries the railway tracks across the Chinna Creek.
(b) A PWR single track leading to the mainland Hump
Yard through the oil installation area, exclusively
used for oil traffic.
Cc) The existing Napier Mole road bridge.
(d) A possible land route of poor quality through Clifton that
is not capable of heavy traffic without substantial improve-
ment.
The existing road bridge was completed in 1864 and widened in 1914.
It carries four traffic lanes, footpaths and services. The overall width
of the bridge is approximately 70 ft. The bridge is being replaced under
the Third Karachi Port Project (Credit 422-PAK).
8.   Ancillary Services
The water supply for the port is obtained from the Karachi
Development Authority and is made available through mains and water barges
provided by KPT.
9.   Maintenance
Maintenance of existing structures needs to be improved, particularly
in the case of O.P.1 and O.P.2 where the existing concrete structures are
showing evidence of deterioration.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH KARACHI PORT PROJECT
Description of Project Items and Other Items to be Undertaken
Not Financed by the Project
A.   Items to be Financed by the Proposed Credit
1.   Oil Berth
The berth will comprise a loading platform 120 ft x 50 ft, two
breasting dolphins, one on each side thereof, each 55 ft x 30 ft with
necessary fendering, and four mooring dolphins 25 ft x 25 ft, all connected
by 5 ft wide walkways. The loading platform will be connected to land by a
causeway of part solid, and part piled construction.
The face of the breasting dolphins will be about 190 ft from the
eastern edge of the lower harbor channel, and the loading platform about
5 ft behind the face of these dolphins. The water area between the new
berth and the existing channel will be dredged to a 44 ft depth to accommodate
loaded 45,000-dwt tankers at all states of the tide. A floating collar
will be provided to contain any possible spillage.
Construction will be with reinforced and/or pre-stressed concrete on
steel tubular piles. Cathodic protection will be provided for the piling;
ancillary works will include electric lighting and a customs office.
To handle the flexible hose connection for discharging/loading
moored tankers, a hose tower equipped with a 5 ton crane will be provided
on the loading platform; the flexible hoses will in turn be connected to a
common user 30"-diameter crude oil import pipe, and an 18"-diameter heavy
fuel export pipe, both of which will be laid to the port boundary. Provision
of all necessary fire fighting equipment has been included.
2.   Entrance Channel
The existing approach channel to Karachi harbor has a limiting
depth of 29 ft (25,000-dwt ships) and will need to be extended and dredged
to give a 40 ft depth of water for 45,000 dwt tankers to enable full use to
be made of the new oil pier. This will be achieved in two stages. First,
a contract will be let to dredge about 3.5 million cu yd which will provide
37 ft (about 40,000 dwt) under the proposed project; this will be completed
by mid-1976, and the cost has been estimated on the basis of US$1.10 per
cu yd; thereafter it will be deepened to 40 ft, involving a further 1.5
million cu yd of dredging, over the following three years by the dredger



ANNEX 2
Page 2
to be provided.  Details of this dredger are in section 3 below.  Additional
market buoys and radar reflectors for existing buoys will improve the
navigability of the channel. The contract dredging includes deepening
a 2,003 ft test length of the approach channel to 45 ft in order to
assess the maintenance dredging which will be required when a channel for
75,000 dwt tankers is provided.
3.   Procurement of Dredger for Maintenance and Deeper.ing of the Entrance
Channel
Maintenance dredging of the fully deepened 40 ft channel is
expected to be about one million cu yd per annum. This has been independently
estimated by three consultants, van Houten & Co. (USA) in association with
the Danish Hydraulics Institute, Frederick R. Harris (USA) and Wallingford
Hydraulic Research Laboratory (UK). It has been indicated that given the
uncertainties of projections of this type the quantity might be exceeded or
may be less. The Association considers one million cu yd an acceptable figure
for planning purposes. At the initial dredged depth of 37 ft, maintenance
dredging is estimated to amount to about 700,000 cu yd per annum. To enable
the required quantity to be dredged annually plus the extra 1.5 million cu
yd to deepen the channel to a 40 ft depth over a period of three Nears, it
is proposed to obtain a trailer suction hopper dredger of 2,000 m  hopper
capacity; this will be fitted with apparatus to compensate for the effects
of swell in the open sea section of the channel. It can be demonstrated
(Annex 3) that a dredger of this capacity can dredge at least 1.5 million
cu yd annually given the known distance from the channel to the dumping area.
This will be adequate to achieve the proposed program. If the maintenance
required proved to be 30% in excess of the present estimate, a 40 ft channel
could be achieved in about 4-1/2 years.
4.   Consulting Services
Final engineering of the oil berth design is being financed under
Credit S-9 PAK and is expected to be completed by December 1973; the proposed
credit will finance only supervision of construction of the berth, hose tower,
and piping; it will also finance the required preparation of dredging con-
tract documents and necessary surveys before and on completion of dredging
to determine precise quantities. For the procurement of the dredger, it
includes financing of naval architects to provide an outline bidding
specification, review the bids and designs submitted, and undertake a number
of inspections during construction. Also, because the operation of a dredger
of this type in open sea conditions is new to IPT's dredging staff, technical
assistance in the form of a dredging master and mechanical engineer will be
provided to give practical training to local staff "n the operation and
maintenance of the dredger over a period of three years from its delivery in
Karachi. Assistance in assessing the results obtained from the deepened
test section of the entrance channel is included.
B.   Other Items Included in, but.Not Financed by, the Project
KPT will dredge the existing O.P.1 to a 38 ft depth to enable it to
berth loaded 35,000-dwt tankers at all states of the tide by mid-1976;



ANNEX 2
Page 3
and, with the dredger described in section 3, KPT will, in addition to
maintaining the 37 ft channel, deepen it to 40 ft depth by about 1979.
C.   Further Ancillary Works
The common user pipelines for crude oil import and heavy fuel oil
export will be extended from the berth limits by the two refinery companies
to a common manifold adjacent to the tank farms, whence each individual
company will provide piping to its own area. The companies will also
increase storage from the present 30,000 tons in the case of NRL and 65,000
tons for PRL to the amount necessary to handle the increased tanker sizes.
Additionally, improved piping arrangements to the existing oil berths,
as required to expeditiously handle imports of-petroleum products and exports
of molasses and edible oils, will be provided by the companies concerned.
Preparation of the required proposals is being coordinated by the Oil
Companies' Advisory Committee for approval by KPT and the Association.

A 40 ft channel would therefore be achieved at the latest by
about May 1979.
Thereafter there is ample capacity for maintenance and some
deepening, but lack of knowledge of the maintenance requirement of a
channel in excess of 40 ft precludes the possibility of determining the
depth which could be achieved. Even if the miaintenance dredging quantities
allowed in the calculation were 30% in excess of estimate, the 40 ft
channel could be achieved in about 4-1/2 years, say, December 1981.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH KARACHI PORT PROJECT
Traffic Forecasting Methodology
Introduction
1.        Past consumption of petroleum products in Pakistan increased over
the period 1962-72 at an average annual rate of 5.6% (Table 6). The growth
rate varies substantially from product to product and from year to year,
making projection on the basis of these data difficult. However, there
appears to be a reasonably good correlation between the growth of GDP
and the growth in consumption of middle distillates, the principal product
group. This relationship was used as the basis of the forecast for middle
distillates which, in turn, provided the basis of the forecast for crude
oil. requirements.
Middle Distillates
2.        Growth in consumption of middle distillates averaged 9.7% p.a.
over the period 1962-70, two percentage points faster than GDP over the
same period. Following a period of relative stagnation in 1971 and 1972
GDP has resumed its growth and is expected to increase at about 7% p.a.
over the next few years. Taking account of expected petroleum product price
increases resulting from devaluation of the Rupee and recent and expected
future, crude oil price increases, consumption of middle distillates are
forecast to increase at 8% p.a., only one percentage point faster than
forecast GDP (Table 7).
Light Distillates
3.        Consumption of light distillates (excluding naphtha) has grown
at an average of 4% p.a. and, since there is no reason to expect any change,
this growth rate is used for the forecast period. It corresponds with oil
industry estimates.
Naphtha
4.        The supply of naphtha (a light distillate) in Pakistan is influenced
by the present imbalance between demand for light distillates, mainly gasoline,
increasing at 4% p.a. and supply, which is increasing in line with middle
distillate growth, at 8% p.a. Given the inflexibility of refinery yield
patterns this imbalance is likely to continue and will result in an
increasing supply of naphtha. At present, surplus naphtha is exported, but
the forecast assumes that the use of naphtha in the manufacture of petro-
chemicals and fertilizer will become economically attractive, and that an



ANNEX 4
Page 2
increasing proportion of the supply will therefore be used in Pakistan
(Table A to this Annex).
Heavy Fuel
5.        Since 1966 domestic consumption of heavy fuel has shown a
declining trend (Table 6), resulting from Pakistan Western Railways'
dieselization program and a switch of large industrial energy consumers
from fuel oil to natural gas. In view of the large and growing surplus
of fuel oil which has to be exported at a very small net benefit to the
economy, the Government is encouraging large industrial consumers, such as
Karachi Electrical Supply Company, to switch back to the use of fuel oil.
The forecast, which conforms with oil industry estimates, assumes that this
policy will be successful.
Asphalt
6.        No data are available for domestic consumption of asphalt separate
from exports. However, the total volume in 1972 of 72,000 tons (Table 6)
is substantially less than in earlier years, and is not unreasonable, in
relation to the mileage of paved highway, as an estimate of domestic con-
sumption. On this basis, therefore, consumption is forecast to increase
at 10% p.a., the estimated growth of paved highways and highway traffic.
Lubricants and Greases
7.        Gaps and anomalies in the data for lubricants and greases limit
their usefulness, and no oil industry forecast is available. In the absence
of a firmer foundation, the forecast was based on data for the four years
1967-1970, which show a clear growth trend of 5.5% p.a.
Refinery Capacities and Yields
8.        The capacities and yield patterns of existing refineries and
planned expansions are shown in Table B of this Annex, which also shows
the crude oil intake required to manufacture these volumes of product.
These yield patterns were used to obtain the product supply figures used
in Table A.
Demand and Supply of Petroleum Products
9.        The product supply figures shown in Table A are derived from a
matching, as far as practically possible, of refining capacity to the
demand for middle distillates, the principal product group. This matching
process is based on the following reasonable assumptions:
(a) when imports of middle distillates would otherwise
reach one million tons p. a., additional refining
capacity will be added;



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(b) all feasible means will be used of minimizing the
volumes of surplus products. Thus, a vis-breaker
will be added to PRL's refinery in 1976 to increase
the yield of middle distillates and reduce that of
heavy fuel; and Multan refinery will have a yield
pattern similar to NRL's present refinery so as to
avoid manufacturing heavy fuel, which could not be
economically exported from this inland location;
(c) the start-up of Multan refinery, scheduled for
1977, will be deferred at least until 1979.
10.       The resulting differences between supply of, and demand for,
individual products is shown in Table A as imported or exported.
Crude Oil Demand
11.       Table 7 recapitulates the volumes of refined products consusmed,
as shown in Table A, deducts product imports and adds product exports, to
obtain total manufactured product. The volume of product used in the
refining process is added to the total manufactured product to obtain the
total crude oil intake. The amount of crude oil supplied from domestic
sources is deducted from the total crude oil intake to give the requirements
of imported crude oil.
12.       Imports of crude oil thus obtained are shown in Table 7 as
increasing at 7.1% p.a. This compares with a growth rate of 6.7% for
product consumption.
Principal Uncertainties
13.       The principal uncertainties in the traffic forecast concern:
(a) The rate of increase in the price of crude oil, and
the effect of this on demand, either directly or
through Government action, to curb demand for balance
of payments reasons. It is not possible to forecast
with accuracy either future crude oil prices, or their
impact on demand. A product-by-product review indi-
cates that the demand for most petroleum products is
not very price-elastic. The forecast recognizes,
however, that there will be some reduction in the
growth of demand as a result of inevitable price
increases.
(b) If implementation of the new policy referred to
in para 5 is less successful than anticipated,
a higher proportion than forecast of the fuel
oil manufactured in Pakistan will have to be



ANNEX 4
Page 4
exported. If the present consumption trend is
maintained, it will result in exports in 1983
being about 300,000 tons higher than forecast.
(c) If future refining capacity is not designed to
minimize surplus product (para 9(b)above), the
volume of fuel oil exports would be increased and
that of lubricants would be decreased.
(d)  If the assumption in para 4, regarding the use
of naphtha for manufacture in Pakistan of
petrochemicals and fertilizer, is not borne out,
substantially higher volumes of naphtha will
have to be exported.
14.       To the extent that the expectations in (b), (c) and (d) are not
fulfilled, exports of petroleum products will be increased. While this
would bring forward the timing of the next oil berth project, it could
have no bearing on the benefits of the present project which are related
to the volume of crude oil imports.
