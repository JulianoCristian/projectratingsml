Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan\n            Project (ASAL) supports rapid development of a more\n            efficient and responsive agricultural sector, in accord with\n            the principles enunciated in the Government of\n            Bulgaria's medium-term program. Reforms will occur in\n            the areas of pricing, trace, agricultural subsidies and\n            finance, land markets, cereals markets, and agriculture\n            enterprise privatization. The reforms will increase domestic\n            marketing competitiveness by expediting development of a\n            private land market, significantly reducing the state's\n            role as a marketing and processing intermediary, improving\n            the incentives environment by eliminating price and trade\n            controls, and reducing subsidized government credit. This\n            will improve income-earning opportunities for rural people,\n            contribute to rural employment generation, and help raise\n            rural living standards. Consumers will benefit from improved\n            agricultural product quality and availability, greater\n            choice, and more efficient marketing demands. The most\n            important risks are first, political resistance by powerful\n            interest groups, and second, that the program will be\n            undermined by a non-supportive macroeconomic environment.\n            All conditions have been fulfilled and the ASAL is a one\n            tranche operation."}, "docdt": "1999-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
