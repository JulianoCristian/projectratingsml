SIERRA LEONE
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Land and the Economy
1.01      Sierra Leone is a relatively small (71,740 km2) West African
country situated along the Atlantic coast between Guinea and Liberia. In mid-
1979 it had a population of 3.3 million growing at 2.5% per year, and an
average per capita income of about US$250 (World Bank Atlas). The country has
a humid, tropical climate with rainfall averaging more than 200 inches per
year in parts of the country. Historically, this was an advantage because the
many rivers provided a crude transport system allowing trade between the in-
terior and the coast. Today, however, many expensive bridges are required to
expand the road network.
1.02      Sierra Leone has a dual economy:  a small modern sector, dominated
by a few public corporations and private mining concerns, coexisting with a
large traditional agricultural sector which sustains three-quarters of the
population. The country is well endowed with natural resources including
appropriate soils and climate, fish, minerals, a significant but mostly
untapped hydro-electric potential, and a relatively well educated civil
service. Since 1973, however, Sierra Leone has lost roughly half its export
base because deposits of the country's main foreign exc:hange earners, iron
ore and diamonds, are nearly depleted and new deposits are not yet exploited.
Prices for cocoa and coffee, the main agricultural exports, also declined.
The budget came under increasing pressure, and deficits were financed
increasingly by short-term external credits or by the domestic banking
system, which severely aggravated Sierra Leone's crediltworthiness.
1.03      In 1979 the Government, assisted by the International Monetary
Fund, adopted an austerity program to address these problems. While the
program helped relieve domestically generated inflationiary pressures, sharp
increases in the price of oil and other imports increased the cost of living
and adversely affected the balance of payments as well as the budget.
1.04      The Government is trying to redress the trade balance by increasing
production of rice (import substitution) and export crops (coffee, cocoa, palm
oil) and by trying to interest investors in rehabilitating existing iron ore
mines and in developing new Kimberlite diamond deposits. Integrated agricul-
tural development plans are proceeding with the help of the Bank Group, the
European Development Fund (EDF), and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development. However, the Government is finding its efforts increasingly
impeded by the poor state of the road network, the focus of the proposed
project.



- 2-
B. The Transport System
1.05      Sierra Leone was the first W4est African country to build a railway
(1895-1912). The line connected Freetown, the capital and major port, with
the major crop collecting points, mainly the rich palm areas in the Southeast.
There was also a branch line north to Makeni. The Sierra Leone Railway (SLR)
was phased out in the 1970s (para. 1.07). Besides the SLR, there was also
the private railway of the Delco Iron Mine which ran from Marampa to the port
of Pepel, near Freetown. In 1975, both the iron mine and its railway closed
down. But their re-opening is currently being negotiated with a foreign
company.
1.06      Early road development emphasized secondary road links between agri-
cultural areas and the railway. This led to increasing overcultivation of
the land in densely populated rural areas served by the SLR, especially the
Western Area near Freetown and the Eastern Province.
1.07      The road network was gradually improved following World liar II,
including roads which paralleled the SLR and which captured a substantial
volume of traffic. In 1966, the Government carried out a Land Transport
Survey (LTS), financed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), which
concluded that in the 1970s rail transport would cost about three times as
much as road transport and recommended that the SLR be closed. The Govern-
ment then took the unpopular decision of phasing out the SLR which was
completed in 1973. However, the comprehensive highway program designed to
serve the regions in lieu of the SLR has not been completed. The road
subsector is described further in Chapter II.
1.08      Freetown has one of the best natural harbors in West Africa and
handles most of the country s general cargo and all of its petroleum traffic.
Two other ports, Bonthe and Pepel, handle mainly bulk exports of bauxite,
rutile and iron ore. The Sierra Leone Ports Authority, a public corporation,
administers the ports and is responsible for their maintenance and operation.
Total port traffic has declined substantially in recent years to about 1.4
million tons in FY78, largely as a function of the slowdown in economic
activity. As a consequence, it is unlikely that new berth or storage capacity
will be needed during the next decade, although new handling equipment or
other facilities might be required if agricultural exports expand.
1.09      Sierra Leone has one international airport serving Freetown, plus
eight small airfields. The recently-improved Freetown airport still has no
instrument landing system, which hampers operations during the rainy season.
It is served by 12 international airlines and Sierra Leone Airways (SLA), a
domestic carrier. SLA½s traffic is growing modestly on average, although the
company has operated at a modest loss in recent years.



C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.10      Over the past five years, between 1974/75 and 1978/79, develop-
ment spending by the public sector amounted to Le 150 million (about 45
percent less than the plan target, which was based on an annual GDP
growth rate of 6 percent as compared with the actual growth rate of 0.9
percent). Out of this total about 22 percent was spent on agriculture,
20 percent on road transport, 17 percent on energy, 15 percent on social
services and 25 percent on other economic and general services.
1.11      The Bank Group has been encouraging the Government to prepare an
intermediate term investment program while work is proceeding on a longer-
term development plan oriented towards improving the productive sectors of
the economy, mainly agriculture. The Government responded positively to
this request, and in late 1978, provided a list of public investment pro-
jects, which was modified in discussion with the Bank Group. The investment
program (1979-81) favors agriculture and development in rural areas and is a
first step in improving the planning process.
1.12      Responsibility for transport planning is shared by the Central
Planning Unit of the Ministry of Development and Economic Planning (MDEP),
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC), and the Ministry of
Works (MOW). MOW proposes roads to be built and is responsible for their
construction and maintenance. MTC determines highway regulations and air
and sea transport policy. MOW and the Central Planning Unit of MDEP advise
on road priorities in accordance with the objectives of the National
Development Plan. Final choices are made by the Cabinet and approved by
Parliament through a review of the Development Estimates.
1.13      Transport investment decisions do not yet adequately reflect the
needs of other sectors, within a realistic macroeconomic or financial frame-
work. While the closure of the railways eliminated an economically obsolete
transport mode, the Government still needs to strike a better balance between
the maintenance of existing infrastructure, the construction of new main
roads, and the construction of rural access roads. In the past, because it was
not adequately staffed, MDEP did not take the lead in this coordination role.
Now, improvements are expected, thanks to experts provided under three pro-
jects: the IDA Technical Assistance Credit (SL 970) to strengthen planning
capability, project preparation and execution capacity in key sectoral minis-
tries; the UNDP Planning Projects in Economic Management (SIL/79/005), and
Infrastructure Planning (SIL/79/004) for which the World Bank is the executing
agency. This effort will be complemented by technical assistance to be
provided to MOW under the proposed project.
D. The Role of the Bank Group
1.14      From 1966 to 1970, the Bank, as the executing agency for the
UNDP-financed LTS, helped shape Sierra Leone-s transport sector policy. One
of the LTS's major sector recommendations was implemented: the unprofitable



-4-
SLR was closed, but its replacement by highways was slow, handicapped by
implementation problems, including a large increase in construction costs
resulting from rapid worldwide inflation.
1.15      Under the First Highway Project (Loan 710/Credit 218 SL, US$7.2
million, 1971), the Bank Group financed the construction of the Bo-Kenema road
and a first phase of road maintenance. The June 13, 1978 Project Performance
Audit Report (PPAR) noted that the construction component was initially
delayed by the need to rebid because of unacceptably high contractor propo-
sals; its cost escalated during construction to such an extent that the Bank
approved in 1975 a supplementary loan of US$2.3 million to finance the overrun.
The road was finally completed in December 1975. The ex post economic rate of
return was 25% compared to 21% at appraisal.
1.16      The First Highway Project also made a first attempt to improve highway
maintenance through the provision of new equipment, technical assistance,
and training. The training program was completed successfully. However, the
routine and periodic maintenance fell far short of expectations, as only about
27 miles of roads were partly improved. The PPAR noted seven reasons for this
failure:
(i)  monies allocated for recurrent expenditures were not spent
efficiently, creating a shortage of funds for fuel, oil,
lubricants and spares;
(ii) equipment was diverted and used by other Government agencies;
(iii) maintenance was subordinated to construction;
(iv) scheduled improvements of the maintenance organization were
deferred due to MOW's fiscal, organizational, and personnel
constraints;
(v)  MOW had difficulties in attracting and keeping engineering
and management staff;
(vi) engineering staff preferred construction work; and
(vii) accounting and budgeting procedures were not implemented
in Area offices.
A principal project objective would be to address each of these issues.
1.17      The Bank Group's principal objective in the transport sector is
to encourage the Government to relate its transport expenditures to broader
economic objectives, particularly in support of agriculture. The first
priority is adequate road maintenance so that the condition of existing roads
will permit efficient transport in support of rural development. The second
priority is rational selection, preparation, and implementation of road
investments, including feeder roads, and improvement works on primary and



-5-
secondary roads. An ongoing agricultural project (Integrated Agricultural
Development Project II, Credit 5681, Loan 1138 SL) includes feeder road
construction and maintenance elements executed by the Cooperative for American
Relief Everywhere (CARE) and co-financed by USAID (para. 2.11). The Technical
Assistance Project (Credit 970 SL) and the currently proposed project focus on
strengthening transport planning and improving highway maintenance and is
based to a significant degree on the lessons learned from the First Highway
Project.

II. THE ROAD SUB-SECTOR
A. Network, Traffic and Vehicle Fleet
2.01      The road inventory taken by MOW with the assistance of consul-
tants during the execution of the First Highway Project shows that the road
network totals about 4,431 miles (7,127 km) of which 764 miles (about 17%)
are paved:

/a See definition of classes in para. 2.20.
2.02      The average density of the network, 0.16 miles per sq mile, though
low, is higher than in neighboring Guinea (0.14) and Liberia (0.12). As a
result of heavy investment in road infrastructure, the Class I and Class II
networks, totalling almost 2,000 miles, provide generally adequate links
between Freetown, the capital and main port, and important provincial
centers except Kabala in the North and Kailahun in the East.
2.03      The condition of the primary and secondary networks (Class I and
II), varies from good to poor due to inadequate maintenance, heavy traffic and
high rainfall.  The tertiary network (Class III and IV) and urban streets
(Class V) are in even poorer condition due to neglect.
2.04      Traffic is high by West African standards, with an estimated 612
miles of roads having an average daily traffic (ADT) of over 400 vehicles per
day and another 869 miles with an ADT of more than 150 vehicles. Only about
half of the roads with an ADT of more than 150 vehicles are paved, and it is
likely that paving most of the remainder would be economically justified.



- 7 -
2.05      The vehicle fleet is estimated at about 33,000 vehicles at 1980,
or about one vehicle per 100 inhabitants. This is somewhat less than in
Liberia (1.5) but considerably more than in neighboring Guinea (less than 0.5).
Vehicle registration statistics have not been properly kept in recent years.
Assistance to improve transport planning, including data collection, would
be provided under the proposed project, as well as under the Association's
Technical Assistance Project (para. 3.13).
B. Road Transport Industry
2.06      The road transport industry comprises a large number of small
private truckers, minibus (poda poda) owners, small taxi enterprises, and
one large public company, the Sierra Leone Road Transport Corporation (RTC).
In the past RTC handled freight traffic, but now it provides passenger serv-
ices only (para. 2.08). The proliferation of small truckers has promoted
competition, except in areas where poor road conditions have discouraged
truckers, resulting in local monopolies and higher tariffs (para 2.07).
Transport capacity, particularly for goods, appears adequate.
2.07      There is no regulation of entry into the road freight transport
industry other than the license required by MTC and the legal limitation of
ownership to Sierra Leonean nationals, a regulation which is not uniformly
enforced. The daily operations of road transport are essentially unregulated,
although the Government retains, but does not use, its power to control
competition on routes formerly plied by RTC. Freight transport is unorganized.
There is no regulation of tariffs for freight haulage, and rates are freely
negotiated between private operators and potential custcmers. The SLPMB does
not rigorously police its agents to ensure that the 20-30% margin between
official producer prices and farmgate prices fairly reflects the cost of
collection and transport.  Passenger fares are set by the Government, and
increases often lag far behind inflation. For example, the latest increase,
applied for in 1975, was not granted until 1979. In the last ten years, there
have been only two increases in passenger fares.
2.08      The difficulties which culminated in RTC's shutdown of freight-
operations date back many years. The Government had not: allowed RTC to
increase its freight rates sufficiently (para. 2.07), and as a consequence,
RTC could not offer the flexibility provided by owners of smaller trucks. By
late 1977, when RTC ceased freight operations, it had accumulated losses
exceeding Le 2.0 million (US$1.9 million). Since 1974, the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Government have been assisting RTC by supplying
loans for buses and technical assistance for their mainlenance. In addition,
the Government subsidizes RTC by exempting it from duties on imports of spare
parts and on office rents. Until July 1979, RTC was also exempt from paying
gasoline taxes. The Government now expects RTC to break even on its passenger
activities; however, this will be difficult since RTC must now renew many of
the buses in its 64-bus fleet. If the RTC is to operate its buses without
subsidy, a system of regular rate adjustments will have to be established.



-8-
C.   Administration and Staff
2.09      The MOW is responsible for the construction, maintenance and admin-
istration of the entire highway system, as well as for pub:Lic buildings,
airports, jetties and ferries. It is organized into six operating divisions,
whose responsibilities and activities tend to overlap. For example, it
relies jointly on two administrative sections for accounting and personnel
management services and for quantity surveying (see chart). A soil and
materials testing laboratory is also attached to the MOW.
2.10      Each of MOW's six Area Offices is headed by an Area Engineer who
operates with a high degree of autonomy. A seventh Area Office is located at
Lungi to take advantage of the presence of an airport engineer who is respon-
sible also for the local road network. The two largest areas each have one
subordinate district. At present, Area and District Engineers are responsible
for minor construction works and for maintenance of all public infrastructure.
The Area Engineers are subject to intense local political pressure, which is a
serious problem, as politically motivated projects and works often receive
priority over road maintenance. Under the proposed project, the Association
will help the Government to review MOW's complicated organizational structure.
The Association has previously advised the Government to create a highway
department within or separate from the MOW; this concept will be investi-
gated further under the project (para. 3.14).
2.11      Feeder road projects are selected and supervised by the National
Feeder Roads Committee which functions under the MOW. At present, CARE, a
private charitable organization, is building feeder roads. These works,
supervised by MOW, are financed by USAID, IDA, (para. 2.15) and the Govern-
ment; they provide a good start in establishing an institutional basis for
future feeder road selection and construction.
2.12      MOW employs a staff of over 10,000 professionals, supervisors, and
laborers, which is excessive. Its management is entirely Sierra Leonean, and
only two expatriates remain in technical positions. Many MOW engineers were
trained abroad, and their professional qualifications are good.  However,
attracting and retaining capable engineers is difficult because of low Govern-
ment salaries, competition with the private sector, and work opportunities
abroad. Promotion seems to be based more on seniority than on aptitude or
performance. Working conditions are difficult, with even office materials in
short supply. In general, job satisfaction in MOW is low, and professionals
at middle levels show little interest in their work, the result being poor
job performance.
2.13      MOW operates a Road Training School at Freetown which has been a
good source for qualified staff. Since its establishment in 1970, the school
has trained about 30 foremen a year for road construction and maintenance
works. In addition, its instructors provide basic on-the-job training to
about 100 workers each year. The school employs nine instructors who teach in
the local Krio dialect and use manuals, slides and tapes, but the school's
space is inadequate and the shortage of training materials is acute. With



- 9 -
some additional classrooms and sufficient funds, additional instructors could
be hired and the school's output could be easily raised, since the employee
response to training is good. The proposed project will, provide for an
expansion of the Road Training School and for improvemernt of its courses.
D.   Highway Planning and Financing
2.14      The Government's objectives in the highway sub-sector, as stated
in the FY75-79 National Development Plan, were to:
(i)  improve or upgrade 213 miles of existing primary and secondary
roads to satisfy traffic requirements;
(ii)  upgrade, or construct 650 miles of feeder roads, mostly through
self-help, to connect isolated villages and potentially produc-
tive centers to the existing highway network; and
(iii)  institute an effective program of road maintenance.
2.15      Plan objectives were overly ambitious, but the Government managed to
invest about Le 34 million (US$32.3 million) in primary road construction
during the period (para. 2.16). The principal investments were made in the
Freetown coastal road. CARE also built about 150 miles of feeder roads, of
which about 50 miles are located in the Eastern Area of the Integrated Rural
Development Project (Credit 323 SL). With a second USA'ID project and continued
funding from IDA and the Government, CARE plans to build another 100 miles of
feeder roads in the Eastern Area and about 250 miles in the Northern Area of
the second Integrated Rural Development Project (Credit 568/Loan 1138 SL).
Highway investments are financed from the Development Budget, generally with
foreign assistance. Highway investments totalled Le 47 million (US$45 million)
during FY75-79, or 22% of total public investment expendlitures, which is
reasonable. However, the effectiveness of road investment in promoting
economic development, particularly in rural areas, has been limited by inad-
equate road maintenance (para. 1.17).
2.16      Road maintenance expenditures decreased from about 4.2% of Govern-
ment recurrent expenditures in FY71 to about 2.5% in FY79 due to the Govern-
ment's economic difficulties (para. 1.02) and the low priority it gave to road
maintenance in the past, in spite of considerable increases in the cost of
maintenance equipment, fuel, and bitumen:

Revenues from road user charges were almost twice what was spent on road
maintenance during FY71-79, although they were lower than the sum of mainte-
nance plus investment expenditures. In the past, the price of gasoline and
diesel fuel did not adequately reflect the economic cost of motor fuel to the
economy. Prices were raised in steps to the current level of Le 3.00/imperial
gallon (US$2.40/US gallon) for premium gasoline, Le 2.94/imperial gallon



- 11 -
(US$2.30/US gallon) for regular gasoline, and Le 1.66/imiperial gallon
(US$1.30/ US gallon) for diesel fuel.   Excise taxes presently account for
about 26% of the retail price. The equivalent import price of fuel is
US$0.98/US gallon. The 39% import duty on spare parts is low relative to
that on new vehicles (from 50 to 120%), and there are few restrictions to
their importation.
2.18      Road maintenance operations have been minimal in the last few years,
particularly on the secondary and unpaved network.  Very little of the mainte-
nance fleet is operable, except for new equipment, and iuel is very scarce.
Actual expenditures for road maintenance during the lasit three years, excluding
equipment maintenance, are estimated as follows:
FYs     Wages and Salaries       Materials and Fuel    Total
1978         3,200                       300            3,500

1980         3,200                       600            3,800
2.19      Expenditures for road maintenance are overstated in the official
statistics due to vaguely defined budget items, poor control of funds, and
diversion of resources to activities unrelated to highways. The project will
address the issue of more precisely defining the budget and identifying
those areas where expenditure of a minimum of additional funds will increase
maintenance output. Using the official statistics, it is nonetheless clear
that MOW has spent increasing percentages of its annual budget on salaries,
notwithstanding the rapid increase in fuel costs:

E. Engineering and Construction
2.20       MOW is developing the expertise and the capacity to carry out
highway and bridge design works. Until recently, preparation and supervision
of major projects were left primarily to foreign consulting firms. Recently,
MOW prepared the detailed engineering for two major projects, the Peninsula
road and the Juba bridge. MOW normally adheres to the following road classi-
fication system and geometric design standards for construction and recon-
struction of highways.
Road Classification and Design Standards

Gravel for ADT of under 150

/b   British standards are being used for the design of bridge structures.
The above standards are somewhat unbalanced 1/ and would be reviewed under the
proposed project.
2.21      Recently, the MOW built the regional airport at Kabala and the Juba
bridge by force account, while two road projects financed by the United
Kingdom were executed under management contracts with consultants. Construction
of all other major road and bridge projects has been done by foreign contract-
ing firms. Minor road and bridge projects are normally built by force account
or by local contractors.
2.22      The MOW keeps a register of local contracting firms divided into
four specialized categories (roadworks, other civil engineering works, special
and general building works) and into six financial classes according to the
contract sizes the firms can handle. The financial class limits are outdated
and are being modified. MOW-s register comprises 45 contracting firms, only
three of which qualify for roadworks.
1/   i.e., pavement too narrow (Class I); formation too narrow (all classes);
minimum horizontal radius too high (all classes); maximum grade too
high (class I, II and IV).



- 13 -
2.23      The contracting industry is in an early stage of development.
Only a few domestic contractors exist, mainly for buildiing construction.
The three locally registered road contractors are foreign owned (German,
Lebanese and French).  The current registration indicates neither ths
ownership of the companies nor the nationality of the owners, although some
nationals participate in companies owned jointly with foreign enterprises.
The domestic contracting industry is constrained by a lack of capital,
difficulties in obtaining bank guarantees, and a lack of managerial skills
and technical expertise.  Under the proposed project, a study wocild be
prepared to assess the present condition and needs of Sierra Leone's con-
struction industry and what measures need to be taken to increase the
competence and capacity of the domestic contractors (Annex 6).
2.24      Equipment intensive methods are used for force account road con-
struction or rehabilitation and for bridge works, while labor intensive
methods are used for routine maintenance (para. 2.26). Cost overruns are
frequent, since project monitoring or control is virtually non-existent. In
1975, CARE started feeder road construction using volunteer, unskilled village
labor to construct minor drainage works. The CARE program is proceeding well,
and works are of good quality. However, current construction costs total
about Le 33,000 (US$31,000) per mile, net of taxes and equipment depreciation,
which is rather high. Feeder road design standards are presently being
revised downward, wherever justified, to decrease costs. Under the proposed
project, a consultant would study the appropriate use of labor in road mainte-
nance and construction (para. 3.14). Since the minimum daily wage is US$2.90
equivalent, a larger labor input than is currently practiced may be justified.
F. Maintenance
2.25      Maintenance of the existing road network is :Lnadequate, and its
improvement through financial and technical assistance is the primary objec-
tive of the proposed project. Sierra Leone's budgetary appropriations
for road maintenance amount to about US$1,000 per mile and could have pro-
duced much better results had the monies been spent more efficiently. MOW
funds are used mainly for wage payments rather than for the purchase of fuel,
spare parts, materials and supplies (para. 2.18). In addition, maintenance
equipment is often diverted to other activities. In 1975, MOW's responsibil-
ities for road maintenance were extended to include roads built and formerly
maintained by District Councils and chieftain administrations, thus doubling
its workload without any increase in resources. This extension was not
practical.
2.26      Routine maintenance of the primary and secondary networks is carried
out irregularly by gangs of five laborers each, plus an overseer, supervised
by foremen and inspectors. The laborers walk to work and transport materials
mainly by wheel-barrow. One gang should service five miles of road, but the
work suffers from poor supervision and training, shortage of good materials,
and poor quality tools. Often the foremen and inspectors have to improvise
transport to the sites, which makes their supervision sporadic. Little



- 14 -
maintenance has been carried out on feeder roads. However, in September 1977,
the Government created a Feeder Road Maintenance Unit within MOW to be respon-
sible jointly with CARE for maintenance of feeder roads built by the latter.
A few pieces of equipment financed by USAID are now arriving for this unit.
2.27      Virtually no periodic maintenance was carried out in recent years
because of the present shortage of funds for fuel, materials and spares.  A
serious shortage of crushed stone further complicated the execution of pave-
ment works. MOW took the position that periodic maintenance of laterite roads
was uneconomical because heavy rainfall washes the gravel away after one or
two rainy seasons. MOW therefore executed only spot regravelling works and
concentrated on the improvement of laterite roads to bituminous paved standard.
In view of the current economic situation, MOW has begun to realize the
need to regravel these laterite roads, and this will be carried out under
the project. There remains the problem of what to do with the several hundred
miles of gravel roads having very high traffic levels (between 150 and 800
vehicles per day), for which paving may well be economically justified.
As a temporary measure these high volume roads would be regravelled under the
present project, pending the availability of financing for their paving.
2.28      Maintenance activities are also hampered by inadequate mechanical
workshops. Productivity is low because of excess unskilled labor, insufficient
spare parts, poor equipment utilization, and inadequate buildings. The
central and regional workshops would be strengthened under the project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      The proposed Second Highway Project would courprise the first phase
in an extended program to improve MOW's road maintenance operations. The
objective would be to increase the output of the presently overstaffed labor
force by adding light mechanized units and by ensuring funds to operate these
units. The project would also improve the efficiency of the MOW staff through
technical assistance and training. The project would be limited to three
priority operations: routine maintenance of the whole network; resealing of
selected paved roads; and rehabilitation of selected gravel roads. The second
phase, to be prepared by a study included in the proposed project, would
define the appropriate level of maintenance for each road class and implement
organizational improvements.
3.02      Accounting, budgetary and procurement improvements would also be
implemented under the proposed project. To encourage 'better supervision,
adequate compensation for field expenses will be paid to MOW's supervisory
staff (para. 3.23), which together with the managerial improvements to be
achieved under the project is expected to increase the frequency of field
visits. Stricter supervision and control of equipment should prevent much
of the equipment diversion which occurred under the First Highway Project
(para. 1.16).
3.03      The project will support Sierra Leone-s agricultural development
by helping to preserve the main links between Freetown and the provinces and
by rehabilitating the gravel trunk roads linking the provinces chief towns
to their hinterland. It will also help improve links between the feeder
roads of the Integrated Agricultural Development Project (IADP) and impor-
tant provincial centers.
B. Project Description
3.04      The proposed project would include the following elements:
(a) planning and implementing routine maintenance by force account on
the entire road network (about 4,400 mTe-s-Y,
(b) resealing by contract of about 200 miles of paved roads;
(c) rehabilitating by force account of about 371) miles of
gravel roads; and
(d) providing consultant services to train MOW's staff and to assist
in improving the efficiency of road maintenance operations and
to prepare a second phase of the maintenance program including
a study of the domestic contracting industry, and to prepare
detailed engineering studies.



- 16 -
3.05      In order to implement the project the African Development Fund (ADF)
would finance the procurement of: (i) road maintenance equipment to comple-
ment the existing fleet; (ii) spare parts for rehabilitation of existing road
maintenance equipment; (iii) workshop equipment and tools, and laboratory and
training equipment. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund)
would finance resealing by contract of selected paved roads. The Association
would finance:
(i) incremental operating costs, excluding labor, for routine
maintenance;
(ii) the foreign exchange element of operating costs for rehabilitation
of gravel roads; and
(iii) procurement of consulting services for technical assistance,
training, and studies.
Routine Maintenance
3.06      Of the over 10,000 workers who make up MOW's labor force, 5,000
are assigned to road operations and are organized into five member gangs
supervised by an overseer. This averages out to about one maintenance worker
per mile of road, which is excessive for the present maintenance output, but
would be close to normal if maintenance output increases significantly
(para. 2.26). Under the project, the gangs would be complemented by light
mechanized units for patching, grading, and minor repair, in order to increase
maintenance output, and a study to determine the optimal labor/equipment mix
would be carried out.   Staff reduction, if needed despite increased mainte-
nance output, would be implemented under a follow-up project. Annex 1 shows
the composition of the mechanized units.
3.07      Routine maintenance will be carried out as follows:
(a) paved roads: manual gangs would perform such works as clearing
bush, cleaning ditches and culverts, and maintaining shoulders,
bridges and road signs; nine patching units would fill potholes
and perform sealing and patching operations; and
(b) unpaved roads: manual gangs would fill potholes, clear bush,
clean ditches and culverts, and maintain shoulders, bridges
and road signs; ten grading units would carry out periodic grading
operations; and seven minor repair units would carry out spot
repairs on the worst sections of the roads.



- 17 -
In addition, sevea support units will exploit borrow pits and service the
equipment of the various units.  Durn g negotiations, the Gover'. me lt
agreed to furnish to the Association by September first of eacl- year, during
project implementation, for its approval, a program of routine Aaiz1Wnance
to be carried out during the next year.
3.08      Most of MOW's older equipment, delivered in 1972 und r the Uirst
Highway Project, is worn out.  The proposed project wouli pCo'Xde .-pare
parts for those pieces which are worth overhauling.  Jn 1979, MOW purchased
additional maintenance equipment under various suppliers- cred- Ls. This
equipment has now been delivered, and most would be made available to the
project. The Government agreed at negotiations that the equipyent listed in
Annex 2 would be used exclusively for purposes of the project. The project
will also finance a few key pieces of complementary equipment such as
compactors, compressors, and service equipment (Annex 3).
3.09      MOW's workshops are currently inadequate.  A large building, cur-
rently used for temporary storage of equipment, will be remodeled under the
project to become the new Freetown Central Workshop, and the existing workshop
would be refurbished as the Western Area Workshop. The new Frsetown Central
Workshop will be fully equipped and additional equipment procured tor
five area workshops under the project.
3.10      Laboratory tests will be necessary to ensure the qual-bty of the
proposed maintenance works.  MOW s soils laboratory in Freetown wili need to
play an important role but its equipment is obsolete.  The proposed project
therefore provides equipment, vehicles, and training to MOW' c Jils laboratory
to improve routine laboratory operations.  Specialized tests wuild be carried
out at the University or in existing private laboratories.
Resealing of Pave& Roads
3.11      Paved roads normally require resealing every 5-7 years, but little
work has been carried out, and there is a substantial backlog of paved roads
which require resealing. The proposed project provides for the resealing
of about 200 miles by contract. The roads will be selected with the assist-
ance of consultants to be provided under the project, with works expected to
be completed by mid-1984. The project would cover about one-quarter of
the paved network, much of which requires resealing at this time. The work
will consist of preparing the existing road and placing a surface treatment.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to the procedure for select-
ing the sections of paved roads to be resurfaced (Annex 4), and will furnish
to the Association for its approval, the program for the resealing of selected
paved roads by August 31, 1981.
Rehabilitation of Gravel Roads
3.12      Gravel or laterite roads normally require regravelling every 5 to
7 years, but only spot regravelling has been carried out in recent years
because MOW hoped to pave a substantial portion of the most heavily trafficked
roads. However, MOW was forced to abandon its paving plans because of the



- 18 -
increase in the cost of bitumen and lack of funds and has now decided to
regravel these roads. The proposed project provides for the regravelling of
about 370 miles of gravel roads. The project will cover about one-tenth of
the gravel road network, much of which requires attention at this time. The
work will be executed by force account, beginning about the end 1981 following
the arrival of equipment to be financed under the project. The Association
will finance the foreign exchange element of the direct operating costs of
the brigades. During negotiations, the Government agreed to the procedure
for selecting the sections of roads to be regravelled (Annex 4), and will
seek the approval of the Association for a program for the rehabilitation of
selected gravel roads by December 31, 1981.
Technical Assistance and Studies
3.13      Consultants will be appointed to assist in improving the planning
and the execution of road maintenance operations, executing studies, and
preparing a follow-up road maintenance program (Annex 5). The team will
include a senior highway engineer (SHE, 39 months); a training specialist
(15 months); a highway engineer (39 months); a second highway engineer (27
months); a mechanical engineer (24 months); a transport economist (24
months); and six Sierra Leonean area road engineers (AREs, 39 months each).
The consultant's team will be complemented by short-term specialists (32
man-months). They will also be supported by staff from the Technical
Assistance Project (about 29 man-months), particularly in the preparation
and early implementation of the project. The AREs will assume line posi-
tions within MOW's administration and would be responsible for road main-
tenance in their respective regions. They will report to the senior highway
engineer through their respective area engineers. The Government confirmed
this administrative arrangement at negotiations. The Government also
confirmed that, as a condition of effectiveness, it will hire consultants
satisfactory to IDA and has already requested proposals from a short list
approved by the Association during negotiations.
3.14      The consultant's principal tasks will be to review and recommend
improvements in the organizational structure and the responsibilities of
MOW, including the maintenance of feeder roads and local tracks; review and
recommend improvements to MOW's accounting and budgeting procedures and
procurement methods, and assist in implementing accepted recommendations;
review the design standards; assist MOW's laboratory personnel in their use
of new equipment and in their study of the construction materials; prepare
an improved maintenance program for the second and third years of the
project and prepare a follow-up program; and determine the most appropriate
labor/ equipment mix for road maintenance; all in accordance with the
proposed Action Plan for the project (Annex 10).
3.15      The UNDP will finance a feasibility and preliminary engineering
study, for which the Association would act as executing agency, of the
Kenema-Pendembu-Koindu road parallel to the abandoned railway. A short list
of consultants to submit proposals has already been prepared by the Associa-
tion. Detailed engineering for the economically justified section(s) of
this road, to be agreed with IDA, would be financed under the proposed
project. During negotiations, the Government agreed to this arrangement.

Recurrent Maintenance Budget
3.16      The Government spent about US$3.2 million equivalent for wages
and US$0.6 for materials 1/ for road maintenance field operations in FY80.
Expenditures for materials are inadequate but cannot readily be increased
because of the Government's severe budgetary constraints. The Association
would therefore finance a decreasing proportion of the adlditional recurrent
cost of materials required to implement the project to overcome this con-
straint and to assure that the funds are available as required (Annex 8).

3.17      During negotiations, the Government agreed to provide the above
required amounts for materials for maintenance operations.  It also con-
firmed that as a condition of credit effectiveness it would open a special
bank account to serve as a revolving fund for all expencLitures for operating
costs, excluding salaries, for maintenance and rehabilitation of gravel
roads, including amounts budgeted by the Government as well as expenditures
reimbursed under the Project. The Government agreed to establish the
account with an initial deposit of Le 0.6 million; to channel expenditures
for road maintenance through the said account, to replenish it monthly; to
increase the initial deposit to Le 1.1 million by September 1982; and
appoint external auditors satisfactory to the Association and make other
arrangements to monitor the account. During negotiations the Government
indicated that it had already taken steps to open the special account, and
that only final approval by the Cabinet remained to be completed.

3.18      The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is esti-
mated at US$27.2 million, of which US$21.4 million (79%) are foreign costs,
and US$5.8 million are local costs. The Government proposes waiving all taxes
and duties for the project, except those on fuel, which amount to about US$1.8
million. Project costs are detailed in Annex 7 and summarized in the table

3.19      The estimates of equipment prices and of the output of mechanized
units are based on data from similar projects in neighboring countries.
Estimates for consulting services are also based on experience in neighboring
countries. The cost per man-month for expatriate consultants was esLimated
to range from US$6,000 to US$8,500, exclusive of local travel and vehicles.
Salaries paid to the AREs would be determined on the basis of salaries
prevailing in the private sector in Sierra Leone. Since the project is
based on an open ended program, no physical contingencies have beent included.
Price contingencies shown below were estimated on the basis of recent trends
in local and international markets.

cost of the project, consisting of 100% of foreign costs and 26% of'local
costs. The Association will finance a declining portion of the foreign
component of recurrent maintenance costs (para. 3.16), the rehabilitation of
gravel roads, and 59% of consulting services. The OPEC Fund will finance 95%
of resealing. ADF will finance 100% of equipment costs:

condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.
D. Project Implementation
3.21      MOW will be responsible for project implementation.  The Area
Engineer has many responsibilities other than roads, and current Government
wage rates and the economic stabilization program make recruitment difficult.
Therefore, an area road engineer (ARE) able to concentrate exclusively on
road maintenance and construction would be provided to each area under the



- 23 -
project (para 3.13). 1/ The role of ARE's following com.pletion of the
project will be defined on the basis of recommendations of the Technical
Assistance Studies financed under the project. The Government has appointed
a high level civil servant in the MOW to coordinate all project matters.
3.22      With the help of the consultants and the Bank Group's Highway Design
and Maintenance Model (HDM), the MOW would further define programming criteria
for road maintenance. Each ARE would then establish an annual work program
which would be reviewed and finalized at MOW headquarters according to overall
equipment and budgetary availability, and approved by II)A. Each ARE would be
fully responsible for the manual gangs and light mechanized units executing
road maintenance in his area. He would also be fully responsible for the
maintenance and minor repairs of the equipment at the area workshop. Major
repairs and equipment overhaul would be carried out at the central workshop in
Freetown.
3.23      Improving the efficiency of routine force account maintenance
operations will be emphasized. In each Area, several inspectors will be
assigned specific road sections which they would inspect weekly for road
condition and for adequacy of maintenance works. To motivate better super-
vision, the Government agreed during negotiations, to pay adequate compensa-
tion for field allowances to MOW's staff, including supiervisors.
3.24      Resealing of paved roads will be carried out by contract to
standards satisfactory to IDA. Regravelling will be executed by force
account, with the project financing the operating costs of the brigades
exclusive of salaries.
3.25      The consultants will help the MOW review some of its internal
operating procedures. In particular, accounting, budgeting and procurement
methods would be assessed and agreed improvements implemented under the
proposed or following project.
3.26      The project would be implemented over a three and a half year
period beginning in April 1981. At negotiations, the Government agreed to
the project implementation schedule shown in Annex 9 and to the summary
action plan given in Annex 10.
E. Procurement
3.27      MOW-s requirements for non-proprietary spare parts (about US$2.6
million equivalent including Government's contribution and contingencies),
lubricants ($0.9 million), and materials ($2.1 million) for routine mainte-
nance and the rehabilitation of gravel roads would to the extent possible be
standardized and purchased in bulk under contracts awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding following Bank Group Guidelines. A
1/   Except Lungi because its road network is rather small and will be
maintained by Western Area units.



- 24 -
15% margin of preference on the import duty if lower would be granted for
goods manufactured in Sierra Leone. Proprietary spares made by the original
equipment manufacturers ($0.6 million), and fuel ($3.9 million) which is
available only from a single refinery, would be procured directly by nego-
tiated contracts satisfactory to the Association. Spare parts and materials
which cannot be conveniently grouped for bulk purchase into lots greater
than US$50,000 would be procured on the basis of local competitive bidding
procedures satisfactory to the Association up to an aggregate amount of $1.0
million equivalent. Minor items of essential and urgently needed spare
parts and materials costing less than $5,000 per purchase and aggregating
not more than $150,000, would be procured by local shopping or by direct
purchase in the case of a single local supplier. Consultants being provided
under the project will assist in the procurement process.
F. Disbursements
3.28      Disbursements from the Credit would be made for:
(a)  100% of the foreign and 15% of the local cost of consulting
services (US$2.7 million); and
(b)  67% of the cost of spare parts and materials for routine road
maintenance and rehabilitation of gravel roads (US$5.3 million).
An amount of US$2.0 would remain unallocated. Disbursements for operating
costs under (b) would be made against certified statements of expenditure
signed by MOW's project coordinator and by the SHE, the documentation for
which would be retained by the MOW for Association inspection. The Govern-
ment agreed at negotiations that it would channel expenditures for routine
maintenance and rehabilitation of gravel roads through the special account
(para. 3.17), and that it would appoint external auditors acceptable to the
Association who would audit this account annually and subniit a report to the
Association. The estimated schedule of disbursements which follows is based
on these participation rates and on the project implementation schedule
(Annex 9).

IV. ECONOMIC APPRAISAL
A. General
4.01      The proposed project, by maintaining Sierra Leone's existing road
infrastructure and upgrading part of the network, would assist the Govern-
ment's efforts to promote national self-sufficiency,stimulate agriculture,
improve accessibility, and reduce vehicle operating costs (voc). This should
encourage increased crop production, especially in areas where poor road
conditions have led to high freight tariffs, unreliable road transport and
little competition among transporters. The Government is basing its plans for
economic recovery on the agricultural sector. Investments in the agricultural
sector critically depend on adequate road transport to provide better access
to markets, to encourage commercial production, and to facilitate agricultural
services. If the economic life of the road network is shortened by neglect,
funds which might be better invested to promote agriculture or to expand the
road network would of necessity be needed to. restore the existing road net-
work. Therefore, avoiding the need for costly road reconstruction by pre-
serving the existing network will remove a potentially serious future drain
on the development budget. Moreover, the project would be the first step in
making important institutional improvements within MOW which would permit
a higher level of maintenance output to be achieved at lower cost on a
permanent basis.
4.02      The project's major impact would be on Sierra Leone's rural popula-
tion of about 2.5 million, whose estimated per capita income of about US$120
p.a. is about half the national average. Moreover, consumers would benefit
from increased availability of food, more competition between traders, and
lower transport costs. Savings from reduced road reconstruction costs would
initially accrue to the Government. By reducing vehicle operating costs, the
project should allow increases in farmgate prices and higher farm incomes.
Competitiveness among transporters varies considerably from area to area, but
increased competition among the agents licensed to buy (and transport) export
crops (coffee, cocoa, ginger) may reduce the margin between the farmgate
prices and official producer prices. More reliable road transport and
improved accessibility should assure a more regular, and thus less expensive,
flow of food supplies to urban areas and reduce the often large price dif-
ferentials between producing and consuming areas. It may also reduce the loss
of potential exports and encourage the expansion of crop production. Better
road conditions will also be necessary for improved agricultural extension
services and distribution of farm inputs needed to support rural development
throughout the country.
4.03      The economic rate of return (ERR) from the project was calculated
on the basis of voc savings resulting from resealing of 200 miles of paved
roads, regravelling of 370 miles of gravel roads, and improving the routine
maintenance of the entire 4,500 mile road network. Additional benefits from
institutional improvements, increased agricultural production, time savings,
or accident reduction were not taken into account. The ERR from the project
is estimated to be over 100%, and the benefit to cost ratio over 5:1 at a 12%
discount rate. The project is therefore estimated to be strongly justified.



- 27 -
B.   Vehicle Operating Costs and Traffic Levels
4.04      Roadway characteristics and pavement conditions were assessed by the
MOW with the help of consultants Roy Jorgensen Associates and evaluated with
the Bank Group's HDM. Traffic levels taken into account in the ERR calcula-
tion are summarized in para. 2.04. The projected rate cf traffic growth is 5%
for private cars, 4% for vans, 3% for light trucks and 2% for heavy trucks.
The traffic composition is summarized as follows:

C. Economic Rate of Return
4.05      Although the 200 miles of roads to be resurfaced and the 370 miles
to be regravelled are not yet identified, it was assumed that those roads with
the highest traffic and roughness index in 1979 would be selected with the
exception of 60 miles of paved roads which require reconstruction. The road
network was divided into links according to surface characteristics, traffic
levels, and initial condition.
4.06      Without the project, MOW would be expected to carry out only manual
bush and ditch clearing, pothole filling with gravel, some grading, and some
bituminous pothole filling. With the project, MOW was assumed to be able to
carry out some spot regravelling, about 370 miles of continuous regravelling,
regular grading, 200 miles of resurfacing, and more regular patching of paved
roads (Annex 11).
4.07      Capital costs include investment in equipment, spare parts, workshop
tools, regravelling, patching and resurfacing operaticns, and technical
assistance, together amounting to 98% of project costs. The economic life



- 28 -
of the project has been estimated at 8 to 9 years, based on the expected
average life of the equipment to be purchased and of resurfacing and re-
gravelling works to be performed. It is also assumed that: medium traffic
paved roads not resealed under the project would be resealed in 1984 and
1985.  Recurrent maintenance expenditures were assumed not to surpass US$12
million p.a., and capital expenditures were constrained to the size of the
proposed IDA, OPEC and ADF loans.
4.08      The benefit/cost ratio of the project is estimated to be 5:1.  The
ERR is estimated to be over 100%, while the net present value computed with a
12% discount rate is about US$190 million:

The low rate of return on the medium traffic paved roads is due to the lack
of money for resealing these roads under the project. The patching that
will be performed gives only very small improvements in roughness and hence
in voc but keeps the road's base and subbase intact for resealing under
a possible future project.
Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
4.09      The project remains justified even with large changes in the input
parameters. If the discount rate were increased to 18%, the net present value
would be US$176 million. If costs increase 100%, the ERR ifor the whole
project remains above 100%, and for heavily trafficked paved roads, above
55%. The medium trafficked paved roads can only stand cost: increases of about
40% before their rate of return falls below 10% (para 4.08). Sensitivity to
traffic growth assumptions indicates that even with zero traffic growth and a
simultaneous 100% increase in costs, the rate of return for the whole project
still remains above 100% (Annex 12).

4.10      The principal project risks are that the Government would not be
able to achieve the planned institutional improvements cr provide the neces-
sary recurrent funds to increase its maintenance output. However, as can be
seen from the above sensitivity analysis, even if only half of the planned
maintenance work were performed, the rate of return would still remain above
100%. This reflects both the incremental nature common to any maintenance
project which yields such high returns because maintenance outlays are rela-
tively small expenditures necessary to achieve the benefits of much larger
past investments.

V. RECOIMENDATIONS
5.01       During negotiations, the Government agreed that, as a condition of
effectiveness, it will:
(i)  hire consultants, satisfactory to the Association, to assist in the
execution of the project (para. 3.13);
(ii) fulfill conditions precedent to effectiveness for co-financing
agreements with ADF and the OPEC Fund (para. 3.20); and
(iii) open a Special Account in a bank, with arrangements satisfactory
to the Association and make an initial deposit of Le 0.6 million
(para. 3.17).
5.02      During negotiations, the Government agreed:
(i)  by September 1 of each year during project implementation, to
furnish to the Association, for its approval, a program of
routine maintenance to be carried out during the next year
(para 3.07);
(ii) that specified maintenance equipment will be used exclusively
for purposes of the project (para. 3.08, Annexes 2 and 3);
(iii) to the procedure for selecting the sections of paved roads to
be resurfaced and of gravel roads to be regravelled and by
August 31, 1981 and December 31, 1981, respectively, to furnish to
the Association, for its approval, programs for the resealing of
selected paved roads and the rehabilitation of selected gravel roads
(paras 3.11 and 3.12);
(iv) that sections of the Kenema-Koindu road to be studied would be
selected by mutual agreement on the basis of their economic priority
following completion of the UNDP feasibility study (para. 3.15);
(v)  to provide the required amounts for material for maintenance
operations, to channel all expenditures for routine maintenance and
rehabilitation works through the above Special Account, to replenish
it regularly and to increase the advance deposit in the revolving
fund from Le 0.6 million to Le 1.1 million by September 1982 and
to appoint external auditors and make other arrangements to monitor
the account (para. 3.17);
(vi) to pay adequate field allowances to MOW's staff carrying out the
project, including supervisors (para. 3.23); and
(vii) the project implementation schedule and summary action plan (para.
3.26).
5.03       With these agreements, the proposed project is suitable for a
credit of US$10.0 million to the Government of Sierra Leone on standard IDA
terms.

SIERRA LEONE
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Procedure for Selection of Sections to be Resealed or Regravelled
A. Sections of paved roads to be resealed
1.       Between May 15 and July 31, 1981, the Senior Highway Engineer (SHE),
with the help of the Area Road Engineers (AREs) and the Highway Engineers
of the Consultants' team, will study the sections of the paved network
to be resealed (page 4).
2.       The study would determine:
(i) the breakdown of the paved network into homogenesous sections;
(ii) for each section, the date of construction, the type, age, state
and thickness of each layer of the pavement, the width of the
pavement and the shoulders, the length of the section, its
average rise and fall and curvature, and a description of its
present state with indications of the average roughness and
percentage of cracking (sections which are unlikely to be selec-
ted may be more simply described);
(iii) for each section, the materials available and the type of surface
treatment recommended;
(iv)  a traffic analysis based on MOW past counts, updated and comple-
mented by new counts where appropriate, which would be carried
out under the consultants' supervision; and
(v) a proposed resealing program listing the first priority 200 miles
of roads to be resealed during mid 1982/mid 1984; also a list of
the second priority of about 100 miles of roads to be resealed
later; the sections of the first list should have a higher economic
priority than those of the second list, but a detailed economic
evaluation would not be required unless sections with excep-
tionally low traffic or high cost are included in the first list.
3.       On August 1, 1981, MOW will submit the Consultants' resealing program
to a committee for review and comments. The committee, chaired by MOW's
Professional Head, will include representatives of the MDEP, the Deputy
Professional Head, the Chief Engineer Highway, the Chief Engineer Highway
Maintenance, the Area Engineers, the SHE, the Highway Engineer of the
consultant team, and the Technical Assistance Project Team.
4.       After the Program has been reviewed and commented upon, MOW
will submit it together with the committee's comments to IDA and the OPEC
Fund for their review and approval.
5.       By July 31, 1981, the draft tender documents for International Competitive
Bidding on the resealing works shall have been prepared by the SHE with the
help of the Highway Engineers and a short term procurement expert. As soon as



-37-                      ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 4
the resealing program is approved, the documents wilL be finalized.  For the
preparatory patching and drainage and for resealing works including produc-
tion and transport of aggregates, these documents wiLl include:
(i) irnstructions to tenderers and tender submission form;
(ii)  general conditions of contract and contract form;
(iii) technical drawings;
(iv)  bill of quantities; and
(v) technical specifications.
6.       MOW will submit the tender documents to IDA and to the OPEC
Fund for review and approval.
7.       The bidding process will immediately follow the approval of the
tender documents.
B. Sections of Gravel Roads to be Regravelled
Before the end of October 1981, the SHE, with the help of the
Economist, the Highway Engineer and the AREs, will study the sections
of the gravel network to be regravelled (page 4).
9.       The study would determine:
(i) the breakdown of the gravel road network inlto homogeneous sections;
(ii)  an estimate of the area of influence of each section, its population,
the principal economic activity of the area such as crop production,
fishing, forestry, services, etc., and some measure of their output;
(iii) for each section, the materials available and the proposed standard
for regravelling;
(iv)  a traffic analysis based on past counts, updated andcomplemented by
new counts as appropriate, to be supervised by the consultants; and
(v)  a regravelling program listing the first priority 370 miles of roads
to be regravelled and the second priority of about 150 miles to be
regravelled later; based on a summary calculation, the first priority
roads should have a higher economic priority than the second priority
roads, but a detailed economic evaluation would not be required
unless sections with particularly low traffic or high cost are
included in the first list. Consideration should be given to the
possibility of upgrading some high trafficked gravel roads to
paved standards under a possible future project.



_38-
Annex 4
Page 3 of 4
10.       In October 1981, MOW will submit the regravelling program to the
committee defined in paragraph 3 of this Annex.
11.       After the committee has reviewed and commented upon the program,
MOW will submit the program and the committee's comments to IDA for review
and approval.

SIERRA LEONE
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for
Study of Domestic Civil Works Contracting Industry
(To be executed by the Senior Highway Engineer/team leader wgith the assis-
tance of the Economist and a Construction Industry Expert to be procured on a
short term basis).
A.   BACKGROUND
1.        The Government wants domestic contractors to participate in
carrying out future periodic highway maintenance, rehabilitation, and
construction works in Sierra Leone. A study would be prepared to assess
the present condition and needs of Sierra Leone's construction industry.
The study should determine what measures need to be taken to increase the
competence and capacity of the domestic contractors in order that they might
qualify as road contractors in Sierra Leone.
B.   OBJECTIVES
2.        The objective of the study is to prepare a program for the streng-
thening of the domestic construction industry so that it will be able to
carry out road works in type, volume, and technology appropriate to the
country's economic and social requirements.
C.   SCOPE OF THE STUDY
3.        The study should include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a) a review and consolidation of the available data concerning types,
volume and applied technology of civil works (including relevant,
locally produced building materials) carried out by:
(i) Government agencies;
(ii) domestic contractors;
(iii) locally based foreign contractors; and
(iv) international contractors during the last years (at least the
1970s);
(b)  the preparation of an estimate of civil works in general and
of the road works in particular to be executed for each of the years
1982-1987, and an estimate of the order of magnitude for the subse-
quent five years, detailed as to type and volume of works and
technology to be applied as well as the suitability for contracting;
(c) an investigation of the development and present status of the
domestic construction industry with regard to contractors' financial
situation, availability of capital and credit, inventory of equipment



ANNEX 6
Page 2 Of 2
and staff, technical assistance, applied technology and any other
data required to evaluate the industry;
(d) an estimation of the volume and type of civil works (including
production of road construction materials such as stone aggregates)
Which it is feasible and economically desirable to have carried out
by domestic contractors during the next five to ten years;
(e) an assessment as to whether the volume of civil works indicated
under (d) above can best be met by expansion of existing construc-
tion firms, participation of building contractors, or establishment
of new enterprises (in this context, the team leader should determine
the appropriate technology to be applied. and investigate the need
for and desirability of creating an equipment rental company);
(f) an investigation of present laws and Government procedures relevant
to the public works sector, particularly with regard to prequalifi-
cation of contractors, bidding, and award of contracts;
(g) a review of standard contract documents and a recommendation
of needed changes where these are not equitable; also a review of
Government's standard procedure for payment of ccontractor's invoices;
(h) a list of suggested improvements to existing private and public
institutions to provide the industry at all levels with training,
technical assistance, insurance, bank guarantees and financing;
(i) a determination of technical assistance needed, including training,
to contractors on work costing, accounting, bidding, work planning,
management, equipment usage and maintenance, and quality control;
and
(j) a report proposing strategy, and a detailed action program to
promote the domestic construction industry.
D.   STAFF REQUIREMENTS
4.        The staffing requirements are estimated t:o total about five
man-months:
(i) Senior Highway Engineer/team leader, one man-month;
(ii) Economist, one man-month; and
(iii) Construction Industry Expert, three man-months.
