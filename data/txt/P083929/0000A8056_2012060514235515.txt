                         To improve the viability and effectiveness of urban services provided by the participating TMAs, and to make such improvements sustainable and replicable in other
                         TMAs through the creation of a performance-based management framework at both TMA and provincial levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Institutional Development Component under the project has made substantial gains in improving the capacity of TMAs to fulfill their mandates, and along with the infrastructure
                         sub-projects, has enabled TMAs to invest in enhanced service delivery in a managed and sustainable manner. A longer term PMSIP impact is now setting in, as a culture of
                         performance management takes root at the municipal level while a culture of performance oversight is taking root at the provincial level. Since the last mission, there has been
                         significant achievement in the scaling up of Institutional Development (ID) activities in 105 TMAs across Punjab, with an additional 68 TMAs brought under the projects fold compared
                         to the initial 37 which had previously been the beneficiaries of ID activities.

                         PMSIP has also shown considerable progress under the infrastructure development component with 20 sub-projects physically completed, while 10 are at various stages of
                         completion. The pace of implementation / completion of infrastructure development sub-projects undertaken by partner TMAs in PMSIP’s second and third subproject cycles has
                         gradually but significantly improved, owing to improved contract management practices and procedures. This is likely to improve even further with the ongoing sub-projects. The

                         number of current and potential beneficiaries of completed PMSIP sub-projects amount to more than 2.3 million. This number will significantly increase after the completion of the
                         remaining ongoing sub-projects.

                         The Cultural Heritage component essentially constitutes a pilot intervention in the Walled City of Lahore, and at project appraisal was envisaged to be strategically deliberated and
                         refined during implementation. Physical implementation has recently commenced following completion of detailed preparatory activities, and piloting of methods and processes in two
                         neighborhood lanes. These have provided valuable lessons for implementation of the main project.
