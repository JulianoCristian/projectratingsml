The results\n            have translated into more water connections and better waste\n            handling for households and a more responsive complaints\n            resolution system. It is expected that the tools developed\n            by the project, and gains coming from them, will be\n            institutionalized at the provincial level in the Punjab\n            through support from key stakeholders. This model is\n            replicable in other provinces of Pakistan as well, with\n            Sindh already using it with some variations through a\n            project funded by the Asian Development Bank."}, "docdt": "2012-05-09T05:01:05Z"}
