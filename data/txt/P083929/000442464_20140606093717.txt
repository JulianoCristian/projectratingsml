 There is a discrepancy in the wording of the PDO in the PAD and the legal documents. The PDO in the PAD has
been used for the purposes of this ICRR following the ICRR Guidelines (updated on 10/05/2011), since it more
closely reflects the tracked results and better describes stakeholders' perceptions of what the project set out to
achieve.

                  the capacity and experience developed at TMAs through delivering infrastructure sub-
                  projects under PMSIP will enable them to effectively manage future service delivery
                  investments. Refer to intermediate outcome indicators below for supporting results

  The PDO Indicators are mostly qualitative. PMSIP was designed as a demand-driven project, and at the time of
Appraisal, the type of investments that would accrue or the scope and depth of institutional development support
that would be provided to TMAs was not entirely predictable.

                  Results from the independent third-party survey of beneficiary perceptions provides
                  strong evidence of the increased satisfaction of beneficiary groups from service delivery
                  improvements resulting from 14 infrastructure investments under PMSIP:
                   a) Majority of the beneficiaries reported that both quantity and quality of water
                       supplied by TMAs have improved or significantly improved (households with piped
                       connections to clean drinking water in 11 participating TMAs increased from 40 to
                       53%).
Comments           b) A significant majority of respondents were satisfied that investments in roads had
(incl. %               improved access, travel times, vehicle maintenance costs, fuel consumption, and
achievement)           business opportunities.
                   c) A significant majority of respondents confirmed improvement in primary collection,
                       transportation, and disposal of solid waste as well as overall cleanliness of their
                       neighborhoods (disposal of solid waste at sanitary landfills increased from 0 to 74%
                       in the 6 participating TMAs).

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    The rapid urban transition in Pakistan could contribute even more to the pace of the
country's economic growth and poverty reduction, if cities did not suffer from severe
infrastructure bottlenecks, service deficiencies, poor local governance, and inefficiencies in land
and housing markets. Shortfalls in urban services are not merely an outcome of aggregate
resource constraints, but are linked to constraints in the institutional, governance, and financial
arrangements. Punjab has continued to recognize the potential role of cities in economic growth,
and the need to make available adequate resources for investment in infrastructure and delivery
of services.

2.     Devolution and Local Governments: Government's 2001 Devolution of Power Program
represented a unique opportunity to address key constraints in urban management and service
delivery. It established new legal and administrative structures at the local level, and the
framework for devolving service functions. The Punjab Local Government Ordinance (PLGO)
2001 resulted in establishing 144 Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs) and 5 City District
Governments (including 39 of the 144 TMAs under them). It gave the responsibility of
municipal service provision to the TMAs, and of monitoring the TMAs in the provision of
services to the provincial government. TMAs had to immediately acquire the technical and
management expertise needed to deliver services, while the provincial government had to change
its focus from service provision to monitoring and oversight. Critical issues that faced the urban
sector in the Punjab, particularly in the backdrop of the devolution program, included:
a) TMA Capacity and Systems: TMAs, as new institutions, faced significant problems with
     respect to strategic, spatial, and investment planning.
b) Service Delivery: Many TMAs struggled to keep services going, and did not have the
     technical capacity or financial resources to plan for and implement new investments.
c) Provincial Government Capacity: While GoPunjab had been monitoring budget inputs and
     disbursements through financial and audit functions, formal systems and reporting
     mechanisms to evaluate TMA financial and service performance and outcomes were
     unavailable.

3.   Cultural Heritage Management: There was a growing and widely shared recognition that
Cultural Heritage (CH) assets had a rich economic potential that could contribute to reduce
poverty and trigger economic activity through cultural tourism10. However, this was complicated
by the multiplicity of institutional mandates at various levels of government and the legislative
frameworks governing conservation, restoration, and maintenance of historic assets in Punjab.



10
     Italian Trust-funded, Bank-executed study on Sustainable Development of WCL had recently been completed.


                                                        1
4.   Rationale for Bank’s Assistance: Four years after the government’s new devolution of
powers program was initiated, the practical capacity constraints for the TMAs to deliver on their
urban management and service delivery mandates were being recognized, and limitations on the
provincial capacity to monitor and oversee TMA performance had become apparent. This
represented an opportune time for the Bank to support the process underway in the Punjab
through a focused operation.

5.    The project set out to assist TMAs and the provincial government in implementing the
concept of performance management in their operations. Eligible TMAs would be invited to
participate in the project based on their performance since establishment, and their continued
eligibility to participate in the project would be based on achieving agreed targets. By designing
and implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation system, the project would contribute to
the provincial government’s ability to carry out its oversight and enabling role envisaged under
PLGO.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.    The objective of the project was to improve the viability and effectiveness of urban
services provided by the participating TMAs, and to make such improvements sustainable and
replicable in other TMAs through the creation of a performance-based management framework
at both TMA and provincial levels11.

7.    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were:

a) Improved effectiveness and financial and technical viability of urban services provided by
   participating TMAs.
b) Rising levels of satisfaction among key stakeholder groups with respect to services targeted
   under the project and improvement in selected service delivery indicators.
c) GoPunjab’s improved capacity to monitor TMA performance.
d) GoPunjab’s improved capacity to manage cultural heritage assets.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification



11
  There is a discrepancy in the wording of the PDO in the PAD and the legal documents. The PDO in the PAD has
been used for the purposes of this ICRR following the ICRR Guidelines (updated on 10/05/2011), since it more
closely reflects the tracked results and better describes stakeholders' perceptions of what the project set out to
achieve.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.    The primary beneficiaries of the Project were:

a) An estimated 1.66 million 12 urban residents of 29 towns would benefit from improved
   municipal infrastructure and services provided through the performance grants.
b) Urban residents of towns where the Project contributed to improvements in TMA operational
   systems and business practices in areas such as participatory planning, complaint registration
   and tracking, effective monitoring of municipal services’ coverage and quality, information
   dissemination through TMA websites, etc.
c) Residents of the area in the Walled City of Lahore where the pilot project would be
   implemented.

1.5 Original Components

10. The project consisted of two components: (a) capacity grants and development grants to
TMAs; and (b) technical assistance to the Punjab Provincial Government.

11. Component One: Support for TMAs - Capacity and Development Grants: Capacity
Grants would finance needed improvements in TMAs’ systems and business procedures in the
areas of urban planning, financial management (including budget management), investment
planning for service delivery, and operation and maintenance. Development Grants would
finance infrastructure investments (“sub-projects”) in the TMAs, which would be awarded based
on performance of the TMAs.

12. Component Two: Support for Other Institutions - Capacity Building and Other
Activities: This component was to: (a) support capacity building of the Local Government and
Rural Development Department (LG&RDD) 13 ; (b) assist in capacity enhancement of the
Planning and Development Department. (P&DD), including the newly established Urban Unit
(UU)14 responsible for implementing the Cultural Heritage component; and (c) support PMDFC
in adding to its capacity through contracting consultant services on a need basis.




12
   This estimate is based on a systematic determination of the coverage area of each infrastructure investment, using
GIS maps of the urban center where the sub-projects were implemented.
13
   Later renamed as Local Government and Community Development Department (LG&CDD)
14
  The GoPunjab transferred implementation responsibility of the cultural heritage sub-component from the Urban
Unit to the Sustainable Development of Walled City of Lahore (SDWCL) unit, also established under the P&DD.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

14. The Project was restructured twice. In August 2010, following the Mid-Term Review
(MTR), successful institutional development activities were extended to a broader set of TMAs
to ensure consolidation of benefits, and sustainability of achievements. In addition, a number of
interim outcome indicators15 were added to support monitoring and evaluation of impacts at the
TMA level. The loan closing date was extended by twenty three months from December 31,
2010 to November 30, 2012 to enable Institutional Development activities to be implemented
over a larger universe of TMAs.

15. The Project was restructured again in November 2012 with the closing date extended from
November 30, 2012 to November 30, 2013 primarily to ensure that the institutional reforms
introduced in TMAs were embedded in their systems, particularly in the TMAs which became
partners since late 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16. Project Preparation: The Project was conceived as an incentive fund for TMAs willing to
improve their performance. A variety of customized capacity building interventions were
supported to enhance TMAs’ ability to deliver on their mandates, and the provincial
government’s capacity to monitor TMA performance. High-performing TMAs were given the
incentive of investment grants for municipal sector sub-projects prioritized through a planning
process. The Project also aimed to assist the provincial government in instituting improved
legislative and institutional frameworks to manage cultural heritage assets.

17. Project preparation used a participatory approach through extensive consultations with
provincial agencies, as well as reform-minded mayors and officials of seven TMAs. The Bank
engaged proactively with these stakeholders to understand and effectively address operational
constraints, and optimally respond to their needs to reinforce ownership.

18. Project Design: Project design drew on a number of important lessons from similar
operations elsewhere, in particular:



This, in the later years of the Project, was transformed into the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA)
established under the Walled City of Lahore Act (2012) which the Project assisted to develop.

                                                   4
a) A key lesson was that ‘greater borrower ownership and a longer term commitment of
   resources for technical assistance/training are required for making sustainable institutional
   improvements’. Support provided to TMAs under the capacity grants sub-component pursued
   a comprehensive institutional development approach to enable TMAs to effectively deliver
   on their urban management and municipal service delivery mandates. This included
   introduction of systems and business processes that helped in making TMAs efficient and
   accountable, as well as training a large number of TMA staff from management and
   operational tiers, mainly through hands-on trainings on the improved systems and processes
   introduced, along with conventional classroom learning.
b) At the provincial level, a key lesson was that ‘specific initiatives need to be supported by the
   introduction of performance-based incentive structures’. Systems for performance
   management at TMAs were therefore designed to allow integration and vertical linkage to
   the provincial performance monitoring system. This has allowed PMDFC and LG&CDD to
   effectively receive and compare performance statistics across all partner TMAs. Better
   performing TMAs were to be rewarded through Development Grants for undertaking priority
   infrastructure investments. In the later years, when the time remaining to undertake full sub-
   projects was inadequate, better performing TMAs were given grants against submission of
   Service Improvement Plans (SIPs) for equipment to improve operations and maintenance of
   infrastructure and services.
c) At the Project level, ‘effective project monitoring systems’ were mainstreamed by
   operationalizing performance management systems at the Provincial and TMA levels. As a
   result, province-wide statistics for agreed municipal service delivery indicators (such as
   volume of solid waste collected and percentage of street lights working in TMAs) are
   regularly being reported and made available for the first time in the country16.
d) Other lessons related to support towards infrastructure sub-projects include: ‘local
   governments have a comparative advantage over provincial governments in project
   identification, development, appraisal, and execution’; ‘assistance to local governments
   should be demand-driven’; ‘municipalities should also contribute to capital costs of their
   sub-projects’; and, ‘local ownership of sub-projects through participation in identification
   and prioritization  by key stakeholders is essential for success’. The Project undertook the
   planning and execution of infrastructure development interventions through a devolved
   model, making TMAs responsible for the execution of physical works and contracts, with
   support from PMDFC. TMAs were required to make a 15% upfront contribution against the
   total cost of each infrastructure sub-project undertaken. Execution of physical works
   contracts was managed by the TMAs, thereby building their operational capacity and
   experience in project and contract management.

e) A key lesson incorporated in the Project design related to ‘project size and complexity should
   be aligned with implementation, planning, and technical capacity.’ PMSIP’s implementation
   model was based on the concept of starting small, learning lessons, and scaling up.

19. Risks and Mitigation Strategies: The detailed participatory process employed during
Project preparation allowed better identification of major risks to implementation outcomes as
well as appropriate mitigation measures.

a) Low Procurement Capacity in TMAs was identified as the primary concern at entry.
   Procurement responsibilities for the TMA component were therefore designed to facilitate
   capacity building and systems strengthening. Goods and services were procured by PMDFC
   on behalf of the TMAs, while works were procured by TMAs, with PMDFC assistance. Over
   the course of the project, TMAs became familiar with procurement requirements and gained
   confidence in carrying them out, as well as managing works contracts. PMSIP was
   instrumental in bringing about positive changes in the works procurement regime in Punjab,
   including building the capacity of TMAs, as well as contractors and consultants, in contract
   management and project implementation.
b) The Project initially faced Contract Management Issues on works contracts, as contractors
   were hired by respective TMAs while the supervision firm was hired by PMDFC. Standard
   Operations Procedures (SOPs) were developed at the MTR stage to streamline the
   management of civil works contracts, including adequate documentation of completion,
   payments, time extensions, variation orders, imposition of liquidated damages, and
   termination of contracts. The SOPs also addressed the management of consultancy contracts,
   including adjustments to staff allocation, time extensions etc.
c) Another key risk highlighted during project preparation was low response from contractors
   due to market conditions. The heightened construction activity and rapidly escalating and
   volatile prices of construction materials due to the post-earthquake reconstruction, which
   commenced during the early stages of the Project, resulted in this risk being realized.
   PMDFC organized a series of workshops with potential bidders, and reflected some of their
   concerns in contract documents, which resulted in increased numbers of bids. PMDFC
   continued to proactively assess the market, adjusted bidding documents to optimize
   competition, maintained a roster of participating contractors, and disseminated procurement
   information on PMDFC and TMAs’ websites. It also took steps to debar non-performing
   contractors, which is unusual in Pakistan. As a result of these actions, while the first three
   rounds of bidding saw limited response, participation of bidders doubled during
   implementation.

20. Quality at Entry: Taking into account the Project context, design, risk identification and
mitigation, and evidence of their appropriateness during implementation, Quality at Entry was
satisfactory. However, in view of the discrepancy in the wording of the PDO in the PAD and the



                                               6
legal documents, and the use of qualitative PDO–level indicators, Quality at Entry is rated
‘Moderately Satisfactory’.

21. The primary objective of the project i.e., improving the viability and effectiveness of urban
services provided by the participating TMAs was clearly defined, and project design/components
supported the achievement of the stated objective. Loan allocations to components allowed
flexibility and the ability to respond to emerging needs, based on the demand-driven concept
underpinning the Project. Involvement of communities through participatory demand based
planning provided for greater beneficiary ownership. The weak capacity of new local
government structures was addressed through a menu of capacity building interventions and
through support for procurement and project management. Implementation of infrastructure
investments through TMAs facilitated building their capacity for future investments. The use of
standard monitoring mechanisms, implemented as integrated databases at all participating
TMAs, enabled the regular collection of key service delivery statistics across TMAs.

22. The objective of making such improvements sustainable and replicable in other TMAs
through the creation of a performance-based management framework at both TMA and
provincial levels was achieved through capacity enhancements at the TMA and provincial levels,
as well as by operationalizing a web-based performance monitoring system at both levels.

2.2 Implementation

23. Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) reports rated progress towards achieving the DO
as satisfactory throughout. However, between end-2008 and mid-2011 implementation progress
was rated moderately satisfactory, primarily due to lower disbursements against projected
targets. However, the problem was overcome through focused attention to issues causing the
lag, including concerted capacity building in contract and project management in PMDFC and
TMAs. On completion, almost 98% of the loan was disbursed.

24.   Key events which had a significant impact on implementation were:

a) Low Market Response: While a number of sub-projects were ready for bidding at Project
   Effectiveness, low market response to invitations to bid due to the massive post-2005
   earthquake reconstruction in Pakistan, caused substantial implementation delays and low
   initial disbursements. Proactive measures from PMDFC (described above) resulted in
   significant improvements.
b) Frequent Staff Turnover in TMAs: Frequent staff turnover in TMAs resulted in the erosion
   of capacities painstakingly built in TMAs, particularly after the new government transferred
   key officials in every TMA after taking office in 2008. Capacity building of officials was
   thereafter expanded to also cover the non-transferable second tier TMA staff to ensure
   sustainable institution building.



                                               7
c) Piloting of Institutional Development (ID) Interventions: The Project pioneered the
   development, operationalization, and testing of an innovative toolkit, customized to the needs
   of urban governance institutions. The toolkit was initially deployed at 19, and then a further
   18, partner TMAs which enabled their fine-tuning and customization. At MTR, structured
   feedback gathered from TMA officials confirmed their value and efficacy. Both classroom
   and hands-on training was provided on the improved systems and processes introduced. The
   successful piloting of Institutional Development interventions generated enthusiastic
   demand, and provided a strong foundation for subsequent scaling up and integration.
d) Infrastructure Investments: Weak TMA capacity for procurement of works and
   project/contract management during the initial period impacted sub-project implementation,
   and resulted in disbursements under the performance grants component being severely
   behind target at the MTR stage.
e) Mid-Term Review (MTR): The Project MTR highlighted issues that resulted in low
   disbursements: US$13 million against the target US$45 million. A comprehensive
   assessment of institutional development interventions carried out for the MTR established
   that institutional development interventions were contributing to the achievement of the
   PDO, although (as discussed earlier) turnover of key TMA officials was a significant issue.
f) Project Restructuring: A Level-2 project restructuring was undertaken after the mid-term
   review (MTR) to build on the significant gains achieved and to address critical impediments
   by:
    Scaling-up of Institutional Development (ID) interventions to include 105 TMAs across
       the province (all TMAs in Punjab except those in the five City District Governments17)
       to:
       o Address frequent staff turnover, by making ID interventions universal across all TMAs.
       o Ensure full institutionalization of improved practices across all TMAs.
       o Enable the provincial government to utilize standardized and integrated oversight and
         accountability mechanisms deployed in all TMAs.
    Initiatives to Improve Project- and Contract- Management Regime at TMA level to:
       o Accelerate the pace of sub-project implementation.
       o Enhance capacities of TMAs by inculcating modern contract management standards
         and practices in the execution of development works.

25. While the Project had already scaled up the ID interventions from the original 19 to 37
TMAs, these measures aimed to fully harness available opportunities to enhance the scope of
project interventions, accelerate disbursements, and ensure a broader impact. Weaknesses
identified in the management of infrastructure investments were addressed through Contract
Management SOPs, trainings, and technical. The above measures enabled:


17
  For the 39 TMAs in the City District Governments, another Bank-funded project (Punjab Cities Governance
Improvement Project) was under preparation; and is currently being implemented.


                                                   8
a) Improved Pace of Infrastructure Investments post-MTR: The project successfully delivered
   an increasing number of investments over the remainder of the project period.
b) Integration of Institutional Development (ID) Interventions: The scaling up of capacity
   grants was aimed to achieve a standardized and integrated performance-management system
   across the province. Institutional development interventions (such as FMS, CTS, PMS, and
   TMA websites) aided in enhancing accountability of urban local governments to the citizens
   and the provincial government. The integrated suite of performance monitoring solutions
   allowed PMDFC and LG&CDD to effectively receive and compare performance statistics
   across all partner TMAs. Better performing TMAs were rewarded through investment grants,
   and in later years, Service Improvement Plan (SIP) grants were provided to TMAs that
   achieved agreed service improvement targets.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

26. The Project helped develop M&E systems in the TMAs, LG&CDD, and PMDFC. Data
collected for outcome and output indicators was reported through an agreed reporting format;
and regular progress monitoring reports, quarterly financial management reports, progress
against key performance indicators, and other requisite information was shared. These
arrangements worked in a satisfactory manner as reflected in the ISRs. The Task Team
periodically conducted site visits to monitor implementation progress, compliance with
environmental and social safeguards, and engaged with all stakeholders on benefits achieved
from interventions. Since visits during missions could cover only a few TMAs, the Bank team
held detailed technical workshops with partner TMAs on benefits of Project interventions to
them, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.

27. Project M&E systems took advantage of the extensive data gathering capability of the
institutional development tools deployed at TMAs. In particular, data generated regularly by the
Performance Management System (PMS) allowed the establishment of a set of intermediate
outcome indicators related to municipal service delivery with consistent baselines. Target values
for indicators were set for individual TMAs, in consultation with concerned TMA officials,
taking into account these baseline values.

28. PMSIP was designed as a demand-driven project, and at the time of Appraisal, the type of
investments that would accrue or the scope and depth of institutional development support that
would be provided to TMAs was not entirely predictable. The PDO Indicators are therefore
mostly qualitative. A number of intermediate outcome indicators were added to the Project’s
Results Framework through the post-MTR restructuring, to measure progress on the scaling up
of institutional development activities. The scaling up of the capacity grants sub-component also
enabled the regular collection of performance statistics related to municipal services, such as
solid waste collection and street lights.



                                               9
29. The Project also employed two instruments to comprehensively evaluate the achievement
of PDO level results18. Institutional Development Assessment Surveys were administered to all
relevant officials at the Tehsil level: in 19 TMAs before the MTR and 37 TMAs (including 19 of
first round) in 2012. A Beneficiary Perception Survey on Infrastructure Investments was
administered in 2012-13 by an external consulting firm, to gauge beneficiary satisfaction levels
with completed infrastructure investments. These have generated evidence for the qualitative
evaluation of the achievement of PDO-level and associated indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: Satisfactory
30. The Project was assigned Environmental Category A due to potential investments in solid
waste management, sewage disposal, and substantial resettlement in the cultural heritage sub-
component. Social safeguards were implemented in a satisfactory manner through two major
instruments – the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which applied
mainly to Development Grants under Component-1, and a Resettlement Framework for the
cultural heritage-related interventions under Component-2. Both instruments played an
important contributory role in achieving all four Key Performance Indicators, especially the
fourth on management of cultural heritage assets.

31. The ESMF was used to screen all development grants for their anticipated environmental
and social impacts, and included extensive public consultations with multiple categories of
stakeholders (such as for a landfill site in Dunyapur, and a solid waste management project in
Liaqatpur). This strengthened PMDFC’s technical capacity to screen and apply social
safeguards, and to include citizens’ voices in project planning. TMA’s capability was enhanced
through training and capacity building measures. Under Component-2, a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) was implemented in the Walled City pilot project area. The Sustainable
Development of the Walled City (SDWCL) unit was able to successfully pilot resettlement
planning and benefit sharing initiatives in a complex urban environment. Some 147 shops and
264 encroachments were removed, and 732 shops were provided temporary support. The scale
of consultations was significant, with more than a thousand meetings conducted during RAP
implementation. Through creating a replicable model of resettlement and citizen engagement in
urban cultural heritage conservation, the project has created a demonstration effect and built staff
capacity to manage social issues in a complex setting.

32. PMDFC had a robust environmental safeguards management system, exercised due
diligence of Pakistan and Punjab environmental regulations, and implemented site specific
mitigation measures identified and designed in environmental management plans. All 37 sub-
projects that were subject to Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) environmental

                                                         10
permission processes received approvals. Environmental safeguards aspects of sub-projects were
managed in compliance with relevant Bank environment policies. Moreover, PMDFC
implemented a number of actions beyond the regulatory requirements, including strengthening of
TMAs’ environmental management capacity, public hearings for sub-projects, and training
sessions on environmental management and occupational health and safety. PMDFC also
institutionalized procedures for consultation with stakeholders, including vulnerable groups, on
project activities. Compliance with environmental safeguards was demonstrated by
improvements in water quality monitoring. Results from the Beneficiary Perception Survey
confirm a significant improvement in water quality.

33. PMSIP also assisted in developing the capacity of Punjab EPD in a number of areas
including: (a) developing checklists for, and conduct of, public hearings and consultations, now
routinely followed by EPD; (b) developing Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
checklists for Category A infrastructure sub-projects e.g., solid waste management and waste
water disposal; and (c) conducting ESIAs for Category A sub-projects.

Financial Management: Satisfactory
34. Financial management arrangements in the two implementing agencies remained
satisfactory throughout the life of the project. Relevant staff, including for internal audit,
remained in place during life of the project. Financial management systems of 102 TMAs were
computerized, which has contributed to efficient budgeting and accounting, as well as
streamlined reporting to the provincial level. The two implementing agencies complied with the
financial covenants, and submitted acceptable quarterly interim financial reports and annual
audited financial statements (mostly) by the due dates. Auditors’ performance was satisfactory.

Procurement: Satisfactory
35. Major procurement risks had been identified during project preparation: TMAs’ low
procurement capacity; weak market response; issues of contract implementation; delays due to
implementation design (PMDFC hiring design and supervision consultancy, and TMAs hiring
works contractors); and transparency. Market response became prominent owing to the market
skew witnessed during the post-earthquake reconstruction period. Country readiness filters had
to be revisited at the negotiation stage as two rounds of bidding concluded without success.
After two workshops with potential bidders, the following changes were made to the bidding
documents:
a) Qualification requirements were relaxed by equating annual turnover to the annual cost, and
    by lowering liquid asset requirements.
b) Performance guarantee was reduced to 5%.
c) Price adjustment clause was introduced in all contracts.

36. The use of insurance bonds instead of bank guarantees as performance guarantee, which
was recommended by some of the TMAs, did not prove successful as the contractors defaulted


                                              11
and TMAs could not encash performance guarantees. Market interest in bidding for project
contracts increased over time. The first three NCB contracts were subject to prior review, while
the rest were subject to ex-post review. The reviews found that project procurements complied
with Bank requirements and were efficient.

37. The slow pace of implementation during the initial period (discussed earlier) was addressed
by providing technical assistance and capacity building support to TMAs as well as contractors.
Contract management SOPs provided guidance to all stakeholders on roles and responsibilities as
well as service standards. Implementation of the SOPs was quick and improved both the pace of
work as well as documentation.

38. While the anticipated limited capacity of contractors was mitigated, capacity constraints of
some of the consulting firms was not foreseen. Performance of an established firm hired by
PMDFC for design and supervision was inadequate, and PMDFC had to seek the intervention of
the firm’s senior management to bring about improvements. SOPs supported PMDFC in
improving capacity to manage consultant contracts. Contract amendments and time extensions
were handled professionally after the SOPs was in place post MTR.

39. PMDFC and TMAs maintained procurement data (IFBs, bidding documents, bid evaluation
reports, and contract status) on their websites. Another good practice under the project was that
two of the non-performing firms were debarred, which is a rare occurrence in the province.

40. Procurement under the Cultural Heritage component was satisfactory; however there were
contract management issues throughout the project. These were due to: uniqueness of restoration
works; site constraints; involvement of multiple agencies in the area; and lack of experience of
contractors. Contract management capacity of WCLA, as well as professional constrains of the
consulting firm, were also contributing factors.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41. PMDFC was established under the Companies Ordinance as the Implementing Agency
(IA) for PMSIP to ensure continuity after Project closure. PMDFC has developed expertise in
designing, planning, coordinating, and delivering a variety of institutional development
interventions, as well as investment sub-projects. It is positioned as a specialized entity, whose
expertise can be utilized across the province and beyond. GoPunjab has started to use it as an
integral technical arm of LG&CDD and is committed to supporting it to assist LGs. PMDFC is
currently developing knowledge management tools and case studies to document and
disseminate systems and processes developed through the Project.

42. LG&CDD, the parent department of all LGs, has recently established with PMSIP’s
assistance, an Integration Cell housing a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. This is
linked to PMDFC’s M&E system, through which TMAs report on agreed municipal service


                                               12
indicators. This has enabled LG&CDD to undertake performance monitoring of TMAs for
results against investments made in their jurisdictions.

43. Systems operationalized in the TMAs have resulted in improved performance, including
operations and maintenance of assets created through the investment grants. O&M Frameworks
and standard procedures have been developed for routine and periodic maintenance of
infrastructure assets, and training has been provided to TMA officials on O&M procedures.
While developing the subordinate legislation and rules of business under the PLGA 2013,
LG&CDD is mandating all municipalities across the Province to adopt the project interventions,
which will help ensure their sustainability.

44. On 12 March, 2014, the Punjab Chief Minister (CM) approved a Summary directing
LG&CDD to seek continuation of Bank support to LGs through PMDFC. A Concept Paper for a
repeater project is under preparation. The CM has also notified a high level Committee on 21
March, 2014, to review municipal service delivery in the Punjab, and the institutional structures
responsible for it. The Committee has requested the Bank’s help to undertake the diagnostics,
and develop recommendations for institutional and policy reforms. This work is already
underway.

45. PMSIP has assisted GoPunjab in promulgating an Act and establishing WCLA as a
dedicated agency responsible for the historic core of Lahore. Capacity developed through
successfully piloting methods and processes in the rehabilitation of urban built environment in
the Walled City of Lahore (WCL) will continue to be utilized in scaling up the restoration of
historic assets and the urban environment, and in the adaptive reuse of the historic buildings and
urban spaces in WCL. The pilot project in the WCL, included to showcase methods and benefits
of conservation of cultural assets and their productive re/use remained incomplete at Project
closure. This resulted in non-utilization of around US $1.2 million of project funds. The pilot
project has since been substantially completed using GoPunjab funds.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

46. Relevance of Objectives: The project has contributed directly to the achievement of
outcomes in the urban sector stated in the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2010-14,
including the aims to foster livability, economic growth, and dynamism within Pakistan’s major
cities and rapidly growing urban settlements (Executive Summary, page iii). It has contributed to
Pillar III of the CPS, related to improving infrastructure to support growth (Page 13), as well as
to ‘improved urban planning and management frameworks implemented in select municipalities’
(Annex 1, page 7).




                                               13
47. PMSIP has helped TMAs operationalize systems for better governance and improved
transparency, accountability, and service delivery; as well as assisted the provincial government
to transition to monitoring and oversight functions. Infrastructure investments have resulted in
direct service delivery improvements as demonstrated by the Beneficiary Perception Survey19
and the service delivery performance data collected through the PMS20. The introduction of a
participatory Planning Process, and development of Structure Plans 21 and GIS maps 22 for all
small and medium towns across Punjab, has allowed TMAs to use these for planning for future
growth and investments. It has thus directly responded to some of the critical issues that have
plagued the urban sector over time23 and the relevance of objectives is rated high.

48. Relevance of Design and Implementation: The objectives and interventions supported by
the Project have continued to remain relevant to the officials and mandates of urban local
governments in the Punjab, as well as to the urban residents served by them. Feedback from
TMAs during the first round of the ID Assessment survey24 conducted in 2009, served as the
basis for project restructuring undertaken after the Mid-Term Review. The Project has
consistently used the approach of piloting, learning, and scaling up for its interventions, seeking
constant feedback from participating TMA officials in a bid to customize and improve initiatives
to better address user requirements. This model has ensured that project activities remain
responsive to the needs of TMA officials and end-users. The relevance of design and
implementation is therefore rated high.

49. Relevance to Context: The project was originally designed to support TMAs established under
PLGO 2001, with elected local representatives at their helm. In end-2009, after completion of two terms
of elected local governments, they were disbanded and local government elections are yet to be held.
Provincial government officials have been posted as ‘administrators’ in lieu of elected mayors. The
Project has nevertheless continued to benefit the TMAs in delivering on their mandates. More recently,
the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2013 requires urban LGs to undertake some of the initiatives
for which PMSIP has already built LG capacity. The relevance to context is therefore rated high.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

50. In terms of efficacy, the Project has resulted in demonstrable improvements in the
governance, management, and accountability of TMAs, and in turn their provision of municipal
services per the PDO. These achievements have led to a discernible increase in the satisfaction

among key stakeholder groups with respect to systems established under the Project, as well as
improvements achieved in service delivery indicators 25 . Moreover, the Project has built
Government of Punjab’s capacity to monitor TMA performance, as well as to manage cultural
heritage assets within the Walled City of Lahore. As a result, a culture of performance
management is taking root at the municipal level; a culture of performance oversight is emerging
at the provincial level; and a robust local government capacity building vehicle has been
established in the Punjab.

51.    A summary of relevant results is provided below:

a) Coverage and Quality of Municipal Services: The intermediate outcome indicators26 reflect
   improvements in coverage of water supply, operation of street lights, and collection and
   disposal of solid waste. The solid waste service has surpassed the target: 74% (vs. 70%) of
   solid waste generated is being collected and disposed of at landfill sites27. For water supply,
   the average percentage of households connected increased from 40% (baseline value) to 53%
   against a target of 59%. For street lights, percentage of operational street lights, averaged
   across all 105 TMAs, increased from 70% to 73%, against a target of 75%.

b) Increasing Beneficiary Satisfaction: The BPS 35 has provided conclusive evidence that a
   very high majority of beneficiaries: (i) reported satisfaction that investments in roads had
   improved access, travel times, vehicle maintenance costs, fuel consumption, and business
   opportunities; and (ii) confirmed improvement in primary collection, transportation, and
   disposal of solid waste as well as overall cleanliness of their neighborhoods. A majority of
   beneficiaries reported that both quantity and quality of water supplied by TMAs had
   improved or significantly improved; however, satisfaction levels for quantity of water
   supplied by TMAs were relatively modest. The below-par results for quantity of water are
   attributable to the energy crisis in the country, which impacted on TMA ability to adequately
   pump and supply water.
c) Complaint Resolution: At project closure, 81 (of 105) partner TMAs were resolving more
   than 90% of complaints against service delivery 36 . ID Assessment surveys reported an
   increasing number of complaints registered over time, showing enhanced public confidence
   in, and the increased use of, the complaint redress system introduced under PMSIP.
d) Mechanisms for Monitoring Service Delivery: Performance management tools provided by
   the project have enabled TMAs to systematically monitor staff performance on municipal
   services’ delivery, as confirmed by the second round of ID Assessment. TMAs with a more

   Evidenced by integrated statistics from Complaint Tracking System (CTS), and relevant intermediate outcome
indicator.


                                                      16
     extended exposure to these tools have started to utilize them better for objectives such as
     decision making on service delivery needs, and identification of repair and maintenance
     requirements.
e)   Capacity for Managing Investments: TMA capacity for project and contract management
     has been enhanced as a result of the Project, and will facilitate TMAs in implementing future
     investments.
f)   Financial Management and Accounting: The automated accounting and financial
     management system introduced under the project has greatly improved financial reporting,
     reconciliation of accounts, and maintenance of a ledger of receipts and expenditures n all 105
     TMAs. Electronic databases of own-source revenues, such as water consumers’ records,
     shops/tenants and lease contracts have been created in 37 TMAs, enabling them to effectively
     monitor and manage revenue collection performance.
g)   Replication and Sustainability: Project interventions have proved highly replicable, as
     demonstrated by their successful scaling up from the original 37 TMAs to 68 additional
     TMAs after the mid-term review in 2010. Institutional development interventions have
     covered all municipal governments, except the five largest cities37 . PMDFC capacity has
     been increased substantially for scaling up the program and will ensure sustainability of
     Project interventions in TMAs. The majority of the local government staff across the
     province has either received training or has benefitted from the operational improvements
     introduced under PMSIP, resulting in an ‘effective mass’ within the local government
     officials for ensuring sustainability of PMSIP’s interventions.
h)   Performance Management tools introduced by the Project have enabled TMAs to quantify
     municipal services’ coverage, evaluate municipal services’ quality, and monitor staff
     performance. The integration of systems across the province has led to the development of a
     consolidated web-based tool for performance management. The monitoring cell established
     in LG&CDD has built the department’s capacity to fully respond to its oversight function of
     TMAs.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

52. The Project encompassed a wide portfolio of activities encompassing innovative
institutional strengthening initiatives, more routine investments in municipal infrastructure, as
well as capacity building of provincial government entities.

53. Investments in Municipal Infrastructure: The project was designed to be demand driven,
with the nature and scope of each sub-project determined through a participatory planning
exercise. Only a few investments were identified at appraisal. An ex-ante economic analysis of


37
  For these another Bank-funded project (Punjab Cities Governance Improvement Project) was under preparation;
and is currently being implemented.


                                                     17
two infrastructure sub-projects (water supply in Jhelum and roads in Pind Dadan Khan) was
included in the PAD. For subsequent sub-projects, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was
required to be calculated with their feasibility study38, and was a part of the screening criteria for
selection of sub-projects.

54. At project completion, ex-post analyses have been repeated for the two sub-projects
reviewed at appraisal, as well as one additional water supply and roads39 sub-project each. These
sectors together comprised 80% of infrastructure investments financed by the project. Economic
and financial analyses carried out at both appraisal and closure show positive results, supporting
the efficiency rating for the Project:
a) Water supply Sub-projects: The estimated ERR at appraisal ranged between 12% and 24%
    depending on parameters assumed for the analysis. Ex-post analysis at completion indicates
    the ERR to be around 13%. The estimated ERR for Liaquatpur Water Supply investments is
    around 5%. ERRs of these sub-projects would have been much higher, but for lower than
    expected tariff rates which GoPunjab approved.
b) Roads Sub-projects: The ERR for the PD Khan Roads sub-project at completion is 14.9%
    against the estimated 17% at appraisal. The ERR for the road sub-project in Chichawatni is
    15% at completion.

55. Capacity Grants: The overall economic impact of capacity grants is difficult to quantify, as
expected outcomes from areas such as performance management, financial management, and
procurement are hard to monetize. However, the supported activities have proved central to the
development impact of the Project: enhanced project and contract management capacities at
TMAs and improved O&M processes contributed to the effective implementation of
infrastructure investments; and improved human resources, additional computer equipment, and
new tools for performance- and financial management are directly contributing to enhanced
viability and efficiencies in municipal service delivery40. This also represents the key area where
the knowledge and global experience available with the Bank has directly added value to the
improvement of systems and increased capacity of institutions. In terms of costs, 6.5% (US $3.2
million) of the total budget allocation was earmarked at appraisal for the implementation of the
institutional building activities. Considering that this was a 7 year operation that eventually
supported 105 TMAs against the originally envisaged 37 TMAs, the average yearly allocation
for the capacity building activities comes to less than a modest US$ 8,50041 per year per TMA,
reflecting high cost efficiency.

56. Based on the above analysis, detailed in Annex 3, the Efficiency of the project has been
assessed as Satisfactory despite the delay in project implementation of just less than three years.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

57. The project outcome is rated satisfactory, taking into account the high relevance of
objectives, design and implementation, and the satisfactory achievement of the PDO in an
efficient manner.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58. The urban poor in Punjab, as elsewhere in the world, are disproportionately affected by the
poor quality of municipal services compared to the middle and upper income populations. The
Project contributed directly to poverty alleviation through equitable access to municipal services
as a result of the inclusive and broad-based process used to identify development priorities.
Information generated through the Performance Management and Complaint Tracking Systems,
as well as the GIS-based service maps, is assisting TMAs in identifying deficiencies in municipal
services, and in more rational decision making on maintenance needs and for new investments.

59. Moreover, the Project’s contribution to better management of urban services as well as
investments in improving coverage and quality is generating significant benefits for beneficiary
populations. Such benefits include improvement in living standards and public health, as well as
economic benefits for the small and medium cities in Punjab. In particular, women benefited
from the improvements resulting from investments in water supply.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60. As discussed in earlier sections, the Project achieved important results in strengthening
existing institutions, including the provincial LG&CDD as well as 105 TMAs across Punjab
province. This has led to their improved ability to deliver on their mandates. PMSIP also helped
set-up, and operationalize on a sustainable basis, two specialized agencies in the Punjab, i.e.,
PMDFC and the Walled City of Lahore Authority.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops




                                                19
61. A Beneficiary Perception Survey, undertaken by an independent third party, covered
beneficiaries of 14 completed sub-projects: eight for water supply, four roads/streets, and two for
solid waste management. The results are generally positive42:

Water Supply:
  Quality of water used for household usage has improved reported by 61% of respondents.
  TMA water supply is primary source of drinking water reported by 70% of respondents. 49%
 used private-bore/hand pump as primary source before sub-project: of these, 71% now use
 TMA water supply as the primary source.
  Quantity and pressure of household water supply has improved reported by 54% and 56% of
 respondents respectively.
Roads:
  Access and travel times have improved for 66% and 87% of respondents respectively.
  Value of property along the roads has increased reported by 83% of respondents.
  Improved business opportunities reported by 75% of respondents.
  Reduction in repair and maintenance costs of vehicles reported by 70% of drivers.
  Reduction in fuel consumption reported by 74% of drivers.
Solid Waste Management:
  Primary collection of solid waste and cleanliness of neighborhoods improvement reported by
 72% of respondents.
  More households are disposing waste in a container/bin placed by the TMA in 33% of cases,
 compared to only 7% before the project.
  Regularity in collection from containers/bins has also improved, with 56% of all respondents
 stating that it is collected on a daily or weekly basis.
  Transportation of solid waste improved reported by 71% of respondents.
  Informal dumping as the major source of environmental pollution is decreasing. Only a
 quarter of respondents stated this was a problem after the sub-projects, compared to half the
 respondents saying that this was a problem before the sub-projects.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

62.      Key risks to development outcomes are summarized below.

63. Transition to Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2013: Significant changes in the
structure of urban local governments in Punjab are underway following enactment of the Punjab
Local Government Act 2013. Once LG elections are held, TMAs participating in the Project will
be reorganized as Municipal Corporations or Municipal Committees. Provincial LG Department
will need to enable the revamped local government structures to fully benefit from, and sustain


42
     More details are provided in Annex-5


                                                20
Project-provided interventions. In view of the on-going revisions to the PLGA, there is a risk in
the level of devolution from the province to the local governments that will be implemented, and
whether institutions created under the project will be sustained.

64. Improved Asset Management: Continued weaknesses at the local level for routine and
periodic maintenance of infrastructure and equipment, and large maintenance backlogs created
by years of deferred maintenance will require allocation of requisite resources for optimal
operation and maintenance. Frameworks for operations and maintenance (preventive and
routine) for all municipal service infrastructure, successfully piloted under PMSIP, will need to
be scaled up.

65. Scaling-up Urban Regeneration and Heritage Restoration: Adequate technical and
management capacity at WCLA is critical to maintaining the significant cultural heritage under
its mandate. WCLA needs to strengthen its regulation, enforcement, and technical capacity as
soon as possible.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

66. Bank performance for ensuring quality at entry during identification, preparation, and
appraisal of the project was satisfactory. As discussed in section 3.1, project objectives were
highly relevant to the sectoral context and needs, and were strongly aligned with provincial and
local government priorities, as well as the Bank CPS for Pakistan.

67. The project was designed in a context where relatively new legal and administrative
structures under the 2001 local government legislation had resulted in a significant revision of
roles and mandates of the provincial and local governments. Engagement with stakeholders,
particularly active participation of the TMA leadership during project preparation, was
instrumental in ensuring that envisaged interventions under the project were customized to TMA
needs. Close dialogue with the provincial government ensured that project design effectively
addressed its requirements, as well and included dedicated interventions to assist provincial
entities fulfill their mandates within the new legislative framework.

68. These consultations and analyses undertaken during preparation and appraisal ensured that
the Project design was well grounded and responded to sectoral and contextual issues. Project
design was also informed by lessons from previous projects and urban sector operations
elsewhere. Implementation arrangements were appropriate to the PDO and project design, and
the M&E arrangements were appropriate and integrated in the design. The identification and



                                               21
assessment of risks was grounded in the country and sectoral context, and envisaged mitigation
strategies responded well when the risks were triggered.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

69. A multi-disciplinary Bank team, with the requisite skill mix (urban, cultural heritage
revitalization, financial management, procurement and contract management, social
development, environmental safeguards, municipal engineering) supervised project
implementation. The team carried out 15 full implementation support missions, which included
TMA visits, wrap-up meetings with counterpart leadership, and documentation in Aide
Memoires. These were interspersed with frequent shorter technical missions and TMA visits.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated for supervision. There was close
collaboration between the Bank team, provincial counterparts (LG&CD and P&D Departments),
and the implementing agencies throughout implementation.

70.   The Bank team’s engagement included guidance on matters such as:

a) developing project management and contract management processes/SOPs;
b) designing institutional development initiatives;
c) assuring quality of engineering designs of infrastructure investments;
d) piloting heritage asset interventions;
e) developing operations and maintenance (O&M) manuals, based on international best
   practices;
f) developing and implementing safeguards management, social mobilization, and resettlement
   plans; and
g) designing and implementing data collection, M&E instruments, and feedback mechanisms
   such as the structured institutional assessment.

71. Implementation support documentation (ISRs and aide memoires) provided adequate
information on project status and agreed actions to address issues identified, especially in areas
relating to technical matters, institutional development and capacity building, procurement,
safeguards, financial management, disbursement, and compliance with covenants.

72. The Mid-Term-Review was carried out in early-2010, and its findings led to a project
restructuring. Subsequently, the need for a second restructuring was identified and was
completed in a timely manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                               22
73. The Bank’s overall performance was satisfactory, based on the ratings for quality at entry
(satisfactory) and quality of supervision (satisfactory).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

74. Government of Punjab’s ownership of the Project remained strong throughout and
commitment to achieve the PDO was high. It was rooted in the awareness of the changed roles of
the local and provincial government entities under the new LG system and the consequent need
for strong monitoring and oversight of LG performance. Government therefore welcomed the
operationalization of a monitoring cell, using integrated performance management, financial
management, and complaint tracking systems. It also supported implementation of performance
management interventions through the issuance of required instructions to TMAs, and resolution
of any operational bottlenecks. More recently LG&CDD has established an effective partnership
with PMDFC as a specialized entity, providing technical assistance and capacity support to LGs.

75. GoPunjab enacted the Walled City of Lahore Act 2012, established the Walled City of
Lahore Authority as a dedicated agency, and rationalized institutional mandates regarding
heritage assets between various agencies. However, the provincial government could have done
better in the timely engagement of critical technical skill sets at the Walled City of Lahore
Authority.

76. The provincial government was less successful in coordinating with the provincial audit
agencies to formally endorse the computerized financial management system operationalized in
TMAs. However, the Auditor General office has given an assurance to shortly evaluate the
CFMS, and sign off on it to enable it to replace the manual system.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77. The overall performance of the two implementing agencies – PMDFC and WCLA - was
satisfactory.

78. The employment of PMDFC - a government-sponsored, not-for-profit company limited by
guarantee – as an implementing agency represented a paradigm shift in the mode of allocation of
public resources for urban development in Punjab. This model enabled bringing the efficiencies
of the corporate sector into implementing a public sector project. PMDFC was successful in
engaging the required competencies and technical skill sets to develop and implement the
requisite institutional development tools. Moreover, expertise and technical support provided by




                                              23
PMDFC contributed strongly to improving procurement and contract management capacities at
TMAs, where infrastructure investments were undertaken.

79. Financial management arrangements at PMDFC and WCLA were satisfactory and
provided reasonable assurance that project funds were used for intended purposes. Regular
submission of progress reports and other information allowed effective tracking of
implementation progress and initiating corrective actions when needed. Effective monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems were developed and used to assess progress against indicator targets.
In particular, the use of project interventions to directly capture M&E data on TMA indicators
ensured regular collection and reporting of information by PMDFC.

80. A robust Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement
Action Framework (RAF) were developed and satisfactorily applied to specific sub-projects
through Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPs). The ESIAs had a high degree of social consultation. RAP implementation in the Walled
City of Lahore not only addressed resettlement issues, but also presented a highly successful
model of social mobilization, benefit-sharing, and citizen-led regeneration.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

81. The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory, based on the above assessments
of the performance of the Government of Punjab (satisfactory), and the Implementing Agencies
(satisfactory).

6. Lessons Learned

82. Implementation experience of this ambitious and transformative project, while providing
many lessons of wider applicability, reaffirms that institutional change and reform is a slow and
painstaking process. It requires patience and sustained Bank and Borrower commitment over the
longer term, despite occasional setbacks and often seemingly slow execution and disbursement
flows. It also shows that public sector institutions such as PMDFC and WCLA, established for
the longer-term beyond immediate requirements of the project, provide a stronger base for
sustaining project outcomes, especially in the face of political uncertainty and risk. This project
was conceived as a high risk, high reward operation and has delivered richly on its promise. The
lessons learned are summarized below.

Project-Specific
a) Project implementation through a semi-autonomous public sector company (with
   public/private Board) brought efficiencies and curtailed undue political interference.




                                                24
b) Hands on capacity building for systems and process improvements, with continuous post
   implementation follow-up and support, can bring about sustainable institutional
   development.
c) Decentralized implementation through TMAs, while slowing progress, ensured local
   ownership and sustainable results.
d) Consultative planning process for investment plans ensured demand-driven priorities.
e) Development of service delivery indicators by TMA officials led to regular data acquisition
   and transmission from TMAs to PMDFC to LG Department.
f) Delegating procurement of works to TMAs initially posed challenges, but helped develop
   their capacity on a sustainable basis.
g) Good procurement and contract management practices in TMAs and IAs over time facilitated
   robust competition and efficient contract completion.
h) Expanding training to lower level non-transferrable technical officials helped mitigate
   erosion of capacity built due to high staff turnover of officials.
i) Community support increases manifold when resettlement was accompanied by wider social
   mobilization and benefit-sharing efforts (forming CBOs, implementing a range of training
   initiatives, and creating widespread public awareness on benefits of heritage-based tourism).

General
a) Creating a culture of performance management is time and effort intensive.
b) Institutions take strong ownership of institutional development activities if interventions are
   aligned to their mandates and assist in responding to them.
c) Institutional development requires persistence and diligence to unfold and achieve
   sustainable results.
d) Careful balance and sequencing between institutional development and investment initiatives
   can ensure success in both.
e) Continuity of key staff in the IA (PMDFC) and Bank Task Team benefits project
   implementation and ensures institutional memory. Moreover country office led initiatives
   can ensure just-in-time responsiveness to emerging issues.
f) Continuity of financial management staff, and requisite capacity building at operational as
   well as management tiers, helps in effective financial management.
g) Use of beneficiary surveys to gauge Borrower Performance integrated in PDO indicators, can
   lead to citizen-centered measurement of Borrower and IA performance.
h) Urban regeneration in historic contexts entails tackling issues on multiple fronts, and requires
   substantial preparatory work. It also needs to focus on both tangible & intangible heritage
   assets.
i) Urban regeneration and heritage restoration need patience and perseverance.

                                                25
Comments Received from:
83. Secretary, LG&CDD: “The ICR adequately captures the major achievements of PMSIP in
the context of improvement and viability of the urban services, and rationale of the World Bank
for provision of assistance. At the outset, I would like to appreciate the strenuous efforts of the
World Bank, partner TMAs, and PMDFC for successfully implementing PMSIP. Assessment of
the project outcomes along with the assessment of Bank and Borrower performance makes
objective and insightful reflections on the performance of different partners of the Project.

84. The Institutional Development and Infrastructure Development components of PMSIP have
been carried out to the satisfaction of the LG&CDD, whereby significant improvement can be
witnessed in the performance of TMAs over the life of the project. The improved delivery of
municipal services achieved under PMSIP and its components speaks for the aptness of
strategically designed and well executed interventions. Another achievement of PMSIP is the
enhanced capacity of PMDFC as technical support agency of the LG&CDD. PMDFC is now
well poised to assist LG&CDD in its endeavors to improve urban services in the province.
Likewise, policy implementation by the LG&CDD and its oversight has significantly improved
due to interventions by PMSIP. LG&CDD is institutionalizing PMSIP interventions like
Computerized Financial Management, Performance Management, and Complaint Tracking
Systems. The Department has also included the adoption of Computerized Financial
Management System (CFMS) in Town Municipal Administrations in its sectoral plan. In the
light of the achievements and learnings of PMSIP, LG&CDD has already initiated the concept
paper for second round of PMSIP in close collaboration with the Planning and Development
Department”.

85. MD, PMDFC: “The Project was a great opportunity for building the capacity of PMDFC
team during the formulation of plans and while implementing them. The ICRR has
comprehensively documented the achievements and lessons leant during the currency of the
project. It is a fine blend of desk review and field appraisals of project activities and
achievements. The report gives a balanced view on key findings and lessons learnt for further
synthesis and systematization exercises for upcoming similar assignments in keeping with the
regional context and local government system. These results shall definitely contribute to
institutional learning for designing and implementing similar municipal service delivery projects.
I must take this opportunity to express my appreciation for all those who put a lot of efforts for
penning down this report”.

86. A detailed Implementation Completion Review report has been prepared and shared by the
Punjab Municipal Development Funds Company (PMDFC). The contents of the report (refer
Annex 7) reinforce and corroborate findings presented above.

87. WCLA: “Refer last paragraph under Pilot Heritage Conservation Sub-project, Annex 10.
The point of “weak contract management” is contested and it is elaborated here that “being the



                                                26
one of the most complex project, whose execution of work encountered multiple, severe
complications from the community and even the firearms used to hit WCLA’s Contractor.
Working in densely populated area, having influx of the traffic and pedestrians as well as the
commercial activates round the clock, and the fact of convincing the community remained
among the biggest constraints of the project, which was dealt amicably by the Social
Mobilization Team, WCLA and executing agencies of the WCLA. Proof of which is narrated
later in the said paragraph”.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Project Components

1.       The project consisted of two components: (a) capacity grants and development grants to TMAs;
and (b) capacity building of the Punjab Provincial Government and PMDFC. The Project was conceived
as an incentive fund for TMAs willing to improve their performance, to be implemented through a public
sector sponsored company with a public/private Board. It included a variety of customized institutional
development interventions to enhance TMAs’ ability to deliver on their mandates (the capacity grants
sub-component), and the provincial government’s capacity to monitor TMA performance. High
performing TMAs were given the incentive of investment grants for sub-projects in municipal sectors
prioritized through a planning process (the performance grants sub-component).

Performance towards Achievement of Project Development Objectives

2.      The Project has resulted in demonstrable improvements in the governance, management, and
accountability of TMAs, and in turn their provision of municipal services per the PDO. These
achievements have led to a discernible increase in the satisfaction among key stakeholder groups with
respect to systems established under the Project, as well as improvements achieved in service delivery
indicators. Moreover, the Project has built Government of Punjab’s capacity to monitor TMA
performance, as well as to manage cultural heritage assets within the Walled City of Lahore.

3.      A culture of performance management is thus taking root at the municipal level; a culture of
performance oversight is emerging at the provincial level; and a robust LG capacity building vehicle has
been established in the Punjab. Outputs from various interventions are discussed below.

Component One: Support for Tehsil Municipal Administrations - Capacity and Development
Grants

Component-1.a) Capacity Grants

4.       The support provided to TMAs under the capacity grants sub-component went far beyond
conventional capacity building and pursued a comprehensive institutional development approach to
enable TMAs to effectively deliver on their urban management and municipal service delivery mandates.
The Institutional Development (ID) initiatives in TMAs undertaken through PMSIP have proved central
to: (a) establishing systems of performance management and monitoring at both the provincial and TMA
levels; (b) providing a platform for ensuring scalability, replicability, and sustainability of institutional
improvements; and (c) improving governance and accountability of TMAs.

5.      The Performance Management System (PMS) has enabled TMAs to quantify municipal
services’ coverage, evaluate municipal services’ quality, and monitor staff performance. The development
of a consolidated web-based tool for performance oversight has helped integrate performance
management systems across the TMAs. A monitoring cell has been established in the provincial Local
Government and Community Development Department (LG&CDD), which is the parent institution for all
local governments in the province. This cell is assisting the LG&CDD oversee TMA performance on
municipal service delivery through all sources of funding, including from PMSIP.




                                                     31
6.      The Complaint Tracking System (CTS) has helped TMAs become responsive to issues in service
delivery faced by their citizens. Complaints received are not only tracked until resolved, but analysis of
complaint data is undertaken to identify systemic issues in service delivery. The CTS is thus helping
TMA management take appropriate development and asset management decisions.

7.      The computerized Financial Management System (FMS) developed and operationalized in all
TMAs across the province is assisting them with efficient and transparent budgeting, accounting, and
financial management as well as streamlined reporting to the provincial level. It has also encouraged the
more reform-minded TMAs to request for addition of modules for water consumer records; and shops,
tenancy, and lease contract records.

8.      The introduction of a participatory Planning Process and development of Structure Plans and
GIS maps for all small and medium towns across Punjab, has allowed TMAs to use these for planning for
future growth and investments. Moreover, the overlays developed for each service infrastructure provides
detailed information on service coverage, and is assisting TMA management to take rational development
decisions. The GIS maps (Base Map, Land Use Map, and Maps for Water Supply, Sewerage, Roads, and
Solid Waste Management) have been placed on PMDFC’s website. This is for the first time that such
information on towns in Punjab has been developed and made available in the public domain.

9.     Websites developed for all TMAs have helped improve public disclosure and access to
information. These are also helping improve the perception of TMAs by the citizens. More recently,
TMAs have been assisted in uploading their PMS data on web-based software, facilitating reporting to
PMDFC and LG&CDD concurrently.

10.     A variety of Trainings have been conducted for TMA officials under PMSIP, with the objective
of imparting skills in the optimal use of systems and business processes introduced in the TMAs. These
have ranged from basic computer literacy to data collection, compilation, and reporting; website
launching and updation; conducting road rating surveys; contract and project management; procurement;
and use of engineering equipment provided to TMAs. The over 3000 officials trained across 105 TMAs
have helped introduce an IT culture in them.

11.      Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Frameworks and standard procedures for various aspects
of routine and periodic maintenance of infrastructure assets have also been developed. These have been
piloted in Jhelum and Kasur for water supply; Chiniot and Bhawalnagar for solid waste management; and
in Shorlot for roads. Training on O&M procedures has also been provided to other TMAs. The piloting
has indicated a clear need to scale up these efforts, and to explore options of institutional arrangements for
improved asset management beyond Project closure.

12.     The overall progress and benefits achieved through ID interventions is summarized below:

Component-1.b) Performance Grants

13.      Performance grants to TMAs have financed investments (sub-projects) in selected TMAs.

                                        Performance Criteria for TMAs
  Eligibility Criteria for Partnering with PMSIP: In keeping with the emphasis on performance management
  under PMSIP, the eligibility criteria for the selection of partner TMAs in years 1 and 2 was: (a) ratio of own
  source revenue to total recurrent revenue (showing revenue generation effort); and (b) ratio of expenditure of
  development funds to total development funds available (showing implementation capacity). Top ranked
  TMAs were invited to partner with PMSIP. Interested TMAs were required to sign an MOU confirming
  willingness to reform, fully implement ID initiatives, and report on agreed indicators.
  Criterion for Performance Grants was good performance on ID initiatives funded through the capacity grants.
  If eligible, a TMA could request a performance grant for a priority infrastructure investment identified through
  a participatory planning process. It also had to agree to upfront contribute 15% of the sub-project cost; fund
  subsequent O&M costs; and submit a detailed application including a service improvement plan, and
  performance indicators and targets.
  Post-MTR in 2010 and project restructuring, the capacity grants were scaled up and offered to all urban TMAs
  in the Punjab (accept those in the 5 largest cities). However, the dispensation of infrastructure development
  grants continued to be subject to the performance, demand, and implementation criteria outlined above. Thus
  while ID support served as the ‘equity window’ for all TMAs, the infrastructure investments remained a purely
  ‘performance window’.
                                                                                                                      
14.      The infrastructure development grants have enabled TMAs to invest in enhanced municipal
service delivery in a managed and sustainable manner. Investments for completed sub-projects include
rehabilitation, improvement, and coverage expansion in water supply (17 sub-projects), roads and streets
(13 sub-projects), solid waste management (6 sub-projects), sewerage and sewage treatment (1 sub-
project), parks (1 sub-project) and firefighting (1 sub-project). The status of PMSIP sub-projects is
summarized below:
                               Table 2.2: Status of PMSIP sub-projects
                                                                                            Number of
                                                Status
                                                                                           sub-projects
               Completed                                                                        39
               In process of closing                                                             2
               Terminated (later completed by TMA and GoPunjab funds)                           3
               Total                                                                            44

15.      The 39 completed sub-projects have been implemented in 29 different urban centers. The number
of estimated beneficiaries or population served from the 39 completed PMSIP sub-projects currently
amount to more than 1.66 million. This estimate is based on a systematic determination of the coverage
area of each sub-project, using GIS maps of the urban center where the sub-project was implemented. The
quality of PMSIP-funded civil works is also superior to regular TMA investments due to strong oversight



                                                          34
provided, and capacity building in project and contract management. TMAs were made responsible for
project management, as well as provided training, which enhanced their exposure to and experience in
implementing FIDIC-based contracts. They were also assisted in conducting National Competitive
Bidding for sub-projects.

16.     Improvements in Sub-project Controls and Contract Management: Through PMSIP, TMAs
have been able to deliver sub-projects which were much larger in size and scope compared to those
previously managed by them. Their implementation was closely monitored by PMDFC, through
continuous support in areas including engineering design and project management; contract management;
and post-completion operations and maintenance for sustainable service delivery. An enhanced contract
management regime has been implemented for PMSIP-funded infrastructure schemes at TMA level,
leading to the emergence of a culture of greater contractual compliance among the various parties
responsible for ensuring timely project completion of requisite quality.

17.     More recently, smaller contracts focusing on specific operational issues were implemented. These
have included investments such as replacing mechanical and electrical equipment in waterworks and tube
wells, and rehabilitating water treatment works. This mix of larger and smaller contracts has funded
major infrastructure improvements, as well as upgrading of existing facilities, and in turn enhanced TMA
operational performance.

18.     Robust Monitoring through Contract Management SOPs and Checklists: In order to address
widespread delays in sub-project completions that were becoming a norm until the 2010 MTR, PMDFC
with Bank assistance developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and checklists for contract
management. The objective was to lay down clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the parties
associated with sub-project execution, for efficient and effective contract management. These have over
time found increasing acceptance and implementation by contractors and supervision consultant in sub-
projects subsequently initiated. The SOPs were made a major part of the contract management training
curriculum developed by PMDFC. Periodic contract management audits were also carried out by
PMDFC. Analyses show that the enhanced project and contract management efforts have led to marked
improvement in performance vis-à-vis timeliness of physical completion of sub-projects.

19.    Figures 1 and 2 above are based on data for the 39 infrastructure sub-projects completed to date,
and show how delays in sub-project completion have substantially reduced. This can be attributed to the
enhanced contract management regime implemented.

20.     The table above shows a comparison of averages over time, as well as before and after the
implementation of the enhanced contract management regime. The average delay for all 39 completed
sub-projects has been 45% in terms of percentage delay over original duration (median delay 33%), and 5
months in terms of absolute time (median delay 3 months), with delays substantially reduced after
implementation of contract management SOPs. The average delay for 18 sub-projects before these SOPs
was 72% over original duration (median delay 54%) and 10 months (median delay 7 months). This fell
down drastically after the SOPs were implemented, to 23% (median delay 26%) and 2 months (median
delay also 2 months).

Component Two: Support for Other Institutions - Capacity Building and Other Activities
Component-2.a) Support to Local Government and Rural Development Department

21.     Vertical linkages of M&E System: LG&CDD being the parent department of all local
governments (LGs) has the mandate of oversight and monitoring of LG performance. However, only
recently with PMSIP’s assistance, has the Department been able to put in place the requisite systems for


                                                  36
effective monitoring and oversight. An Integration Cell has been established, housing the monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system linked to PMDFC’s M&E system, through which TMAs report on agreed
municipal service indicators. This has enabled LG&CDD to undertake performance monitoring of TMAs
for results of investments made in their jurisdictions against coverage and quality of municipal services.
In future, LG&CDD can begin to seek data on required service coverage and quality indicators from the
district and union levels as well.

Component-2.b) Support to Planning and Development Department – Cultural Heritage
Subcomponent

22.     The Cultural Heritage (CH) subcomponent was added to the Project with the objective to
undertake the detailed preparatory activities that a CH initiative requires, as well as to fund a pilot. It
focused on: (a) Amendments to the existing legislative frameworks; (b) Rationalization of institutional
mandates for management of heritage assets; and (c) Implementation of a pilot project in the Walled City
of Lahore. The pilot project included the creation of a Heritage Trail, to showcase methods and benefits
of conservation of cultural assets and their productive re/use. Outputs under the cultural heritage
subcomponent include:

23.     Amendments to the Existing Legislative Frameworks: There are multiple legislative frameworks
that govern the conservation, restoration, and maintenance of historic assets in the Punjab 45 . Their
contents are at times contradictory to each other, while many clauses are outdated and no longer relevant.
GoPunjab undertook a review of these and enacted the Walled City of Lahore Act 2011 through the
Punjab legislature, thus rationalizing and updating the legal framework operating in the Walled City of
Lahore (WCL). This is a major achievement, as the Act establishes the regulative mechanisms for
conserving and restoring the historic core of Lahore and helps resolve conflicts in the multiple laws that
had earlier governed interventions in the WCL.

24.      Rationalization of Institutional Mandates for Management of Heritage Assets: There are
numerous institutions with mandates for heritage assets and provision of infrastructure and services in
areas like the WCL. These are at the federal, provincial, and local levels46 leading to difficult issues of
coordination and accountability. Within these agencies there is a significant lack of specific historic core
management capacities. Thus a key step towards the success of any CH initiative was to rationalize the
institutional mandates.    This, for Lahore, has been achieved through the establishment and
operationalization of the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA). It is currently in the process of
assuming responsibilities for the WCL, being transferred from other institutions at various levels of
government.

25.      Implementation of a Pilot Project: The Shahi Guzargah (the Royal Route) was selected as the
pilot for implementation, to showcase methods and benefits of conservation of cultural assets and their
productive re/use. It is the route that the Mughal emperors followed to reach the royal fort palace, when


45
   Like the Punjab Heritage Foundation Act 2005, the Punjab Special Premises (Preservation) Ordinance 1985,
Antiquities Act of 1975, and the Evacuee Trust Property Management and Disposal Act 1975.
46
   For example the federal and provincial Archaeology Departments, the federal Auqaf Department, the federal
Evacuee Trust Property Board, the federal Ministry of Culture and provincial Department of Culture, and the
relevant District and Town local governments, their agencies, and authorities.


                                                    37
returning from Delhi to Lahore or vice versa. The initiative includes: (i) provision of new municipal
infrastructure and services (below ground as far as possible) including electrical, communication, water
supply, storm drainage, sewerage, and gas supply networks which were obsolete, inadequate, or
completely absent; and (ii) rehabilitation of the urban fabric through facade and street improvements.

26.      The overall scope of physical works under the pilot project included, in addition to infrastructure
rehabilitation works:
         Number of streets to be paved:                 57
         Number of facades to be improved:              773
         Number of buildings in project area:           1028 (including buildings without facade work)

27.     Due to a variety of reasons including the nature of works involved which could not be fully
estimated upfront; weak contract management capacity at WCLA; and time and effort needed to
undertake preparatory activities before implementation could begin, the Works Contract remained
incomplete at project closing. The status of implementation was completion of 72% of façade
improvement work and 52% of street surfacing work. Similarly, for the infrastructure rehabilitation, 75%
of general works, 70% of water supply system, 70% of sewerage, 80% of storm water drainage, and 60%
of electrical network works had been completed. The remaining works are being completed using
GoPunjab funds.

28.     Social Mobilization: Over time, public space in the WCL has been massively encroached upon.
Detailed surveys of the pilot project area identified the need to remove 147 shops completely, with
another 732 shops being affected on a temporary basis along the Shahi Guzargah. Moreover, 264
encroachments onto the public realm (mainly kitchens and washrooms) were identified in the 47
residential streets emanating from the Shahi Guzargah. Thus the initiative has had to ensure the careful
community-centered implementation of its Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Activities included widely
held consultations; baseline development of the Project Area; impact assessment and mitigation;
mechanism to address the grievances of the affectees during implementation; and adequate institutional
capacity to implement the RAP.

29.     WCLAs Social Mobilization Team (SMT) has, among other activities, conducted over 1000
meetings to create awareness among the shopkeepers, traders, and residents; helped form 10 CBOs; and
helped train 48 youth of the area in technical skills, many of whom have found sustainable employment.
As a result, the Project has been able to undertake successful relocation of shops and residences that had
encroached on the public domain. Robust social mobilization ensured that the work was not just restricted
to resettlement, but also included residents in benefit sharing through trainings and community
organization. The Project has left in place a living model of citizen engagement in heritage restoration,
which can serve as a platform for citizen led regeneration and tourism in the area.

30.     Other Key Outputs include: (i) topographic survey of the WCL to serve as the GIS base map and
for design of infrastructure; (ii) an inventory of all historic buildings in the WCL, including record of land
use, ownership, age, and historic value; (iii) a Strategic Plan for the WCL; (iv) detailed physical
documentation of all buildings in the pilot area; and (iv) a socio-economic survey in the project area.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Analysis of Economic Benefits from Performance Grants (Infrastructure Investments)

1.    Infrastructure investments in TMA service delivery were expected to yield significant economic
benefits. PMDFC conducted a preliminary field appraisal for each sub-project, followed by a detailed
feasibility study by Engineering Consultants. The feasibility studies include Economic Rates of Returns
(ERR) for investments. The field appraisal reports include a review of the sub-project affordability, both
in terms of investment and operation and maintenance. Field appraisal reports as well as detailed
feasibility reports are available in the Project Files.

2.     Ex-ante economic analyses of infrastructure investments were included in the Project Appraisal
Document for a water supply in Jhelum and a roads sub-project in Pind Dadan Khan. For this ICR, ex-
post analyses have been performed using information collected during implementation to update the
economic analyses developed at appraisal stage. Economic rates of return have been calculated for
infrastructure sub-projects analyzed at appraisal to facilitate comparison between estimated and end of
project economic results. A similar ex-post economic analysis has been performed for two additional
water supply and road sub-projects. Overall expenditure on Water Supply and Roads/Streets sub-sectors
collectively accounts for almost 80% of all expenditure on infrastructure investments under the Project.

2. Economic Analysis of Water Supply Investments

3.    Water Supply is the largest sub-sector amongst infrastructure investments, accounting for more than
50% of expenditure. Economic analysis at completion has been carried out for the following two sub-
projects: (i) Extension and Improvement of the Water Supply Scheme in TMA Jhelum; and (ii) Extension
and Improvement of the Water Supply Scheme in TMA Liaqatpur.

4.    The Water Supply sub-project in Jhelum was appraised in the PAD, and a repeat Economic
Analysis has been conducted. The Water Supply sub-project in Liaqatpur has been chosen for an ex-post
Economic Analysis as it is the largest sub-project funded by PMSIP in terms of monetary value, equaling
about 9% of the total cost of the Project's Infrastructure Component and 19% of the Project’s
Infrastructure investments in the water supply sector. Summary findings from these analyses are
presented below, while detailed analyses are available in Project Files.

 2.1. Estimation of Health Benefits for Water Supply Sub-Projects

5.    Although several approaches to economic analysis were explored during project preparation (such
as quantification of time savings, health benefits, or assessing the willingness to pay) lack of data did not
allow for a meaningful analysis of these important benefits. Economic benefits have been estimated by
considering potential health benefits from improved access to adequate quantity of water for water
consumers.

6.    For both water supply sub-projects, the main economic benefits considered are the potential health
benefits from improved access to adequate quantity of water for water consumers. These benefits have




                                                     39
been quantified by using a national-level analysis recently conducted by the Water and Sanitation
Program, a trust fund managed by the World Bank47. It estimated the annual per capita economic cost of
inadequate sanitation (PKR 2,163), and then estimated the impact of various health (water and sanitation)
interventions in reducing these costs. Two such impacts are improved access to an adequate quantity of
water and improved access to improved quality of water which, according to the analysis, can reduce the
economic cost of poor sanitation by 30% and 36% (estimated at PKR 650 and PKR 779 per capita per
year) respectively.

 2.2. Economic Analysis of Jehlum Water Supply Sub-Project
    2.2.1. Calculation of Economic Benefits for Jehlum Water Supply Sub-Project

7.    Change in Consumer Surplus: At the time of Appraisal, economic benefits for this sub-project
were calculated by estimating the additional surplus for water consumers due to increased water supply.
This method was used at Appraisal because of unavailability of data to estimate health benefits, and the
benefits from time savings due to increased piped water supply. However, this method has not been
followed in the ex-post evaluation done at ICR stage, as data is now available to estimate health benefits.
The quantification of health impact thus seems a more appropriate indication of the sub-project’s benefits
instead of changes in consumer surplus, since it is difficult to assess consumer surplus when exceptionally
low tariffs have distorted consumer’s willingness to pay, and there is no recent data to provide revealed
preferences of consumers for adequate water supply.

8.     Quantification of Health Benefits: The sub-project improved the quantity of water supplied
through the construction of new tube wells for groundwater pumping, rehabilitation of existing tube
wells, rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply distribution network, and the construction of
overhead reservoirs for storage. It is assumed that health benefits from improved quantity of water (at
PKR 54 per capita per month) will accrue to low income and middle income population in the sub-project
target area, estimated to be 85% of beneficiary households. The estimated economic impact has not been
increased for inflation, and has been kept constant.

9.     Revenue from Water User Fees: Other benefits considered include revenue from water user fees
for the municipal government. However, due to lower than expected collection rates and expected water
tariff increases that did not materialize, financial and economic gains from water user fees are not
substantial. The water tariff is approved by the Provincial Government, and the TMA does not have
control over it. The Provincial Government increased the water tariff in Jehlum in 2011, which is still
considerably below the tariff estimated at appraisal.

     2.2.2. Calculation of Economic Costs for Jehlum Water Supply Sub-Project

10. Increased Operations and Maintenance Expenditure: Besides the capital investment costs, major
economic costs include increased expenditure for operations and maintenance of the sub-project. This
includes electricity, staff costs, and repairs and maintenance. Among these, electricity remained the

largest item, and led to substantial recurrent costs, exacerbated by steadily rising energy prices. A general
inflation rate of 8% has been applied to all costs, and it is assumed that electricity prices will increase by
3% in real terms going forward, which is the assumption used at appraisal. Costs incurred have been used,
where possible, for the period 2005-2012.

11. Other Assumptions Considered: Three assumptions have been revised downward from Appraisal:
i) expected increase in water tariff; ii) expected increase in collection efficiency of water revenues; and
iii) expected rate at which households connect to the water supply system. Other assumptions remain the
same, with actual values used, wherever possible.

result of the provincial government’s decision to disallow an increase.

     2.3.1. Calculation of Benefits for Liaqatpur Water Supply Sub-Project

  13. Quantification of Health Benefits: Economic benefits have been determined using the same
  methodology as for the Jehlum sub-project, except for one addition: health benefits include the impact of
  improved quality of water, in addition to adequate quantity. This is because the Liaqatpur water supply
  sub-project included the rehabilitation of the town’s water treatment plant, which provides cleaner water
  for drinking and other household use. It is assumed that this additional benefit will only accrue to the low
  income population in the sub-project target area, estimated at 50% of the beneficiary households.

  14. Change in Consumer Surplus: Change in Consumer surplus has not been calculated due to similar
  reasons as for the Jehlum sub-project.

  15. Revenue from Water User Fees: Other economic benefits considered include revenue from water
  user fees for the municipal government. However, due to lower than expected collection rates, and no
  water tariff increases since 2001, the financial and economic gains from water user fees are not
  substantial.

      2.3.2. Calculation of Economic Costs for Liaqatpur Water Supply Sub-Project:
  16. Economic costs for the Liaqatpur water supply sub-project have been determined in the same
  manner as for the Jehlum sub-project, except for one difference: the electricity cost for pumping and
  treating per gallon of water in Liaqatpur water supply system is double that in Jehlum per the feasibility
  reports. This is possibly because of the additional element of water treatment in Liaqatpur.

been higher but for tariff rates being much lower than expected.

18. One factor however, that may help improve revenue from water users is the establishment of a
computerized water consumer database for partner TMAs. The database, which has been piloted in a few
TMAs, can help improve collection efficiency and arrears recovery in the medium term.

3. Economic Analysis of Roads Sub-projects

19. Roads and streets was the second largest sub-sector among the Project’s infrastructure investments
portfolio, accounting for 28% of overall expenditure. Economic analysis at completion was undertaken
for two sub-projects involving improvement of road networks in TMAs Pind Dadan Khan (PD Khan) and
Chichawatni. At Appraisal, the ERR for a roads sub-project in Pind Dadan Khan were estimated at 17%.
The analysis has been repeated at completion in order to assess and validate the findings of the ex-ante
analysis. In addition, detailed ex-post economic analysis for another roads sub-project in TMA
Chichawatni has been conducted, to facilitate a wider comparison of results with later investments. The
ex-post economic analysis of the two roads sub-projects (Pind Dadan Khan and Chichawatni) is
summarized below with key results. The detailed analyses are available in Project Files.

 3.1. Methodology

20. The methodology used follows standard practice of comparing life cycle road agency and user costs
with and without project, using Net Present Value (NPV) and EIRR at 12% discount rate as decision
criteria. The Highway Development and Management (HDM) Model-4 of the World Bank, has been used
for analysis. The main assumptions on maintenance and improvement strategies “with” and “without”
project are summarized below.

21. The current roughness level of the existing road is taken as 9 IRI, and only routine maintenance/do
nothing is provided for in the “without project” case. In recognition of the prevailing maintenance
standards in urban areas, roughness levels are allowed to deteriorate up to the maximum value. For
improvement strategy (with project case), one treatment has been tested with improvement and
rehabilitation of roads with improved drainage provisions. Periodic maintenance has been assumed to be



                                                      43
scheduled at every 4-5 years by the Municipal Authorities. The initial treatment will give IRI (roughness)
levels of 3 with Asphalt wearing Course/TST. It is assumed that after improvement, routine maintenance
will be carried out.

22. In the absence of historical traffic count data for these roads, traffic growth rates were estimated
based on national averages. These follow analysis of historical growth rate factors such as population,
GDP, value added in agriculture, transport and commercial fuel consumption, vehicle registration, and
various studies previously done by other institutions in Pakistan. Furthermore, a series of studies by
JICA48 has been referenced to estimate traffic growth rates and elasticity of traffic growth. The current
analysis assumes an overall growth rate of 5.0%, which has an elasticity of 1.0 with respect to historical
GDP.

 3.2. Costs
    3.2.1. Vehicle Operating Costs
Vehicle operating costs depend upon road conditions, as well as vehicle characteristics, utilization, and
prices. For vehicle characteristics, default values of HDM model have been used. Other input data,
namely, prices of vehicles and other inputs, and utilization of vehicles are given below.

       3.2.2. Road Improvement and Maintenance Costs

24. Improvement costs for the rehabilitation and improvement of municipal roads have been
established based on engineering design and completion cost of contracts. Cost per km of road sections is
given in Table A3.5. Residual value of the asset at the end of the operation and maintenance period has
been taken for analysis as 10%. Maintenance costs based on unit rates for various maintenance operations
are given in Table A3.6

 3.3. Economic Benefits

25. The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are: (i) savings in Vehicle Operating Costs
(VOCs) for existing traffic after improvement; (ii) VOC savings to generated traffic where applicable;
and (iii) savings in travel time. Economic benefits from generated traffic or diverted traffic (traffic which
is attracted from an alternative route to the project roads), and other non-tangible benefits which may
occur, including increase in the rents or prices of shops, less time consumed by commuters for shopping
etc., have not been considered.

26. The value of time has been estimated conservatively by estimating the value of working time for
bus and wagon passengers by dividing per capita national income of Rs.89,16550 by 360 days and 8
working hours a day. Considering the labor force statistics in the country, the figure is multiplied by a
factor of 1.67. The value of time of motorcycle and car passengers was taken as 1.5 and 3.0 times higher
than that of bus passengers. The value of non-working time was taken at 1/3rd of working time. The
resulting value of time used in vehicle operating costs is given below. Time savings have also been taken
for passenger vehicles.

savings in VOC generated through better road surface conditions; improved access to markets, which
includes agricultural benefits, and greater economic activity. However, these benefits have not been
quantified.

 3.4. Results of Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis

28. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) have been computed using Highway Development and
Management (HDM) Model - 4 of the World Bank for VOC values. One improvement strategy has been
evaluated. The sensitivity of results has also been tested with respect to 10% increase in costs, decrease in
benefits, both together, and one year’s delay in implementation. Moreover, switching values have also
been calculated for costs and benefits. They indicate the extent of variation in costs or benefits that will
turn EIRR below 12%. The summary of the results is shown in tables 7, 8 and 9 in terms of EIRR,
Switching Values, NPV and B/C ratio.

4. Qualitative Assessment of Economic Benefits from Capacity Grants

29. The overall economic impact of capacity grants is difficult to quantify. Improvements in
institutional performance do not easily translate into monetary terms. Moreover, the transverse nature of
reforms in the areas of performance management, financial management, and procurement among others,
makes it difficult to attribute the expected outcomes to a single reform initiative. However, based on
certain assumptions, expected benefits from proposed interventions were analyzed qualitatively and the
results are encouraging. There is reasonable qualitative evidence to suggest that the overall economic
impact from the interventions is positive. The probable qualitative economic outcomes based on the broad
objectives of the interventions are summarized below.




                                                       46
30. Transparency and Accountability: Empirical literature demonstrates that transparency and trust are
highly correlated, and that as institutions become more transparent they will also become more trusted
(Rawlins 2007). The Complaint Tracking System has helped in increasing transparency and
accountability of TMAs. Urban residents benefit from quicker and responsive resolution of defects or
failures in service delivery, while TMA staff benefit from enhanced job satisfaction and motivation. This
has not only helped in developing the trust of stakeholders in TMAs, but has also helped TMAs to better
plan, monitor, and manage municipal services.

31. Improved Management Systems: Efficient and effective monitoring through the Performance
Management System (PMS) is expected to translate into more efficient service delivery, as evidenced by
the qualitative results from the Institutional Development (ID) Assessment Surveys. Similarly, the
Computerized Financial Management System (CFMS) has also enabled TMAs to maintain electronic
record keeping practices, making financial management and accounting data convenient to use and more
accessible. Therefore, the overall economic returns from these interventions are based on the efficiency of
public service delivery provided through public/ tax money. As with similar technological innovations in
governance, electronic monitoring of urban management and service delivery agencies is strongly
expected to have a spillover effect to related sectors and agencies in urban areas.

32. Moreover, the Participatory Planning Process and GIS based Maps are expected to improve the
joint ownership of stake holders and the government. The use of modern technology not only helps in
investment planning, but also increases the effective management of public assets thus created. In
addition, available evidence from the ID assessment surveys strongly points to an improved capacity for
local economic and investment planning in the participating TMAs.

33. Human Capital Development at TMAs: Finally, interventions involving human capital
enhancement of TMAs have resulted in smooth operationalization of systems and improved interaction
between TMAs and stakeholders. Training provided under the project has encompassed optimal use of
resources, improved management capacity, and the introduction of an IT-based culture. The new
paradigm is expected to result in improved service delivery, as well as simultaneous accruing of very
significant dividends in terms of increased productivity and operational capacity of TMA staff and
officials. This may be a key area of value addition under the project.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      A Beneficiary Perception Survey was undertaken by an independent competitively selected firm,
for assessing perceptions of service delivery improvements and their effectiveness. It covered
beneficiaries of 14 completed sub-projects, selected on the basis of the criterion that they were fully
functional for at least six months at the commencement of the survey. These included 8 water supply, 4
roads/streets, and 2 solid waste management sub-projects. The results are generally positive, showing that
these PMSIP-funded sub-projects have responded to service delivery needs of the citizens. Key findings
are:

2.     Key Findings for Water Supply Sector: The survey sample included households connected to
TMA water supply, as well as those that had not. 54% of respondents said that quantity of water has
improved or significantly improved after the sub-projects, and 56% said that pressure of water supply
has improved or significantly improved. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the use of private
motors/pumps after the commissioning of the water supply sub-projects. About 20% of those respondents
having groundwater pump said that they have very little use of it after sub-project completion. 70% of
respondents stated that the TMA water supply is the primary source of drinking water for them.

3.       61% of respondents said that the quality of water used for household usage has improved or
significantly improved after the sub-project completion. In a very encouraging result, there has been
significant switching to TMA supply as primary source of water for household use after the sub-project:
64% of all respondents used private-bore/hand pump as primary source for household use before sub-
projects. Now, 74% of all respondents use TMA water supply as primary source for household use.

4.       There has also been significant switching to TMA water supply as a primary source of drinking
water after the sub-project - 49% used private-bore/hand pump as primary source before sub-project, and
out of these 71% now use TMA water supply as the primary source. Moreover, the perception of
improvement in drinking water quality is higher for those using TMA water as a primary source of
drinking water - with perception of improvement increasing to 71% of respondents compared to 50%
overall.

5.       Key Findings for Roads and Streets Sector: 66% of beneficiaries said that access had improved
after the sub-project, and 87% said that travel time has reduced. 70% of drivers felt that there has been a
reduction in repair and maintenance cost of vehicles after the sub-project, while 74% of drivers felt that
there has been a reduction in fuel consumption cost. 83% of beneficiaries said that there had been an
increase in value of property along the roads, and 75% indicated improved business opportunities along
roads. Broadly similar results were seen for the one street pavement sub-project which this survey
included.

6.      Key Findings for Solid Waste Management Sector: 72% of respondents confirmed improvement
in primary collection of solid waste and cleanliness of their neighborhoods after sub-project completion.
52% of respondents reported door to door collection of solid waste after the project, compared to 35%
saying this also happened before the sub-project. 33% of households are disposing waste in a
container/bin placed by the TMA, compared to only 7% before the project. Regularity in collection from
containers/bins has also improved, with 56% of all respondents stating that it is collected on daily and/or

weekly basis. 71% of respondents stated that there is an improvement in transportation of solid waste.
After the sub-projects, only a quarter of respondents have said that informal dumping is a major source of
environmental pollution, compared to half the respondents saying that this was a problem before the sub-
projects. Finally, results suggest improved efficiency of TMA staff in complaint resolution, due to the
combined effects of sub-projects and the Complaint Tracking System.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs) represented the most important stakeholders for the
interventions under the project, owing to their centrality to urban local governance, and the provision of
municipal services in the small and medium cities in Punjab. The Project has strived to closely engage
with the TMAs during preparation through the active participation of the leadership of seven TMAs, and
subsequently throughout implementation and completion. This engagement has allowed PMSIP to
consistently use the approach of piloting, learning, and scaling up for its interventions, and use feedback
from participating TMA officials to customize and improve initiatives to better address user requirements.

2.      As part of the Project completion phase, two main instruments were used to capture the views
from stakeholders and record the experiences and lessons learned during Project Implementation. These
included:
    a) Experience Sharing Workshops with TMA Officials;
    b) Structured recording of feedback from TMA officials at all levels through the Second Round of
        the Institutional Development Assessment

Experience Sharing Workshops with TMA Officials

3.      Experience-sharing workshops were held with key TMA officials during missions throughout
project implementation. Four such half-day workshops were organized during one of the last missions
before project completion. Four key TMA officials were invited from each of the 37 partner TMAs that
were project beneficiaries till the scaling up in 2010. The participants included Tehsil Municipal Officers,
Tehsil Officers (Finance), Tehsil Officers (Implementation and Services) and Tehsil Officers (Planning
and Coordination). The objective was to hear their views on the performance of PMIP; where they found
its support useful, and where it could have done better. A summary of the discussions from these are
presented below:

4.      TMA officials overwhelmingly enumerated the benefits of PMSIP’s ID interventions. They
opined that due to the ID initiatives, both municipal service delivery and TMA performance management
had considerably improved.

5.      The Complaint Tracking System (CTS) has improved citizen complaint resolution as TMAs now
have full information on the status of each complaint. The establishment of a complaints cell and regular
reporting of complaints data has been helpful in standardized complaint tracking, resolution, and analysis
by nature and type of complaints.

6.      The Performance Management System (PMS) has helped in the systematic monitoring and
tracking of data on the status of various municipal services, which can now be used to guide manager-
level development decisions.

7.      Municipal Planning and GIS-based Mapping of services assists TMAs in the development of
their Annual Development Plans by providing an input into the process of allocation of resources to
various municipal service sectors. These maps not only assist in investment planning and prioritization of
new infrastructure investments, but have also become the basis for land use classification and surveys.



                                                    52
8.      The development of TMA Websites has also been hailed as public disclosure of information has
been facilitated. Moreover, while staff was initially illiterate in the use of computers, that has now
changed and they are maintaining technology-based systems themselves. In essence, they admit that the
ID interventions have led to a change in the culture of TMA staff and its approach.

9.       Operations and Maintenance of Infrastructure Assets: The option of management contracts for
capital assets was discussed with TMAs. TMA Bhalwal mentioned that it is considering contracting the
management of some of its water supply schemes to an NGO. This would involve long term contracts on
no profit no loss basis. The other TMAs present were keen to learn from this experience. It was also
suggested that regular trainings of TMA staff specifically focusing on O&M of capital assets can be used
in lieu of management contracts or new staff hiring, to better maintain these assets. PMDFC can be a
strong vehicle for such trainings, given its past record.

10.      TMA officials were also strongly in favor of other agencies and entities undertaking
infrastructure investments in TMAs’ jurisdiction being required to coordinate better with the TMAs, since
they had to shoulder the O&M responsibilities of the assets created. This could be done via signing an
MOU with the TMA, or even requiring an NOC from the TMA before beginning capital projects in TMA
jurisdiction.

11.      TMA officials were also of the opinion that the inclusion of the planning staff (TO-Planning) in
infrastructure development process will be fruitful. This will ensure that new capital asset creation aligns
with the overall TMA plans, as planning staff were best suited to give holistic information on the status of
assets and service infrastructure in the TMA.

12.      Own-Source Revenue Generation: The level of financial self-sufficiency of TMAs and options
to improve it were also discussed. TMA officials mentioned the need for higher level support (from the
Province) in raising taxes (such as on transfer of property, rates, and user charges (such as for water
supply). This support is not always forthcoming, thus keeping TMA resources low. Beyond this, TMA
officials expressed interest in working with PMDFC to explore ways to enhance own source revenue
generation using better utilization of existing sources. The database of water consumers developed and
computerized billing of water connections supported through the CFMS can further assist in generation of
OSR.

13.      Improvements in Planning and the Role of Town Officer (Planning): The TOs Planning
suggested that since data was now available through GIS-based mapping, it could be used for more
sophisticated purposes like Land Value mapping within the urban area limits. This would assist in
efficient collection of commercialization fees, property tax revenue and other receipts. Moreover, they
strongly supported provision of GIS training to TMA staff and the housing of GIS-based data at the TMA
level, so that TMA staff can update the maps and data as needed. A number of TOs (P) volunteered to
train TMA staff as well as update maps themselves.

14.     Procurement Procedures and Sub-Project Implementation: In general there was positive
feedback on the project implementation model which made TMAs responsible for civil works contract,
with supervision support from a firm hired by PMDFC. This provided management support to TOs I&S.
However, in some TMAs where the multiple contracts were running, the need to bring in more resources



                                                    53
to support in contract management was highlighted. Similarly, the project did not allow pre-registration
of firms but the TMA’s own processes required reference to the list of pre-registration firms. TMAs
supported the idea of having a transparent and disseminated system of pre-registration.

Results from the Second Round of the Institutional Development (ID) Assessment

15.     The ID Assessment, including a detailed survey and follow-up analysis work was completed by
PMDFC in early 2013, with assistance from the Bank Task Team to systematically assess the impact of
ID initiatives implemented. The first round conducted in 2009 at the MTR stage, covered 19 partner
TMAs of the first phase, while the second one focused on 37 (including the 19 original ones) partner
TMAs. The data collected provides detailed feedback on the extent of usage and utility of each ID
intervention, as well as possible future directions that these interventions could take.

16.      Results from the second round of the Assessment51 suggest that extending the scope to a larger
number of TMAs resulted in the intended replication of key benefits to the newer TMAs. Moreover, a
greater level of satisfaction and achievement of higher level benefits in older partner TMAs demonstrates
a successful deepening of ID interventions. The results provide strong evidence to suggest that TMAs are
increasingly using these tools in more sophisticated ways for planning, O&M, and decision making.

17.      Complaint Tracking System (CTS): Adoption of the Complaint Tracking System (CTS) has
made possible the systematic organization of complaint information, standardization and reduction of
resolution time, efficient redressal of individual complaints, and has in turn resulted in enhanced public
confidence in the complaint resolution systems. TMAs are also using CTS for identification of problem
areas and Rehabilitation and Maintenance (R&M) needs.

18.     Performance Management System (PMS): Introduction of the Performance Management
System (PMS) has enabled TMA officials to quantify municipal services’ coverage, evaluate municipal
services’ quality, and monitor TMA staff performance. Moreover, survey results indicate that TMAs are
beginning to utilize PMS for more sophisticated objectives such as identification of R&M requirements,
and decision making on service delivery needs. This has formed a firm base to move on areas such as
budget allocations, identification of capital investments, and O&M allocations.

19.     Computerized Financial Management System (CFMS): The Financial Management System
(FMS) has successfully provided an automated accounting and financial management system in partner
TMAs, and has improved generation of financial reports, reconciliation of accounts, and maintenance of a
ledger of receipts and expenditures. Subsequent additions to CFMS have facilitated TMAs towards the
recovery of arrears, and increasingly employ electronic record-keeping and bill generation for water
supply consumers. However, a full transition to CFMS will only be achieved if the use of CFMS reports
is allowed as valid audit documents.

20.     Computer Trainings and Websites: IT trainings conducted in TMAs have made a major
contribution towards developing an IT culture. TMAs are increasingly aware of the significance of
Websites for disseminating information regarding upcoming and ongoing projects, tenders, major events,
budgets, etc. to the citizens. While websites are still being updated less frequently than intended, greater
ownership and focus from TMA management demonstrates improvements in this regard. TMA officials
have found IT trainings to be very useful in developing an IT culture.

21.      Participatory Planning: The Planning Process under PMSIP included the development of GIS
maps; preparation of spatial plans; and a demand-based prioritization of sub-projects. TMA management
is successfully using GIS Maps for planning infrastructure investments. An important benefit of the
planning exercise conducted in partner TMAs has been the subsequent availability of GIS-based maps for
infrastructure investment planning, and the growing awareness amongst the planning staff and TMA
management regarding the utility of these maps. An increasing number of TMAs are selecting projects
from the Prioritized List of Investments for their development decision making and more TMA staff is
finding value in the demand-based planning exercise now.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The current section includes key sections from the Implementation Completion Report shared by the
Punjab Municipal Development Funds Company (PMDFC) which is the principle implementation agency
for the TMA Component.

                        Key Sections of Implementation Completion Report from
                            Punjab Municipal Development Funds Company

    1. Project Development Objectives

1.      The objective of the project was to improve the viability and effectiveness of urban services
provided by the participating TMAs, and to make such improvements sustainable and replicable in other
TMAs through the creation of a performance based management framework at both TMA and provincial
levels.

2.       The objective was quite relevant as TMAs were newly created under PLGO 2013 and were
assigned specific functions relating with municipal services. Therefore Banks interventions were timely
and objectively planned. The objective was successfully achieved by introducing institutional and
infrastructural initiatives in municipal bodies. Initially, 19 TMAs were selected and the scope was finally
extended to 105 TMAs.

    2. Implementation

3.       Infrastructure Development: PMSIP’s infrastructure development grants have financed
investments (sub-projects) in selected TMAs. TMAs were ranked on the basis of performance criteria.
The top ranked ones were eligible to access PMSIP funding subject to their agreement to fully implement
the Institutional Development initiatives, demonstrate a service delivery need, and agree to adequately
fund the subsequent O&M of the service infrastructure so developed.

4.       The infrastructure development grants have enabled TMAs to invest in enhanced municipal
service delivery in a managed and sustainable manner. Performance criteria were used to provide funds
to better performing TMAs for demand-based investments in service delivery infrastructure. Investments
for completed sub-projects include rehabilitation, improvement, and coverage expansion in water supply
(17 sub-projects), roads and streets (14 sub-projects), solid waste management (7 sub-projects), sewerage
and sewage treatment (1 sub-project), parks (1 sub-project) and firefighting (1 sub-project). The status of
all PMSIP sub-projects is summarized below:
                                          Status of PMSIP Sub-projects
                                                                            No. of sub-
              Status

5.      These 39 completed sub-projects have taken place in 29 different urban centers. Out of a total of
almost PKR 3 billion in expenditure, approximately half has been spent on water supply sub-projects.
This includes extension and improvement of networks, as well as replacement of worn-out equipment.
There has also been a growing focus on sub-projects in the solid waste management sector.

6.     Institutional Development: PMSIP introduced a number of Institutional Development activities
for enhancing TMAs ability in municipal services delivery to the public. An epigrammatic view of
PMSIP Institutional Development interventions is as under:

7.      Citizen Complaint Tracking and Redressal Systems (CTS): It was designed and implemented in
105 TMAs to comply with the requirements of PLGO 2001 and was in line with the practices of good
governance where active feedback of citizens in the form of complaints is received and acted upon by the
urban local government. PMSIP devised a comprehensive complaint resolution and redressal system with
standard operating procedures for the TMA staff. Citizens were provided the opportunity to log their
complaints through telephone as well as through email. CTS helped in allocating funds for the repair and
maintenance of municipal services in areas which required immediate and long term improvement.

8.      Centralized Province-wide Performance Management System (PMS): Performance
Management System designed with the technical assistance of the experts from the World Bank helped in
developing a baseline of the performance of TMAs. Subsequently, realistic performance improvement
plans were made to achieve targets set for improving access and coverage to municipal services. PMS has
now been automated in 105 TMAs and the partner TMAs submits their reports on KPIs through an online
database.

9.      Computerization of Financial Management Systems (CFMS): CFMS was introduced in 102
TMAs to streamline the budgetary data of the TMAs of Punjab so that issues related to manual book
keeping and financial planning could be avoided. This objective was successfully achieved by PMSIP and
financial data of the partner TMAs of Punjab has been properly automated which has increased the
transparency and accountability manifolds. CFMS uses the New Accounting Model (NAM) and is fully
compatible with the World Bank funded PIFRA system.

10.      Participatory Planning for prioritization of Investments: Urban planning was a big challenge
for the nascent local urban governments whereby they were required to plan for the entire cities with
meager resources. PMSIP, with the use of GIS technology to map the status of municipal services and to
classify cities into different zones, assisted the 104 TMAs in developing Plans for urban development
whereby development projects were identified with the technical assistance of PMSIP and the same were
prioritized by adopting a participatory approach in the light of the wishes of local citizens.

11.      Creation and Implementation of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Framework:
Infrastructure developed by successive governments in general and urban local governments in particular
was deteriorating due to the absence of operation and maintenance. PMSIP realized the need to provide
the urban local governments with an “Operation and maintenance Framework” that could guide them
towards taking the necessary and timely steps for O&M of infrastructure. The framework provided by
PMSIP will enhance both the performance and life of infrastructure of urban local governments.

12.      Creation and Optimal Use of Up-to-date and User-friendly Websites: PMSIP provided the
TMAs with an opportunity to benefit from the use of information technology whereby TMAs could share
and disseminate information about their working with the citizens. Websites developed for 103 TMAs
under PMSIP also fulfilled the transparency and accountability requirements laid down by the governing
statute of PLGO 2001 which required all local governments to share their financial and administrative
information with the citizens.

13.     IT Training and Support for TMA Staff: PMSIP bridged the capacity gap of officials of TMAs
with respect to office working and IT training through the provision of necessary trainings to 1136 staff
members of partner TMAs while taking care of the much needed hardware support as well. The trained
staff worked for successful implementation of PMSIP interventions like TMA websites


                                                   57
       14.     PMDFC also provided support in the capacity enhancement of the Local Government Department
       in Punjab, which helped in developing a culture of accountability, transparency, good governance and
       informed decision-making.

        16.      Monitoring and Evaluation: A comprehensive M&E system was developed for monitoring of
        infrastructure and institutional development components of PMSIP. This included steps for:
          a) Implementation monitoring
          b) Process monitoring
          c) Output and Outcome monitoring

        17.      For institutional development activities, an implementation monitoring system was developed
        that recorded the procedures and steps followed in the introduction of all Institutional Development
        activities in 105 partner TMAs.

        18.     For infrastructure schemes, a more rigorous system for implementation monitoring was
        developed, given the scale of financial involvement:
          a) At PMDFC level: Separate full-time highly qualified Consultants were hired from the private sector
              responsible for: Planning and Scheduling; and Contract Management.
          b) At Scheme level: a Resident Supervision contract was given out to qualified engineering
              consultancy firms to provide quality assurance and support at the field level




                                                                59
    c) At TMA level: constant support and hand-holding was provided to TMA on following best
       practices and reporting progress on financial and physical status of schemes.

19.      For institutional development activities, a comprehensive process monitoring system was
developed that tracked the procedures and systems being followed for each Institutional Development
activity at the TMA level. This was centrally monitored by PMDFC and closely tracked the processes at
the TMA level that have been introduced due to these Institutional Development interventions.

20.      Result Management System Approach: M&E matrices for Institutional Development
interventions using a result management system approach were developed and actual data was entered in
these matrices periodically to evaluate the impact created by Institutional Development interventions. For
infrastructure schemes, contract management SOPs were developed to systematically track the
performance of TMAs in managing these schemes from project start to completion stage. These SOPs
were introduced in partner TMAs by PMDFC and then tracked centrally throughout the length of the
scheme.

21.      Quarterly Status Report on Improvements/actions for Adjustments in Contract Management:
Require monthly report from consultants on delays, the reports from the consultants were demanded on
periodic based to monitor the delays of activities affecting the progress of sub project. These reports were
certified and accepted by contractor, with proposed mitigation actions taken from contractor’s side.

22.     Delay Analyses of PMSIP Infrastructure Sub-projects: These analyses were conducted to
evaluate the factors causing delay in the infrastructure sub projects.

23.     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance: PMDFC has employed a robust environmental
safeguards management system. Below is a synopsis of environmental safeguard adopted by PMDFC.

3. Assessment of Outcome

    3.1 Relevance of Objectives
24.     The objective was quite relevant as TMAs were newly created under PLGO 2001 and were
assigned specific functions relating with municipal services. Therefore Banks interventions were timely



                                                       60
and objectively planned and were such that future changes could easily be incorporated at any time. The
objective was successfully achieved by introducing institutional and infrastructural initiatives in
municipal bodies. Earlier 37 TMAs were selected and then the scope was extended to 105 TMAs.

    3.2 Achievement of Objectives
25.     The Project has significantly achieved its development objectives. This is demonstrated by the
performance against the agreed outcome and intermediate outcome indicators.

                                Municipal services are considered as a vital need for improving the quality of
                                living and well-being. Therefore, the Bank’s intervention in the urban sector
                                through PMSIP was both timely and objectively planned.
Technical,       Satisfactory   The project was prepared after thorough consultation with all stakeholders and
Financial, and                  appropriate interventions were designed in supporting the urban sector in the
Economic                        Punjab province.
Aspects                         At the plenary stage, the baseline information collected was quite adequate. A
                                proper evaluation was conducted to assess the capacity of the borrower and

Consultation     Satisfactory   significantly. The Bank regularly held consultations with all relevant
                                stakeholders of the project particularly during the project design with the
                                government counterparts and the active participation of the TMAs during
                                project preparation. In other aspects, Bank continuously held discussions with
                                LG&CDD, PMDFC, P&D and the TMA officials from time to time during the
                                implementation and evaluation stages. Various visits of TMAs were conducted
                                along with implementing agency during the initial implementing phase of the
                                project to analyze and access the progress of components so that any error found
                                could be removed and interventions may be replicated in other TMAs with a

                                visits on project sites. Infrastructure and Institutional Development related
                                technical inputs were provided from time to time. Obstacles related to the
                                implementation of certain project components were discussed with the GoPb
                                and solutions were recommended.

                                agency. Periodic reports were fetched from implementing agency on
                                infrastructure and Institutional Development components indicating the progress
                                of the project.
                                Moreover, it was also required by the WB to conduct Beneficiary Perception
                                Survey for completed infrastructure sub projects, Institutional Development
                                assessment exercises as well as various analyses such as result chain and delay
                                analysis etc. to track the issues faced by implementing agency. For the purpose,
                                intensive guidelines and technical support were provided.

28.     The Bank’s overall performance is considered satisfactory. The Project Development Objective
was significantly achieved. One of the components of the PDO was institutional development of TMAs
which not only strengthened the municipal service delivery institution but also set many valuable
examples. For infrastructure projects, the Bank provided both technical and financial support. It is
understood that during the design and development of the project, some of the decisions made were very
relevant and in harmony with the realities of country’s background. However, if any gaps existed during
the implementation phase, the Bank realized and provided timely support to PMDFC in particular and all
other stakeholders in general. The Bank was well-informed about the major constraints during the
implementation of the project that were beyond the PMDFC control. Therefore, the Bank approved
extension requests twice for around three years beyond the originally planned completion date.

Utilization of M&E data,   Satisfactory   The LG&CDD being the parent department of all municipal bodies has
HR in decision-making                     the mandate of oversight and monitoring of LG performance. An
and resource allocation                   integration cell has been housed at LG&CDD for robust monitoring and
                                          evaluation (M&E) system. This is linked to PMDFC’s M&E system,
                                          through which TMAs report on agreed municipal service indicators.
                                          Through this LG&CDD is able to undertake performance monitoring of
                                          LGs. In future, LG&CDD can begin to seek data on required key
                                          performance indicators from the TMAs.
                                          Due to the scaling up of Institutional Development interventions across
                                          all TMAs in Punjab, majority of the LG staff across the province has
                                          benefitted from the operational improvements introduced under PMSIP.
                                          This has resulted in the creation of an ‘effective mass’ within the entire
                                          LG cadre for ensuring sustainability of PMSIP’s interventions
                                          introduced in TMAs. Moreover, Institutional data provided substantial
                                          immediate benefits and the setting-in of tangible longer term help for the
                                          government in utilizing the resources in true manner.

    4.3 PMDFC Performance (Self-Assessment)

30.      PMDFC has adopted systematic approach to design and implement PMSIP both Institutional
Development and Infrastructure Development components keeping in view the field challenges such as;
capacity constraints at TMAs level, lack of relevant information, commitments and target oriented
approach. Technical support throughout the project period was extended by PMDFC as it had selected
skilled human resource according to the scale and requirement of the project interventions. PMDFC teams
conducted thorough field visits to suggest practical measures within the given constraints for suggesting
improvements for both institutional and infrastructure development initiatives.

31.      The implementation of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for contract management in the
various infrastructure sub-projects was monitored by PMDFC, particularly in respect of time extensions,
variations, performance guarantees, payment certificates, and completion certificates etc. Periodic
contract management audits were also carried out by PMDFC. During the infrastructure development
initiatives and investments at TMAs, PMDFC contributed strongly in improving procurement and
contract management capacities by providing expertise and technical support. Required hands-on
trainings to relevant TMA staff were also provided in areas of project designing, project planning,
contract administration and O&M.

32.      Further, all project-funded infrastructure schemes have followed the PMDFC-developed
Environmental and Social Framework to ensure that their design and implementation adheres to highest
standards and do not leave any significant negative impact. All sub-projects that were subject to Punjab
EPA environmental permission processes have received approvals. Environmental safeguards aspects for
sub-projects have been managed in compliance with relevant Bank environment policies. Furthermore,
PDFMC has implemented a number of actions beyond the regulatory requirements, including
strengthening of TMAs’ environmental management capacity, public hearings for sub-projects, and
training sessions on environmental management and occupational health and safety.

33.      Institutional Development section of PMDFC provided the required technical support to TMAs,
in terms of ensuring effective municipal service delivery through capacity building initiatives in
accordance with scope defined under Project Development Objective. PMDFC teams conducted thorough
field visits to suggest practical measures within the given constraints for improving the delivery of
municipal services. Intensive trainings, both class room and hands-on, were given to the staff of partner
TMAs for optimization of results. Results determined through detailed assessment exercise of
Institutional Development component provided basis to enhance the scope of the institutional


                                                       64
development subcomponent to another 68 TMAs. PMDFC has also provided support in the capacity
enhancement of the Local Government department in Punjab leading in developing a culture of
accountability, transparency, good governance and informed decision making.

5. Lessons Learnt

34.     Giving TMAs More Responsibility: The project gave TMAs far more responsibility than they
were used to, by making them lead the process of large infrastructure development schemes that were
funded by PMSIP. This was new for them, and enhanced their capacity over the life of the project, in
project management, contract management and operations and maintenance.

35.      Testing Pilots and then Scaling-Up Across Province: The project introduced a set of
institutional development interventions in a gradual piloting process – first in 17 and then 18 TMAs. Once
these had been successfully tested over a few years, they were replicated and scaled up to 68 additional
TMAs across Punjab. This strategy worked very well as now 105 TMAs are beneficiaries of these well-
designed and much-needed interventions.

36.      Incentives and Rewards are Vital in Maintaining LG Interest in Performance
Improvements: The best performing TMAs, ranked based on their performance in adoption of
institutional development activities, were provided grants for large-scale infrastructure schemes. This
incentive system allowed TMAs to compete amongst each other on high performance, and will be a key
feature of PMDFC’s future work.

37.     Sustainable Improvements in Service Delivery Require Robust O&M Systems: Instead of
solely providing TMAs with fully-developed large-scale infrastructure schemes to manage, the project
helped build their capacity in operations and maintenance of these schemes. O&M manuals were
developed and implemented at the TMA level, enhancing their capacity to manage their newly acquired
systems in a sustainable manner.

38.     More TMA Ownership Needed for Some Aspects, Requiring Province-Level Guidance:
TMAs did not show enough ownership initially for some aspects of the project, both for institutional
development interventions and infrastructure schemes. In the earlier stages, TMAs viewed these as
requirements imposed by PMDFC, an outside entity not part of their official reporting structure. This was
especially true for engineering consultancy arrangements for infrastructure schemes, which were needed
for many quality assurance aspects of these schemes. The situation significantly improved in the later
stages as TMAs became adequately aware of benefits from these interventions.

39.     Adequacy of Staffing and Requisite Skills Essential to Maintain and Update Systems
Introduced: In the initial phases of the project, many gains were compromised when TMA staff left or
were transferred to other entities. This was resolved when the activities were scaled up to 105 TMAs
across the province. Now, we are beginning to see the creation of a cadre of trained staff that is fully
acquainted with project interventions.

40.    Documentation and Communications of Project Achievements and Good Practices Weak:
The implementing agencies could have further strengthened the systematic documentation and
communication of results and achievements that were done over the last six years. This may have been an
opportunity not entirely exploited in increasing the profile of the project amongst stakeholders, and
developing strong champions of its interventions and results.




                                                   65
41.      Sustainability of achievements requires enabling environment and oversight from higher
levels: While the project has introduced a whole suite of institutional development interventions that have
built the capacity of TMAs, as well as helped them design, develop, operate and maintain large scale
infrastructure projects, these activities need to be further institutionalized as they require more support at
the Provincial level. Mandating municipal entities across the province to adopt these interventions is the
easiest way to consolidate gains and institutionalize these activities.

Annex 10. Implementation of the Cultural Heritage Sub-component

1.      The cultural heritage (CH) subcomponent was added to the Project with the objective to
undertake the detailed preparatory activities that a CH initiative requires, as well as to fund a pilot. Its
focus was on: (a) appropriate amendments to the existing legislative frameworks; (b) undertaking studies
to recommend rationalization of institutional mandates for management of heritage assets; and (c)
implementing a pilot project, which included the creation of a Heritage Trail, to showcase methods and
benefits of conservation of cultural assets and their productive re/use. The key highlights of
implementation experience of this component are discussed below.

2.      Implementing Arrangements: The overall implementing agency for this subcomponent under
Component-2 of the Project was Government of Punjab’s Planning and Development Department
(P&DD). During Project preparation, it was envisaged that the already established Urban Unit would be
responsible for its management and implementation. However, soon after in September 2006, P&DD set
up a dedicated agency – the Sustainable Development of the Walled City of Lahore (SDWCL) unit under
the P&DD. During implementation, this has transitioned into the Walled City of Lahore Authority
(WCLA) following the enactment of the Walled City of Lahore Act 2012.

3.      The engagement of specialist skills required for heritage restoration activities at SDWCL Unit,
and later the WCLA, was undertaken very slowly over time. This had negative consequences on the pace
of implementation, particularly with regard to the pilot heritage restoration sub-project which had
required stronger capacity at the implementation agency in terms of project and contract management
expertise.

4.      Legislative and Institutional Aspects: There are multiple legislative frameworks that govern the
                                                                            52
conservation, restoration, and maintenance of historic assets in the Punjab . Their contents are at times
contradictory to each other, while many clauses are outdated and no longer relevant. While progress to
enact adequate legislation was slow, the promulgation of Punjab Historic Areas Planning, Development,
and Regulation Ordinance 2007 represented an early success in this regard. However, the ordinance
lapsed during the political transition in the country. Subsequently, the Government of Punjab enacted the
Walled City of Lahore Act 2011 through the Punjab parliament, thus rationalizing and updating the legal
framework operating in the Walled City of Lahore (WCL). Moreover, the legislation proved to be a key
step towards supporting rationalization of institutional mandates with the establishment and
operationalization of the WCLA. The Authority is currently in the process of assuming multiple
responsibilities for the Walled City of Lahore, being transferred from other institutions at various levels of
government.

5.      The need to establish formal partnerships with relevant utility agencies such as Lahore Electric
Supply Company (LESCO), Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA), Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Limited (SNGPL), and Pakistan Telecommunication Limited (PTCL) was critical to the undertaking of
envisaged infrastructure improvement works. The former SDWCL unit engaged with the agencies early
on with the aim to expeditiously establish Memorandum of Partnerships (MoPs). However, the signing of


52
 Like the Punjab Heritage Foundation Act 2005, the Punjab Special Premises (Preservation) Ordinance 1985,
Antiquities Act of 1975, and the Evacuee Trust Property Management and Disposal Act 1975.


                                                     69
the required MoPs suffered from substantial delays due to several factors, which in turn impacted the
commencement of physical works on the pilot project.

6.       Partnership with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture: The CH initiative was instrumental in
attracting the interest of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) as a development partner in 2008. The
technical support from AKTC, and later its subsidiary the Aga Khan Cultural Services Program (AKCSP),
led to an effective collaboration with the GoPunjab. AKTC-AKCSP provided invaluable guidance and
technical assistance on the detailed preparatory activities for the Pilot Project, as well as identification of
potential demonstration sub-projects along the Shahi Guzargah. Key areas that benefitted from their
technical assistance included:

a) Completion of an inventory of all buildings in the entire WCL, including inventory of land use,
   ownership, age, and historic value, and the setting up of an operational GIS system in the AKCSP
   premises;
b) Completion of the detailed physical documentation of buildings along the Shahi Guzargah (SG),
   including the preparation of a complete inventory with detailed attributes;
c) Completion of the socio-economic survey of the pilot area;
d) Development of conceptual frameworks and detailed designs of the building facades, as well as
   appropriate street paving proposals. These ensured that all aspects of building asset restoration and
   infrastructure upgrading were designed and implemented in an integrated fashion; and
e) Preparation of a comprehensive logical framework analysis (LFA) for the sustainable development of
   the entire WCL over a 10 year period, as well as a more focused LFA for the Bank-funded CH
   component.

7.       Neighborhood Demonstration Initiative: Prior to the commencement of the pilot heritage
restoration sub-project, work on two streets on a sub-pilot basis was undertaken to test methods and
specifications, and streamline processes. AKTC-AKCSP undertook work on Gali Surjan Singh while the
SDWCL unit carried out work on Mohammadi Mohalla. Work on the latter was delayed due to
termination of the original contract, with the remaining works undertaken by another contractor through
rebidding. The sub-pilots resulted in the accumulation of critical technical capacity and supervision
experience at the implementing agency, which informed the implementation of the main pilot heritage
restoration sub-project.

8.       Pilot Heritage Conservation Sub-project: The Shahi Guzargah (the Royal Route) was selected as
the pilot for implementation, to showcase methods and benefits of conservation of cultural assets and their
productive re/use. It is the route that the Mughal emperors followed to reach the royal fort palace, when
returning from Delhi to Lahore or vice versa. The initiative includes: (i) provision of new municipal
infrastructure and services (below ground as far as possible) including electrical, communication, water
supply, storm drainage, sewerage, and gas supply networks which were obsolete, inadequate, or
completely absent; and (ii) rehabilitation of the urban fabric through facade and street improvements.




                                                     70
9.       The overall scope of physical works under the pilot project included, in addition to infrastructure
rehabilitation works:

    Number of streets to be paved:                        57
    Number of facades to be improved:                     773
    Number of buildings in the project area:              1028 (including buildings without façade work)

10.     Due to a variety of reasons including the nature of works involved which could not be fully
estimated upfront; weak contract management capacity at WCLA; and time and effort needed to
undertake preparatory activities before implementation could begin the Works Contract remained
incomplete at project closing. The status of implementation was completion of 72% of façade
improvement work and 52% of street surfacing work. Similarly, for the infrastructure rehabilitation, 75%
of general works, 70% of water supply system, 70% of sewerage, 80% of storm water drainage, and 60%
of electrical network works had been completed. The remaining works are being completed using
GoPunjab funds.

11.     Restoration of Shahi Hammam. The removal of encroachments from the periphery of the Shahi
Hammam under the Project had a seminal impact in revealing the glory of this historic jewel. The AKTC
has more recently been able to secure bilateral funding for its restoration. Detailed physical
documentation and measured drawings are currently being developed; careful excavation to reveal the
original construction and details, buried well below the current finished floor levels is underway; and
research in the historic use of the spaces revealed is in progress. In view of its invaluable historic and
monumental value, as well as potential to attract visitors, it is heartening to see this precious monument
being scientifically restored for posterity.




                                                    71
12.     Social Mobilization: Over time, public space in the WCL has been massively encroached upon.
Detailed surveys of the pilot project area identified the need to remove 147 shops completely, with
another 732 shops being affected on a temporary basis along the Shahi Guzargah. Moreover, 264
encroachments onto the public realm (mainly kitchens and washrooms) were identified in the 47
residential streets emanating from the Shahi Guzargah.

13.     The scale of encroachment was a significant challenge to the implementation of the pilot project.
The initiative has had to undertake a large scale social mobilization effort to ensure the careful
community-centered implementation of its Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and its subsequent updation.
Activities included widely held consultations; baseline development of the Project Area; impact
assessment and mitigation; mechanism to address grievances of the affectees during implementation; and
adequate institutional capacity to implement the RAP.

14.     WCLAs Social Mobilization Team (SMT) has, among other activities, conducted over 1000
meetings to create awareness among the shopkeepers, traders, and residents; helped form 10 CBOs; and
helped train 48 youth of the area in technical skills, many of whom have found sustainable employment.
As a result, the Project has been able to undertake successful relocation of shops and residences that had
encroached on the public domain. Robust social mobilization ensured that the work was not just restricted
to resettlement, but also included residents in benefit sharing through trainings and community
organization. The Project has left in place a living model of citizen engagement in heritage restoration,
which can serve as a platform for citizen led regeneration and tourism in the area.
