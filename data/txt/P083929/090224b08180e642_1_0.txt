                         The objective of the project is to improve the viability and effectiveness of urban services provided by the participating TMAs, and to make such improvements
                         sustainable and replicable in other TMAs through the creation of a performance-based management framework at both TMA and provincial levels.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Institutional and Infrastructure Development components being implemented by the Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMDFC) are progressing satisfactorily
                         towards achieving the Project Development Objective. Since the last ISR, there have been significant achievements in the scaling up of Institutional Development (ID) activities in all
                         105 Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs) across Punjab, with an additional 68 TMAs brought under the project’s fold compared to the initial 37. These interventions are
                         introducing better governance, transparency, and accountability in municipal governments through the strengthening of systems and procedures. They include systems for
                         performance management, complaint tracking, computerized financial management, GIS-based spatial planning, participatory investment planning, contract management, and

                         The Investment component has enabled TMAs to invest in enhanced municipal service delivery in a managed and sustainable manner. It includes sub-projects for rehabilitation,
                         improvement, and coverage expansion in water supply, sewerage, roads and streets, and solid waste management, as well as provision of a variety of equipment for O&M of
                         municipal infrastructure and services. A total of 42 infrastructure development sub-projects were commenced by various TMAs under PMSIP, out of which 30 have been physically

                         completed, while the rest are in various stages of implementation. The pace of implementation of infrastructure development sub-projects undertaken by partner TMAs in the second
                         and third cycles has significantly improved. Substantial improvements in contract management procedures have resulted in increasing subproject completion rates and decreasing
                         delays.
                         Under the Cultural Heritage Component, the Walled City of Lahore Act has been promulgated after due process through the Punjab Cabinet and Assembly, and the Walled City
                         Authority has been notified. This is a major achievement, as the Act will go a long way in establishing the much needed regulative mechanisms for conserving and restoring the
                         historic core of Lahore including the periphery of the Walled City which is included in the control area of the Authority, and establish this area as an important tourism destination. It
                         will also help do away with conflicts in the multiple laws that have governed interventions to date in the Walled City of Lahore. The main pilot project under this component is under
                         implementation, where the work involved is multifaceted and the time line extremely tight for a project of such complexity. GoPunjab will need to be vigilant in supervising the quality
                         of implementation, and securing the requisite specialist skills for ensuring the restoration of invaluable cultural assets and urban regeneration of the historic core of Lahore in
                         accordance with international standards.
