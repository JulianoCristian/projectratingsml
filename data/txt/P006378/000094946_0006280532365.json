The lessons indicate how an\n            optimized network rehabilitation, and maintenance strategy,\n            can effectively re-instate an entire road network into\n            satisfactory conditions, over a period of just a few years,\n            and at reasonable costs, as demonstrated in Santa Catarina.\n            It is suggested that a proactive supervision, and project\n            restructuring, if critical assumptions have changed (the\n            funding capacities of the states were converted following\n            the establishment of the stabilization program), are\n            essential ingredients to achieve development objectives. The\n            increase of the Bank's cost-share for civil works, from\n            50 percent to 75 percent, drastically improved the\n            attractiveness of the loans, hence, consideration for\n            offering better cost-sharing arrangements, should be taken\n            into account. While grouping similar sub-projects under one\n            \"umbrella\" project can lead to savings at the\n            project processing stage, the very few economies of scale in\n            supervision, renders appraisal, and completion stages so\n            difficult, that it is therefore suggested that each\n            sub-project be adequately, and separately funded, to allow\n            for effective supervision, and include civil works'\n            field visits as well."}, "docdt": "2000-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
