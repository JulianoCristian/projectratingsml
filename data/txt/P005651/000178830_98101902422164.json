It would help meet the growing\n            local demand for foundry products, and improve the quality\n            and cost competitiveness of castings thus creating also a\n            sound basis for exports. It would form an important backward\n            link for engineering industries which have been given the\n            highest priority by the Tunisian Government. Further, it\n            would serve to strengthen and upgrade technological and\n            management capabilities through technical assistance and a\n            management improvement program. The project consists of: (i)\n            modernization of SOFOMECA's existing iron and steel\n            foundry by reorganizing the productive facilities and\n            installing new equipment; (ii) installation of a new\n            fully-equipped foundry for mechanical castings; and (iii)\n            construction of a sand treatment plant to supply Tunisian\n            foundries and other industrial users with high-quality sand."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
