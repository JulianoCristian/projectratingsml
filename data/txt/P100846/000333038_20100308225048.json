    follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: strong political commitment and ownership\n            are critical for successfully steering a sector-wide program\n            and for addressing governance constraints to effective\n            service delivery. Many changes required challenging\n            historical expectations and vested interests. One example is\n            the success in implementing a merit-based teacher\n            recruitment policy in Sindh, in a significant break from\n            past practice. Complementary non-lending analytical and\n            advisory support and sustained dialogue is essential. Bank\n            engagement at the highest political levels played a key role\n            in supporting the new government in implementing\n            improvements in sector governance. At the same time,\n            technical inputs from Bank staff through, for example,\n            analytical reports and a variety of just-in-time policy and\n            technical assistance notes supported design and\n            implementation. Given the educational context in Pakistan,\n            it is important to simultaneously address the issues of\n            school access and quality. Experience shows that the\n            quantity of education (enrolling in school) is only one\n            factor which affects the socio-economic prospects of\n            individuals. The level of learning (quality of education) is\n            also a powerful determinant. It is likely that the\n            simultaneous focus in Sindh Education Sector Reform Program\n            (SERP) on inputs and reforms to improve quality also\n            improved access. Systematic communication can play a key\n            role in ensuring wider understanding and ownership.\n            Strategic communications can increase understanding among\n            the general public, media and civil society, local\n            communities as well as internal stakeholders such as\n            teachers or other employees. This involves two way\n            communications and extensive consultations."}, "docdt": "2009-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
