Objectives 
and 
Description: 
The 
proposed 
credit 
of 
SDR 
18 
million 
(US$ 
25 
million 
equivalent) 
aims 
to 
support 
the 
Government 
of 
Bolivia’s 
ongoing 
decentralization 
reform 
agenda. 
The 
proposed 
operation 
would 
be 
the 
second 
in 
series 
of 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credits 
(PSACs). 
The 
proposed single-tranche 
PSAC 
continues 
the 
reform 
agenda 
initiated 
under 
the 
first 
PSAC, 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
in 
May 
2001. 
The 
comprehensive 
decentralization 
reform 
program 
aims 
to 
adapt 
the 
existing 
institutional  framework 
for 
improved 
decentralized 
public 
service 
delivery 
and 
governance 
to implement 
the 
Government’s 
poverty reduction 
strategy. 
The 
PSAC 
program 
supports the 
Government 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
public 
services 
to 
the 
poor 
and increase the 
efficiency, 
transparency and 
accountability 
of 
Bolivia’s 
decentralized  government 
system. 
Bolivia 
has 
taken 
important 
steps, 
including 
those 
supported 
under 
the 
first 
PSAC, 
hut 
important 
challenges 
remain. 
The 
proposed 
operation 
supports 
further 
deepening 
of 
the 
reform 
efforts, especially 
as 
regards 
issues 
of 
subnational 
finance 
and 
administration. 
The 
overall 
goals 
of 
the 
Government’s decentralization reforms 
are 
to 
(i) 
improve 
the 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
decentralization; 
(ii) 
strengthen 
governance and 
enhance 
community participation; 
(iii) 
support 
fiscal 
discipline 
at 
the 
subnational 
level; 
and 
(iv) 
continue 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
fiduciary 
management 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
all 
levels 
of 
government. 
Specifically, 
the 
proposed 
operation 
aims 
to 
support 
the 
critical 
next 
steps 
for 
a 
system 
which 
has 
been 
declared 
decentralized 
but 
in 
reality 
remains 
only 
partially 
so. 
Some 
of 
these 
“next 
steps” 
include: 
(a) 
the 
transfer 
of 
limited 
local 
autonomy 
for 
tax 
policy 
to 
the 
municipalities; 
(b) 
clarifying 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
levels 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
the 
important 
electrification 
sector 
and 
setting 
the 
stage 
for 
greater 
clarity 
across 
service 
sectors; 
and (c) 
the 
involvement 
of 
international 
credit 
rating 
agencies 
and 
auditors 
in 
assessing 
the 
financial  well-being 
of 
municipalities.  The 
proposed  second 
PSAC 
assures 
the 
continued 
progress  and 
visibility 
of 
Bolivia’s 
efforts 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
point 
of 
fully 
transparent 
distribution 
of 
responsibilities, accountability,  evaluation, 
and 
control. Future 
steps 
along 
that 
path 
are 
expected 
to be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
PSACs.

I. 
RATIONALE 
AND 
OBJECTIVE 
1. 
Despite a 
difficult 
political 
and 
economic  situation, 
Bolivia 
remains 
committed 
to 
the 
medium- 
term 
program 
of 
decentralization 
reforms. 
For 
nearly a 
decade, 
these 
reforms 
have been 
at 
the 
core 
of 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
Combined 
with 
an 
anemic  economic 
recovery 
and 
fragile 
financial 
and corporate 
sectors, 
continued 
fiscal 
imbalances 
in 
recent 
years 
have 
added 
to 
the threat 
of 
both 
macroeconomic  and 
socio-political  instability. 
In 
the  face 
of 
recent 
outbursts 
of 
social 
unrest,  the 
Government 
is 
working 
to 
ensure 
stability 
while 
redoubling 
its 
efforts 
to 
deepen 
internal 
political 
dialogue 
and reach 
agreement 
on 
an 
economic 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
promise 
of 
the 
Government’s 
decentralization 
agenda 
will 
not 
be 
realized 
without 
advancing 
policy 
reforms 
and 
the 
engagement 
of 
the 
Association 
and donor 
community. 
The 
medium-term 
reform 
program 
is 
more important 
than 
ever. 
2. 
The 
proposed operation 
is 
a Programmatic Structural 
Adjustment Credit 
(PSAC) 
building 
upon 
the 
first 
Decentralization 
PSAC 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
May 
of 
2001. 
As 
the 
second 
in 
a 
series 
of 
potential 
PSACs  expected  over 
the 
next 
four 
years, 
it 
would  provide 
support 
to  Bolivia’s 
medium-term 
decentralization 
reform 
program. 
3. 
The 
first 
PSAC 
made 
important 
progress 
in 
supporting 
the 
design 
and 
development 
of 
the 
comprehensive approach 
to 
decentralization pioneered 
in 
Bolivia. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
would 
support the 
key 
next 
steps 
for 
a 
system 
which 
has 
been declared 
decentralized 
but 
in 
reality 
remains 
only partially 
so. 
Some 
of 
these 
“next 
steps” 
to 
devolving 
full 
responsibility 
for 
effective 
local 
management 
include: 
(a) 
the 
transfer 
of 
more 
local 
autonomy 
for 
tax 
policy 
to 
the 
municipalities; 
(b) 
clarifying 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
levels 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
the 
key 
electrification 
sector and 
setting 
the 
stage 
for 
greater 
clarity 
across 
service 
sectors; 
and 
(c) 
the 
involvement 
of 
international 
credit 
rating 
agencies 
and 
auditors 
in 
assessing 
the 
financial well-being 
of 
municipalities. 
The 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
assures 
the 
continued 
progress and 
visibility 
of 
Bolivia’s 
efforts to arrive 
at 
a 
point 
of 
fully 
transparent 
distribution 
of 
responsibilities,  accountability, 
evaluation,  and 
control. Future 
steps 
along 
that 
path 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
PSACs. 
4. 
The 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
of 
SDR 
18 
million 
(US$ 
25 
million 
equivalent) 
has 
been prepared 
in 
the 
context 
of 
strong international 
support 
for 
the 
decentralization 
effort 
through active 
engagement 
across 
institutional 
boundaries 
within 
the 
Bolivian 
Government 
and at 
the 
local 
level. 
The 
proposed operation 
has 
complements 
a 
Stand-By 
Arrangement 
with 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF), 
recently 
approved, that 
focuses 
on 
the 
major 
sources 
of 
macroeconomic 
instability 
and  provides  a 
framework 
for 
sustained 
medium-term 
economic 
growth. 
5. 
At 
the 
outset 
it 
is 
crucial 
to 
note that, 
on 
the 
one hand, 
the 
socio-political situation 
in 
Bolivia 
limits 
the 
Government’s 
space 
for reform 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
many 
of 
the 
required 
reforms 
and 
the 
long-term 
efforts 
in 
decentralization 
will 
take 
time 
to 
show 
results. 
There 
is, 
however, 
strong 
government 
commitment 
for 
advancing  the 
decentralization 
agenda. 
The 
authorities  should 
be 
able 
to 
implement 
significant 
components 
of 
the 
overall program 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
sub-national 
fiscal 
accounts 
are 
on 
a 
sustainable 
path. 
While 
such 
steps are 
important 
and 
significant, 
the 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the proposed 
second 
PSAC 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
deal exhaustively  and 
conclusively 
with 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
problems 
facing 
the sub-national 
sector. 
6. 
The 
CAS 
Progress 
Report 
discussed 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
May 
of 
2001 
foresaw the 
inclusion 
of 
a 
fast 
disbursing  policy-based 
adjustment 
operation 
in 
FY02  to 
support 
civil 
society 
monitoring 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PRSP). 
Given 
the 
urgent 
need 
to 
provide fiscal 
support and 
to 
sustain 
the 
decentralization 
process 
during 
the 
political 
transition 
and 
within 
the 
framework 
Page  10
-L- 
for 
decentralization 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
PRSP, 
it 
became clear that 
the 
areas 
of 
policy reform 
covered 
within 
the 
decentralization 
program 
were 
among 
the 
most 
needed 
in 
the 
short-term and 
would 
be 
the most appropriate 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
design 
of 
a new 
operation. 
This 
second 
PSAC 
intends 
to 
address these 
needs. 
The 
risks 
are 
high, especially 
in 
light 
of 
political 
fragmentation, 
social 
fragility, 
and 
economic uncertainty. 
The 
risk 
of 
inaction 
by 
the Association,  though, 
in 
remaining on 
the 
sidelines 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
Government 
is 
prepared 
to 
take the 
important next 
steps 
in 
advancing the 
decentralization 
agenda, 
are 
outweighed 
by 
the 
content 
of 
the Governments 
reform 
efforts. 
7. 
The 
medium-term reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
PSAC program 
are 
laid 
out 
in 
the Government's 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(Annex 
2) 
and are 
reflected 
in 
the 
multi-year 
matrix 
of 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
for 
the proposed 
operation 
and 
potential 
subsequent 
credits 
(Annex 
3).

BOLIVIA'S 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
STRATEGY 
8. 
Slightly 
less 
than 
two-thirds 
of 
Bolivia's 
population 
are 
poor 
and 
slightly 
more 
than 
one-third 
of 
the 
population 
live 
in 
extreme 
poverty. 
Poverty 
affects 
half 
of 
the 
population 
in 
large 
cities, 
two-thirds 
in 
other 
urban 
areas 
and 
80% 
in 
rural 
areas.' 
This 
last 
decade has 
led 
to 
a substantial 
increase 
in 
access 
to 
services. 
In 
1992, 64.3% 
of 
the 
population 
was 
categorized 
as 
poor, a rate 
which 
fell 
to 
62.6% 
in 
1999. 
The 
impact 
of 
recent 
events 
is 
still 
unclear, 
but 
may 
well 
negatively 
effect 
growth 
and 
poverty. 
There 
are 
considerable 
regional 
variations, 
and 
income 
inequality 
remains 
problematic. 
The 
United 
Nations 
Development  Program 
(UNDP) 
Human 
Development 
Report 
(2000) 
predicts 
that 
by 
2004, 
the 
Human 
Development 
Index 
(HDI) 
of 
the 
department 
of 
Santa 
Cruz 
will 
be 
double 
that 
of 
Potosi. 
9. 
Bolivia 
prepared 
an 
interim 
PRSP 
in 
January 
2000 
and presented 
a 
PRSP paper 
to 
the 
Boards 
of 
the 
Association 
(and 
the 
IMF) 
in 
June, 
2001, 
the core elements 
of 
which 
remain 
valid 
today. 
Bolivia's 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) was 
developed 
following 
an 
extensive 
consultation 
process 
in 
2000 
between 
the 
Government, 
civil 
society, and representatives 
of 
municipal 
governments 
known 
as 
the 
National 
Dialogue. 
During 
the 
National 
Dialogue, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
resources 
received 
as 
external 
debt 
relief 
(under 
the 
Highly 
Indebted 
Poor 
Countries, 
or 
HIPC, 
initative) 
would 
be 
administered 
by 
the 
municipal 
governments. 
These 
resources 
were 
to 
be 
distributed 
in 
a 
progressive way 
in 
accordance 
with 
poverty 
indicators. 
It 
was 
also 
agreed 
that 
community 
supervision 
would 
be established 
at 
the 
municipal, 
departmental, and 
national 
levels. 
10. 
The 
PRS 
has 
four 
strategic components: 
0 
Expanding 
employment 
and 
income 
opportunities 
by 
supporting 
small, 
urban 
agricultural 
producers; 
fostering 
rural 
development 
through 
greater investment 
in 
the 
productive 
and 
marketing 
infrastructure; 
and 
supporting 
small 
businesses 
and 
microfinance. 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
primary 
education, 
preventive health 
care services, and 
access 
to 
adequate 
housing. 
Increasing 
security and 
protection 
for 
the 
poor through 
improved 
risk 
management. 
Providing 
incentives 
for 
social 
participation 
through 
the 
Popular 
Participation 
and 
Decentralization 
Laws.

In 
addition, 
the 
PRS 
includes cross-cutting 
actions 
to 
promote 
(a) 
greater 
equity 
in 
favor 
of 
ethnic 
groups 
and 
indigenous 
peoples, 
(b) 
gender 
equity, 
and 
(c) 
the sustainable 
development 
of 
natural 
resources 
in 
an 
environmentally 
friendly 
manner. Recent 
modifications 
to 
the 
PRS 
provide 
a 
greater emphasis 
on 
supporting

aggressive 
policies aimed 
at

decentralization 
process 
which 
the 
proposed 
credit 
is 
intended 
to 
support 
will 
thus 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
overall 
PRS. 
111. 
ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS 
AND 
PROSPECTS 
A. 
Background 
12. 
For 
most 
of 
the 
last 
decade, 
Bolivia 
has 
had 
a good 
record 
of 
implementing 
sound macroeconomic 
policies 
and 
profound 
structural 
reforms.2 
These 
reforms, 
together 
with 
large 
inflows 
of 
capital,  made 
it 
possible 
to 
attain 
high 
rates 
of 
growth, 
further 
reduce 
inflation 
(today 
in 
the 
single  digits),  and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
balance-of-payments. 
From 
1990 
to 
1998, 
annual 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
averaged 
4.4% 
and 
inflation 
remained 
below 
4% 
(Figure 
1). 
While 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
remained 
under 
control, 
it 
increased 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
decade 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
pension 
system 
deficit 
(Figure 
2). 
13. 
Several 
adverse 
external 
and 
internal 
shocks 
affected 
the 
country 
in 
the 
late 
1990s 
and 
early 
2000s 
causing 
a 
significant 
economic 
slowdown 
and 
reversing 
poverty reduction 
gains. 
These 
external factors 
included: 
(a) 
the Russian 
crisis 
(which 
led 
to 
a 
slowdown 
of 
capital 
inflows 
to 
the 
region 
in 
general and 
Bolivia 
in 
particular); 
(b) 
the 
East 
Asian crisis 
(which 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant 
deterioration 
of 
key 
Bolivian 
export 
prices); 
(c) 
the 
Argentinean 
recession 
(which lowered 
Bolivian 
export 
demand and 
significantly 
reduced 
workers 
remittances 
to 
Bolivia); 
(d) 
the 
overall 
Latin-American 
regional slowdown 
(which 
led 
to 
lower 
demand 
fa- 
Bolivian 
exports); 
(e) 
the 
devaluations 
in 
Brazil, 
Chile, 
and 
Argentina 
(which 
led 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
competitiveness 
of 
Bolivian 
exports); and 
(f) 
weather shocks 
and 
the consequent increase 
in 
natural 
disasters 
like 
droughts and 
floods 
(which 
negatively affected 
agricultural 
production). 
In 
addition, 
Bolivia 
suffered 
significant  internal 
shocks, 
including: 
(a) 
the 
Government’s  coca-eradication 
program 
(that 
resulted 
in 
income 
contraction); 
(b) 
pre-election uncertainty 
in 
June 
2002 
and 
social 
unrest 
in 
February 
2003 
(that 
led 
to 
financial 
sector 
deposit 
withdrawal, 
and 
this 
in 
turn 
to 
a 
credit 
“crunch”  and 
international 
reserve 
losses); 
(c) 
a 
sharp 
reduction 
in 
FDI 
as 
capitalization 
programs  matured 
and 
the 
natural 
gas

and 
(d) 
the  customs 
reform 
(that 
changed 
relative 
prices 
and negatively affected 
the 
informal 
economy. 
All 
these 
factors 
deepened 
financial 
and 
fiscal vulnerabilities 
in 
Bolivia, 
and 
prevented 
poverty 
from 
continuing 
a 
downward 
trend. 
Over 
the 
last three 
years, 
the 
share 
of 
urban 
population 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
has 
remained around 
50% 
and 
the 
poverty incidence 
in 
rural 
areas 
is 
still 
above 
80%. 
Inequality 
indicators 
have 
deteriorated 
over the 
last 
two 
years 
and 
it 
appears 
that the economic 
crisis 
has 
had 
its 
most 
dramatic impacts 
on 
the 
poorest. 
74.9 
B. 
Recent Economic Developments 
14. 
The 
new 
administration 
that 
took 
office 
last 
August 
inherited 
an economy 
in 
distress: 
Bolivia 
has 
a 
a 
large 
fiscal 
imbalance 
and a 
fragile financial 
and corporate 
situation. 
Social 
tension prevails 
reflecting 
disappointment 
with 
the  Government 
strategy 
to 
restore  faster 
growth.  Last 
February 
the 
country 
experienced 
two 
days 
of 
violent 
social 
unrest 
triggered 
by 
the 
Government's 
announcement 
of 
higher 
taxes 
as 
part 
of 
the 
2003 
budget  proposal. 
Clashes 
between 
military 
troops  and 
striking 
police 
officers 
and 
civilians 
left 
many 
dead; 
protestors 
and 
opposition 
parties 
called 
for 
the 
President 
and 
the 
Vice-president 
to 
resign. 
However, 
the 
Government 
weathered 
this 
incipient 
crisis 
and 
with 
the 
signing 
of 
a 
twelve month 
IMF 
Stand-By  Arrangement 
provided 
the 
macroeconomic 
framework 
for 
faster 
growth. 
Nevertheless, 
economic 
policy 
making 
in 
Bolivia 
remains 
unusually 
challenging 
for 
the 
thin 
official 
majority 
in 
Congress 
that 
faces 
intense 
political 
opposition 
and 
social 
resistance 
to 
further 
economic 
adjustment. 
The 
challenge 
for 
the 
Government 
is 
to 
restore economic 
stability 
and 
continue 
implementing 
reforms 
in 
this 
difficult 
political 
environment. 
Bolivia's 
high 
vulnerability to 
external 
shocks 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
incentives 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
develop 
in 
areas 
other than 
primary 
sectors are 
the 
root 
causes 
of 
Bolivia's 
current 
crisis, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural Adjustment 
Credit 
that accompanies 
the 
proposed 
PSAC 
project. 
15. 
Growth 
has 
been 
meager 
in  Bolivia 
in 
recent  years. 
After 
averaging 
1.3% 
in 
1999-2001, 
preliminary 
data 
indicate that 
real 
GDP 
growth 
in 
2002 reached 
2.5%, 
of 
which 
1 
percentage 
point 
is 
due 
to 
expansion 
of 
the 
gas 
sector 
(Table 
1). 
Real 
per 
capita 
income 
is, 
to 
date, 
some 
4% 
lower 
than 
in 
1998. 
Inflation 
remains 
low, 
reflecting 
weak 
domestic 
aggregate 
demand 
with little 
pass-through 
effect 
from 
the 
exchange 
rate 
crawling 
peg. 
Open 
unemployment 
has 
increased 
in 
the 
last 
four 
years, 
reaching 
about 
9% 
in 
2002 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
about 
half 
of 
the 
labor force 
remains 
under-employed. 
The 
informal 
sector 
is 
also 
growing, 
representing 
about 
54% 
of 
the 
total 
labor 
force. 
16. 
Fiscal 
Policy. 
The 
fiscal deficit 
increased 
in 
the second 
half 
of 
the 
decade, 
and 
at 
this 
time 
Bolivia 
is 
facing 
a 
critical 
fiscal 
situation: 
in 
2001 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
reached 
6.5% 
of 
GDP 
and 
by 
the

of

this 
figure 
amounted 
to 
8.5% 
of 
GDP. 
Fiscal 
deterioration 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
high 
costs 
of 
pension reform3, 
weak domestic demand 
which 
translates 
into 
lower 
tax 
receipts, 
the 
lack 
of 
domestic 
fuel 
price 
adjustments, 
and 
unplanned 
wage increases. 
Increasing 
financing 
needs 
have 
led 
the 
Government 
to 
borrow 
substantially 
in 
the 
domestic 
markets, 
to 
resort 
to 
non-concessional 
external 
borrowing 
(e.g., 
CAF) 
and 
recently 
to 
borrow 
from 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
monetizing 
part 
of 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
(Figure 
3). 
As 
a 
result, 
debt 
indicators 
have deteriorated 
(see 
Figure 
4), 
and 
the 
Treasury 
is 
facing 
liquidity 
shortfalls 
during 
the 
first 
semester 
of 
2003 
(amounting 
to 
about 
1% 
of 
GDP). 
In 
addition, 
growing municipal 
debt 
is 
contributing 
to 
the 
fragility 
of 
the 
overall 
fiscal 
situation 
(see 
Figures 
5 
and 
6 
for 
selected 
municipalities). 
17. 
Restoring 
fiscal 
sustainability 
while 
protecting poverty-related 
spending is 
a 
daunting 
challenge 
for 
Bolivia. 
The 
adjustment 
path 
will 
have 
to 
strike a 
balance 
between 
the 
need 
for 
a strong 
and 
credible 
up-front 
effort 
and the need 
to avoid 
an 
abrupt 
deficit 
reduction 
while 
the economy 
is 
near recession. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the Government intends 
to 
implement key 
policy 
measures such 
as: 
(i) 
containing 
the 
costs 
of 
the  new 
pension 
system; 
(ii) 
modernizing 
the  tax  procedures 
code; 
(iii) 
deepening the 
administrative 
reforms 
of 
customs  and 
the 
National  Tax 
Service 
(SIN); 
and 
(iv) 
improving 
public 
expenditure 
management 
and the budget 
process. 
Moreover, 
policy 
actions 
are 
needed 
to 
address 
growing 
sub-national 
debt, 
which 
represents 
a 
genuine 
threat 
to 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and continues 
to 
proliferate 
despite 
the 
implementation 
of 
debt 
restructuring efforts 
supported 
under 
the 
first 
PSAC. 
18. 
Bolivia's 
financial 
sector 
is 
experiencing a 
high 
degree 
of 
stress, 
reflected 
in 
negative performance indicators, 
e.g., 
bank 
non-performing 
loans reached 
20% 
in 
April 
of 
2003. 
This 
critical 
situation 
is 
due to, 
both, a 
prolonged 
period 
of 
sluggish 
growth 
that 
has 
weakened the corporate sector's 
capacity 
to 
honor 
their 
debts, 
and 
recent 
credibility 
crises  associated 
with 
pre-election uncertainties  and 
the 
February 
events that 
led 
to 
deposit 
withdrawals 
(Figures 
7 
and 
8), 
as 
discussed. 
These 
factors have 
affected 
the 
solvency and 
liquidity 
of 
the 
banking 
system, 
whose 
loan 
portfolio 
has 
contracted 
by 
more 
than 
38% 
(US$ 
1.61 
billion) 
since 
1998 
and 
by 
11.6% 
(US$ 
348 
million) 
in 
2002. 
By 
December 
2002, 
deposits 
had returned 
to 
the 
banking 
system 
but 
did 
not 
attain previous 
levels. Recently, the 
Government 
has 
embarked 
on 
a 
strategy 
to 
attack 
financial 
and 
corporate 
sector 
vulnerabilities 
including 
establishing a 
scheme 
to 
restructure 
firm 
debts, 
a 
new 
bankruptcy 
law 
and 
restoring 
independence 
of 
supervisory 
agencies. 
Bolivia's financial 
sector 
vulnerabilities 
are 
being  addressed 
by 
the 
Govemment.

The 
pension-related 
deficit 
plus 
the 
interest 
payments 
on 
outstanding 
public 
domestic 
debt 
with 
private 
pension 
funds 
have 
increased 
to 
about 
6% 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002 
- 
way 
above the 
initial 
projections. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
a 
higher 
number 
of 
early 
retirees, Government 
bailouts 
of 
insolvent 
complementary 
funds, 
preferential 
treatments 
given 
to 
specific 
sectors 
(judicial 
power 
and 
armed 
forces), 
and 
increases 
to 
the 
minimum 
pension 
following 
social 
unrest.

Competitiveness 
is 
gradually 
being  restore, 
but 
the 
external 
accounts 
remain 
fragile. 
Bolivia’s 
international 
reserves 
have 
dropped 
and 
remain 
at 
around 
25 
% 
of 
financial 
sector 
liabilities, 
indicating 
that 
Bolivia’s 
ability to 
finance 
its 
liabilities 
remains 
vulnerable. 
Preliminary 
data 
indicate 
that 
the 
current 
account 
deficit 
reached  about 
4% 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002  (Figure 
9). 
The deficit 
has 
been 
financed 
by 
direct 
investment 
flows 
and 
official 
financing. Exchange rate 
management 
follows 
a 
quasi-crawling peg 
to 
the 
US 
dollar. 
In 
response 
to 
regional 
turbulence 
and 
domestic 
political 
uncertainty, 
the 
annualized rate 
of 
crawl 
was 
accelerated 
in 
2002 and 
has 
continued 
in 
early 
2003. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
Boliviano 
has 
depreciated 
vis-h- 
vis 
the 
US 
dollar 
by 
9.81% 
in 
nominal 
terms 
during 
2002. 
In 
spite 
of 
this, 
domestic 
currency 
has 
appreciated 
in 
real 
terms 
by 
6.1% 
in 
the year-to-September 
2002 
as 
the 
real 
bilateral 
exchange 
rate 
against 
Argentina’s  and 
Brazil’s 
currencies sharply appreciated 
- 
by 
58% 
and 33% respectively (Figure 
lo). 
This 
trend 
is 
reversing 
gradually 
because 
of 
the 
real 
appreciation 
of 
currencies 
of 
neighboring 
countries. 
The 
high 
amount 
of 
dollar-denominated 
liabilities 
in 
the 
economy,  together 
with 
the 
mismatch 
of 
domestic- 
currency  denominated 
assets 
and 
dollar-denominated 
liabilities 
in 
the  corporate 
sector, 
considerably 
constrains, 
in 
the 
short term, 
the 
scope 
of 
the authorities 
to 
further 
accelerate 
the rate 
of 
depreciation 
of 
the 
domestic currency.

Economic 
Prospects 
20. 
Bolivia's 
medium-term 
outlook 
remains clouded 
by 
large 
imbalances 
in 
both 
the 
fiscal 
accounts 
and  the 
financial 
sector. 
However, a 
real 
GDP 
growth 
of 
about 
2-3 
% 
is 
expected 
for 
2003 
in 
view 
of 
a 
gradual 
improvement 
in 
political 
and economic 
stability 
accompanied 
by 
better 
prospects 
for 
the 
region. 
In 
the 
medium-term, 
as 
long 
as 
these 
factors 
remain 
in 
place and 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
imbalances 
are 
brought 
under 
control, 
prospects 
for 
higher 
economic 
growth 
are 
very  good: 
gas 
production 
and 
exports 
are 
expected 
to 
expand 
in 
2004-2005, 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
non-gas exports 
in 
response 
to 
the 
US 
preferential 
treatment 
for 
these 
exports 
will 
contribute 
to 
achieve that goal. 
21. 
Real 
GDP 
growth 
is 
projected 
to 
reach 4.3% 
in 
2004  and 
around 
4.7% 
by 
2005, 
with 
inflation 
remaining relatively 
low. 
The overall 
deficit 
of 
the 
combined 
public 
sector 
is 
projected to narrow 
gradually 
from 
about 
6.5% 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003 
to 
under 
4% 
in 
2005 
due 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
fiscal 
reforms. 
The 
current  account 
deficit 
is 
expected 
to remain 
around 
3% 
in 
2004 
and 
2005. 
FDI 
flows 
are 
projected to 
remain 
high, 
around 
US$ 
675 
million 
per 
year 
if 
gas 
projects 
develop 
as 
projected, 
and 
external 
financing 
requirements 
are 
expected 
to 
decrease 
in 
2004 
and 2005 
to 
2.6% and 2.3% 
of 
GDP, 
respectively.

IV. 
BOLIVIA’S DECENTRALIZATION 
REFORM 
PROGRAM 
22. 
The 
Government 
of 
Bolivia 
has 
been 
a pioneer 
in 
promoting 
decentralization 
of 
governance 
structures. 
The 
Law 
of 
Popular Participation 
approved 
in 
1994 
gave 
more 
autonomy 
and 
accountability 
to 
the 
country’s  3 
10 
municipalities, 
while 
the 
Administrative Decentralization 
Law 
passed 
in 
1995 
defined 
regional 
departments (prefectures) 
as 
deconcentrated arms 
of 
the 
central administration 
responsible 
for 
regional 
development. 
The 
2001 
National  Dialogue 
Law 
established 
a  direct 
link 
between  the 
Government’s 
PRS 
and 
municipal 
responsibilities, 
provided 
municipalities 
with 
additional 
funding, 
and 
extended the 
framework 
of 
social 
control to 
other actors at the 
local, 
departmental, and 
national 
levels. 
The 
law 
determines 
the 
distribution 
of 
HIPC 
II 
funds 
to 
municipalities 
under 
a 
poverty-based 
formula, through 
semi-conditional, 
partly 
earmarked transfers. 
A. 
Progress 
Made 
under the 
first 
PSAC 
23. 
In 
2001, 
in 
response 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
decentralization 
agenda, 
the 
Association 
and 
the 
donor 
community 
active 
in 
Bolivia 
prepared a 
first 
PSAC, 
which 
established 
a 
unifying 
instrument 
for 
aligning 
donor 
support 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
fiscal 
and administrative 
decentralization. 
The 
broad 
development 
objectives 
of 
the Government’s 
program that the 
first 
PSAC 
supported were 
to 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
public 
sector  services, 
particularly 
for 
the 
poor,  through 
(a) 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
efficiency, 
transparency and 
accountability 
of 
Bolivia’s 
decentralized government system and 
(b) 
an 
improvement 
in 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
decentralized government system 
to 
deliver 
these 
services. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
political 
transition, 
the 
original 
two-tranche 
first 
PSAC 
was 
restructured 
into 
a 
three-tranche  operation. 
All 
conditions 
of 
the 
first 
two 
tranches 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC 
were met, and the 
third 
tranche 
was 
disbursed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a waiver 
of 
a 
sole 
~ondition.~ 
Thus, 
the 
credit 
has 
been 
fully 
disbursed. 
B. 
The 
Programmatic 
Approach 
24. 
The 
first 
PSAC 
identified 
a 
series 
of 
I1 
issues 
for 
policy reform 
within 
five 
main 
 theme^.^ 
The 
main 
issues 
and 
the 
progress since 
the 
presentation 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC 
at 
the 
Board 
are 
summarized 
below 
and 
detailed 
in 
Annex 
4. 
25. 
The 
proposed second 
PSAC 
represents 
an 
instrument to facilitate 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
initial 
programmatic 
vision 
established  under 
the 
first 
PSAC 
to 
the 
Government’s 
evolving  vision 
for 
decentralization 
policy; 
it 
follows 
the 
logical 
framework 
developed 
under 
the 
first 
operation 
by 
the 
former 
administration 
and 
donor 
community, 
building 
on 
the 
successes 
and 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
first 
PSAC 
and 
taking 
critical 
subsequent 
policy 
actions. The 
programmatic 
adjustment approach 
provides 
sustained 
support 
for 
the 
complex  medium-term  decentralization 
reforms 
and 
enhances 
government 
ownership 
by 
tailoring 
the 
Association’s  interventions 
to 
the 
Government’s  vision, 
with 
a 
clear  “roadmap” 
and  the 
flexibility to 
adapt. 
Though 
a 
number 
of 
the 
prior 
actions 
included 
as 
benchmarks 
for 
the second 
PSAC 
differ  from 
those 
originally 
envisaged 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
first 
operation,  the 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
second 
operation 
represents 
a  robust 
series 
of 
measures 
that 
demonstrate 
a  path 
of 
continued 
policy 
progress. 
The 
new 
administration 
is 
currently preparing 
a 
Medium-Term 
Decentralization 
Strategy, 
which 
would 
represent the 
first 
time 
that 
the 
Government 
has 
attempted 
to 
address 
administrative 
and 
fiscal 
decentralization 
in 
a 
comprehensive way 
in 
reflection 
of 
the 
new 
legal framework, 
including 
the 
Law of 
The 
Association 
sought 
a 
waiver 
of 
the 
condition 
related 
to 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
revised 
Procurement 
Law, 
reflecting 
the 
Government’s 
issuance 
of 
a Supreme 
Executive 
Decree, acceptable 
to 
the Association, 
which 
addressed 
the 
underlying 
procurement 
framework 
issues.

C. 
Increasing 
the 
Efficiency, 
Transparency, 
and 
Accountability 
of 
Bolivia’s 
Decentralized 
Government 
System 
26. 
Roles, 
resuonsibilities, 
and 
financing. 
At 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
Government’s decentralization 
program, 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
the 
harmonization 
of 
responsibilities,  authority, 
resources  and 
accountability 
across 
different  levels of 
government 
was 
a 
necessary 
first 
step 
towards  establishing  a 
system 
of 
governance 
which 
delivers 
local 
services 
efficiently 
and 
is 
accountable 
to 
its 
citizens. 
In 
many 
cases, 
municipalities 
have 
not 
yet 
developed 
into 
truly 
autonomous 
political 
entities, 
in 
large 
part 
due 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
clear 
rules 
of 
the 
game; 
for 
instance, 
prefecturas 
have 
simultaneously 
played 
a 
dual, 
inconsistent 
role 
as 
a 
deconcentrated 
arm 
of 
the 
central 
government, 
on 
the one 
hand, 
and 
a 
semi-autonomous representative 
of 
regional 
political 
interests, 
on 
the other. 
27. 
Under 
the 
first 
PSAC, 
the 
Government 
initiated 
the process 
of 
assessing 
the 
options 
to 
put 
in 
place 
decentralized 
management 
of  the  comprehensive 
set 
of 
government 
services 
across 
the  three 
levels 
of 
public 
administration, 
and prepared 
a draft, 
comprehensive 
framework 
law, 
satisfactory 
to 
the Association, 
which 
defined 
the roles, 
responsibilities, 
and 
financing 
of 
both 
prefecturas 
and 
municipalities. 
In 
part 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the  complications 
of 
passing 
new 
legislation 
in 
the 
current 
political 
situation, 
the 
new 
administration 
aims 
to improve 
the 
overarching 
legal framework governing 
local 
service 
provision 
by 
both: 
(a) 
addressing the 
need 
to clarify 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
levels 
of 
government 
in 
priority 
sectors, 
including 
rural 
electrification, 
at 
the 
ministerial 
level; 
and 
(b) 
carrying 
out a more 
extensive 
process 
of 
consultation  after  dealing 
with 
the 
emergency 
measures 
included 
in 
the 
Plan 
Bolivia 
and 
making 
a 
concerted 
effort to 
prepare 
the 
appropriate 
legislation 
to 
address 
the 
remaining 
issues 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
design 
and 
roll-out 
of 
the 
Medium-Term National 
Decentralization 
Strategy. 
28. 
The 
second 
PSAC 
supports the 
Government 
in 
its 
efforts 
both 
to 
bring 
greater 
clarity 
to 
the 
division 
of 
responsibilities 
among 
levels 
of 
government and 
to 
establish 
the 
proper 
incentive 
structure 
to 
ensure 
its 
success 
by 
initiating 
the 
process 
of 
devolving 
revenue generating 
capacity 
to 
municipalities. 
Specifically, 
the 
administration 
has 
chosen 
the 
high 
visibility 
and 
politically 
important 
rural 
electrification 
sector 
as 
an 
area 
needing 
intervention 
to 
clearly 
define 
the  competencies 
of 
prefecturas 
and 
local 
governments. 
The  decentralization  reforms 
of 
the 
last 
10 
years 
have  been 
gradually 
shifting 
the 
responsibilities 
and 
financing 
for 
rural electrification 
to 
municipalities, 
and the 
results 
have 
been 
mixed. 
On 
the 
one hand, 
there 
has 
been 
an 
increase 
in 
rural electrification 
efforts, 
but 
there 
are 
serious concerns 
about 
efficiency 
and 
sustainability 
of 
these 
investments,  and  the 
lack 
of 
clarity 
about 
the 
role 
of 
municipalities 
vis-h-vis 
prefecturus 
and the 
central 
government. 
Efforts 
under 
the 
National 
Dialogue 
have 
attempted 
to 
resolve 
this 
issue 
by 
concentrating 
the 
responsibility 
for 
rural 
electrification 
at 
the 
municipal 
level, 
but 
the results 
have 
been 
disappointing, 
as 
municipalities 
appear 
to 
lack 
technical capacity 
to 
design 
and 
implement electrification 
projects 
which 
tend 
to 
be 
relatively 
technically 
complex. 
In 
addition, 
this 
has 
lead 
also 
to 
market 
segmentation that prevents economies 
of 
scale, 
discourages 
private 
sector 
participation, 
and 
complicates nation-wide planning. 
29. 
The 
Government 
is 
currently developing 
a 
general  sector  strategy  that 
would  involve 
all 
three 
levels 
of 
public 
administration. 
This 
strategy 
and 
the proposed 
conditionality would 
clarify 
respective 
roles 
between 
municipalities, 
prefecturas 
and 
the 
central 
government, and 
establish 
basic 
rules 
and 
regulation 
of 
rural 
electrification 
projects. The 
basic  and sensible approach 
would 
be 
to 
select 
investments 
from 
the 
“bottom 
up,” 
whereby 
each 
community 
decides what 
its 
priorities 
are. 
But 
because 
of 
the 
network 
aspect 
of 
Page  18
- 
10- 
the 
electricity 
sector, 
a more complicated 
iterative 
process 
is 
needed 
to 
ensure 
efficiency 
and 
technical 
quality 
in 
network 
expansion, 
as 
well 
as 
to benefit 
from 
economies 
of 
scale. 
This 
requires 
a certain 
amount 
of 
“top 
down”  planning, 
and 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
the  proposed 
credit, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Hydrocarbons 
and 
Energy 
has 
issued 
a 
Ministerial 
Resolution 
to 
clarify 
the 
roles 
of 
each 
level 
of 
the 
public 
administration. 
The 
pilot 
example 
of 
the 
rural 
electrification 
sector 
would 
provide 
a valuable 
experience 
as 
the government 
moves towards 
a 
comprehensive 
restructuring 
of 
responsibilities 
in 
all 
sectors. 
30. 
Bolivia 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
countries 
in 
Latin 
America 
that, 
having 
gone 
through 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
fiscal 
decentralization, 
maintains authority 
for 
approval 
and 
control 
of 
the 
most 
important 
inputs 
for 
local 
tax 
policy 
and 
administration 
at 
the 
national level. 
In 
spite 
of 
substantial progress 
in 
citizen 
and 
community 
participation 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
municipalities 
cannot take decisions 
on their 
own 
to 
adjust revenue 
efforts 
or tailor 
tax 
administration 
to 
each 
municipality’s 
own 
potential. 
The 
connection 
between 
local 
expenditure 
decisions and 
citizens’ 
payment 
for 
better 
local 
services 
is 
largely lost. 
31. 
Municipalities 
in 
Bolivia 
are 
required 
to 
submit 
to 
Congress 
for 
approval 
any 
modification 
to 
the 
so-called 
“tablas 
de 
valores” 
which 
defines 
the structure and 
levels 
of 
local 
taxes 
and 
fees. 
The 
process 
involves 
two 
steps; 
first, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
receives and 
reviews 
tables 
de 
valores, 
and 
pending 
its 
approval, 
forwards 
the 
tablas 
to 
the 
Congress 
for 
approval. 
The 
proposed second 
PSAC 
and 
subsequent 
operations 
will 
support the Government’s 
efforts 
to 
remove 
those 
barriers. 
As 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
second 
PSAC, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
agreed 
to 
greatly 
simplified 
procedures 
for 
tablas 
de 
valores 
it 
receives. 
In 
essence, 
it 
will 
automatically 
forward to 
Congress any 
local 
proposals 
received. 
Next, 
as 
a 
trigger 
for 
the 
initiation 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
potential 
follow-up 
operation, the 
Government 
will 
prepare 
a new 
law 
to 
fully 
and 
formally 
transfer tax 
policy 
and tax 
administration 
authority 
to municipalities. 
32. 
Lack  of  transparencv 
in 
public 
fund 
allocation 
and 
the 
transition to 
formula-driven 
earmarked 
transfers. 
Despite 
a legal framework 
which 
explicitly 
promoted 
a 
system 
of 
non-discretionary, 
formula- 
driven 
mechanisms 
to 
allocate 
public 
funds 
in 
a 
progressive  way, 
the 
Government’s 
institutions 
for 
financing 
local 
investment 
have, 
until 
only 
recently,  operated 
in 
a 
way 
in 
which 
discretion 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
transparency were endemic. 
The 
Government 
took 
bold 
steps 
- 
supported 
by 
the 
first 
PSAC 
-to 
establish a 
National 
Compensation 
Policy 
(NCP) 
to 
introduce progressivity 
and 
a 
pro-poor 
bias 
to 
intergovernmental 
finances  and 
to 
establish 
a 
mechanism 
to 
reconcile 
local 
demands 
with 
national 
priorities 
through 
a 
matching 
grant 
system 
of 
“relative 
prices”. 
In 
doing 
so, 
they also 
eliminated 
the 
earlier social investment 
vehicles  and  established 
a 
single 
window 
for 
channeling 
matching 
grant 
resources 
to 
municipal 
governments 
with 
the 
Fondo 
Nacional 
de 
Znversidn 
Productiva 
y 
Social 
(FPS), 
under 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
Unified 
Directorate 
of 
Funds 
(DUF). 
33. 
The 
institutionalization 
of 
the 
FPS, 
which 
began 
with 
considerable  promise, 
faltered 
in 
the last 
months 
of 
the 
previous administration. The number 
of 
personnel and 
administrative 
costs 
increased 
rapidly 
while 
disbursements 
fell 
to 
$57 
million. 
The 
internal 
processes 
used 
by 
the 
FPS 
became 
so 
complicated 
that 
the 
number 
of 
days 
that 
it 
took 
from 
the 
moment 
of 
submitting 
a 
sub-project 
to 
the start 
of 
its 
execution 
grew 
to 
490 
days. 
By 
the 
time 
the 
new 
administration took 
over 
in 
August 
of 
2002, 
problems 
within 
the 
FPS 
had reached 
a 
critical 
point 
and were seriously 
affecting not 
only 
the 
execution 
of 
its 
own 
resources, 
but 
also 
of 
HIPC 
I1 
funds. 
34. 
As 
the Government conducts 
a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
the 
FPS 
and 
the 
NCP 
to 
determine 
their 
long-term viability, 
an 
urgent 
priority 
is 
to 
make 
the system 
which 
currently 
exists 
less 
onerous 
and 
more 
responsive 
to 
its 
clients 
- 
local 
governments and the 
citizenry. 
The 
proposed operation 
directly 
supports 
four 
efforts 
to 
do 
so. 
First, 
the Association 
has 
reviewed 
and 
issued 
its 
no 
objection to 
a revised operations 
manual 
for 
the 
FPS 
which 
represents 
a considerable improvement 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
processes 
and 
project 
cycle. 
Second, 
the 
FPS 
has 
introduced 
an 
institution-wide 
business 
process 
reengineering 
program 
to 
Page  19
- 
11 
- 
reduce 
costs, 
simplify 
procedures 
(reducing 
the 
steps 
required 
for 
project 
approval 
by 
over 
30%), 
and 
streamline 
its 
functioning. 
Third, 
since 
the 
first 
PSAC 
was 
approved, the 
Government 
has 
maintained 
its 
commitment 
to fully 
operationalize a 
system 
for 
discounting discretional 
and 
donor 
transfers 
from NCP 
resources. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
DUF, 
has 
established 
a 
system 
for 
quantifying 
and 
publishing 
discretionary 
resource 
flows 
to municipalities 
a 
first 
step 
for 
phasing 
them 
out. 
Finally, 
the 
FPS 
has 
contracted a 
private 
sector 
firm 
to 
establish and manage 
an 
anti-corruption 
and 
anti-fraud 
hotline 
to 
receive 
complaints 
and concerns 
about 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
FPS 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
FPS-financed 
projects. 
35. 
Access 
to information 
regarding 
government 
programs 
for  local and 
communitv development. 
In 
Bolivia, 
local 
communities 
often 
have 
little 
access 
to 
information 
about 
public 
policies 
and programs 
for 
local 
and 
community 
development 
and 
have 
little, 
if 
any, 
recourse 
for 
raising 
complaints 
to 
the 
central 
government. 
While 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
donor-supported 
efforts ongoing 
in 
these 
areas 
(including 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
to municipalities to 
prepare 
and 
disseminate 
information 
about 
their 
local 
finances and the 
training 
of 
media 
and 
NGO 
personnel 
in 
public 
affairs 
and 
finance) considerable 
work 
is 
needed. 
The 
proposed second 
PSAC 
and 
subsequent 
operations 
would 
formally initiate 
a 
program to 
widely 
disseminate 
- 
in 
a 
simplified 
manner, 
easily 
understood 
by 
the 
general 
public 
- 
information 
about 
local 
finances 
in 
municipalities 
throughout 
the 
country. 
Thirty 
six 
such 
pilots 
are 
already 
under 
way 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
IDA-financed 
decentralized 
Participatory 
Rural 
Investment 
Project 
(PRIP) 
and the 
Government 
has 
committed to 
scaling 
up 
its 
information 
dissemination 
efforts 
through 
expansion  and 
mainstreaming. 
36. 
Accountabilitv 
of 
the 
public 
sector. 
The 
Bank 
and 
donor  community's 
decision 
to 
support 
programmatic 
adjustment 
lending 
in 
Bolivia 
was 
conditioned 
in 
no small part 
on 
the 
integration 
of 
aspects 
of 
fiduciary 
management 
- 
in 
both 
the 
areas 
of 
financial 
management and 
procurement 
(see 
below). 
The 
proposed second 
PSAC 
maintains 
the 
programmatic 
treatment 
of 
the 
national 
fiduciary 
frameworks 
and 
introduces 
two 
important reforms to 
address 
important 
shortfalls 
in 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
governments 
to 
be 
accountable 
to 
their 
constituencies. 
37. 
As 
the 
national 
Government 
continues 
to 
attempt 
to 
resolve 
the 
problem 
of 
subnational 
fiscal 
indiscipline, 
the 
problem 
of 
supplier  credit, 
known 
in 
Bolivia 
as 
deuda 
flotante 
or 
floating 
debt 
has 
emerged 
as 
the 
area 
of 
debt 
management 
most 
complicated 
to 
address. 
The 
practice 
of 
allowing 
creditors 
access 
to 
the 
interception 
of 
fiscal 
transfers 
(coparticipacio'n 
funds) 
through 
the 
dkbito 
automa'tico 
is 
used 
in 
Bolivia 
as 
elsewhere, 
despite 
its 
shortcomings, 
as 
a 
source 
of 
credit 
enhancement 
for 
lenders, 
but 
the 
absence 
of 
credible 
information 
about the amount 
of 
coparticipaciones 
resources 
freely 
available hinders 
the 
ability 
of 
creditors 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions about 
providing 
services 
to 
local 
governments and 
has 
helped 
cause 
the 
ballooning 
trend 
in 
deuda 
potante. 
38. 
In 
addition, 
the 
proposed 
PSAC 
supports 
efforts 
to 
bring 
private 
sector 
discipline 
and the 
rigor 
of 
international 
auditing 
to 
the 
municipal 
sector 
through 
the 
requirement 
that 
the 
fifteen 
most  populous 
municipalities 
undergo 
an 
annual 
financial 
assessment 
by 
a 
private 
auditing 
firm 
as 
a prerequisite 
for 
accessing 
the 
credit 
market, 
both 
public 
and 
private. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and  other  government 
agencies 
have 
been 
developing 
databases 
for 
monitoring 
and 
controlling 
sub-national 
debt. 
However, none 
of 
those  databases 
will 
fully 
satisfy market 
demand 
for timely 
and transparent 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
sub- 
national 
data. 
The 
General 
Controller 
does 
not 
provide 
financially 
relevant 
information. 
Independent 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
assessments, 
however, 
will 
have 
more 
flexibility 
to 
tackle 
the 
most worrisome 
sources 
of 
municipal 
debt 
growth, 
including 
floating 
and contingency 
debt. 
They 
can also 
develop 
and 
apply 
new 
measures 
of 
municipal 
indebtedness capacity 
tailored 
to 
Bolivia's 
needs. 
Regular 
assessments 
will 
not only 
be 
of 
interest 
to 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
financial 
institutions 
but 
to 
suppliers, 
public 
employees, and 
communities 
at 
large. 
Furthermore, 
Bolivia 
already 
has 
reputable 
and 
experienced 
international 
accounting 
Page  20
- 
12- 
and 
auditing 
firms, 
some 
of 
which 
have  prepared 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
assessments 
for 
the 
largest 
municipalities 
and 
are 
therefore 
familiar 
with 
the 
particular 
challenges posed 
by 
the 
limited 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
practices 
in 
Bolivia. 
39. 
The 
participation 
of 
community 
groups 
in 
local 
affairs 
and 
social 
control. 
A 
primary 
objective 
of 
the 
Popular 
Participation 
Law 
(LPP) 
was 
to 
substantially 
increase the 
participation 
of 
Bolivian 
citizens 
in 
local 
community 
and 
local 
government 
decision-making. 
Particular 
attention 
has 
been 
given 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
(a) 
participatory 
planning 
methods 
at 
the 
municipal 
government 
level; 
and 
(b) 
legally 
effective recognition 
of 
indigenous 
communities. 
As 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC, the Government 
enacted 
the 
National 
Dialogue 
Law, which 
along 
with 
the 
LPP 
and 
Municipal 
Law, 
forms the 
core 
of 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional framework 
addressing 
issues 
of 
decentralization 
and 
citizen participation, 
and 
represents 
an 
important 
pillar 
in 
the Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
approach. 
40. 
The 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
would 
further 
the 
reform 
agenda 
as 
regards 
institutionalizing 
the 
LPP 
and 
expanding  opportunities 
for 
Comites 
de 
Vigilancia 
(Vigilance 
Committees, 
or 
VCs) 
- 
a 
locally 
representative 
social 
control 
mechanism created 
under 
the 
LPP 
- 
to 
formally 
participate 
in 
the 
monitoring 
of 
local 
expenditure 
and 
municipal 
administrative 
management. 
Through 
a 
phased scaling-up 
of 
efforts 
already 
under 
way and 
being 
financed under 
the PRIP, the 
Government 
aims 
to 
mainstream the 
functioning 
of 
the 
VCs 
in 
line 
with 
the 
stipulations 
of 
the 
LPP. 
As 
a 
condition 
of 
the proposed operation, 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
citizen 
input 
into 
the 
oversight 
of 
the 
DUF, 
the 
DUF 
has 
established 
local 
project 
approval 
committees 
at 
the department level, 
Comites 
Departamentales

The 
compatibility 
of 
political 
and 
administrative  divisions 
with 
indigenous 
territories. 
Some 
“Territorios 
de 
Origen 
Comunitario” 
(TOCs) and other 
indigenous communities 
have expressed 
concern 
to 
both 
the 
current 
and 
previous administrations 
that 
their 
voices 
are 
not 
represented 
within 
municipalities 
where 
other  populations 
dominate 
the 
decision-malung 
process. 
The 
political 
implications 
of 
doing 
so 
would 
be complicated,  and 
the 
current 
Government 
has 
expressed 
its 
interest 
in 
continuing 
to 
study 
the 
issue 
as 
part 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Decentralization 
Strategy. 
The 
results 
of 
such 
efforts 
would 
be 
incorporated 
into 
expected 
future 
PSACs. 
42. 
The design 
of 
models 
for 
managing 
mancomunidades. 
The 
issue 
of 
mancomunidades, 
or 
multi- 
municipal 
associations, 
was addressed 
under 
the 
first 
PSAC 
and despite the short 
amount 
of 
time 
which 
has 
passed 
since 
the 
original 
operation 
was 
made 
effective, 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
mancomunidades 
has 
been  impressive. 
To 
date, 
Bolivia 
has 
at 
least 
6 
important 
experiences 
in 
formalizing 
mancomunidades 
and anecdotal evidence, 
at 
least, 
indicates 
that there have been 
some 
very 
positive 
impacts 
on 
service 
provision. 
No 
key 
reforms 
are 
envisaged 
at 
the 
current juncture, 
but 
in 
the 
medium-term, 
the 
Government expects 
to 
fine-tune 
the 
legal framework 
for 
decentralization 
to 
more 
explicitly 
support and 
promote 
the 
formation 
of 
mancomunidades 
where appropriate.

Improving 
the Capacity

Bolivia’s 
Decentralized 
Government 
System to

43. 
Fiscal 
discipline 
and 
debt 
control 
of 
local 
governments. 
The 
issue 
of 
Bolivia’s 
subnational 
debt 
is 
central 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
decentralization 
agenda 
and 
a 
key 
factor 
in 
the 
Government’s 
ongoing 
fiscal 
dilemma. 
While 
efforts 
supported 
by 
the 
first 
PSAC to 
control 
the 
growth 
in 
subnational 
debt were 
implemented 
successfully 
- 
and the 
PRF 
program 
represented 
a 
first 
important 
effort to 
reigning 
in 
what 
had 
been, 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
operation, 
a 
potentially 
enormous 
problem 
- 
new important reforms 
are 
needed 
to 
correct the 
deteriorating 
fiscal 
trend, restore 
fiscal 
discipline 
and 
move towards 
market-controlled 
debt 
constraints 
at 
the 
municipal 
level. 
There 
is 
little 
doubt 
that 
a 
solvent 
municipal 
sector 
is 
the 
first 
necessary 
condition 
for 
improving 
local 
services 
in 
a decentralized 
governance structure. 
Page  21
- 
13- 
44. 
The 
proposed 
operation 
supports 
the 
introduction 
of 
several 
instruments 
to 
help 
enhance 
discipline 
in 
municipal 
borrowing 
and 
correct 
over-indebtedness, 
which 
threatens 
both 
the decentralization 
process 
and macroeconomic 
stability 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
first 
instrument 
is 
the 
introduction 
of 
municipal 
credit 
ratings 
by 
international 
credit rating 
agencies. 
The 
Government 
will 
require, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
Bolivia, 
an 
independent 
credit 
rating 
for 
any 
municipality 
that  expects 
to 
borrow 
from 
financial 
institutions,  either 
public 
or 
private. 
The 
initial 
legal 
norm 
has 
already  been 
issued and 
will 
be 
further 
developed 
through 
regulatory 
action 
during 
2003. 
45. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Government 
has 
established 
a 
limit 
on 
the amount 
of 
coparticipaciones 
which 
can 
be 
withheld 
using 
the 
dkbito 
automdtico. 
Because 
the 
de'bito 
automdtico 
has 
reached 
proportions 
of 
70% 
(or 
more) 
of 
total 
coparticipaciones 
in 
some 
municipalities, 
and 
since 
most 
municipalities 
have revenue 
dependency rates 
of 
80% 
and 
above, 
withholding 
rates 
of 
more 
than 
50% 
seriously jeopardize payment 
of 
rigid 
current 
expenditures 
such 
as 
the 
payroll. 
If 
not 
properly 
taken 
into 
account, 
those 
high 
withholding 
rates also 
veil 
pre-committed 
revenues 
- 
which 
often 
lead 
to 
overestimation 
of 
resources 
freely 
available 
and 
municipal 
indebtedness 
capacity. 
46. 
As 
the government transitions 
to 
a 
system 
in 
which 
the private 
sector 
plays 
a 
more important 
role 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
municipal 
creditworthiness 
(the 
roll 
out 
of 
creditworthiness 
assessments 
will 
take 
a 
number 
of 
years 
and 
even when 
fully 
functional 
will 
not 
reach 
small municipalities) 
it 
is 
important 
to 
maintain 
in 
vigor 
the 
existing 
approach 
which 
the 
Government 
initiated 
in 
2000 
to 
provide 
an 
administrative 
control 
on 
the 
growth 
of 
municipal 
debt. 
The 
first 
PSAC 
supported 
a 
single-shot approach 
to 
rescheduling 
municipal 
debt 
through the 
introduction 
of 
the 
Financial 
Reform 
Program 
(PRF) 
for 
the 
five 
largest 
municipalities 
in 
Bolivia. 
Steps 
taken under 
the 
first 
PSAC 
to improve 
liquidity 
and 
avoid 
further 
fiscal 
pressure 
included: 
(a) 
introducing 
debt service and 
debt 
stock 
limitations 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
further 
borrowing; 
(b) 
implementing 
a 
sunset 
clause 
limiting 
participation 
in 
the 
PRF 
to 
municipalities 
overindebted 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2001; 
(c) 
introducing 
limits 
on 
public 
sector 
severance 
benefits under 
the 
Estatuto 
del 
Funcionario 
Obrero; 
and 
(d) 
a 
series 
of 
sanctions 
available 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
be 
imposed 
on 
non-compliant municipalities. 
47. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
PRFs 
has 
enabled 
a degree 
of 
control 
of 
an 
extremely 
difficult 
situation. 
Debts 
with 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
amounting 
to 
over 
US$38 
million 
have 
been 
rescheduled. 
Other 
debts, 
mostly 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
Corporacio'n 
Andina 
de 
Foment0 
(CAF) 
resources, 
amounting 
to 
over 
US$46 million, 
were 
refinanced. 
PRF 
municipalities 
have 
paid 
off 
debts 
amounting 
to 
over 
US$75 
million 
and 
have 
facilitated future 
payment 
flows 
by 
rescheduling 
and 
refinancing their 
debts. 
A 
Guarantee 
Fund, 
which 
directly 
debits 
debt 
service payments 
from 
the 
municipal 
co-participation 
resources was 
used 
to 
ensure 
compliance. 
To 
this 
end, 
the proposed 
second 
PSAC 
supports 
the 
continued 
certification 
of 
the 
indebtedness 
capacity 
of 
municipalities 
which  do 
not 
exceed the 
existing 
20/200 
debt 
limits6 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
new 
sanctions 
which 
will 
be applied 
to 
PRF 
municipalities 
which 
do 
not 
meet 
their 
PRF 
targets. 
48. 
Institutional 
cauacini 
to 
im-ulement 
and 
steer 
the 
decentralization 
process. 
The 
important 
policy 
reforms 
at 
the national 
level 
supported 
by 
the 
PSACs 
will 
be 
of 
little 
long-term 
value 
if 
the three 
levels 
of 
government 
do 
not 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
deliver 
services, 
manage 
local 
finances, 
and 
manage, 
implement, 
and 
monitor 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
decentralization program. 
In 
addition 
to 
the ongoing 
requirement that 
all 
municipalities 
complete 
Institutional 
Reform 
Plans 
(PAIS), 
the 
Government 
is 
taking 
steps 
to 
reorganize 
the 
The 
Government's 
existing 
administrative 
limits 
on  subnational 
debt 
(debt 
services 
limited 
to 
20% 
of 
current 
revenues 
and 
debt  stock 
a 
maximum 
of 
200% 
of 
current 
revenues) 
may 
not 
be 
appropriate  given 
the 
limited 
expenditure 
autonomy 
of 
many 
municipalities. 
For 
the many 
small 
municipalities 
that 
are 
not 
subject to market 
credit, 
the 
Government 
is 
analyzing 
revised administrative 
limits 
on 
municipal 
debt.

national 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
decentralization 
policy making 
and 
putting 
in 
motion 
a 
program 
of 
local 
capacity strengthening. 
The 
Government 
has 
established 
the 
Comite‘ 
de 
Andisis 
de 
Descentralizacidn 
(CAD) 
within 
the 
Vice-Ministry 
of 
Municipal 
Development 
(VMMD) 
as 
the 
key 
technical 
policy 
unit 
and 
interlocutor 
for 
the donor community,  central 
government, 
and 
local 
governments 
in 
the 
area 
of 
fiscal 
and 
administrative 
decentralization. 
In 
addition,  the  Government’s 
medium-term 
plans, 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
potential 
future 
PSACs, 
include 
important 
measures 
to: 
(a) 
develop 
local 
capacity 
in 
a systemic manner, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
a 
municipal 
civil 
service; 
and 
(b) 
rationalize 
the 
pervasive  and 
often 
ineffective 
use 
of 
technical 
assistance 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
by 
transferring responsibility 
for 
administering 
official 
technical 
assistance 
resource 
directly 
to 
beneficiary 
municipalities. 
49. 
Access 
to 
credit 
financing 
by 
municipalities. 
In 
addition 
to 
low 
financial 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
delivery 
of 
local 
services, 
municipalities 
in 
Bolivia 
are 
faced 
with 
a 
highly 
restricted 
credit 
market. 
Creditworthy 
municipal 
governments 
- 
of 
which 
there 
are 
many 
- 
and 
other 
providers 
of 
local 
public 
services 
should 
be 
able 
to 
finance 
lumpy 
capital 
investment 
projects 
through 
borrowing. 
The 
Government’s 
continued 
access 
to 
concessional 
finance 
at 
the 
international 
level,  the 
low 
level 
of 
development 
of 
a 
market 
for 
local 
financing, 
and 
the 
relatively 
unsophisticated 
level 
of 
financial 
markets 
in 
Bolivia 
mean 
that 
it 
would 
be 
unrealistic 
to 
expect 
an 
overnight 
transition 
to 
a market-based 
municipal 
credit 
system. 
Nonetheless, 
important 
first 
steps 
were 
taken 
under 
the 
first 
PSAC, 
including 
the 
adoption 
by 
FNDR 
of 
uniform 
lending policies 
that 
address 
risk 
assessment 
and 
management and the 
elimination 
of 
FNDR 
credit 
availability 
to 
Prefecturas 
as 
a  source 
of 
credit 
for 
non-creditworthy 
municipalities. 
The 
second 
PSAC 
aims 
to 
further 
the 
process. 
50. 
The 
program 
of 
reforms 
described 
above 
is 
aimed 
to 
establish 
the 
right 
incentive framework 
for 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
a 
subnational 
credit  market 
within 
a 
context 
of 
market 
discipline 
- 
the 
introduction 
of 
annual  audits 
and 
private 
sector 
credit 
ratings 
are 
key 
to 
this 
effort. 
In 
addition, 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
second 
PSAC, the 
DUF 
has 
issued 
a 
Board 
Resolution 
(Resolucidn 
de 
Directorio) 
requiring 
that 
FNDR 
differentiate 
provisions 
according 
to 
the 
credit 
rating 
of 
each 
borrowing 
municipality, 
helping 
to 
ensure 
a 
level playing 
field 
for 
private 
sector 
involvement 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
local 
investment. 
V. 
THE 
PROPOSED 
CREDIT 
51. 
The 
proposed 
US$25 
million 
equivalent 
Credit 
would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
a 
single 
tranche 
upon 
effectiveness, 
and 
supports  needed 
reforms 
in 
the 
decentralization 
of 
fiscal 
autonomy 
and 
administrative 
responsibility. 
The 
PSAC 
framework 
of 
single-tranche operations 
within 
an 
overall 
conceptual 
framework 
has 
been chosen 
as 
a 
lending 
instrument 
because 
it 
supports 
a 
sustained 
medium-term commitment 
to 
institutional 
reform 
focused 
on 
decentralization 
and 
allows 
the 
Association and 
the 
Government 
to 
address 
emerging 
and  unforeseen 
issues 
within 
a 
consistent 
framework. 
A 
key 
lesson  learned 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC, and reflected 
in 
the 
narrowed 
focus 
of 
the proposed 
second 
PSAC, 
is 
that 
flexibility 
is 
a 
sine 
qua non 
condition 
for 
maintaining 
a 
relevant 
policy 
dialogue. 
A. 
Consistency 
with 
the 
CAS 
and 
Linking 
the 
Credit 
to 
the 
forthcoming Poverty 
Reduction Support 
Credits 
52. 
With 
the 
increasing 
emphasis 
given 
to 
the 
role 
of 
municipalities 
in 
the PRS 
and the 
severe 
effects 
on 
municipal 
investments 
caused 
by 
the 
implementation 
problems 
within 
the 
FPS, 
the importance 
of 
having 
a 
well-functioning 
decentralization 
system 
is 
ever 
more 
evident. 
The 
proposed 
second 
PSAC would 
help 
address 
this 
issue 
by 
maintaining 
the  Association’s 
engagement 
in 
the 
area 
and 
introducing important 
reforms, especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
fiscal 
decentralization and 
management. 
Page  23
- 
15- 
53. 
The 
new 
government 
has 
proposed 
- 
and 
the 
international 
donor 
community 
has 
accepted 
- 
that 
future 
donor coordination 
be 
organized around 8-10 
thematic 
areas. 
One 
of 
the proposed thematic 
areas 
is 
decentralization; 
and 
in 
this 
context, 
one 
of 
the outcomes 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC 
was 
that 
it 
provided 
a 
focal 
point 
around 
which different 
donors interested 
in 
decentralization 
made 
effective their 
support. 
There 
is 
considerable 
interest 
in 
sustaining 
this 
positive 
experience, and 
treating 
decentralization 
issues 
within 
a 
sequence 
of 
PSACs and 
institutional 
reforms.  The 
PSAC 
program 
is 
expected 
to 
run 
concurrently 
and 
complement 
the 
PRSC program, 
allowing 
for 
a 
tighter 
thematic 
focus 
in 
each 
operation. 
Following 
this 
strategy, 
the 
first 
PRSC 
is 
expected to 
more 
directly 
issues 
related 
to 
promoting 
results-oriented, 
pro-poor 
activities, 
accelerating human and social 
capital 
development and 
protecting 
the 
poor 
and vulnerable. 
54. 
Continuing 
with 
the 
second 
PSAC, and 
subsequent 
operations, 
including 
a 
third 
and 
fourth 
PSAC, 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
to 
concentrate on 
policy 
conditions 
at 
a 
time 
when the 
Government 
is, 
in 
addition 
to 
working 
on 
ensuring 
stability, 
ready 
to 
tackle 
the  issue. 
These 
policy-based  credits 
would 
be 
complemented 
by 
other instruments, 
such 
as 
technical 
assistance 
and investment 
credits 
directed 
towards 
solving 
some 
of 
the 
problems related 
to 
decentralization. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
Association 
co-finance 
all 
operations, 
nor 
is 
it 
necessary 
that 
all 
bilateral 
donors 
cofinance 
the 
PSACs. 
The 
shared 
vision provided 
by 
the 
PRS 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
multiple 
instruments 
will 
enable 
the 
Government, the 
Association, 
and 
other donors 
to 
match 
instruments 
to 
problems. 
This 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
prepare 
simpler 
and 
more 
targeted operations, 
closely aligned 
with 
the 
future 
Medium 
Term 
Decentralization 
Strategy. 
56. 
The new 
CAS, 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
in 
early 
fiscal 
year  2004, 
will 
set 
forth 
how 
the 
international 
donor 
community 
will 
be 
supporting 
the  PRS. 
Within 
this 
overall 
assistance 
strategy, the 
Association 
will 
focus 
on 
those 
activities 
where 
it 
has 
a comparative 
advantage, 
including providing 
general 
direction 
in 
key 
areas 
of 
decentralization 
(with 
the 
Decentralization 
PSACs), 
institutionalization 
(with 
continuation 
of 
the 
Institutionalization 
Reform 
APLs) 
and 
poverty reduction 
(with 
PRSCs). 
B. 
Addressing Bolivia’s 
Fiduciary 
Framework 
within 
the Context 
of 
the Decentralization 
Program 
57. 
The 
first 
PSAC 
included 
an 
innovative 
approach 
to 
integrating 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Country 
Procurement 
Action 
Plan 
(CPAR) 
and 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
as 
benchmarks 
in 
the 
program 
of 
policy 
reforms. 
The 
Government recently 
issued 
a 
Supreme 
Decree 
in 
the 
area 
of 
public 
procurement 
which 
improves 
upon 
the 
existing 
legal framework 
for 
procurement 
by 
the 
public 
sector and 
represents an 
important improvement 
in 
the 
framework 
for 
public 
sector 
contracting. 
58. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial  accountability 
arrangements 
of 
the 
Bolivia 
public 
sector 
was 
conducted 
by 
the 
Association 
in 
1999. 
The report concluded 
that: 
(a) 
the 
Government’s 
systems 
did 
not 
provide 
sufficiently 
reliable 
information 
to 
permit 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
performance; and 
(b) 
the 
General 
Comptroller 
(CGR) 
did 
not report on 
the  Government’s annual 
financial 
statements. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
1999 
CFAA, 
the 
Government and 
the 
Association 
agreed 
to 
a 
financial improvement action 
plan 
- 
the 
major 
items 
of 
which 
were 
included 
among 
the 
benchmarks 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC. 
These 
were: 
(a) 
the 
unambiguous 
application 
of 
the 
Supreme Decree 
that related 
to 
the 
integrated 
financial 
management 
systems 
(SIGMA); 
and 
(b) 
a  commitment 
to 
achieving 
agreed 
minimum 
benchmarks 
in 
financial 
management 
in 
all 
Central 
Government 
ministries 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
SIGMA. 
59. 
Since 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC, 
SIGMA 
has 
become 
operational 
in 
all 
Central 
Government 
ministries 
and 
now 
facilitates 
reliable reporting 
of 
budget 
execution. 
In 
addition, 
data 
on 
government 
expenditure 
has 
been 
made 
available 
to 
the 
public, through 
the 
internet, 
in 
a 
simplified 
form, 
based 
on 
the 
SIGMA 
inputs. 
During 
2002, 
SIGMA 
has 
also 
begun 
operating 
in 
some 
decentralized entities, 
including 
FPS 
and the 
National 
Customs 
Service, 
and 
efforts 
are 
underway 
to 
continue 
the 
process 
of

scope 
and amount

progress 
has 
been

actions 
anticipated 
as 
triggers

E. 
Poverty 
Implications 
62. 
Given 
the 
central 
role 
of 
municipalities 
in 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy, an 
efficient functioning 
of 
the decentralized system 
is 
critical 
for 
poverty 
reduction. The 
point 
of 
delivery 
for 
many essential 
social 
services 
in 
Bolivia 
is 
the 
municipality. 
The 
measures 
included 
in 
the proposed 
PSAC 
are 
part 
of 
a 
series 
of 
needed 
adjustments 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
current 
and 
projected 
municipal fiscal 
imbalances 
do 
not 
reach 
crisis 
level, 
which would 
have 
dire 
consequences 
for Bolivia’s 
poor. 
For 
example, 
efforts 
to 
limit 
the 
withholding 
of 
coparticipation 
to 
50% 
of 
available 
funds 
is 
one 
measure 
included 
in 
the 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
to 
ensure 
the 
continued 
provision 
of 
essential 
services. 
Likewise, 
FPS 
reforms 
are 
necessary 
to 
facilitate 
pro- 
poor 
investment 
and 
ensure 
the 
adequate 
allocation 
of 
HPC 
I1 
funds. 
63. 
Further, 
the 
measures 
proposed 
to 
deepen 
the process 
of 
decentralization 
through developing 
clear 
arrangements 
for 
service 
provision 
in 
the 
rural electrification 
sector 
represent 
a 
key next 
step 
towards 
the 
clarification 
of 
expenditure responsibilities 
as 
a prerequisite 
for 
efficient 
local 
service 
provision 
at 
the 
municipal 
level, a 
sector 
which 
needs 
highly 
correlated 
to 
incidences 
of 
poverty. 
In 
both 
setting 
the 
stage 
for 
clarifying 
service 
delivery 
responsibilities  throughout 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
improving 
information 
management 
via 
the 
implementation 
of 
a  planned 
municipal  information 
system, 
the 
quality 
and 
accountability 
of 
local 
public 
services 
should substantially 
improve. 
Because 
of 
uncertainties over 
local 
capacities, 
the 
strategy 
is 
to 
proceed 
slowly, 
with 
evaluations 
carried 
out 
along 
the 
way 
to 
ensure 
that the 
new system 
helps 
and 
does 
not 
retard 
the 
delivery 
of 
essential services 
to 
the 
poor. 
F. 
Arrangements 
for 
Management, 
Implementation 
and 
Monitoring 
64. 
Implementation 
Arrangements. 
Decentralization 
is, 
by 
its 
very  nature, 
a 
cross-sectoral 
activity 
that, 
to 
be 
effectively 
implemented,  requires 
the 
cooperation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
Government 
ministries 
and 
agencies. Because 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
proposed operation, 
which 
focuses 
on 
issues 
of 
local 
financial 
and 
fiscal 
management, 
the 
primary 
counterparts 
for 
ensuring 
that 
program 
benchmarks 
are 
met 
will 
be 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance’s and 
Fiscal 
Decentralization 
Unit 
(UDF) 
and 
the 
CAD, 
in 
close cooperation 
with 
the 
DUF, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance’s 
CONAPE, 
and  the 
Ministries 
of 
the 
Presidency  and  Sustainable 
Development, 
specifically 
the 
Vice-Ministry 
of 
Municipal 
Development7. 
65. 
The 
central 
management 
responsibility 
and 
authority 
will 
lie 
with 
the 
CAD. 
Bi-monthly 
management 
reports 
will 
be 
presented 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Sustainable 
Development 
to 
CONAPE for 
their 
perusal and (co)approval, 
after 
which 
they 
will 
be made 
available 
to 
the 
Association. 
Because 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
measures 
supported 
under 
the proposed second 
PSAC, 
the 
Association 
plans 
an 
intensive supervision 
effort, and 
will 
field 
bi-monthly 
supervision 
missions. 
In 
addition, quarterly 
meetings 
will 
be 
held 
with 
the 
Association 
and 
all 
donors 
involved 
on 
matters 
related 
to 
management 
of 
the 
decentralization program. 
The 
former 
Ministry 
of 
Municipal 
Development 
has 
been 
restructured and 
is 
now 
the 
Vice-Ministry 
of 
Municipal 
Development

Supervision 
and 
Subsequent 
PSACs. 
Bolivia’s 
reform 
program 
has 
set 
out 
benchmarks 
in 
key 
areas, 
together 
with 
expected 
outcomes 
to 
be 
achieved 
after 
completion 
of 
the 
reforms. 
These 
benchmarks 
are 
not 
conditions 
of 
future 
lending, 
but 
are 
to 
serve 
as 
guideposts 
to 
signal 
when 
progress 
is 
advancing 
or 
falling 
behind 
in 
any 
given 
area. 
In 
addition, 
the proposed 
second 
operation 
has 
included 
specific triggers 
to 
provide 
a 
clear 
indication 
of 
the 
readiness 
to 
move 
ahead 
with 
future PSACs. 
If 
progress 
is 
adequate, 
Bolivia’s 
reform 
program 
could 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
PSACs, 
timed 
to 
coincide 
with 
the 
Government’s 
fiscal 
year 
and 
annual 
budget 
cycle, 
under the Programmatic 
Lending 
framework.

the 
IMF 
and Donor Community 
67. 
The 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the proposed 
operation 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
the 
Association’s 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
and 
donor 
community 
operating 
in 
Bolivia,

Germany, 
and the 
governments 
of 
the 
Netherlands, Great 
Britain, 
Sweden, 
Switzerland, 
Denmark 
and 
USA. 
The 
Government 
of 
Bolivia 
has 
recently 
finalized 
a one year 
Stand-By 
Arrangement 
with 
the 
IMF, 
which follows 
on 
the 
three-year 
PRGF 
arrangement 
approved 
by 
the 
IMF 
in 
1998. 
The 
arrangement 
of 
SDR 
86 
million 
focuses 
on 
restoring 
macroeconomic 
balance 
through 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
tax 
system, 
improve  public 
expenditure 
management, 
and support 
the ongoing decentralization efforts. 
68. 
Assistance 
to 
the decentralization 
program 
embodied 
in

from 
the 
start, 
a 
joint 
effort 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Association 
and the 
donor 
community 
in 
Bolivia. 
The 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
will 
be 
complemented 
by 
a 
series 
of 
ongoing 
and planned activities, 
including 
ongoing 
supervision 
of 
the 
reforms 
supported 
under 
the 
first

the 
IADB, 
Department 
for

I. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
72. 
Decentralization 
is 
not 
an 
end 
in 
itself, 
but 
a 
mechanism 
to 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
services and 
allow 
the structure 
of 
governance 
to 
be 
more 
transparent 
and accountable 
to 
its 
citizens. 
An 
objective 
of 
the 
proposed 
operation 
is 
the 
restoration 
of 
fiscal 
equilibrium 
at 
the 
sub-national 
level 
which 
threatens 
Bolivia’s 
national 
economic 
position 
in 
the medium-term. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
need 
for 
support 
to 
Bolivia’s 
short-term  external 
financing 
needs, 
the 
key  benefits 
of 
the 
proposed 
second 
PSAC  would 
include 
supporting 
the 
overall 
decentralization 
and 
poverty reduction framework, 
strengthening 
the 
mechanisms 
for 
channeling 
resources 
to local 
governments, enhancing 
citizen 
participation 
in 
the 
decentralization 
process, 
expanding 
local 
governments’ revenue generation capacity, 
improving 
expenditure 
management, 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
a 
municipal 
credit 
market,  and  strengthening  mechanisms 
of 
accountability 
and 
transparency, 
all 
of 
which 
will 
contribute 
to 
enhance 
the 
efficiency 
and effectiveness 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
services 
at 
the 
local 
levels. 
73. 
The  decentralization 
program 
supported 
by 
the  proposed 
PSAC 
carries 
high 
risks. 
There 
are 
important 
political 
and 
social 
risks: 
there 
have  been  recent 
political 
disturbances  and 
the 
current 
Government 
is 
sustained 
by 
a 
fragile 
coalition 
and 
confronts  strong 
opposition 
in 
Congress. 
With 
the 
recession and 
unemployment 
likely 
to 
continue 
in 
the 
short 
run, 
social 
unrest 
might 
deepen 
the 
resentment 
to 
needed 
austerity 
measures. 
Were 
the 
coalition 
to 
collapse, the 
highly 
polarized 
opposition 
would 
be 
unlikely 
to deliver 
a 
consistent package 
of 
policies to maintain 
the 
reform 
agenda. 
There 
is 
also 
the 
risk 
that 
strong 
opposition to fiscal 
adjustment 
efforts, 
particularly on 
the 
part 
of 
vested 
public 
sector 
interest groups 
and large 
politically 
important municipalities, 
may 
disrupt 
the 
reform 
effort, 
since, 
in 
the 
short-term, 
local 
governments 
will 
no 
doubt 
bear 
some 
of 
the cost 
of 
reform. 
74. 
There 
are 
also 
serious economic 
risks. 
Bolivia 
finds 
itself 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
sluggish economic 
growth 
and 
remains  vulnerable 
to 
a 
crisis 
in 
the 
corporate  and 
financial 
sectors. 
Hard 
hit 
by 
the 
increasingly 
adverse 
external  situation 
and  dampened 
internal 
demand, 
the 
corporate 
sector 
is 
facing 
widespread 
fragility, 
putting 
at 
risk 
the  solvency and 
liquidity 
of 
the 
domestic 
financial 
system. 
Moreover, 
the 
new 
Government continues 
to confront 
a 
serious 
fiscal shortfall 
- 
it 
inherited 
a 
larger 
than 
anticipated 
budget 
deficit 
and 
there 
are 
concerns  about  macroeconomic 
stability 
in 
the 
medium-term. 
Obviously, 
further 
deterioration 
of 
the 
economy, 
which would 
disproportionally 
affect 
the 
poor, 
might 
derail 
the 
proposed 
reform 
process 
and 
put 
at 
risk 
the 
success 
to 
date 
in 
pushing 
the 
envelope 
of 
decentralization. 
Political 
opposition 
and delays 
in 
developing 
the proposed 
gas 
pipeline 
infrastructure 
might 
have 
a 
similar 
negative 
impact. 
The 
economic 
risks 
are 
amplified 
by 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
Bolivian 
economy 
to 
external 
shocks. 
Continued 
economic 
turbulence 
at 
both 
the 
regional 
and 
global 
levels 
would 
heighten 
the 
chance 
of 
a crisis, 
capital 
flight, 
and 
further 
problems 
in 
the  corporate and 
financial 
sectors. 
There 
are 
limited 
mitigating 
efforts 
which 
can 
be 
undertaken 
to 
reduce 
the 
economic 
risk, 
and most 
are 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
intervention 
by 
the 
Association. 
Any 
policy 
response 
to 
adjust 
with 
equity 
goals 
would 
be 
more 
difficult. 
75. 
These 
risks 
are 
in 
some 
ways 
mitigated 
by 
the 
PSAC 
instrument 
itself 
and 
a 
number 
of 
the 
reform 
areas 
stressed 
by 
the 
proposed 
second 
PSAC 
and 
possible 
future 
operations 
which 
aim to 
establish 
conditions 
for 
improving 
the 
citizen/government  interface.  The  Government’s 
ongoing 
dialogue 
with 
diverse representatives 
of civil 
society 
is 
likely 
to 
produce a slower 
pace 
of 
fiscal 
tightening, 
allowing 
for 
adjustment 
to 
take place 
in 
a more palatable 
manner 
with 
greater 
focus 
on 
issues 
of 
political 
economy. 
By 
including 
advances 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
citizen 
participation, 
transparency, and 
accountability, 
the 
PSAC 
is 
not 
only 
making 
important 
policy 
progress 
but 
clearly 
identifying 
a 
trajectory 
of 
policy 
reforms 
for 
the 
medium-term, 
signaling 
the 
continued importance 
of 
such 
action. 
In 
addition, 
the 
needed 
fiscal 
support 
Page  29
-21 
- 
provided 
by 
the 
credit 
and 
the 
overall program 
of 
Association 
support, 
including 
future 
PRSCs 
will 
provide 
the Government 
with 
the 
needed 
liquidity 
to 
take 
urgent 
action 
to 
alleviate contractionary 
pressure 
on 
the 
most vulnerable. 
Economic 
prospects 
for 
the 
region 
are 
improving, 
though; 
capital 
inflows 
have resumed 
and 
there 
are 
high 
expectations 
regarding 
a 
rebound 
in 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil. 
As 
in 
the 
early- 
and 
mid- 
1990s, 
such 
factors 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
mitigation 
of 
economic 
risks 
and the 
resumption 
of 
faster 
growth 
in 
Bolivia.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This 
Policy 
Letter 
is 
intended 
to 
present the 
areas 
of 
strategic 
intervention 
regarding decentralization 
where the Government 
of 
Bolivia 
has 
decided 
to 
act 
during 
the 
current 
administration. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
lays out 
the 
general 
guidelines 
that 
link 
this 
process 
directly 
to 
an 
efficient 
and transparent 
application 
of 
the Government Plan. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
decentralization 
policy 
described 
below, 
the Government 
of 
Bolivia 
intends 
to 
continua 
receiving 
the  support 
of 
the 
international 
cooperation 
agencies 
for 
the 
decentralization 
process 
through 
short and 
long 
term 
financial 
assistance 
operations. 
This 
support 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
establishing 
systems 
and incentives 
enabling 
Bolivia’s 
development 
actors 
to 
achieve 
an 
efficient 
coordination 
and 
integration 
of 
their 
territorial 
functions, 
through 
efficient 
resource 
allocation 
mechanisms, 
equity 
in 
the 
territorial distribution 
of 
the 
same 
and 
effective 
mechanisms 
for 
social 
control 
and 
involvement. 
The 
decentralization 
process 
and 
a 
decentralized 
public 
management are 
the 
instruments 
required 
to 
give 
greater 
effectiveness 
to 
the 
country’s 
efforts 
in 
executing 
the 
Bolivia 
Plan, 
through 
an 
enhanced 
operation 
of 
subnational 
public 
institutions 
to 
expand the coverage and 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
basic 
services 
and 
infrastructure, 
promote 
local 
and 
regional 
development 
and 
generate 
genuine  and 
irreversible 
processes 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
those 
social 
groups 
which 
are 
vulnerable 
and excluded. 
11. 
DECENTRALIZATION 
POLICY 
BACKGROUND 
The 
legal 
framework 
of 
the 
Decentralization 
process 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Bolivia 
comprises 
an 
ensemble 
of 
laws 
defining 
the 
framework 
of 
action 
for 
the 
decentralization 
model, 
notably: 
the 
Popular 
Participation 
Law 
(1994), 
the 
Administrative Decentralization 
Law 
(1995), 
the 
Municipal 
Government 
Law 
(1999), 
the 
National Dialogue 
Law 
(2001), 
besides 
a 
series 
of 
Supreme 
Decrees 
for 
the 
enforcement 
of 
the 
Decentralization 
processes. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 1997-2002 period, the 
Government 
of 
Bolivia 
decided 
to 
initiate 
adjustment 
measures 
for 
the 
decentralization 
of 
Bolivia. 
There 
was 
evidence 
of 
a 
huge 
weakness 
of 
operating 
management 
capacity 
in 
the 
territorial 
units, 
coupled 
with 
a 
lack 
of 
clarity 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
responsibilities 
across 
territorial 
jurisdictions. 
There 
was 
no 
accurate 
knowledge 
of 
the  balance 
existing 
between  resource 
allocation, responsibilities 
per 
territory 
and management 
capacity. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
was 
evidence 
that  debt 
at 
the 
municipal level 
was 
growing 
out 
of 
control. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
were  also 
indications 
that  the 
policies 
of 
decentralization, 
and 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
indigenous 
districts 
and 
commonwealths 
required 
a more specific 
monitoring. Finally, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
assess 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
terms 
of 
citizen’s 
participation 
in 
local public 
management 
and 
information 
mechanisms. 
A 
more detailed evaluation 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
so-called 
participatory planning 
to 
stimulate a 
more 
strategic spending that 
goes 
beyond 
the 
short 
term 
perspective 
and the 
listing 
of 
demands 
was 
also 
in 
order.

Balance 
to 
date 
Summarizing, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
draw 
a 
first 
balance 
of 
progress 
and 
stagnation 
in 
the decentralization 
process, 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
above considerations. 
Achievements 
: 
The role 
of 
Municipal 
Governments 
as 
actors 
of 
national 
development 
has 
been 
enhanced 
by 
expanding their expenditure and 
revenue 
responsibilities 
with 
an 
incidence 
in 
local 
development 
and 
poverty 
reduction; 
The 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
democratic 
system 
has 
been 
strengthened 
by 
the 
inclusion 
of 
groups 
(peasant 
and 
indigenous 
leaders) 
that 
traditionally had 
been 
excluded 
from 
excercising power; 
Citizenship 
has 
been 
strengthened 
by 
bringing 
the 
government’s 
functions 
closer 
to 
the demands 
of 
the 
population; 
by 
institutionalizing 
participatory 
planning 
processes 
and 
social 
control over 
municipal 
management; 
The 
legal 
standing 
of 
neighborhood 
and 
community 
organizations 
(monitoring 
committees and 
grass-roots 
territorial 
organizations) 
has 
been  recognized, 
and  they 
exercise 
new 
rights 
in 
planning 
and 
social control; 
Municipal 
resources  have  been  increased 
through 
tax-sharing 
resources, 
foreign 
debt 
relief 
resources and 
national 
co-funding; 
The 
areas 
of 
departmental 
administration 
have been 
aggregated 
under 
a 
single entity; 
National 
resources 
have  been 
redistributed 
with 
a 
strong  bias  towards 
rural 
areas 
and  the 
population 
outside 
the central corridor; 
From 
the 
existence 
of 
2 
non-poor 
municipalities 
in 
1992, 
progress 
was 
made 
to 
38 
municipalities 
according to 
the 
2001 
National 
Census. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
legal 
progress 
achieved 
in 
this 
process, 
the subnational 
governments 
and 
administrations 
need 
to 
take advantage 
of 
their 
local 
autonomy 
or 
their 
decentralized 
character 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Prefectures) 
to 
manage 
subnational 
resources 
efficiently, 
achieve 
an 
enhanced 
institutionality 
and 
improve 
social 
monitoring 
systems. 
Limitations: 
Persistence 
of 
a 
clientalistic 
political 
culture 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
affairs 
in 
subnational 
governments 
and 
administrations; 
Municipal 
and 
prefectural 
weaknesses 
in 
management  capacity, 
notably 
those 
linked 
to 
the 
timeliness 
of 
financial information, 
civil 
service 
career 
and 
effective planning; 
and 
difficulties 
arising 
from 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
planned 
strengthening 
scheme; 
Overall 
deficits 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
decentralized 
public 
management 
culture, 
especially 
at 
the 
national 
sectors; 
Persistence 
of 
perverse 
limitations 
and 
incentives 
to 
increase 
subnational 
fiscal 
efforts; 
Worsening 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
municipal 
and 
prefectural 
excessive debt; 
Deficiencies 
in 
accountability and citizen’s 
participation 
at 
the intermediate 
or 
prefectural 
level, 
and 
at 
the 
municipal 
level; 
Unsatisfactory  Prefectural 
support 
function 
to 
the 
Municipalities 
and 
gaps 
in 
the 
linkage 
between 
the 
Prefectural 
and 
municipal 
level; 
Unsatisfactory connection between decentralized 
management 
and 
local 
and regional 
economic 
development.

THE 
DECENTRALIZATION 
POLICY 
IN 
THE 
CURRENT 
ADMINISTRATION 
3.1 
Strategic 
Vision 
The 
current administration 
ratifies 
its 
decision 
to 
move 
forward 
with 
the decentralization 
of 
Bolivia’s 
State. 
On 
the 
one hand, 
it 
is 
part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
plan to 
increase 
the 
efficiency 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
investment 
of 
which 
50% 
is 
made 
by 
the subnational 
level. 
On 
the 
other, 
it 
has 
been 
decided 
to 
link 
the 
decentralization 
processes 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
subnational 
economic 
productivity 
and 
thus 
contribute 
to 
a 
renewed 
civic 
perception 
of 
the 
benefits that 
may 
be 
derived 
from 
decentralization. 
Such 
measures 
imply 
refining 
the 
processes 
of 
social 
inclusion 
and 
citizens 
participation 
in 
public 
management, 
besides 
increasing 
the levels 
of 
public 
spending 
equity. 
The intention 
is 
to 
“align” 
popular 
participation 
processes 
with 
those 
of 
administrative decentralization 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
their 
impact. 
Such decisions 
require 
an adjustment 
in 
Bolivia’s 
inter-governmental relations. 
In 
the 
medium term 
a 
decentralized 
public 
management 
that contributes 
to 
an 
improved public 
supply 
of 
good 
and 
services 
under conditions 
of 
effective 
civic 
participation 
and 
inclusion 
is 
required, 
as 
well 
as 
positive 
incentives 
for 
local 
and 
departmental 
efforts 
addressed 
at 
an 
equitable 
allocation 
of 
resources, 
involving 
the 
prefectures 
in 
proactive 
actions 
in 
support 
of 
subnational 
economic 
development. 
3.2 
Action 
Framework 
In 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
Bolivia’s 
decentralization 
emphasized 
the 
participatory 
aspects 
and the construction 
of 
the 
foundations 
for local 
management  (1993-1997). 
Later 
the 
focus 
was 
placed 
on 
targeting 
transfers 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
affecting 
poverty 
rates  (1997-2002). 
This 
Policy 
Letter 
opens 
up 
the  issue 
of 
subnational economic development 
as 
an aspect 
that 
until 
today and since 
1994 
has 
not 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
targeting 
subnational investments and 
territorial 
planning. Despite 
having 
an 
integrated 
vision 
of 
the 
benefits 
that 
may  be 
derived 
from 
the 
decentralization 
process, 
the  government 
has 
decided 
to 
emphasize 
the 
role 
of 
decentralization 
in 
connection 
with 
a 
measurable 
generation 
of 
subnational 
added 
value 
leveraging 
spatial 
productive 
vocations. 
The 
actions 
to 
be undertaken 
suppose 
the 
combination 
of 
two 
logics 
to 
approach 
the problems. 
On 
the 
one hand, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
improve 
the 
existing 
structures,  since there are 
several mechanisms 
for 
the 
decentralized 
management 
of 
the 
public 
administration 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
exploited 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
potential or 
which 
encounter 
obstacles 
that can 
be 
rapidly 
resolved. 
On 
the 
other, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
propose 
scenarios 
that 
explore 
new 
solutions 
although 
this 
may 
require 
changes 
in 
the 
existing 
legal 
framework 
within 
a 
context 
of 
social 
consultation, 
political 
consensus 
and 
talung 
into 
account 
constitutional restrictions. 
3.3. 
Reform 
Proposals 
An 
overarchinv articulator 
of 
national 
policies 
on 
decentralization 
The 
current 
government’s 
commitment 
is 
to 
deepen 
decentralization. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
decentralization 
process, 
the 
National Committee 
to 
Support 
Decentralization 
has 
been 
created 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
Sustainable 
Development and substantially integrated 
by 
representatives 
with 
Vice 
Ministerial 
rank 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
the President’s 
Office. 
This 
is 
the 
instance 
where 
the 
strategic 
decisions 
for 
the 
decentralization 
of 
Bolivia 
will 
be 
expounded, 
agreed 
and enforced. 
Thus, 
this 
new 
guiding 
body 
for 
decentralization 
policies 
will 
lead 
on 
aspects 
referring 
to 
the 
National 
Compensation 
Policy 
and 
the 
new 
architecture 
of 
roles and 
competencies 
distribution. 
The 
extension 
of 
decentralization 
begins, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
past, 
with 
the 
materialization 
of 
a 
center 
to 
coordinate

decentralization 
policies, 
a 
leadership 
on 
decentralization 
issues 
and the 
generation 
of 
State 
expertise 
to 
conduct decentralization 
analyses 
and 
technical 
proposals. 
Definition 
of 
inter-governmental 
roles, 
competencies 
and responsibilities 
In 
view 
of 
the 
evident  dispersion 
of 
rules, 
but 
especially,  due 
to 
the 
ambiguity 
that  prevails 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
competencies, 
this 
government 
needs 
to 
reformulate 
the rules 
of 
the 
game 
of 
competencies 
so 
as 
to 
guarantee the 
bridging 
of 
eventual 
breakdowns 
in 
the 
sectorial supply 
of 
essential 
services such a 
those 
that 
are 
perceptible 
in 
health and 
education; 
modern 
techniques 
should be 
adopted 
to 
facilitate 
the 
attainment 
of 
territorial 
equity (balancing the 
basic 
needs 
with 
the 
fiscal 
effort);  consolidating 
the 
State’s 
decentralization 
culture; 
integrating 
within 
the 
design 
of 
general rules, 
the 
broad 
outlines 
of 
the 
various 
aspects 
that 
any 
decentralization 
comprises; 
executing concurrent and subsidiary 
subnational 
investment 
and 
management  practices; 
triggering 
drives 
for 
subnational economic development and 
perfecting 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
civil 
participation 
and 
accountability. 
The 
deepening 
implies 
an 
innovative 
design 
yet, 
one 
that 
profits 
from,  and 
recovers, 
the 
lessons 
learnt 
in 
order 
to 
clarify 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
each 
territorial 
level 
facilitating  quality  control 
of 
the  management 
and 
offering 
a 
consistent 
scheme 
of 
competence 
distribution. 
Design 
of 
a 
new 
overall 
proposal 
for 
inter-governmental 
fiscal 
relations 
Any 
distribution 
of 
competencies 
has 
to 
be  supported 
by 
a  transparent. 
system 
of 
inter-governmental 
transfers capable 
of 
generating 
sufficient positive 
incentives 
for 
an 
efficient 
allocation 
of 
resources. 
Such 
system 
should 
comprise, 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
among 
others, 
delegation 
and 
formula-based transfers. 
The 
departmental 
financial 
structure 
is 
restricted 
by law 
so 
as 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
departmental 
planning 
decisions; 
and 
the 
per capita allocations 
to 
municipalities, 
although 
it 
provided 
for 
a 
positive 
start 
up 
of 
the 
municipal 
system 
in 
the 
mid 
1990’s, 
ended 
by 
disincentivating 
both 
the 
fiscal 
effort 
and 
the 
inter- 
territorial 
equalization 
designed 
to 
achieve the coverage 
of 
core social 
services. 
Formula-based 
transfers, 
on 
their 
side, 
were 
hampered 
by 
the 
efficiency 
in 
the  placement 
of 
the 
Funds 
contemplated 
for 
this 
purpose 
while, 
on 
the 
other, 
municipal 
debt 
grew  increasingly 
out 
of 
control. 
In 
this 
area, 
deepening 
decentralization 
means 
a 
realignment 
of 
the 
global 
system 
of 
fiscal-financial 
relations 
across 
territorial 
levels 
leading 
to 
macro-economic 
prudence 
without 
discouraging 
effective  policies 
for 
subnational 
financial leveraging policies, equity 
and 
rewards 
to territorial 
efforts 
Definition 
of 
National 
Policies 
for Municipal 
and 
Prefectural 
Management 
Development 
The 
Government 
will 
formulate 
a 
national 
policy 
to 
develop 
management 
capacity 
at 
the 
territorial 
agencies, 
articulating 
the 
efforts 
and contents 
across 
Prefectures 
and 
Municipalities. 
This 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
overcome the 
diversity 
of 
approaches. 
To 
this 
end, 
a 
scheme 
will 
be 
developed 
that 
while 
providing 
consistency 
will 
allow 
for 
flexibility 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
development 
of 
each 
agency, 
but 
will 
focus 
on 
fostering 
a 
private  market 
supply 
of 
capacity 
development 
offerings. 
As 
opposed 
to 
what 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
past, 
the importance 
of 
strengthening 
institutionality 
(civil 
service 
career, 
transparency) 
will 
be differentiated 
from 
the 
also 
important 
aspect 
of 
organizational strengthening 
(administrative 
systems) 
promoting 
the 
incorporation 
of 
measures 
that 
favor 
management 
by 
objectives. 
Special 
concern 
will 
be 
devoted 
to 
enhancing 
planning 
capacities 
at each agency 
and 
their articulation 
across 
the 
various 
territorial 
levels. 
Based 
on 
past 
lessons 
on 
this 
point, 
the 
decision 
to 
deepen 
decentralization 
stems 
from 
the 
belief 
that 
good 
organizational 
ideas 
are 
not 
sustainable 
without 
clear 
institutional 
reforms 
for 
the 
territorial 
agencies 
and 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
overall 
policy 
scheme 
to 
develop 
management capacities 
that 
is 
enforced 
on 
the players 
involved.

vocations 
in 
order 
to 
direct 
public 
efforts 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
sustainable 
added 
value 
at 
the 
local 
and 
regional level. The 
linkage 
with 
the 
economic players 
on 
a 
consensus 
basis 
is 
a 
premise 
for 
the 
success 
of 
actions 
supporting 
economic development. 
In 
the 
longer 
term,  the deepening 
of 
decentralization 
will 
be 
evaluated 
on 
its 
success 
in 
encouraging 
both 
municipalities 
and regions 
to 
promote productive 
innovation, 
increase 
investment 
on 
productive 
processes 
and 
generate 
added  value 
for 
the 
respective 
production 
chains. 
Furthermore, 
such 
decision 
is 
the essential 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
this 
administration’s  decentralization 
policy. 
Civil 
uarticipation 
and 
social 
inclusion 
through a 
national reporting 
system 
of 
the 
decentralized 
public 
management 
with 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation indicators 
The 
weaknesses 
regarding 
the 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
benefits 
and 
difficulties 
of 
decentralization 
by 
ordinary  citizens 
have 
been 
compounded 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
national 
system that 
provides 
the 
aggregation, 
analysis and 
evaluation 
of 
specialized 
information 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
impacts 
on 
the 
public 
supply 
of 
goods 
and services 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
subsidiarity. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
address 
the 
lack 
of 
basic 
information 
systems 
on 
subnational 
finances, service coverage 
and management. 
The 
deepening 
of 
the 
process 
will 
imply, 
in 
this 
area, 
the 
capacity 
to 
measure 
the 
benefits 
attributable 
to 
a 
decentralized 
public 
management 
and 
driving for 
a 
timely 
flow 
of 
creditable 
information 
of 
public 
management 
on 
a 
territorial 
basis 
towards 
the 
population. 
IV. 
STRATEGIC 
DECENTRALIZATION 
WITHIN 
THE 
PLAN 
BOLZVZA 
The 
strategic 
vision 
is 
geared 
towards 
obtaining inclusive 
growth 
that 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
align growth 
patterns 
with 
the 
population’s 
need 
for 
employment 
and 
income 
generation. 
The 
Bolivia 
Plan 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
Government  establishes 
the 
main 
public 
policy 
guidelines 
to 
be 
executed 
during 
the 
current administration. 
4.1. 
Priority: 
broad-based 
growth 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
a 
dual growth 
structure 
leading 
to 
a 
high 
concentration 
of 
income, 
a 
strategic 
development 
vision 
is 
proposed 
based 
on 
broad-based 
growth 
- 
the 
expansion 
of 
agroindustrial, 
industrial 
and 
services 
growth 
in 
thousands 
of 
micro, 
small 
and 
medium 
sized 
players 
in 
the 
country. 
In 
the 
short 
term 
(FY 
2003), 
this 
strategic 
vision 
leads 
to 
actions oriented towards 
the 
creation 
of 
temporary 
and 
permanent employment,  the establishment 
of 
social 
protection networks 
and the 
recovery 
of 
the 
micro, small 
and 
medium-sized 
business 
base. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
(FYs 
2004-2007) 
this 
vision 
leads 
to 
democratizing 
the 
right 
to 
property  (land 
and housing), 
the 
active 
promotion 
of 
those 
agroindustrial, 
industrial 
and service 
sectors 
that have 
a 
high 
capacity 
for 
the generation 
of 
employment, 
added 
value 
and 
export 
earnings and 
a 
sustainable and 
productive 
use 
of 
the 
country’s  renewable 
and 
non-renewable 
resources. 
4.2. 
Instruments: 
public, private 
and 
mixed 
agreements 
Together 
with 
a 
broad-based 
growth 
strategic 
vision, 
the 
plan 
calls 
for 
an 
expansion 
of 
public policy 
instruments. 
The 
social 
policy 
approach 
of 
the 
last 
fifteen 
years 
focused 
on 
public 
investment, 
first 
Page  37

- 
centralized,  then 
decentralized, 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
social 
services 
and 
promote 
the 
accumulation 
of 
human capital. 
The poverty 
reduction through 
social 
investment 
approach 
resulted 
in 
a 
moderate 
increase 
of 
access 
to 
social 
services 
but 
did 
not 
have 
perceptible impacts 
on 
the 
reduction 
of 
income 
poverty, 
quality 
of 
employment and production. 
The 
Government 
proposes 
to 
expand the 
exclusive  focus 
on 
public 
policy 
of 
the 
National 
Dialogue, 
towards  three 
types 
of 
broad-based 
growth  promotion 
instruments: 
public 
agreements 
(between 
the 
central 
government, the prefectures and 
the 
municipal 
governments), 
public-private 
agreements 
(transfer 
to 
micro, 
small 
and 
medium 
sized  producers, 
peasant 
and  indigenous  communities)  and 
agreements 
between 
private 
parties (between 
farmers,  wholesalers, 
retailers 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
exporters). 
The 
three 
types 
of 
agreements 
are 
already 
being 
used 
in 
the 
competitiveness 
agreements 
promoted 
by 
the 
Productivity 
and  Competitiveness 
Unit 
(Unidad 
de 
Productividad 
y 
Competitividad, 
UPC) 
and  the 
ATPDEA 
export 
promotion 
agreements 
promoted 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economic 
Development. 
A 
strengthening 
of 
the 
public-private 
agreements 
requires 
an analysis 
of 
the 
scope 
and 
limitations 
of 
the 
current 
National 
Compensation 
Policy 
(Dialogue 
Law),  and 
of 
the 
fiscal 
architecture 
resulting 
from 
the 
processes 
of 
Popular 
Participation 
and 
Administrative 
Decentralization. 
The 
current 
architecture 
is 
based 
on 
four 
axis, 
of 
which 
three 
are 
significantly 
weakened: 
blocks 
of 
municipal 
transfers 
(tax-sharing, 
HIPC 
II), 
selective 
transfers 
(FPS, 
SNC,  other  sectorial 
programs), 
municipal 
debt 
(FNDR 
and 
others) 
and 
municipalities’ 
own 
resources. 
A 
systemic 
reform 
of 
the system 
of 
selective 
transfers, 
municipal 
debt and 
municipal 
own 
resources 
is 
required, 
to 
increase 
the 
amount 
of 
resources 
available, 
create 
incentives 
for 
co-funding 
of 
public 
works,  expedite disbursement 
processes 
and 
build 
a 
common 
strategic 
vision 
to 
strengthen agreed decentralized, 
social 
and 
institutional 
arrangements. 
The 
extension 
of 
public-private 
partnerships 
concentrates 
on 
the 
14 
production 
chains 
(1 
0 
agroindustrial, 
3 
industrial 
and 
1 
service 
chain) 
of 
the 
Bolivian 
Productivity 
and Competitiveness System 
as 
a 
priority. 
It 
includes technical 
assistance 
and 
financing 
from 
the Operations 
Capital 
Fund, 
the 
Business 
Restructuring 
Fund, 
SAT, 
SIBTA, 
C-PROBOL, 
UPC 
and 
other 
programs 
and 
subprograms 
of 
the 
Bolivian 
Productivity 
and Competitiveness 
System. 
Facilitating 
agreements 
between 
private 
parties also requires  an 
aggressive 
simplification 
of 
registration 
proceedings, 
and the 
arrangements 
for 
creditors 
agreements 
and 
liquidation 
of 
small  and 
medium 
sized 
business. 
The prohibitive 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
in 
Bolivia 
results 
in 
a 
sustained process 
of 
tax and production 
informality 
in 
the 
business sector. 
4.3. 
Results: 2003-2007 
Productive, 
Social 
and 
Institutional 
Pacts 
The 
expected outcome 
of 
the 
2003 
National Dialogue 
is 
summarized 
in 
the achievement 
of 
productive, 
social  and  decentralized 
institutional 
pacts, 
supported 
on 
2003-2007 
management 
commitments  and 
sustained 
financing  derived 
from 
public,  private  and 
mixed 
agreements. 
The 
process 
of 
reaching 
agreement 
implies 
a 
clear 
strategic 
vision 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
central and prefectural 
governments 
in 
terms 
of 
their  productive,  social  and 
institutional 
financing 
and 
a 
clear 
strategic 
vision 
of 
municipalities, 
commonwealths, 
TCOs 
and 
other 
territorial 
planning 
instances 
regarding their 
priorities 
at 
the 
three 
levels 
of 
planning. 
Two 
types 
of 
arrangements 
are envisaged: 
immediate 
agreements, 
resulting 
from 
budgetary 
reallocations 
for 
FY 
2003 
and 
medium 
term 
agreements, 
stemming 
from 
strategic 
prioritizations 
for 
2004-2007 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
legal and institutional 
framework. 
4.4. 
Targets: 
National and 
Decentralized 
Targets 
Each 
productive, 
social 
and institutional 
pact requires setting 
management 
commitments 
and 
targets 
to 
be 
attained 
in 
the 
period 2004 
- 
2007. 
National 
targets 
use 
as 
medium 
and 
long 
term umbrella 
the 
Millenium 
Targets 
on 
poverty reduction, 
educational, 
health, 
water 
and 
sanitation 
and 
gender achievements 
within 
Page  38
- 
30 
- 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
commitments  fostered 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 
for 
developing 
countries. 
The 
Millenium 
Targets 
are 
complemented 
by 
production, social 
and 
institutional 
targets 
corresponding 
to 
the 
specificities 
of 
a 
broad-based 
growth 
strategic 
vision. 
Proposed 
National 
Targets 
2003-2007 
1. 
Reduce 
moderate 
poverty by 
one 
third 
2. 
Expand 
the 
base 
of 
growth 
of 
the 
agroindustrial, 
industrial 
and 
tourism 
sectors 
3. 
Extend 
and 
guarantee 
access 
to 
urban 
and 
rural 
property 
rights 
4. 
Increase 
agroindustrial 
and 
industrial 
exports 
5. 
Consolidate 
the 
quality 
and 
coverage of 
universal 
primary 
education 
(MDM) 
and 
foster technical 
and 
higher 
education 
6. 
Reduce 
maternal 
and 
child 
mortality 
rates 
(MDM) 
7. 
Greater 
access 
to 
drinking 
water 
and 
basic 
sanitation 
(MDM) 
8. 
Drive 
multi-territorial 
institutional 
reforms 
centered 
on 
management 
by 
results 
commitments 
9. 
Reduce 
gender 
gaps 
in 
production, 
social 
and 
institutional 
policies 
(MDM) 
10. 
Incorporate 
multiethnic 
and 
multicultural 
approaches 
in 
production, 
social 
and 
institutional 
policies 
At 
a decentralized level, 
targets 
will 
be 
set 
around 
local 
productive,  social 
and 
institutional 
pacts, 
not 
necessarily 
linked 
to 
the 
Millenium 
Targets, 
but 
aligned 
with 
the 
strategic 
priorities 
of 
each 
municipality, 
region 
and department. 
The 
targets 
will 
be 
specified 
in 
each agreement and 
will 
include 
details 
on 
data 
collection 
arrangements, 
frequency, 
multiterritorial 
responsibilities 
and 
public monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
processes. 
The 
Agencies 
of 
the 
National,  Departmental 
and 
Municipal 
Social 
Control 
Mechanism 
will 
have 
a 
central 
role 
in 
setting 
the 
targets  and 
in 
the 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the  management 
commitments 
included 
in 
each 
agreement. 
The 
Inter-Institutional 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Committee 
(CISE) 
of 
the 2003 
National 
Dialogue 
will 
do 
the 
same 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
powers 
and 
remit. 
4.5. 
Financing: Beyond 
HIPC 
II 
The 
2000 
National 
Dialogue mobilized 
commitments 
for 
an 
equivalent 
of 
US$ 
1,500 
million 
in 
15 
years 
around 
EBRP. 
Other 
resources were 
added 
to 
this 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Beyond 
HIPC 
agreements 
(US$ 
30.0 
million 
in 
2002 and 
US$ 
35.3 
million 
in 
2003). 
In 
2002, 
poverty reduction 
HIPC 
II 
resources 
amounted 
to 
US$ 
84.5 
million 
(US$ 
57.5 
million 
for 
the 
Dialogue 
Account, 
distributed 
based 
on 
a 
formula 
to 
the 
municipalities 
and 
US$ 
27 
million 
assigned 
to 
the 
Municipal 
Solidarity 
Fund, 
to 
finance 
new health 
and education  items). 
In 
the course 
of 
the 
coming 
years, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
resources assigned 
by 
the 
Dialogue 
Law, 
from 
US$ 
84.5 
million 
in 
2002, 
to 
US$ 
59.5 
million 
in 
2007 
and 
US$72.4 
million 
in 
2012.8 
A 
viable 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
should 
diversity 
the 
sources 
of 
funding 
beyond 
HIPC 
11, 
towards 
the 
logic 
of 
public, 
private 
and 
mixed 
agreements. 
This 
proposal 
intends 
to 
mobilize 
around 
US$ 
150 
million 
per 
year 
in 
public-private 
agreements, 
with 
resources 
from 
HIPC 
I1 
and 
Beyond 
HIPC 
allocated 
for 
2003, 
US$ 
50 
million 
in 
public-private 
agreements 
and 
US$ 
50 
million 
in 
agreements 
between 
private 
parties. 
The 
reallocation 
of 
resources 
from 
the 2003-2007 
investment 
program 
depends 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
on 
the 
rigidities 
implicit 
in 
long 
investment 
cycles 
(transport 
and 
productive infrastructure 
works), 
external 
sources 
of 
financing 
(terms 
of 
co-funding 
of 
external credits) 
and 
the 
level 
of 
centralization 
of

Bolivia 
currently 
has 
approximately 
US$ 
1,570 
million 
in 
approved  credits 
pending 
disbursement 
and 
US$ 
1,900 
million 
additionally, 
estimated 
as 
new 
resources 
from 
external 
sources 
for 
2003-2006. 
The 
greatest 
financing 
challenge 
of 
the 
initiatives 
agreed 
in 
the 2003 
National 
Dialogue 
is 
that 
of 
restructuring, 
harmonizing 
and 
expediting 
those 
credits that 
have 
already been 
agreed.
