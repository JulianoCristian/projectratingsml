However, there were rather\n            frequent changes in the personnel assigned to supervision,\n            which did not always have a favorable impact on either the\n            consistency of approach regarding the line of conduct to be\n            followed, or the promptness in decision making and\n            implementation. On numerous occasions since 1983, missions\n            have referred to the Mangoro plantations in discussions both\n            with forestry experts at the Bank and other various four\n            authorities in Madagascar. Relations between project\n            personnel and the latter seem to have been excellent. While\n            certain differences of view may have existed on specific\n            technical points, the harmonious execution of the project\n            has never suffered. During project implementation, certain\n            requests to purchase supplementary equipment and machinery\n            were refused, although the allocation was far from\n            exhausted. These actions partially handicapped project\n            implementation. Because of the interim nature of this\n            project, the list of materials and equipment to be procured\n            could not be fully identified at the start of the project,\n            hence, procurement delays. The same goes for the quantity\n            and the nature of the inputs."}, "docdt": "1991-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
