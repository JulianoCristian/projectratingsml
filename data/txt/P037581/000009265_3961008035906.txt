MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROMOTION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of C6te d'Ivoire for SDR 3.70 million (US$5.83 million equivalent), on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an Agricultural Export Promotion and
Diversification project. The project was prepared in close collaboration with the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) who provides the equivalent of US$3.42 million in grants towards the
project. Another co-financier will be the European Union who will provide an additional US$3.74 million
equivalent, also on a grant basis.
2.           Country/Sector Background. C6te d'Ivoire is one of the principal countries in the CFA
zone, with a population of about 13 million and an estimated GDP of US$6.7 billion in 1994. The country
has been in recession since 1986 and faces a severe external debt problem. High population growth and
economic decline have resulted in a steady fall of living standards. GNP per capita is estimated at about
US$515 in 1994 compared to well over US$1,000 in the early 1980s. Social indicators have also been
deteriorating, reflecting the effects of the economic crisis as well as the neglect of basic social services.
3.           Confronted with the lingering economic crisis since 1986, the Government decided,
together with its partner countries in the CFA zone, to complement the on-going internal adjustment efforts
with a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF per French franc, in
January 1994. The Government expects that with this parity change and the implementation of the
accompanying fiscal, monetary, and structural adjustment policies, the Ivorian economy will be able to
maintain and strengthen its restored international competitiveness and return to a sustainable growth path.
4.           The Government is strictly implementing its fiscal policy.  It met its revenue and
expenditure targets throughout 1994 and generated its first primary balance surplus in the 1990s. The
introduction of a major tax reform (reduction of VAT, petroleum taxes and import tariffs) in early 1994
helped dampen inflationary pressures but also reduced revenue as a share of GDP and, therefore, required
compensatory measures in the forn of reintroducing export taxes on coffee and cocoa. Although these
taxes are needed for fiscal reasons, the Government is committed to (a) reduce their importance within the
overall government revenue, and (b) pass through the positive effects of the devaluation to the farmer which
has become easier in the wake of improved intemational prices for coffee and cocoa. To this end, the
Government has repeatedly increased the producer price of coffee and cocoa, with the latest increase having
been mandated in February 1995.
5.           Apart from its beneficial effect on the budget, the Govermment's restrictive wage policy
was also followed by the private sector which increased wages by an average of 10 percent. The
devaluation effect on prices has quickly subsided after the initial surge in January 1994. During the last
quarter of 1994, the monthly inflation rate was 0.3 percent.
6.           Preliminary trade data indicate that export volumes in the first six months of 1994
contracted by about 6 percent relative to the same period in 1993. This was due to lower export volumes of



- 2 -
cocoa and coffee. Excluding these two commodities, export volumes increased by about 2 percent. Import
volumes shrank by 13 percent compared to the same period in 1993. As a result, the trade balance surplus
was about CFA franc 130 billion. The recent boom in international prices for coffee and cocoa is expected
to increase the trade surplus in 1994 above initial estimates. Moreover, preliminary results for 1994 show
that the Ivorian economy has responded positively to the devaluation and registered its first real growth
since 1987.
7.           Traditionally, agriculture in Cote d'Ivoire has been a major source of export-oriented
growth and private sector development. Since the mid-80s, however, agricultural exports have declined
sharply, primarily because of deteriorating terms of trade for key commodities such as cocoa and coffee.
The country has suffered a concomitant decline in real per capita GDP. This trend has accelerated at the
beginning of the 90s. In 1986, the Government launched an adjustment program aimed at restoring macro-
economic balances and putting the country's economy back on a sustainable growth path. An Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Program launched in 1989 introduced major reforms in the sector's fiscal, pricing and
institutional policies. In 1991, the Government adopted a medium-term macroeconomic framework,
including the pursuit of reforms in the agricultural sector to: (a) improve the incentive framework; (b) strike
the right balance between public and private sector roles; and (c) foster broad-based development. Since
the January 1994 devaluation, through the Economnic Recovery Credit (effective in November 1994), the
Bank is supporting broad-ranging economic reforms designed to generate growth through private supply
response in the productive sectors of the economy. In addition, further sectoral reforrns are expected to be
carried out under the proposed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) which aims at liberalizing
trade and prices, increasing private sector efficiency and reducing the Government's role in the economy.
8.           In agriculture, the Bank's strategy is based on the findings of a 1994 Agricultural Sector
Review and aims at (a) restoring the competitiveness and broad-based sustainable growth, and (b) helping
the country manage its natural resource base. To this end, the Bank will focus on three areas. First, the
Bank will support reforms that remove structural constraints in the incentive framework that have seriously
impaired the ability of this sector to adjust to changing internal and external circumstances and have limited
sector growth. Second, the Bank will concentrate on the role of the public sector and support the
Government efforts to divest and privatize public enterprises engaged in agricultural production and
processing. Third, the Bank will support investment programs which help develop non-traditional exports,
and strengthen the agricultural sector's ability to deal with population pressures, low productivity,
desertification and natural resource exploitation. While the ASAC would support policy actions in the first
two areas, new IDA investment operations in agricultural services, rural financial services and export
promotion would respond to the third area of focus.
9.           In line with the above strategy, the proposed project would build on the momentum created
by the devaluation that has also enhanced agricultural export competitiveness and provided an important
incentive to agricultural export promotion and diversification. Such a momentum will be further sustained
as the project will build upon the pilot phase (November 1993 through April 1995) which was designed to
test actual export sales and market development operations and possibilities for agricultural diversification
by a sample of over 60 enterprises. The results of the pilot phase have indicated that an important potential
for export exists in C6te d'Ivoire for non-traditional products such as desiccated coconut, cut flowers and
potted plants, essential oils and fruits and vegetables, cashew nuts, cola nuts, etc. The pilot phase tested
successfully a well-established methodology which focuses on assuring that the buyers on regional and
overseas markets are identified first, that their needs and requirements are translated back to Ivorian
producers and that the producers can successfully meet the needs of buyers. The pilot operation has further
been instrumental in addressing a large number of requests for services which were being sought from
various donors and defining a coherent approach for seeking solutions to common problems experienced by



- 3 -
producers and exporters of non-traditional products. It has received an enthusiastic response on the part of
the above producers and exporters.
10.           Moreover, the project would capitalize on financing facilities being granted from the
Government's own resources through an Agricultural Promotion and Diversification Fund of CFA franc
1.25 billion (about US$2.6 million) which provides credit to small private agricultural exporters of non-
traditional commodities.   Following the Agricultural Sector Review  and ASAC  discussions, the
Government decided that no additional allocation to the fund will be made and that it will carry out a
comprehensive review of the role and perfornance of the fund by December 31, 1997. The project would
further ensure close coordination of donor assistance in the sector: (a) CIDA is providing technical
assistance for the proposed project; (b) EU is financing packaging warehouses for increased fruit exports
by the Pineapple and Banana Producers/Exporters' Organization; and (c) the German Gesellschaft fur
Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) is funding market research and search for foreign commercial partners
for cut-flower exporters. As regards IFC, the project has established a close working relationship with the
Africa Project Development Facility (APDF) which is providing advisory services to medium and larger
enterprises with the objective of helping African entrepreneurs develop viable projects.  It is also
considering with IFC, through the Africa Enterprise Fund (AEF) which finances projects costing between
US$250,000 and US$5 million, ways to involve the latter in taking equity participation in some promising
non traditional producer/exporter businesses. It is further working directly with producers and exporters of
essential oils, cashew nut and fruits which are benefiting from IFC's lending. By focusing on smaller
enterprises, the project activities will contribute to widen the array of advisory services available to
agricultural producers/exporters and complement those of other institutions such as APDF.
l.            Project Objectives. The project's objectives would be to diversify and expand private
agricultural exports with a view to supporting the Government's export-led growth strategy, through: (a)
export market development activities for non-traditional agricultural products to foster diversification out of
traditional export crops; this would be achieved by scaling up actions initiated under an eighteen-month old
pilot operation as part of project preparation; (b) strengthening existing associations of agricultural
producers/exporters and promoting the establishment of an interprofessional group of producers' and
exporters' associations and the creation of new farmer associations; and (c) upgrading of export handling
facilities. The diversification of agricultural exports is further intended to reduce the country's excessive
dependence on traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee and timber.
12.           Project Description.  In support of the above objectives, the project would have the
following components:
(a)    Export Promotion and Diversification Actions through assisting Ivorian producers
in: (i) market research, customer identification, meeting quality requirements, trial shipments and obtaining
pre-export finance and follow-up of sales and export shipment; (ii) product development and quality control
via adaptive research; (iii) establishment of business partnerships for private operators engaging in the
production and export of products proven to have an important export potential for the country, such as
desiccated coconut, cashew nut, tropical cut flowers and potted plants, essential oils and fruits and
vegetables, etc. Under this component assistance will be provided to producers/exporters in identifying
regional and overseas buyers and developing partnerships and in establishing Ivorian product brands, logos,
labels and packaging materials.  Financial advisory services and training for entrepreneurs in the
agricultural export sector will also be provided to facilitate access to the banking sector's facilities through
assistance in preparing credit applications and helping arrange sound financial packages, especially for
smaller agricultural export businesses. Therefore, this component will contribute to address the major
remaining issues which constrain agricultural export promotion and diversification including the lack of



-4 -
foreign market development partnerships for non-traditional agricultural products and the limited access to
credit from the banking sector for financing private agricultural export activities and the uncertainty as
regards the willingness/readiness of banks to get involved. The total cost of the component is estimated at
US$6.26 million.
(b)    Support to Producers/Exporters' Organizations by strengthening existing privately-
controlled professional organizations: producer groups, exporter associations, cooperatives, etc., and
promoting the creation of new farmer associations and the establishment of an Interprofessional Group of
Producers' and Exporters' Associations. The interprofessional group of associations will not only represent
the interests of its members but is also expected to become a major vehicle for non-traditional export market
development and for engaging in trade lobbying actions. In the initial phase, project efforts will be
concentrated on producers involved in non-traditional crops with high export potential including primarily
products such as fresh cut flowers and potted plants (UPHCI), tropical fruits and vegetables (UPEFL) and
essential oils (APEPCI), for which farmer associations currently exist but experience a fairly low level of
organization. Management and legal advice required for the formal establishment of nascent associations
and for developing their work programs together with training in simplified cost accounting and
management principles will be provided. During negotiations assurances were obtained that a feasibility
study would be carried out to determine the need to establish the interprofessional group and specify the
modalities of its functioning. The terms of reference for the study and prompt implementation of
recommendations would be agreed upon with IDA. The total cost of this component is estimated at
US$2.88 million.
(c)    Upgrading of Export Handling Facilities through rehabilitating the infrastructure
in critical areas such as the existing fruit wharf in the Port of Abidjan and undertaking minor works for
handling and specialized storage facilities at the airport of Abidjan for allowing better transit conditions for
the export of perishable produce. This component will be carried out under parallel financing from grants
of the EU to cover the total cost of this component estimated at US$3.74 million; and
(d)    Support to Project Management which will be carried out by qualified private
professionals experienced in agricultural export and farmer organization. The total cost of this component
is estimated at US$1.52 million.
13.           Project Implementation. The existing Project Coordination Unit which operated efficiently
during the pilot phase will be used to carry out project implementation. The unit's staff which consists of
agricultural export professionals with private employment status will be redeployed to carry out new
responsibilities in line with the project's objectives. Project staff will also be assisted by professionals to be
recruited through local competition to provide technical and market development advice to individual
producers/exporters and their associations. The project management team will be assisted - under bilateral
donor funding -- by a team of internationally recruited technical assistants including an export development
and sales specialist with financial/export finance experience, and a farmer organization specialist who will
be paired with the above local professionals. General oversight and monitoring of project activities will be
carried out through a Steering Committee which will review and approve once a year the project's budget
and annual work program. Establishment of the Steering Committee with membership and responsibilities
acceptable to IDA would be agreed upon during negotiations.
14.           Project Sustainabilitv. The project would enhance the capacity of the agricultural export
sector to respond to the country's export promotion and diversification objectives. By strengthening farmer
organizations and helping establish interprofessional groups, which will be self-financing from the members
(producers/exporters), the project would contribute to build a local capacity, thus ensuring that actions



- 5 -
initiated under the project are carried out and pursued beyond project completion. Effective and sustainable
farmer participation will be assured as producers and exporters will be voting and paying members of their
existing and future professional organizations and of the interprofessional group that they will own and
from which they will demand high levels of continuous services.
15.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. Until the January 1994 CFA franc
devaluation, C8te d'Ivoire did not offer much opportunity for this type of project. However, since the
devaluation and as a result of various structural reforms supported by Bank SECALs things have changed.
16.          Given that there is no past Bank experience for this type of operations in C8te d'Ivoire,
such experience was sought from several developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia where
agricultural export promotion and diversification has been supported by the Bank, which proves that even
modest success in increasing a country's share of world markets can translate into considerable growth. It
is also showing that the future is in non traditional exports, while also giving evidence that traditional
exports still need to be part of an outward-oriented strategy. Moreover, unrestricted access to imported
inputs, investment licensing, financing and realistic exchange rates proved to constitute critical factors in
creating an enabling environment for an outward-oriented development benefiting agricultural production.
An important ingredient for successful entry into the international market has often been the presence of a
catalytic mechanism that facilitated the establishment of partnerships between local agricultural producers
and foreign investors and their subsequent response to world market demands. An important lesson learned
in the failure of developing fruit and vegetable export markets in a number of Bank export projects has been
the lack of identification of customer and product requirements beforehand. Foreign market development
proved to be an essential ingredient for export promotion projects in Kenya and Burundi while excessive
complexity and division of responsibility for implementation has been a major factor that adversely affected
the performance of Kenya's export promotion project. The above considerations are largely taken into
account in the proposed project design as most of them are and can be applied to C8te d'Ivoire.
17.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. Following the devaluation of the CFA franc which
provides an unprecedented incentive for agricultural export promotion and diversification, new
opportunities for the restoration of the agricultural export sector competitiveness are now emerging. By
providing an effective vehicle to support private investment and private sector involvement in improving the
performance of non-traditional exports and streamlining the role of the private professional organizations in
the agricultural export sector, the project fits well in the Bank's post-devaluation Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) presented to the Executive Directors on June 28, 1994. In addition, the project will
complement sectoral reforms to be carried out under the ASAC which aims at liberalizing trade and prices,
increasing private sector efficiency and reducing the Government's role in the economy. The ASAC will
focus on: (a) reducing and eventually eliminating any restrictions (licenses, quotas) on the importation of
agricultural and agro-industial commodities other than those related to health reasons, and substitute it by a
transparent protection mechanism based on reasonable levels of tariff duties; (b) adjusting the export tax on
cocoa and coffee, taking into consideration the fiscal needs of the country; (c) further supporting the full
liberalization of consumer prices in the agricultural and agro-industrial subsectors; and (d) contributing to
streamline the Government's role in the economy. ASAC support to policy actions will be complemented
with IDA investment operations in agricultural services, rural financial services and export promotion.
18.          The present operation would also complement a number of adjustment operations
supported by the Bank, most notably the Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (PASCO-Ln.3429/Cr.2324),
the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (PASFI-Ln.3408/Cr.2303), the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC-
Cr.2656) and the upcoming Private Sector Development Credit (PSD). Under the PASCO, a number of
measures aimed at the promotion of non-traditional exports were adopted, of which the following are of



direct relevance to the proposed operation: (a) settlement by the Government of VAT arrears to exporters,
i.e., reimbursement of VAT paid on inputs for all eligible exports; (b) extension of VAT eligibility (and
hence reimbursement of VAT paid on inputs) to certain agricultural exports (bananas, pineapples and
flowers and plants; extension to other products is scheduled); (c) elimination of the statistical tax of 2.5
percent for inputs used in export production; and (d) improvement in the system of temporary admission of
inputs for export products.
19.           More generally, the PASCO  has introduced a series of reforns that facilitate the
development of private sector activities, like the elimination of price controls (with a few exceptions), the
reduction of the level and dispersion of tariff rates, the reduction of the number of VAT rates, the
modification of the Investment and Labor Codes. The upcoming Private Sector Development Credit will
pursue and deepen many of these reforms and address specifically issues of interest to exporters, like the
streamlining of customs/port/transit procedures and remaining VAT eligibility and deduction issues.
Similarly, the PASFI has contributed to strengthen the financial system through the recapitalization of
commercial banks, the closing of unprofitable state banks, the securitization of government arrears to the
banking and insurance sectors and the introduction of legal reforms to facilitate the calling of collateral and
reduce the cost of legal action. The ERC has been the vehicle for the introduction of reforms in the
maritime transport sector, aimed at increasing competition in such services and reduce transport costs. As
a result, exporters should be allowed to seek direct agreement with shipping companies to take advantage of
much better transport rates that competition brings about. This will further contribute to create an
appropriate incentive framework for the success of project activities. Moreover, these measures which are
not only of extreme importance to the current operation will also increase, more generally, the
competitiveness of Ivorian agricultural exports in foreign markets.
20.           Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements were obtained:  to open a Project
Account, to establish a Project Coordination Unit and a Steering Commnittee, to carry out a feasibility study
and a comprehensive mid-term review, also agreements were reached on project cost sharing, audit and
report requirements. Conditions of Credit effectiveness include: opening a project account at CAA with an
initial deposit of CFA franc 100 million; appointment of independent auditors; appointment of project
management team with key personnel; establishment of the Steering Committee and adoption of a Project
Implementation Manual.
21.           Environmental Aspects. The environmental analysis of the project concluded that it entails
no significant negative environmental imnpacts. The industries in the sector are not polluting, the expected
increases in cultivated areas will take place on cleared land, with no impact on natural forests. The main
environmental issue associated with the project is the expected increase in the utilization of agricultural
chemicals and pesticides, in order to meet the quality standards required for exports. A closer analysis of
the latter issue showed that Cote d'Ivoire is well advanced in terms of the control of pesticide distribution,
thus reducing the likelihood of negative environmental impacts. In certain cases, the project will have
positive environmental impacts by creating incentives for planting tree crops and maintaining the existing
vegetation that yields valuable gathered products (i.e., shea nut and kola). In addition, the project may
create incentives for the stabilization of agriculture by promoting environmentally sound cash crops and by
increasing household income in rural areas through the marketing of high value specialized agricultural
products. The project is classified under environmental category B.
22.           Program  Objective Categories. The project would support sustainable agricultural
production through private sector development, increased agricultural exports and capacity building,
consistent with the Government's and IDA's strategy in these areas.



23.           Participatory Approach. The proposed project was identified by a government project
coordination team, with the assistance of a Canadian consulting firm. An eighteen-month pilot phase
allowed testing real export opportunities for a number of non-traditional crops following approval of
Japanese and Canadian grants. Under the leadership of an Ivorian private sector implementation team, 60
agricultural producers/exporters and their professional associations participated in this pilot phase. This
was done following a systematic client consultation through continued dialogue on agricultural export
promotion and diversification issues which further allowed for significant beneficiary involvement in the
project. The above producer/exporter groups will also participate actively in project activities during the
implementation period. Both existing and future professional associations will also be involved in project
execution through thematic technical committees regrouping their representatives to review and follow up
the project actions and priorities and advise the selection of beneficiaries of project support programs
including promotion of professional organizations and export diversification actions.
24.           Benefits and Risks. The project will directly benefit an estimated  100 private
enterprises/exporters and reach indirectly by project completion at least 10,000 growers of non-traditional
crops who, without this project, would have little or no hope to develop successful export sales on their
own. It will have major impact on agricultural professional organizations as it will contribute to
streamlining existing associations and helping establish new ones thereby empowering these organizations
to effectively lobby the Government for necessary changes related to their activities while enhancing the
ability of these organizations to represent producers/exporters. The project will also foster improved links
between production and markets, and result in increased exports of agricultural products. The development
of non-traditional export products will enhance job creation throughout the country for those
producers/exporters engaged in such activities. It will also bring new technology and training to farmers
and other professionals in the trade. It will further move the country from a position of being highly
dependent on traditional crops (such as cocoa, coffee, cotton, etc.) to a position of producing high value,
branded Ivorian products which sell at high prices in the off-season markets of Europe and other continents.
This is expected to bring about a significant improvement in the country's export receipts. The project will
also result in significant additional local value-added because of the expected increase in local demand for
processed products which would be a side outlet for non-exportable products. In addition to the above
benefits, the project will enhance the skills and knowledge of farmers and exporters significantly and carry
many farmers from subsistence level farming to a position of profitable producers of high value export
crops. The economic rate of return calculated on the incremental exported agricultural production for nine
major non-traditional crop channels comprising grated coconut, cashew nuts, essential oils, tropical flowers,
fruits and vegetables was estimated at 17 percent. The concerned crops are high value-added agricultural
products which fetch fairly high selling prices on international markets. The robustness of the above rate is
further explained by the impact of the 50 percent devaluation of the local currency which is having a
favorable impact on net margins and the relative share of local production factors costs such as that of
labor and irrigation.
25.           The major foreseeable risk is likely to be a slower than expected private sector supply
response if conflicting interests were to delay the anticipated improvements in the incentive framework for
agricultural exports. If the implementation of the Government's plan to progressively liberalize sea and air
freights were delayed and tariffs were not adjusted, there might also be a risk that freight costs could price
Ivorian products out of the international market. Such risks would be reduced, however, through the
removal of major economic and sectoral constraints as part of the reforms agreed upon under the ERC, and
those to be supported through the proposed ASAC, in addition to increased involvement in lobbying actions
by the recently created Air Freight Committee. There is also a risk that government agencies will attempt to
interfere with project activities. The strengthening of professional organizations, and eventually their

grouping into an interprofessional group of trade associations, would empower them to better represent and
defend their interests, remain self-reliant and ensure effective project implementation.
26.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
