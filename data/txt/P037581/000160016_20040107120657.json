These are some\n            of the lessons learned from this project: The old paradigm\n            of developing a sector through the creation of parastatals\n            is over; the promotion of strong professional associations\n            can be the cost effective way to achieve expected results.\n            Only a strong private and public partnership can contribute\n            to the success of this new paradigm, where each partner has\n            a role to play and particularly the Government, in building\n            the right environment for this to happen. It takes longer\n            than anticipated to \"build\" professional\n            associations and make them financially viable. The project\n            faced problems in removing constraints to boost supply and\n            to meet an increasing demand resulting from aggressive\n            external market promotion. If the project would have had a\n            sound financial management (\"transfer of capital\"\n            to the project's coordination unit), the flow of funds\n            to the project could have been smoother and the problems\n            generated by the inadequate existing financial management\n            system and the delays in providing counterpart funds, which\n            particularly affected this type of project, could have been\n            avoided.  Research and extension should have been set as\n            prerequisites to ensure increasing supply. Once the market\n            has been identified, an immediate supply response is a key\n            factor for the development of commodities. It hinges on a\n            dynamic financial market ready to take risks. However, a\n            common problem that the Export Promotion Project and similar\n            projects being implemented in the sub-region faced, was the\n            lack of adequate funding to beneficiaries'\n            sub-projects. Future projects should not only concentrate on\n            export of raw products but should also give equal importance\n            to processing products with the perspective of increasing\n            the value added, creating jobs in rural areas and ensuring\n            sustainability. The issue in question is the Ivorian\n            cashew-nut industry which may not survive if a fair amount\n            of raw nuts is not processed in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire."}, "docdt": "2003-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
