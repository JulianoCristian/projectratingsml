with a\n            view to supporting the Government's export-led growth\n            strategy, through: 1) export market development activities\n            for non traditional agricultural products allowing for\n            diversification out of traditional export crops; this will\n            be achieved by scaling up actions initiated under an\n            eighteen month old pilot operation as part of project\n            preparation; 2) support to producers' and\n            exporters' organizations; and 3) upgrading of export\n            facilities. The diversification of agricultural exports is\n            futher intended to reduce the country's excessive\n            dependence on traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee and\n            timber. The project will have the following components: a)\n            export promotion and diversification actions through\n            assisting authorities in: i) market research, customer\n            identification, meeting quality requirements; ii) product\n            development and quality control; iii) establishment of\n            business partnerships; b) support to\n            producers/exporters' organizations; and c) upgrading\n            export handling facilities; and d) project management support."}, "docdt": "1995-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
