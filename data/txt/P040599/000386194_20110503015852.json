Some of them are included here: The maintenance\n            of machinery and vehicles will be enhanced to ensure that no\n            discharge of black smoke and to strictly comply with the\n            city's regulation for motored vehicles. Secondary dust\n            raised by construction and transport vehicles will be\n            managed by controlling the speed and weight of the vehicles.\n            Other dust control measures include water spraying, cleaning\n            truck wheels at all entrances and exits, and sweeping\n            construction sites. To reduce air pollution, exhaust\n            pollutants will be limited and monitored according to\n            present regulations. Noise levels near schools, hospitals,\n            and residential buildings caused by construction machinery\n            and transport vehicles, are short term and temporary and\n            will be measured; and if not controlled, especially at\n            night, will disturb residents. Noise abatement will include\n            reinforcing windows. Temporary bypass measures and\n            rearranging public transportation bus lines may ease traffic\n            congestion. Discarded soil will be disposed of, cleaned in\n            time, and transported to fixed sites. Replanting vegetation\n            will reduce soil erosion, lessen traffic dust and noise,\n            adjust and improve the road climate, and improve road landscaping."}, "docdt": "2010-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
