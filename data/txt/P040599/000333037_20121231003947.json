Some lessons learned included:\n            the project involved adopting approaches and technologies\n            which had been practiced relatively infrequently around the\n            world, and of which there were no or few successful\n            experiences in China. These were: polluted/toxic sediment\n            disposal (in Dagu Canal), small town urban sewerage\n            (including the Design-Build-Operate, or DBO method),\n            wastewater reuse, and bus priority corridors. The first two\n            were successfully implemented as originally planned, but at\n            considerable costs. Both required a large amount of\n            high-level input for preparation and implementation, and the\n            DBO for Hangu sewerage incurred a major delay. The\n            wastewater reuse component was cancelled, and the bus\n            priority corridors are still at an experiment and planning\n            stage. They therefore cost the project considerable delay\n            and difficult adjustment efforts.  In fact, it was the\n            programmatic element of the project, city sewer and road\n            component which consisted of small and medium-size\n            subcomponents that allowed an effective adjustment to the\n            cancellations while keeping the project consistent with the\n            original objectives and framework. Adaptable Program Loan\n            (APL) is an instrument that explicitly supports innovations.\n            The experience of this project suggests that a combination\n            of programmatic and specific investment components could be\n            a valid option, while challenge funds or a similar mechanism\n            included in programmatic types of projects could be another."}, "docdt": "2012-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
