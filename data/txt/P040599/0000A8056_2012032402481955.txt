                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With about three months to go, the project has enhanced the efficiency and equity of urban wastewater management as demonstrated by the increase in the overall percentage of
                         wastewater collected and treated, which started at 25% in 2003 and has now reached 80%, exceeding the end-of-project target of 75%. The project has also improved the efficiency
                         of Tianjin’s transportation systems, with the increase in traffic mode sharing for the bus system up from 10% in 2003 to 18% now, achieving that end-of-project target. In addition,

                         traffic flow has improved with bus speeds up from 15 kilometers per hour (km/hr) at appraisal to 25 km/hr now. Tianjin’s sustainable development has been facilitated through the
                         implementation of key recommendations of a drainage and a transport sector studies. Among the key recommendations implemented are restructuring the drainage sector by
                         creating a separate financially independent service provision company; creating a single authority to manage urban transport issues in Tianjin; franchising bus operations to the
                         private sector managed by a capable, strong public transport administrative office; and promoting integration of bus and rail companies.
