                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation status is moderately satisfactory. First, the project is enhancing the efficiency and equity of urban wastewater management through implementing the

                         recommendations of a sector reform study and improving wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. Second, the project is enhancing transportation systems by
                         implementing the recommendations of a sector reform study; encouraging and facilitating mass transit modes; and improving and or rehabilitating roads, interchanges and other
                         related infrastructure. In May 2010, a time-bound Action Plan was agreed to improve project implementation and disbursements, and pave the way for a proposed second project
                         restructuring. The Action Plan has now been complied with satisfactorily. The proposed second restructuring includes: (i) changing the scope of some components to reflect
                         Tianjin's priorities; (ii) extending the closing date to June 30, 2012 to allow completion of ongoing activities; (iii) reallocation and changes in disbursement percentages; and (iv)
                         updating the project monitoring indicators. With the proposed restructuring, the PDO can be fully achieved.
