                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1. The Ministry of Finance, by letter dated February 18, 2011, has requested the
following changes to the project: (i) changes to the scope, description and location for
some components; (ii) extending the closing date of the project by 12 months to June 30,
2012; (iii) reallocating Loan proceeds among various categories; (iv) increasing the
disbursement percentage for the Works categories to 100% retroactive to June 1, 2010;
and, (v) updating the name of the project implementing agency to reflect organizational
changes within the Tianjin Municipal government. The proposed changes increase the
total project cost from US$303.1 million to US$371.4 million.

B. PROJECT STATUS
Project Information

2.      This project is in its seventh year of implementation and has had many
difficulties. It was restructured in May 2007. Nevertheless its performance declined in
2008 and 2009, the main reason being deficiencies in project management and
coordination during the period when the implementing agency the Tianjin Municipal
Construction and Administration Commission (TCAC) was restructured and replaced
with a new agency, the Tianjin Municipal Urban Rural Construction and Transport
Commission (TURCTC).

3.      In early 2010, the new leadership at TURCTC signaled its renewed commitment
to the project and requested a second restructuring. For the Bank to consider a second
restructuring, TURCTC agreed to implement a time bound Action Plan, which
emphasized improving disbursements; strengthening project management and monitoring
capacity at the project management office (PMO) and district project implementation
units (PIUs); and satisfactorily resolving all safeguard and procurement issues. The PMO
and remaining active PIUs have hired additional qualified staff; a special working team
was established to effectively coordinate project activities between various Tianjin
Municipal Government entities; and the bidding documents for all remaining activities
were cleared and are already in advanced stages of procurement or under implementation.
Disbursements jumped by US$30m between June 30 and December 30, 2010, and
cumulative disbursements to date are US$98.9 million (66% of the Loan). In view of this
turn-around the Bank upgraded the Project Development Objective (PDO) and
Implementation Performance ratings to moderately satisfactory on January 31, 2011.

4.      Tianjin is a rapidly growing city whose priorities for the wastewater and
transportation sector are constantly evolving as manifested in recent master plan
revisions. The proposed changes are necessary to maintain the project’s relevance and
enhance achievement of the PDO.



                                            4
C. PROPOSED CHANGES
Results/Indicators

5.     The project outcome indicators are not impacted by the proposed changes since
all components cancelled from the Loan have been completed using counterpart funding.
The intermediate results indicators for each component have been updated to reflect the
proposed changes, and are summarized in Annex 1.

Detailed Changes to the Components

6.    The following paragraphs describe the proposed changes with their justifications.
They do not have an impact on achievement of the PDO.

7.     Part A: Storm Water and Wastewater Collection. The scope is increased to
include additional roads in the rapidly developing north western and south eastern parts
of Tianjin city to improve storm water and wastewater collection networks, as well as
improve traffic flow and pedestrian.

8.     Part B: Shuanglin-Jinnan Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). This
component will be cancelled from Loan financing because of changes in the regional
master plan. In the original project design, the WWTP at Shuanglin was planned as a
regional WWTP with a capacity of 150,000 tons per day to serve the southern parts of
Tianjin and Jinnan District. Instead, the Jinnan Construction Bureau (the PIU for this
component) decided to meet this treatment capacity through construction of three smaller
WWTPs (of which one is completed and two are underway) with its own funding.

9.      Part D: Dagu Sewage Canal Rehabilitation. This component was satisfactorily
implemented and is now operational with periodic monitoring of the water quality in the
canal. To speed up the process of coordinating with other districts outside the outer ring
road, four packages outside the ring road were carried out with their own funding. The
scope of this component is therefore being revised as follows: “Rehabilitation of cross-
sections, bridges, culverts and pump stations of the sections of the Dagu canal and its
associated tributaries, and dredging and disposal of their sediment.”

10.     Part E: Suburban Sewerage. Revisions to the masterplans for Tangu and Hangu
Districts necessitated changes to this component from two locations to one in Hangu
District. This component was satisfactorily implemented and is operational. The plan
was to implement this component through three packages funded by the Loan: (a) the
WWTP with capacity of 100,000 tons per day; (b) sewage collector main; and (c)
pumping station. However, because of procurement delays, Hangu District decided to
implement the last two packages through their own funding. Moreover, the design of the
WWTP had to be revised to accommodate the new stringent zoning requirements. The
scope of this component is therefore being revised as follows: “Construction of a
wastewater treatment plant in the Binhai New area serving Hangu and the new “ECO
City”.



                                             5
11.      Part F: Urban Road Infrastructure. This component was divided up into three
sub-parts. The description of Part F3 is being amended to read “construction of road
traffic engineering improvements on selected locations.”

12.     Part G: Area Traffic Control and Traffic Management. Because of procurement
related delays, the implementing agency decided to implement this component using its
own funds. Hence this component will be cancelled from the loan.

13.    Part H: Bus Priority Corridors. This component was divided into two
components during the May 2007 restructuring. Part H1 was implemented through
counterpart funds and is cancelled from the Loan. Part H2, the bus parking depot, is
under implementation. However the location of the facility has changed from “Lingbin
Road” to “Longzhou Road” and the name of the PIU has also changed.

14.      Part I: Institutional Development. Part I(a) is cancelled as a standalone activity
as its contents were merged partly into the urban transport planning and management
study (Part I(c)) and partly into the reform and development of sewerage institutions
study (Part I(b)). Parts I(b), I(c), I(d), and I(e) have been satisfactorily completed. A
new activity is added to provide funds for capacity building and preparation of studies for
future infrastructure service improvements.

Institutional arrangements

15.    There is a change in the official name of the project implementing agency from
TCAC to TURCTC as a result of an organizational restructuring. The implementation
and project coordination capacities of the PMO and TURCTC have been strengthened to
ensure effective implementation and monitoring for the remaining life of the project.

Financing

16.     The proposed changes in project scope increase the total overall project cost from
US$303.1 million to US$371.4 million. Table 1 below indicates the changes in various
project components from the original estimates in the PAD and the first restructuring.

Disbursement Arrangements

17.     The disbursement percentage for Works category is increased from 70% to 100%
retroactively from June 1, 2010. This increase is partly to finance additions to the project
scope and to reduce the overall counterpart financing ratio. In line with OP/OB 6.00, the
retroactive increase was approved by the Bank and is consistent with the Country
Financing Parameters on cost sharing for China and all expenditures are eligible.

Reallocations

18.   In light of the cancellations in Parts B, D, E, F and G from the Loan funding, the
amount cancelled is reallocated to Part A in order to finance the additional road sections,

                                             7
and to Part H in order to finance the new bus depot. The proposed loan reallocation is
summarized in Table 2 below.
