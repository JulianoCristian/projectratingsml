of the urban transport system.\n            Urban transport in Shanghai is inadequate and is starting to\n            be addressed under the first Shanghai Metropolitan Transport\n            Project. The project will be carried out by Shanghai\n            Municipality. The Bank will provide assistance in the areas\n            of strategic transport planning and multimodal transport\n            systems, impact of motorization, public transport\n            operations, traffic management, and transport environmental\n            issues. This project is related to several key actions\n            relevant to the transport sector found in the economic\n            reform action plan designed to speed the evolution of the\n            Shanghai economy."}, "docdt": "1993-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
