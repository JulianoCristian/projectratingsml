Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) a stable macroeconomic and political\n            environment contributed greatly to the successful\n            implementation of difficult structural reforms in Vietnam;\n            2) overall, progress was slower in policy areas\n            characterized by limited political will, conflicting\n            institutional responsibilities or insufficient analytical\n            work; 3) an effective coordination mechanism is essential to\n            overcome the logistical challenges posed by a wide ranging\n            and cross-cutting policy dialogue; and 4) the Vietnam\n            experience demonstrates that poverty reduction support\n            credit programs, with very low conditionality, are a\n            well-suited aid instrument in countries with strong\n            government ownership of the reform agenda and its capacity\n            to deliver in practice."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
