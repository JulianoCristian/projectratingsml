Terms:          Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.

Description:    A fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 4) for the
                implementation of Vietnam's Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and
                Growth Strategy (CPRGS), approved in May 2002 and expanded in
                December 2003.

Benefits:       The present operation provides further support to Vietnam's reform
                program. The current cycle o f PRSCs is a vehicle for the World Bank,
                and the donor community more broadly, to stay engaged with a client
                that has delivered an outstanding performance in terms o f economic
                growth and poverty reduction. The proposed credit strengthens the
                reform program on several fronts:

                0   Itpromotes greater competition and faster integration with the world
                    economy. The credit supports actions aimed at gaining accession to
                    the World Trade Organization (WTO), measures to accelerate the
                    divestiture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in non-strategic
                    sectors, the adoption o f a more determined approach to banking
                    reform, and the introduction o f regulatory bodies for infrastructure
                    services.    Overall, these measures should lead to increased
                    efficiency, rapid economic growth andjob creation.

                    The proposed credit also promotes human development and
                    environmental protection. It supports improvements inthe quality o f
                    education, especially in poor areas.     The credit also endorses
                    measures aimed at protecting and developing forests, which sustain
                    the livelihoods o f many poor households.      And it includes the
                    adoption o f a better regulatory framework in relation to the
                    environment.      These actions should contribute to keeping
                    development inclusive and sustainable.

                0   The introduction o f modern planning methods, geared towards
                    attaining development outcomes, is also supported by this credit.
                    Other measures aimed at enhancing transparency and improving
                    governance include increased disclosure for all state budget entities,
                    strengthened accountability through the independence of the State
                    Audit, an effort to increase the effectiveness of anti-corruption
                    actions, and better information systems, especially in relation to
                    poverty measurement and targeting.

Risks:           At the same time, Vietnam faces important risks that the proposed credit
                 alone may not be able to mitigate:

                 0   The government's ambitious objectives interms o f economic growth
                     could conflict with its efforts to increase transparency and contain
                     the growth of contingent liabilities. There could be considerable
                     pressure to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure
                     development, especially at local levels.      This could reduce the
                     overall quality o f lending, thus undermining the banking reform
                     agenda and resulting in substantial contingent liabilities for the
                     government in the medium-term. Meanwhile, the full benefits from
                     WTO accession will accrue only if complementary reforms are
                     undertaken in areas such as trade logistics, tax policy and
                     administration, and the investment climate.

                 0   The dynamics created by rapid economic growth in a context o f
                     economic transition could make development less inclusive and
                     compromise environmental sustainability.       Policies in health and
                     education aim at channeling more resources to the poor and
                     improving the quality o f the services delivered. However, some key
                     programs are under-funded.         The incentives given to service
                     providers to charge fees have not been matched by sufficient
                     accountability on the delivery o f basic services to be provided at low
                     or no fee.   Regarding sustainability, an increasingly sophisticated
                     legislation still needs to translate into effective administrative,
                     economic and information tools to protect the environment.

                 0   Finally, there is a fiduciary risk associated with the proposed credit.
                     While there has been considerable progress on strengthening the
                     management of public expenditures             and enhancing budget
                     transparency, the management o f state assets and liabilities remains
                     weak.    Rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment
                     funds could contribute to the development o f infrastructure at the
                     local level, but their limited transparency and accountability are a
                     matter of concern. The government i s also taking important steps
                     towards more effective anti-corruption policies, but in a rapidly
                     growing economy the opportunities for graft could outpace
                     improvements inanti-corruption policies, at least for some time.

Disbursement:    The credit will be disbursed upon declaration o f effectiveness.

Co-financing:    Numerous bilateral and multilateral donors have expressed their support
                 to the PRSC process inVietnam. Eleven o f them have participated inthe
                 preparation o f this credit, and have been actively involved in the policy
                 areas where they are stronger. Subject to confirmation, the following
                 donors intend to contribute resources to the PRSC 4 operation through
                 grant finance or parallel lending: the Asian Development Bank, Canada,
                 Denmark, the European Commission, France, Ireland, Japan, the
                 Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

                        TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLICOF VIETNAM
                                               FOR

                                    I. INTRODUCTION
                                        ,




1.       Progress in the implementationof Vietnam's ambitious reform agenda remains
satisfactory,interms of boththe measuresadoptedand the development outcomesattained.
Year after year, a range o f policies are enacted to complete the transition to a market economy,
foster human development, and strengthen governance.            Moreover, there has been a clear
acceleration o f economic reforms since the beginningo f the current planning cycle (2001-2006).
Inrecent years, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) hasbeengrowing bymorethan seven percent
annually, and exports by roughly 20 percent. The poverty rate declined from 53 percent in 1993
to 37 percent in 1998 and 29 percent in 2002. Preliminary figures for 2004 indicate the
continuation o f this trend. Vietnam i s also on a solid path to attain the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs). These achievements are taking place in a context of prudent macroeconomic
policy, with a fiscal deficit inthe order of two percent o f GDP and moderate inflation rates. The
ratio o f external debt to GDP is on a decliningtrend as well.

2.        Several mechanismscurrently at play, from integrationwith the world economy to
decentralization,are bound to accelerate the reformprocesseven further. Integration with
the world economy has been used to "lock-in" changes behind the border. Joining the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) and signingthe Bilateral Trade Agreement with the U S were important
milestones inthis process. Accessionto WTO, which could happen by the end o f 2005, will have
an even stronger effect, because of its far-reaching implications, from lower trade barriers for
goods to competition in services to the adoption o f an array o f laws and regulations.        The
preparation of the five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010 is also
providing an opportunity to articulate the future reform agenda across sectors and provinces.
While progress i s bound to be uneven, the recent decision to move away from a "command and
control" approach towards a plan focused on development outcomes, incorporating the principles
o f the CPRGS, bears much promise. Decentralization i s also allowing more reform-oriented
provinces to experiment in new directions. The success of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and its
neighboring provinces at attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and the boldness of Danang
in using state-owned land to support private sector development, are worth mentioning in this
respect. These efforts are likely to be emulated by other provinces.

3.        The proposedcredit supports reformsacross the structural,social and institutional
areas, with an emphasis on SOEs and state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). Slow
progress in the reform of SOEs and SOCBs has been consistently identified as one o f the weak
points of the reform program o f Vietnam. A large number o f SOEs has been divested already,
and much has been accomplished interms of layingthe technical foundations of modern banking.

                                                  1

But SOCBs are commercially-oriented only to a certain extent and the full separation of their
management and supervision has yet to be accomplished. In this context, the share o f non-
performing loans (NPLs) remains highas a fraction of total credit, and is growing as a fraction o f
GDP. While the problem remains manageable for now, the proposed credit supports more
decisive actions to acknowledge the extent of NPLs, and complete the reform of the banking
system during the,next few years. It also supports a major reduction in the number o f sectors
where state intervention isjustified, which should lead to a further acceleration o f the divestiture
process, including now large SOEs.

4.      Other important prior actions supported by the proposed credit concern the
transparency of public finance and the fight against corruption. Vietnam has been
implementing a comprehensive reform of public financial management, which i s now bearing
fruit. For the first time, the entire budget is being disclosed. The proposed credit also includes
measures aimed at increasing transparency in the budget, extra-budgetary accounts, public
investment projects and SOEs. In parallel, Vietnam has started moving away from a punitive
approach to corruption to one based on strengthened government systems and reduced discretion
by government officials. The ongoing generalization o f the One-Stop Shop (OSS) model for
administrative services, the planned modernization of customs, and the foreseen strengthening o f
public procurement, are illustrations of this trend. A comprehensive diagnostic of corruption and
its modalities i s being completed, and its findings will be publicly disclosed. An anti-corruption
action plan has been set up under the proposed credit. In envisions the introduction o f more
effective whistle-blowing mechanisms and the establishment o f a database o f assets o f top civil
servants and their families.

5.      By focusing on transparency and laying the grounds for more decisive banking
reform,the proposedcredit addressessome of the main concerns raised by the Board. The
government has implemented many policy actions going in the right direction, albeit not as
strongly as might have been desirable.        And there is indeed a risk associated with partial
implementation.      The divestiture of SOEs could continue at a relatively slow pace, a level
playing field could fail to be secured, and banking credit could still be allocated to projects o f
dubious merits. The opportunities for embezzlement created by rapid growth could more than
offset the strengthening in government systems, and lead to increased corruption. However, the
rapid integration with the world economy creates a strong incentive for the government to tackle
these problems, and in particular to address the weaknesses o f the banking system, before the
implicit fiscal burdenbecomes too large. The top leadership o f the country appearsto be strongly
committed to the fight against corruption, which is one of the main areas o f popular discontent.
An increasingly coordinated policy dialogue between donors and government, especially around
the preparation of PRSC operations, i s also contributing to the mitigation o f risks, as it allows
focusing attention on the laggard areas of the program.



               11.      ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION



6.       The performanceofthe Vietnamese economy remainsremarkablystrong, inspite of
recurrent adverse shocks. Inrecent months, these shocks included a serious outbreak of avian
influenza, severe floods and droughts, a sharp rise inthe price o f key imported commodities, and
the introduction o f market barriers in textiles, garments and other export products. In spite of
those adverse conditions, GDP growth remained above seven percent for the third consecutive


                                                  2

year, and indeed accelerated to attain 7.7 percent in 2004 (see Table 1). As a result, the
improvement in living conditions has been widespread. Preliminary figures from the Vietnam
Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) 2004 indicate a substantial decline in the poverty
headcount since 2002, the year o f the last survey. While it i s still too early to report a poverty
rate with confidence, there is a clear expectation to see sustained progress towards the attainment
ofthe Vietnam DevelopmentGoals (VDGs) and other key development outcomes.

 7.      The resilience of the economy to adverse shocks is partly a reflection of prudent
 economic management. The avian influenza outbreak in the first quarter o f 2004 resulted in a
 sharp setback to the poultry sector, whereby nearly 17 percent of birds had to be culled. The


                                                  3

tourism sector was also threatened, as potential visitors altered plans in the wake o f the disease.
Floods and droughts further compounded the problems for the agricultural sector. An immediate
effect of the avian influenza and adverse weather conditions was a rise infood prices. This shock
was further fuelled by an increase in international prices of key imports such as oil, fertilizer,
cement and steel. Inflation soared from three percent year-on-year in January 2004, to over ten
percent in September.       However, calls to resort to administrative price controls were not
followed. Budgetary policy remained prudent, and owing in part to high oil prices the budget
deficit actually fell to 1.4 percent o f GDP in 2004, below the targeted level o f 2.2 percent.
Monthly increases in consumer prices are now much closer to the levels o f previous years. But
the considerable turbulence experienced in recent months should raise awareness on the need for
a coherent framework to guide macroeconomic policy decisions.

8.      Credit growth accelerated to 42 percent in 2004, mainly after the inflationary peak. The
main concern from faster credit growth relates to the quality o f lending, given that project
screening by banks remains weak. Inthe 12 months to November, credit fromjoint- stock banks
(JSBs) had risen 51 percent, while that from SOCBs had expanded by 37 percent. The higher
growth rate o f commercial bank credit coincided with a deceleration inpolicy lendingwhich may
have resulted from stricter regulations. The on-lending of domestically raised resources by the
Development Assistance Fund(DAF) decelerated from 45 percent in2003 to 22 percent in 2004.
Money supply growth stood at 30 percent in 2004 compared with 25 percent in2003. As inrecent
years, there was no monetization of the fiscal deficit in 2004. Foreign exchange reserves are
estimated to have remained roughly stable at around nine to ten weeks o f imports. The current
account deficit narrowed from 4.7 percent o f GDP in 2003 to about four percent. This prudent
macroeconomic stance, aided by a recovery o fthe agricultural sector, i s leading to a decline inthe
inflation rate, which i s expected to reach 6.5 percent in2005.

9.      The strong economic performance of the Vietnamese economy also reflects the
increasingstrength and buoyancy of the private sector. Exports of garments faced stricter
quotas in the U S market, while shrimp exports were slapped with anti-dumping tariffs. These
shocks came at a time where the expiration o f the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) gave an
advantage to competitors of Vietnam who are already members o f the WTO. Confronted with
uncertain market conditions, exporters have looked to diversify into the European Union (EU)
and Japanese markets, with some initial success. This trend should be aided by recent garment
quota removals in the EU and better food safety standards in Vietnam. Overall, helped by high
oil prices, exports grew by 29 percent in 2004, reaching 57 percent of GDP. Exports o f textiles
and garments continued to expand, albeit at a lower rate, in spite o f the expiration o f the MFA.
While the number o f SOEs is steadily declining, an additional 35,000 new businesses were
registered in 2004, representing a year-on-year increase o f 26 percent innumber and 24 percent in
registered capital. Private sector industrial production rose 23 percent in2004, compared with 12
percent for the state sector. FDI commitments reached a seven-year high o f US$ 4.2 billion in
2004, or nearly ten percent o f GDP.

 10.     Broad-based growth is leading to an improvement in living standards for most
 population groups, with strong indications o f a continuing decline in poverty.          Estimates
combining data from the VHLSS 2002 with trends in the growth o f provincial economic activity,
 suggest that the poverty headcount ratio could have fallen to around 26 percent in2004 compared
with 29 percent in2002. Early, but promising indications from the analysis of the VHLSS 2004
also point to a sustained decline in poverty (see Figure 1). Several consistency checks are still
necessary before a final figure for the poverty headcount can be announced, most likely in June,
 2005. By that time, an assessment of progress towards the VDGs and other key development
 outcomes will be available as well.

11.      Other readily-availableindicators suggest that considerable progress is being made
on human development. Administrative data on school enrollment shows that the number o f
children inprimary education is roughly stable, inspite of a rapid decline inthe size o f population
cohorts. The picture is slightly more complex in the case of infant mortality, as different survey
instruments lead to different estimates. But the declining trend is consistent across sources.
Based on census and inter-census data, the infant mortality rate fell from 44.4 per 1000life births
in 1990 to 36.7 in 1998. According to the Demographic and Health Survey, it fell from 28 in
1997 to 18 in 2000. These figures need to be interpreted with caution, as even the omission o f a
few deaths could bias the results. The latest official estimate i s 26 deaths per 1000 life births.
More precise estimates mightnot be available untilthe next population census, planned for 2009.
Still, even taking into account very large measurement errors, the hypothesisthat infant mortality
rates declined very rapidly cannot be rejected.

12.      Whether ethnic minorities have benefited from economic growth as other
populationgroups did is unclearat this point. Similarly, itwill be important to assess whether
progress towards the attainment o f the VDGs and other social indicators can also be seen among
the poorest population quintile. Other areas o f concern relate to the vulnerability o f those barely
above the poverty line, as well as the potentially widening gap in living standards between the
booming regions in the deltas and coastal areas compared to the much less dynamic uplands.
Finally, there could be groups o f emerging poor as a result o f the changes inVietnam's economic
structure. They might include rural households who lost their land due to adverse shocks and, in
a context of massive rural-urban migrant, city dwellers lacking proper registration, hence access
to some key social services.

                              111.     THE REFORMPROGRAM



13.     The reform agenda of Vietnam is guided by a series of strategic plans and
documents, including the CPRGS, the 2001-2006 SEDP and the Ten-Year Socio-Economic
Development Strategy. The CPRGS, approved in 2002, represented a sharp improvement from
earlier planning documents basedon a "command and control" view of the economy. Rather than
spelling out detailed sector-by-sector production targets, the CPRGS focused on development
outcomes such as ,poverty reduction and other VDGs.            Empirical evidence and a broad
consultation process were used to identify the policies best suited to attaining those development
outcomes. Efforts were also made to "cost" these policies and to align resources towards their
attainment. A set of monitoring indicators was developed to monitor progress in implementation.
The CPRGS was "expanded" in December 2003 so as to better address policies related to large-
scale infrastructure. Broadly speaking, the reform agenda in the CPRGS i s structured around
three main pillars: completing the transition to a market economy, ensuring social inclusion and
environmental sustainability, and buildingmodern governance.

14.      Other important policy developments have influencedthis reform agenda recently,
and are bound to accelerate the pace of change in the coming years. After several years o f
hesitation and delays, by mid-2003 the government decided to aim for a rapid accession to the
WTO. In late 2003, a new anti-corruption strategy started to emerge, with the emphasis shifting
from punitive measures to increased transparency and the strengthening o f the systems through
which the government operates. The year 2004 saw the coming into effect o f the new Budget
Law, which makes the National Assembly and People's Councils at all levels responsible for
resource appropriations.     And in late 2004 the decision was made to integrate the CPRGS
approach into the preparation o fthe 2006-2010 SEDP.

15.      The turning-point WTO offer discussed in Geneva in June 2004 paved the way for
the critical phase of bilateral market access negotiations currently under way.           In WTO
terminology, the June 2004 offer moved Vietnam from "draft elements o f a working party report"
to a full "draft report", discussed in December 2004. The reforms addressed in this process are
sweeping, as they range from reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers to increased competition
inservices to comprehensive changes inlaws and regulations. Vietnam's latest offers, circulated
in April, include commitments to cut tariffs to an average of about 18 percent (four percentage
points below the previous offer), with industrial tariffs around 17 percent and agricultural tariffs
bound at 25 percent on average. In services, the offer provides some access in 10 sectors or 92
sub-sectors. Vietnam dropped an earlier request for a phased-in implementation o f the Sanitary
and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) agreement, and pledged to comply with it from the date o f accession.
The process received a major boost with the successful completion o f bilateral negotiations with
the EuropeanUnionEU in October. Thus far bilateral negotiations have been finalized with six
trading partners. An ambitious but still attainable target would be to wrap up the membership
negotiations by the time o f the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, in December 2005.
Meanwhile, in the regional context, Vietnam has steadily met its targets for trade liberalization
under the AFTA agreement. Average tariffs under this schedule are expected to fall to 2.2
percent by 2006 compared with 6.6 percent in2003.

 16.     A more systemic anti-corruption approach is gradually taking root, as opposed to
punitive, ex-post measures. After many years o f reluctance, a corruption diagnostic assessment


                                                 6

i s currently being undertaken with the participation o f local academics and technical assistance
from foreign experts. The research i s based on an internationally recognized methodology, where
three separate surveys cover households, enterprises and public officials, to allow for
triangulation o f responses. Preliminary findings are being discussed and a full report will be
disclosed inthe coming months.

17.      The Government Inspectorate (GI) has been appointed as the leading agency for the
preparation o f a new anti-corruption strategy. A key element inthis strategy is an Anti-corruption
Law, to be passed by the National Assembly in October 2005. Supplemented by the anti-
corruption articles in the penal code, the draft law includes stronger accountability requirements
for heads o f agencies, the monitoring of assets o f senior government officials and their families,
and the introduction o f a more effective whistle-blowing mechanism. In parallel, the Ministryo f
Home Affairs ( M O W ) is setting up incognito spot-checks across government offices. The
government and the Party have also asked the media to apply a more proactive approach in
detecting and reporting on corruption issues. This is at a time when the number o f mass media
has increased considerably. For instance, 77 newspapers are currently accessible online through
the internet.

18.      There is strong progress in public financial management, and in 2005 the entire
State BudgetPlanwas disclosed for the first time, including an aggregate amount for defense
expenditure. The State Budget Law, which became effective in 2004, was a cornerstone in this
process. In November 2004, the trend was reinforced by the Prime Minister's Decision 192,
which mandates that details of budgets at all levels o f government be published within a
stipulated time period. Importantly, the Decision introduces financial transparency in capital
projects that use state budget resources. Allocation o f funds to such projects must be based on
approved investment plans, and details o f the biddingprocess needto be made publicly available.
Decision 192 also covers the disclosure o f information on the financial situation o f SOEs. The
recently completed Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA),
jointly prepared by the government and the World Bank, charts the way for further reforms inthis
area. A related development is the transformation o f the State Audit o f Vietnam (SAV) into an
independent institution reporting the National Assembly, rather than to the government. The
Auditor General will be appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly and the audit reports
will be made public. The State Bank o f Vietnam (SBV) will also be subject to annual auditing
and the disclosure o fthe audit reports.

 19.     Recognizing the merits of the CPRGS approach the government has decided to
integrate it in the formulationof the next five-year plan. This welcome step could result in
the modernization o f the planning process at all levels. In September 2004, the Prime Minister
issued Directive 33/2004/CT-Ttg, on the SEDP, specifically requiringthat it address the VDGs,
therebymotivating a more outcome-focused plan. The Directive also statesthat the analyses used
to underpin the plan should make use o f international methods and standards. This would be
particularly relevant for poverty measurement and the targeting of assistance. The method
currently used to measure poverty in Vietnam has provided considerable discretion to local
authorities, who have sometimes manipulated it to exaggerate progress. The use o f international
methods and standards also opens up the possibility o f addressing more openly sensitive issues,
 such as ethnicity and migration, which received more attention in the CPRGS than in previous
plans and strategies. Last but not least, the Directive proposes that the preparation o f the SEDP
emulate some o f the participatory approaches to planning that characterized the CPRGS. Sectors
and provinces have been explicitly instructed to take into account the comments and opinions
voiced by research institutions, universities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and social
 groups, with special attention to the business community. While fully moving away o f the


                                                  7

command approach will take time, a more strategic approach to planning should emerge from this
integration.

20.      Progress has not been so rapid regarding the transformation of SOEs.                 The
elimination o f direct subsidies, increased competition inproduct markets and, to a certain extent,
the hardening o f the budget constraint, are exerting pressure on SOEs to become more
competitive. Admittedly, data should be interpreted with caution, as information systems remain
particularly weak in this area. But with this caveat in mind, about three quarters of the SOEs
reported profits while the rest either broke even or recorded losses. The most recent average
return on equity was estimated at 7.3 percent, although it would be lower if the opportunity cost
o f land was fully taken into account (see Table 2). The divestiture process, while proceedingat a
faster pace than before, has failed to meet the ambitious targets of the SOE restructuring plans of
2002. The aim o f those plans was to equitize, sell, or liquidate around 2400 SOEs over a three-
year period. The combined figure for 2003 and 2004 was 1091, which reflects a very substantial
acceleration in the process, but suggests that the target will not be met.              Ownership
transformation also seems to be associated with more substantive restructuring at present, as
reflected in the operation the social safety net for redundant SOE workers. While only 1,147
SOE workers were laid-off and assisted by the safety net in2002, the figure increased to 18,445
in2003 andto 43,466 in2004.

 21.      However, the agenda for SOE reform is evolving, so as to facilitate the divestiture or
 restructuring of large enterprises. Decision 155/2004/QD-TTg reduced the list o f sectors in
which full state control is justified. 100 percent state ownership i s now stipulated only for
 strategic sectors such as explosives, national defense, printing o f banknotes, the natimal
 electricity grid, the rail network, and major ports. A decree was approved to convert large
 groupings of SOEs, currently organized under the form o f General Corporations (GCs), into
 holding companies.     The holding company model had been recommended by a series o f


                                                  8

operational reviews and promises to improve corporate governance o f the GCs. Key changes
were also introduced in the equitization process, whereby valuations must be conducted by
outside agencies, the ability o f strategic investors and other outsiders to buy shares has been
extended, and the shares themselves are to be sold through auctions. The impact of these changes
is already visible. Decision 155, for example, has paved the way for equitization of electricity
generation units, an area previously deemed strategic. A hydropower plant was equitized through
auction inMarch 2005. An action plan for the equitization o f another seven power plants has also
been approved. Vinamilk, a leading agro-products company, successfully auctioned shares on the
HCMC securities exchange. Nearly all the shares auctioned were bought by foreigners.

22.        Several initiatives are currently under way to strengthen the capacity of MOF to
exercisethe State's shareholders rights. They include the monitoring o f SOE performance, the
effective operation o f the Debts and Assets Trading Company (DATC) and the creation of a State
Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC). These initiatives, if carried through ina way that makes
them complementary, bear considerable promise to strengthen the performance o f the state sector
in Vietnam. This would require reallocating state capital through the SCIC towards profitable
SOEs, based on performance indicators (including stock market valuation in the future),
narrowing the scope of state ownership to a few, truly strategic sectors, and divesting state capital
insmaller and non- strategic SOEs. The DATC would then be instrumentalinhandling SOEs in
need of major restructuring or liquidation.

23.        Much has been done at the technical level to strengthen Vietnam's SOCBs, but they
remain weaker than is openly acknowledged.                   The improved payments system, the
development o f accounting rules aligned with International Accounting Standards (IAS),
enhanced procedures for the collection and sharing of credit information, an enabling legal
framework for modern financial products and services, and the implementation o f risk-based
prudential supervision o f banks are all encouraging. But assessments based on IAS audits o f
SOCBs suggest that their combined non-performing loans (NPLs) represent around 19 percent of
their combined loans and 12percent oftheir combined assets. These NPLs amount to roughly 15
percent of total credit to the economy, or eight percent o f GDP. Assessments basedon IAS audits
also suggest that the overall quality o f the SOCB portfolio is not improving. Given the rapidly
 increasing ratio o f credit to GDP, fiscal liabilities mightbe growing. Despitethe re-channelingo f
directed credit through the Development Assistance Fund (DAF), SOCBs are still too open to
 implicit pressures for non-commercial or politically-preferred lending, especially in provincial
branches. Moreover, the resolution of NPLs requires decisions about the future o f the delinquent
 SOEs, which the SOCBs are in no position to make. Despite little progress in their ability to
 allocate credit to worthy projects, SOCBs have received about VND 10.9 trillion in capital
 injections.

 24.       A new resolve to tackle banking sector issues is noticeable; it is expected to lead to
 the adoption of an ambitious reform roadmap for the next SEDP. The highest levels o f
 government seem by now to fully realize the challenges posed to SOCBs by the rapid global
 integration of Vietnam, and in particular by the commitments made in the context o f WTO
 accession. At the instruction o f the Prime Minister, the SBV prepared a far-reaching submission
 o f its input for the SEDP. This inputhas also been considered as the basis for the banking reform
 agenda by the Politburo. It includes the equitization o f all SOCBs, and the issuance o f new laws
 for the SBV and Credit Institutions based on WTO requirements and Base1core principles. The
 input for the SEDP envisions the transformation of the SBV into a modern central bank charged
 with the conduct of market-based monetary policy and financial sector supervision. There will
 also be a clearer separation o f SOCB management and supervision functions of the SBV, and a



                                                      9

strengtheningo fthe commercial orientation ofthe SOCBs. The new laws for the SBV and Credit
Institutionsare scheduledto be passedin2008.

25.      Meanwhile,an effort is under way to produce more reliabledata on the situationof
SOEsand SOCBs. After many yearsreportinga low share o fNPLs inbankingcredit, byrelying
on Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS), in April 2005 the SBV instructed all banks to
reclassify their loans based on U S . A first estimate for SOCBs has already been prepared by
SBV. Staff had access to this estimate, and concur that it provides a much more accuratepicture
on NPLs. In parallel, MOF has launched an assessment o f the fiscal risks associatedwith SOEs,
SOCBs and DAF, to gain a better understanding o f the potential costs for the budget. Efforts by
SBV to estimate the stock of NPLs, while very important, are only a first step. A reliable
assessment o f the financial health of the debtors (including state-owned enterprises) i s also
needed to estimate the share o f the NPLs that could be recovered. MOF i s in an excellent
position to conduct such assessment, using the financial statements of SOEs and tax
administration records on items such as profitability and interest coverage. It can also value the
assets heldby delinquent SOEs, including inparticulartheir land.

26.      Direct budget support is needed to implement this ambitious reform program.
Policy measures supported by the PRSC process, such as the safety net for redundant SOE
workers, the restructuring o f SOCBs or the creation o f provincial Health Care Funds for the Poor
(HCFPs) involve additional spending. Admittedly, total government revenue is increasing. For
2005 it is projected at US$ 11.3 billion, compared to 10.5 billion in 2004. But total budget
expenditure, including the on-lending of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and debt
amortizations, i s increasing ever faster. It attained US$ 13.3 billion in 2004. It i s expected to
climb to 15.2 billion in 2005, pushingfinancing needs up from 1.5 billion to 2.1 billion. Given
the revenue brought forward from 2004, and projections on domestic borrowing, the external
financing needs for 2005 (including grants) can be estimated at US$ 1.4 billion.



                      IV.     PROGRESS UNDERTHE PRSCPROCESS



27.      The implementation of the ambitious reform agenda spelled out in CPRGS and
other strategies and plans has been supported through three PRSC operations so far. The
proposed credit i s the fourth one in the series. PRSC 1, a two-tranche operation for US$ 250
million, was approved by the Board in June 2001, based on an Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The focus of PRSC 1 was mainly on the structural reform agenda, with
policies articulated around five main areas: liberalizing trade, reforming SOEs, strengthening the
banking sector, creating an enabling environment for the private sector, and improving
management and transparency in public finances. PRSC 2, a one-tranche operation for US$ 100
million, was approved by the Board inJune 2003, based on the CPRGS. Under PRSC 2, the range
of economic reforms supported by the international community was considerably broadened. In
addition to the mainly structural reforms covered by PRSC 1, this second credit included various
policy actions aimed at keeping development inclusive and building modern governance.
Measures related to education and health sectors, environmental sustainability, land management,
 legal development and public financial management, were all part o f PRSC 2. PRSC 3 was a
one-tranche operation for US$ 100 million too. It was approved by the Board in June 2004, and
had the same broad coverage as PRSC 2.

28.     In addition to providing resources to the budget, PRSC operations have served as
an effective coordination device, supported by an increasingly large number of donors. The
Steering Committee for PRSCs is led by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge o f economic
reforms, and brings together representatives from 24 line ministries and government agencies.
On the donor side, PRSC operations have been co-financed by several bilateral and multilateral
agencies, either through grants or through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a
transition in the role o f co-financiers, from providers o f finance to partners substantially engaged
in the preparation of the operations and the policy dialogue with government. This dialogue is
organized by policy areas, in which donors engage selectively, based on their interests and
technical capacity on the ground.        The number o f donors participating in this process has
increased from four inPRSC 1to seven in PRSC 3 to 11 inthe current operation. As many as 15
bilateral and multilateral donors could co-finance PRSC 5. All donors who seriously consider the
possibility to partner up in this process are invited to participate in the preparation o f PRSC
Operations, even ifthey cannot commit to co-finance them inthe short term.

29.     Progress under the PRSC process can be measured against the development
objectives spelled out in the CPRGS and other plans and strategies of the government.
Unfortunately, a comprehensive system of indicators to monitor and evaluate the impact of
economic reforms was not yet in place at the beginning o f the PRSC process. The focus varied
across government plans and strategies, and the definition o f goals and targets was not always
precise, or totally pertinent. This i s not surprising at a time when the "command and control"
view o f the economy was more entrenched, and the statistical system was only starting to
develop. In spite o f these limitations, based on the CPRGS and other planning documents o f the
government it is possible to compile a set o f development objectives covering the three main
areas o f the reform program. Because o f the five-year planning cycle of Vietnam, most o f those
objectives were spelled out for the year 2006 (see Table 3).

30.      While progress across policy areas is uneven, much has been accomplished under
the first three PRSC operations. Given how comprehensive the reform agenda o f Vietnam is,
some areas are bound to see faster change than others. The overall balance is also affected by
differences in the quality and frequency o f the available indicators.          However, substantive
progress has occurred inthe structural, the social and the governance pillars o f the reform agenda,
making it difficult to identify any o f them as a systematic laggard. On the other hand, it appears
that the speed at which progress is made towards the attainment development outcomes within
each o f these pillars crucially depends on the political will to implement the reforms. The
contrast between rapid progress in the integration with the world economy on the one hand, and
the reform o f SOEs and SOCBs on the other hand, is revealing in this respect. But to a certain
extent, this contrast also reflects a strategy, whereby the integration with the world economy is
used as a mechanism to "lock-in" the reforms, and gradually create the incentive for changes in
areas where the inertia i s stronger. Because o f the wide-ranging commitments implied, accession
to the WTO is bound to strengthen the reform incentives even further.

31.      The assessment of the triggers spelled out at the time of PRSC 3 points towards
base-case lending. The 15 triggers chosen for the preparationo f PRSC 4 were evenly distributed
across the structural, social and governance areas o f the reform program (see Table 4). These
triggers should not be interpreted as conditions, and their evaluation involves an element of
judgment, inthe spirit o f a "bottom-line" assessment. Meeting all the triggers would have opened
the way for high-case lending. Progress across most triggers but no backtracking across any o f
them is associated with base-case lending. A serious reversal in any of the triggers would have
ledto the low-case scenario, effectively implyingthat the next operation inthe cycle is suspended
untilreforms regainmomentum.

32.      The fact that a vast majority of the triggers was met does not mean that progress in the
reform agenda was satisfactory across the board. Triggers are definedina precise way, to reduce
the extent of subjectivity intheir assessment. For instance, inthe SOE reform area, key decrees
to support the equitization o f large companies and GCs were revised, which explains the rating o f
this trigger as highly satisfactory. But it should not be inferredthat the overall progress in SOE
reform is highly satisfactory. Infact, this is one of the policy areas that have been lagging behind
expectations. With this caveat in mind, the fact that three o f the triggers can be rated as highly
satisfactory, and nine others as satisfactory, can be seen as an indication that Vietnam continues
implementing its reform agenda across the structural, social and institutional pillars, albeit at
varying paces within each of them.



                                V.      THEPROPOSED CREDIT



33.      A considerable number of meaningfulpolicy measures have been adopted over the
previous twelve months, across all policy areas. Similarly, several follow up measures are
envisioned, or are already under preparation, for the year under the nextoperation. Inother cases,
improvements in some of the key development outcomes of the reform program can be used as a
benchmark to asses the progress accomplished.

34.      While policy measures and development outcomes under PRSC 4 can be documented in
detail, their exhaustive description would make this Program Document too long. Instead, an
exhaustive list is provided under the form o f an overview o f policy actions, organized according
to the three pillars o f the CPRGS (see Table 5). In practice, all of the items under the PRSC 4
column o f this overview table represent prior actions, in the sense that they have already been
accomplished. But only a critically important subset o f them, highlighted in bold characters in
the overview table, is detailedinthe DevelopmentCredit Agreement (DCA). Such critical subset
i s reproduced, using the same language as in the DCA, in the Policy Matrix (see Appendix 2).
This section briefly describes thejoint expected contribution o fthe prior actions by sector, rather
than detailingthe individual content and nature o f each action.



A.       Transitionto a MarketEconomy

35.      Strong progress on multilateral and bilateral negotiations has boosted the chances
of WTO accession by end-2005. Key milestones in this process have been the discussion o f a
full Draft Working Party Report in December 2004, and the conclusion of a bilateral agreement
with the EU. Vietnam has also agreedto comply with the sometimes controversial Trade-related
aspects o f intellectual property (TRIPS) and trade-related investment measures (TRIMS)
 agreements upon accession. A major challenge that Vietnam faces in meeting commitments
relates to the very wide ranging legal amendments.              The determination to fulfill these
 requirements is reflected in the unprecedented number o f laws the National Assembly has on its
 agenda.   Some o f these laws have been brought forward in order to be completed before
 December 2005, crucial ones being the new enterprise law and the common investment law. In
 addition, a law on international treaties establishes the prevalence of the international treaties to
 which Vietnam is a party, including WTO agreements, over domestic legislation in case the two
 are inconflict.

36.      Vietnam has committed to complywith the WTO's SPS agreement from the date of
accession. As part o f the commitment, a national SPS notification body and EnquiryPoint has
been established to facilitate communication both between Vietnam and outsiders and among
Vietnamese agencies involved in SPS. The Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD) has been appointed the focal agency in this process. An action plan is also being
developed that goes beyond the shorter-run WTO requirement. This plan will address SPS, food
safety, and agricultural health issues inthe medium-term. Its aim is to facilitate the exploitation
of new export opportunities in agriculture and fisheries, as well as to protect Vietnam from cross-
border disease-related and pests-related threats inthese areas.

37.      A new law will reorient Customs towards a philosophy of trade facilitation rather
than control. The present law bases customsprocessing on physical inspectionof goods and the
lodgement o f manual documents. The law submitted to the National Assembly in May 2005 will
introduce an electronic environment for interactions between traders and customs.             It will
engender self-assessment by traders o f their liabilities to customs. Customs will move towards a
system o f risk management that minimizes physical inspections, and relies more on post-
clearance verifications and audits.

38.      The way for equitization of large SOEs has been cleared, and a few of those
equitizations have already taken place. Until recently the reform o f large SOEs, including
GCs, had focused on making them more competitive rather than equitizing them. InMarch 2004,
the Prime Minister signaled a policy change and directed legal revisions to permit the equitization
of large SOEs. The promulgation o f Decision 155 i s key in this regard. The earlier Decision
58/2002/QD-TTg had stipulated that in many industries and sectors where SOEs operate, state
share holding was to remain at 100 percent. The list i s now much shorter and, arguably, i s
restricted to sectors that are truly strategic. In addition the list o f activities where at least 50
percent state ownership i s to be maintained has been shortened. Under Decision 58, this latter
restriction had served to limit the numbers of shares that could be sold to outsiders in
equitizations.

39.      The significance o f Decision 155 extends beyond the equitization o f large SOEs. In2003
every line ministry, government agency, province and GC drew up an equitization list defined
according to the criteria in Decision 58. These were the so-called 104 restructuring plans that
were approved by the Prime Minister, to serve as the basis for the equitization process over the
following three years. The necessaryrevision of all these plans in light o f Decision 155 will lead
to the divestiture o f many more SOEs, including large ones. A preliminary count indicates that
736 SOEs would have to be added to the 2400 that had been singled out for equitization, sale or
liquidation in the so-called 104 restructuring plans. Also SOEs whose equitization has already
been approved are being examined again as the proportion o f shares to be sold may now increase.

40.      Key changes were introduced to the procedures guiding the equitization of SOEs.
Decree 187/2004/ND-CP defines the responsibilities o f SOE managers in financial settlement,
and stipulates the transfer of assets and debts not included in enterprise valuation to the Debt and
Asset Trading Company (DATC). The decree mandates the employment o f outside agencies to
carry out valuations, and makes land valuation consistent with the new Land Law. It extends the
ability o f strategic investors and other outsiders to buy shares, and links share prices to market
value determined by auctions. The decree also provides clearer guidelines on how sales proceeds
are to be used: for severance benefits, to support retraining, and for the remainder to be
transferred to MOF.




                                                 23

41.      The conversion of GCs into Holding Companies should greatly strengthen their
management. As defined in Decree 153/2004/2004/ND-CP a Holding Company in Vietnam is
not a large entity involved in a wide variety o f industries. Converting into a Holding Company
rather involves the corporatization o f entities whose activities are largely restricted to one sector.
The GC structure o f Vietnam is unique. GCs do not control the SOEs in their clusters through
ownership of equity in the manner that conventional limited liability companies own their
subsidiaries. This has resulted in the performance o f GCs being sub-optimal in terms o f their
ability to drive sector growth and competitiveness. Decree 153 is designed so that a "mother" GC
can exercise appropriate management control over its "children" companies. In the future, this
rationalization o f the structure should make it easier to equitize whole GCs, including their
children companies.

42.      The announced separation of SBV's management of SOCBs from its supervision
functions signals a breakthroughin banking sector reform. This announcement is based on
the inputs prepared by SBV for the preparation o f the next SEDP. The SBV submission i s
currently under consideration by the Politburo, which i s expected to endorse most if not all o f it.
Through a separate document, the government has confirmedthe non-controversial aspectso f this
submission. They include the development o f new laws on SBV and Credit Institutions, to be
passed in 2008 based on WTO requirements and Base1 core principles. This document also
envisages the transformationof the SBV into a modern central bank, charged with the conduct o f
market-based monetary policy and financial sector supervision. The commercial orientation and
autonomy o f SOCBs i s another key objective o f the reform. The equitization o f all SOCBs is
seen as an important step inthat direction.

43.      A new regulationon asset classificationand loan-loss provisioningfor banks follows
good internationalpractices. The regulation includes a mandatory classification o f debt based
on repayment status into five categories, with associated specific provisioning ratios. Banks will
also have to apply a qualitative risk-based classification o f debts using internal credit rating
systems which need to be approved by SBV. Initially banks will have the option to defer the
qualitative risk-based classification, but they must have implementedit after three years. The
regulation representsa significant improvement over the use o f VAS and will enhance the overall
evaluation o f asset quality in the banks, as well as ensure appropriate provisioning for potential
losses. All banks will have to produce their first reports based on the new classification by June
2005, and submit the corresponding NPL resolution plans shortly after. Staff have had access to a
preliminary estimate o f NPLs based on the new regulation, and can confirm that it leads to
plausible figures overall, much inline with independent IAS audits o f the SOCBs.

44.      A new framework for the regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions
(MFIs) has been developed. Decree 28/2005/ND-CP will be implemented by the SBV and it
represents a significant step forward in improving their governance. Thus far there has not been
any formal regulation in this area despite the existence of a wide variety o f organizations that
provide financial services. Decree 28 defines MFIs and will provide for the licensing and
supervision of the institutions based on specific criteria in areas such as capital, corporate
governance, and business plans. It allows the MFIs to expand operations on a uniform basis
across the country and will allow for the provision o f a range o f basic financial services,
depending on the type o f license granted. The supervisionof the MFIs i s not as strict as for banks
as the institutions are much smaller in scale and therefore should not have to contend with the
relatively complex regulations that apply to banks.

45.      The Electricity Law passed by the National Assembly in November 2004 will
facilitate the restructuring of the power sector, including the separation o f generation,


                                                  24

transmission and distribution. It will also allow for greater diversity o f ownership and financing
o f power sector assets, as well as create the conditions for greater competition inthe power sector
generation and supply markets in the longer term. The law foresees the establishment of an
electricity regulator to ensure more transparent oversight of existingoperators and new operators,
as well as evaluate electricity tariffs, investment, quality of service and operation.




B.       Social Inclusion and Environmental Sustainability

46.      In education, concern for quality has taken centre stage as strategies to improve
access and equity are being implemented. A standards-based approach is being employed to
upgrade quality. FSQL standards for primary schools have been adopted nationwide. They refer
to physical infrastructure, teaching staff, school organization and management, social
participation ineducation, educational activities and quality, and expected educational outcomes.
A survey covering all districts has been conducted to assess audit the current situation relative to
the standards. Typically, it is schools inpoorer zones that fall far short. To ensure equity, poorer
zones have been givenpriority inupgrading quality.

47.      Low teaching skills and content knowledge are major constraints for enhancing student
achievement, as demonstrated by a recent study o f academic performance at the end o f the
primary school cycle. These constraints are being addressedthrough the introduction o f a clear
teacher profile as an assessment tool to improve teaching competencies, to guide professional
development, and to set up a remuneration-related grading system. The teacher profile consists o f
three dimensions (attitudes, knowledge and pedagogical skill) defined through four levels o f
competency (beginning, regular, senior and lead).            The profile has been refined through
stakeholder consultation and a trial application with 2,200 teachers. By now 25,000 primary
school teachers (or 7 percent o fthe total) have been evaluated against the new profile.

48.      Recent legal changeswill promote and safeguard poor people's access to forest land
and forest resources as a source of livelihood. State Forestry Enterprises (SFEs) currently
control 40 percent o fthe 11million hectares o f land classified as forested, which are often located
in the poorest parts of the country. SFEs generally have contracted-out all forest management
activities to local households. But because tenure security is weak and arrangements lack clarity,
the local population benefits only marginally from forestry activities. A clear separation between
the public service provision role o f SFEs and their business activities i s needed to improve the
well-being of those whose livelihoods depend on forest land and to enhance conservation.
Decree 200/2004/ND-CP on the restructuring o f SFEs provides criteria for their transformation
 into either commercially viable wood businessesor effective public service entities, in particular,
for forest protection. In the process, LUCs for remaining under-used land and scattered forest
 land will be transferred to households, communities and other users, including private sector
enterprises.

49.       The revised Law on Forest Protection and Development approved by the National
Assembly inNovember 2004, provides the overall framework for the move towards more social
 and community-based forestry. For the first time, it recognizes the forest use right o f households,
 communities and other sectors as well as their ownership o f plantation forest. It provides a
 framework for the multiple-use o f the vast areas of protection forest in the uplands, and
 exploitation rights in these areas, which could lead to new management systems combining
 protection with production. The law provides terms and condition for the leasing o f production
 forest to economic units including farm households and proposes to assign an economic value to


                                                   25

each forest production area as the basis for its allocation or lease. In parallel, key stakeholders
have also started the consultation process to revise the Forest Sector Strategy, which is expected
to produce a long-term broad positive impact not only on poverty reduction but also on
sustainable management o f forest, land, water and environment inupland areas.

50.      The foundations for an effective set of policies, tools and incentives for
environmentalprotection are being laid out. Vietnam's development over the last decade has
created sustainability challenges that are not appropriately addressed by the existing legislation.
The amendments to the Law on Environmental Protection, submittedto the National Assembly in
May 2005, should lead to improvements in two main areas. First, they clarify line ministries'
responsibilities for environmental protection and decentralize responsibilities within the Ministry
o f Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) to its departments at the local and regional
levels. Second, they enable new policy tools and remedies for various environmental issues such
as pollution prevention and cleanup, adjustments to cover the private sector, improvements in
financial mechanisms for environmental protection, and initiatives for raising public awareness
and support for environmentalprotection.

51.      Guidelines for the implementation of the Land Law represent a key step in
strengthening land registration and landvaluation. Under the new Law the issuanceo f LUCs
has been decentralized to district and provincial governments, and a unified system o f land
administration agencies is to be setup. Decree 181/2004/ND-CP covers these aspects. It also
addresses zoning issues, with the requirement that provinces submit their complete land-use plans
in 2005. The recalling of unusedor inappropriately used land is assigned to provincial People's
Committees.     Decree 188/2004/ND-CP provides guidelines in the crucial area of valuation,
serving as the basis to calculate taxes on LUC transfers, and to set the value o f LUCs and rents
when the government decides to lease or allocate land to businesses. The system will also be
used to define the value of LUCs for compensation claims when the government withdraws land.
The new valuation system is much more flexible than the previous one and will be adjusted in
accordance with changing market values. The previous mechanism often fixed land prices at
much lower rates than their market value, resulting in residents being reluctant to move out o f
construction areas becauseo f low resettlement packages.



C.       BuildingModernGovernance

52.      The preparation of the 2006-2010 SEDP provides an opportunity to strengthen
nationaland provincialplanning. Directive 33 instructs that CPRGS principles be incorporated
into the SEDP. Not only does this bode well for modernizing planning at the national level, but it
also holds that promise for provincial plans.       Over the last two years, 20 provinces have
experimented with the preparation o f strategic plans, inthe context o f a donor-supported initiative
to "roll out" CPRGS to sub-national levels. Based on the experience and lessons learnt from the
on-going process, the Ministry o f Planning and Investment (MPI) has proposed to scale up the
roll-out process in all provinces and cities in Vietnam. Because o f the ongoing decentralization
process, local governments will play an increasingly important role in attaining national
development goals. Roughly half of budget spending is now under the control o f provinces,
districts and communes. The success o f decentralization in Vietnam, and the ability to keep
 development inclusive, will crucially depend on the ability o f local governments to embrace
 strategic planning, leading to sound policy choices, supported by commensurate budget
 allocations, and monitoredthrough an appropriate set of provincial-level development indicators.



                                                26

53.      Disclosure requirementsfor the state budget at all levels, as well as for entities using
state budget resources, have been considerably strengthened. The regulation is applicable to
funds financed by state budget resources, such as DAF, Vietnam Social Security, provincial
investment funds, SOEs, and organizations financed by contributions from the public. Under the
regulation allocation norms approved by the National Assembly and the People's Councils must
be publicized at each budget level. Organizations funded from the state budget must disclose
their state budget support, budget plans and final accounts, and the methods used to determine
their state budget support. For state capital investment projects, annual budget allocations, budget
plans, final accounts and biddingresults for procurements must be disclosed. Funds financed by
the state budget must make public their charters, financial arrangements, annual financial plan
and operational performance. For SOEs, mandatory disclosure includes their financial position,
operational performance, provision for and use o f welfare funds, remittances to the state budget,
per employee income and return on state equity. Methods o f disclosure include announcements
at public meetings, printeddocuments, posting at offices and websites, and publicity through the
mass media.     Ministries and Provincial People's Committees are responsible for monitoring
compliance o f their subordinate bodies. There i s a normal requirement to respond to questions
regarding disclosures within10 days.

54.      The launching o f a comprehensive assessment o f the fiscal risks associated with SOEs,
SOCBs and DAF signals the intention o f the Government to venture into a more active
management of assets and liabilities. Much of the focus has been so far on estimating the share
of NPLs in the portfolios of commercial banks and policy-lending institutions. A somewhat
implicit assumption i s that the delinquent debtors, most o f them SOEs, do not'have the ability to
repay their debts. However, not servicing the debts is not the same as not making profits. More
importantly, most o f the delinquent SOEs are sittingon prime land, whose sale or lease could be
an important source of revenue.

55.      The newly acquired independence of SAV, which is now an agency established
under the National Assembly, is a milestone for transparency. The SAV law approved in
May, 2005, gives the NationalAssembly the authority to appoint, and if necessaryto dismiss, the
auditor general. SAV reports that have been approved by the National Assembly will be publicly
disclosed through several channels, including the Official Gazette, the SAV website, and mass
media. This is in sharp contrast with the situation that prevailed previously, when audit findings
are not made public except with government authorization.            In this context of increased
transparency, the audit of the financial statements o f SBV for the year 2003 was launched in
April 2004, and it is the intention of the government to submit a copy of the audit report to the
National Assembly after its completion.

56.      The move towards increased transparency is also reflected in the emerging
approach towards fighting corruption. The appointment o f GI as the leading agency for the
preparation of a new anti-corruption strategy has been associated with an invitation to donors to
cooperate with its implementation. Previous efforts to curb corruption had focused on punitive
measures, rather than on rigorous diagnoses and systemic remedies. It took years to launch the
first comprehensive study on the modalities and mechanisms o f corruption inVietnam, with little
 information about this study being filtered to outsiders. Insharp contrast with such approach, the
findings of pilot surveys in seven cities are beingbrought to the mid-2005 informal CG meeting
for discussion with donors, jointly with a framework to ask for support with key components of
the emerging anti-corruption approach.        A call to the media to be more proactive in the
 investigation and reporting o f corrupt acts suggests that transparency is seen indeed as an
 important component o f the new approach.



                                                 27

57.     The criteria for measuring poverty have been brought into line with international
standards. Based on the recommendations of a task force led by the Ministryo f Labor, Invalids
and Social Affairs (MOLISA) and GSO an expenditure-based poverty line will be estimated
usingGSO's Vietnam HouseholdLiving Standard Survey (VHLSS). This line consists o f a food
component, which is the value o f a "typical" basket of food items inVietnam that provides 2100
calories per person per day, and a non-food component. The latter is the value o f a set o f basic
non-food items that are typically consumed by those people whose food expenditures are around
the food poverty line. The earlier method combined a participatory approach with a rudimentary
survey to estimate household incomes of those generally considered poor. The participatory
approach consisted o fvillage-level consultations to classify households accordingto their poverty
status. While this method accurately identified the poorest of the poor households it did not
necessarily identify all the poor. The methodology was inconsistently applied across provinces
and was subject to manipulation by provinces who wished to report faster progress.



D.      Triggers for PRSC 5

58.     The overview o f policy actions in Table 5 lists a series of measures that will in principle
be supported by PRSC 5. These actions are reported not as conditions, but rather to describe the
direction of reforms and expected follow-up in each ofthe sectors. A subset o f key policy actions
expected under PRSC 5, highlighted in bold, will serve as triggers to launch the preparation of
that operation(the triggers are reproduced for convenience inAppendix 3).

59.     A new Intellectual Property Law will be issued, in line with WTO requirements. A
number of Vietnam's trading partners have identified strengthening the protection o f intellectual
property as a key factor for enhancing trade and investment relations. Vietnam has stated that it
will be in compliance with the TRIPSagreement o f the WTO upon accession. While the WTO
requirements could be met through amending existing pieces of legislation, this has the
disadvantage of scattering the changes over many legal documents. The preferable alternative i s
to issue a new intellectual property law that meets WTO requirements. The passage o f such as
law is onthe fall 2005 agenda o fthe National Assembly.

60.     SOEs will be classified according to their performance, and the results of this
classificationwill be disclosed. Decision 271/2003/QD-TTg set up a mechanism to monitor
SOE performance and applying sanctions inthe case o f consistently poor performance. SOEs are
to be classified into one of three groups (A, B, or C) based on indicators including earnings,
returns on state equity, and the ability to service debts.   Enterprises that are graded C for two
consecutive years are in principle subject to reorganization, including changes in management.
However, few SOEs have complied so far with the reporting requirements under Decision 271
and government agencies in charge have not made serious efforts to ensure compliance. MOF
has recently agreedto speed up the classification process and to produce a first classification, for
SOEs reportingto line ministries and GCs, within one year.

61.     A comprehensive roadmap for the reform of the banking sector will be released.
The recent submission o f the SBV for the preparation o f the SEDP bears the promise o f a
substantial acceleration of banking reform. But for this promise to materialize, the submission
needs to be translated into a clear, time-bound set o f policy actions, with responsibilities assigned
accordingly.   The recent decision to classify all banking loans based on IAS is already an


                                                28

indication o f the determination o f the government to fully disclose the magnitude o f the problems
faced by SOCBs, as a first step towards resolving them. However, the timingand sequence o fthe
actions to be undertaken inthis respect i s still unclear. The government has been encouraged to
seek donor assistance as needed in the preparation o f this roadmap, and to produce a first draft in
time for the Consultative Group (CG) meetingo f government and donors scheduled to take place
at the end o f 2005.

62.      A Unified Enterprise Law will be issued, paving the way for equal treatment for
firms, regardlessof ownership. The current enterprise law applies only to the domestic private
sector. Under the new law, scheduled to be passed in October 2005, both private domestic
enterprises and foreign invested enterprises will be governed by the same legislation. Foreign
enterprises will be subject to the same registration procedures as domestic firms, and will be able
to choose the form o f corporate entity that is most suitable on business grounds. At present, they
are only allowed to operate as limited liability companies. Foreign enterprises will be allowed to
restructure, expand, or diversify their business rather than being limited to the specific lines in
which their business was initiated. The ownership cap o f 30 percent i s proposed to be removed
for most business lines. On the other hand, the coverage o f SOEs by the new law has been an
area of debate. According to the draft law, only those SOEs that convert tojoint stock companies
or single member limited liability companies will be covered. Thus, the extent to which the
unified law will be successful in creating a level playing field will depend upon the extent to
which SOEs will convert to the covered forms. The unified law must present sensible business
benefits for SOEs to convert.         Which will happen if it succeeds in providing them with
significantly  greater autonomy in defining their business strategies, and making investment and
personnel-related decisions. At present business decisions are directed by line ministries or
provinces, often in inconsistent ways.

63.      Formulate an appropriate regulatory framework for provincial infrastructure
funds. Confronted with enormous needs in terms o f infrastructure development, more than a
dozen provinces have already established provincial funds, in charge o f raising resources and
channeling towards selected projects.         These funds offer the prospect to support private
participation in the provision o f infrastructure services. They could also provide an opportunity
to move from "retail" to "wholesale" in the funding o f local infrastructure development by
bilateral and multilateral donors. However, the existing funds still have serious shortcomings in
terms o f transparency and rules o f operation, which are reminiscent o f the situation o f DAF until
quite recently. Before contingent liabilities start buildingup, and before donors start considering
the use of these funds to channel their resources, a sounder regulatory framework is needed. An
 in-depthstudy o ftwo ofthese funds is currently under way. Over the next year, it should leadto
clear recommendations regardingtheir appropriate regulation.

 64.     Issue regulations for inclusive education for children with disabilities.                  The
 government i s preparing an integrated set o f national guidelines for inclusive educationto ensure
that disabled children have access to education services. The guidelines will be informed by
 analyses o f issues that disabled children face, a profile o f their educational needs, and the barriers
they face incompleting primary education. They will also addressthe needs and constraints faced
 byprimary schools that attempt to adopt an inclusive education policy. It is also expectedthat the
 guidelines will recommend an organizational structure to support the needs o f disabled children.
 Preparation of these guidelines involves a number o f ministries such as MOET, MOH, and
 MOLISA, and agencies dealingwith childprotection and is thus a complex coordinationtask.

 65.      Strengthen the regulations for the management of provincial HCFPs. The creation
 o f provincial HCFPs was a breakthrough in terms o f providing resources for health care to the


                                                   29

poor, and gradually shiftingfrom the direct fundingof health care providers to reliance on health
insurance. In practice, however, the allocation per beneficiary has been insufficient to cover the
health insurance premium, and most provinces have continued to rely on the direct funding o f
providers.    To address these deficiencies, the government will make the insurance option
mandatory after some time, and will increase the amount o f resources available to HCFPs
accordingly. A substantial increase in funding is also needed in light o f the new criteria for the
measurement o f poverty, which should considerably expand the size o f the beneficiary
population. To keep costs under control, a change in targeting rules o f the benefits will be
introduced, whereby all beneficiaries will be identified on a household basis. At present, all
households ina commune supported by specific targetedpoverty alleviation programs are entitled
to the benefit, even ifthey are not poor.

66.      Set up provincialland registrationoffices in compliancewith the 2003 Land Law. A
major shortcoming o f land management in Vietnam has been the lack of an effective land
registration system. One of the significant changes introducedby the new Land Law is to address
this deficiency through the creation of LUC registrationoffices. These offices are to be set up at
the provincial level and, if deemed necessary, at district level as well. They will be responsible
for registering all land transactions, managing land files, and carrying out land-related
administrative formalities.    Decree 181 empowers the LUC registration offices to provide
information on land to any land user.        This will ensure not only transparency but also that
information on land is accessible to all users. The expectation i s that all offices at the provincial
level will be set up by the end o f 2005.

67.      Assign institutional responsibilities to implement the National Rural Water and
Sanitationstrategy. Progress in service provision at the rural level has been hampered by the
internal organization issues in MARD. At present, the responsibility for rural water supply i s in
the hands o f the Department o f Irrigation, which specializes in spatial planning but not in service
provision. A more effective implementation o f the strategy requires that the responsibility be
shifted to the Department for Cooperatives and Rural Development, which has the mandate and
the expertise to improve service delivery. While this trigger might seem an administrative
reorganization, completing this action i s not straightforward.      This is because the change in
assignments needsto take place not only at the central level, but also ineach o f the provinces, and
requires the involvement o f the corresponding People's Committees.

68.      Develop economic, administrative and information tools for environmental
 protection. The legal framework for a better management o f environmental impacts is gradually
being set up inVietnam. But the tools to actually influence decisions that affect the environment
are still rudimentary. An Environment Fund is already in place, but it is not fully functional.
Waste water fees have been introduced at the local level, as well as fines on the worst polluters.
But a more integrated approach is still needed.           It should include taxes to reflect social
externalities in the exploitation o f fisheries, forests, mineral resources and water resources. It
 should also include the issuance and enforcement of discharge permits, and a more clear
 differentiation between the disposal o f hazardous and regular waste. An effective information
 system i s neededto guide the use o f these tools.

 69.     Issue SEDP based on broad consultation, with a poverty focus and appropriate
 monitoringtools. Inconformity with the new approach to planning, the SEDP is expected to be
 organized around national priorities for economic growth, poverty reduction and social
 development. This involves a move away from setting out production and investment targets,
towards relying on VDGs and other development outcomes as motivators for public action. It
 also involves assessing the link between government policies and development outcomes,


                                                  30

spellingout the changes in people's lives the SEDP is tryingto achieve as motivators for public
action. The SEDP i s also expected to be built on extensive consultations within government but
also with a broader range o f stakeholders (including mass organizations, academics, the private
sector, civil society and development partners). Identifyingthe most appropriate policy actions to
attain the desired development outcomes i s only a first step. The SEDP should thus serve as a
framework to allocate public resources over the medium term and, hopefully, as a mechanism to
align donor support to national priorities. Finally, the foundations of an effective monitoring and
evaluation system should be laid out inthe process.

70.     Requireall ministriesand provincesto prepareforward-lookingbudgets in support
of the SEDP. MOF is presently working on a key circular for the preparation o f the budget for
the year 2006. While the submission and approval of the budget by the National Assembly will
continue to be done on an annual basis, line ministriesand provincial governments will be asked
to prepare a budget framework for the period 2006-2010, based on the SEDP. The submission o f
the 2006 budget by each ministry and province should be coherent with such framework. The
reference to a five-year period should be conducive to a better integration between planning and
recurrent budgets. It should also help ministries and provinces to prepare more realistic plans, to
better prioritize their spending, and to improve the overall efficiency o f public expenditures.
After the budget circular i s issued, it is expectedthat MOF and MPI will issue detailed guidelines
to sector ministries and provinces. However, it is still unclear whether the circular would be
issued within the next twelve months. The trigger is thus focused on its preparation.

71.      Monitor service delivery, introduce user feedback and cap salaries in units under
Decree 10. By allowing service delivery units to charge fees, Decree 10/2002/ND-CP has
introduced powerful incentives to improve quality while substantially increasing the resources
available to such units. However, there are indications that the provision o f basic services to be
provided free o f charge, or at low prices established by government regulations, has suffered as a
result o f such incentives. Moreover, many service delivery units face limited competition at the
local level. Because Decree 10 gives them considerable flexibility to use revenue from fees to
pay higher salaries, there is also an incentive to charge excessively high prices for services.
Aware o f these problems, the government intends to strengthen the surveillance o f service
delivery units operating under Decree 10, relying on user feedback to assess the services
provided, and restrictingthe use of revenuefrom fees to raise salaries.

72.      Issue action plans for simplification and greater transparency of administrative
procedures. The government, through the Prime Minister's Directive 09/CT-TTg, has identified
these action plans as a key priority for all agencies at central and local levels in 2005. Particular
attention i s devoted to administrative services such as resident registration, land registration,
notary services, housing construction permits and business registration. These areas were
identified as problematic in a recent review. As the government fully recognizes the challenges
of reforming administrative procedures in practice, strong monitoring mechanisms are being
prepared to verify implementation.

73.      Issue an Anti-Corruption Law including denunciations and monitoring of assets.
This is a key component of the government's framework to increase the effectiveness of its anti-
corruption efforts. It i s clearly recognized that an Anti-Corruption Law is not a panacea. But it is
seen as a speedy, inexpensive way to start addressing the problem. The new Law is expected to
 include articles on asset declaration by high-ranking public servants, whistle-blowing and
denunciation, conflicts of interest, outlawing o f bribery and other related corruption crimes such
as embezzlement, fraud and illicit enrichment by public servants. To be effective, the law will
have to tailor enforcement regulations to the capacity and incentives o f the agencies that will be


                                                   31

incharge of its implementation. These agencies include the Government Inspectorate, the police
and the courts at all levels. The preparation of the Anti-Conuption Law i s informed by the
ongoing diagnostic assessment on corruption.



                          VI.    TIMINGAND IMPLEMENTATION



74.      The policy actionssupported through the PRSC processcan be seen as a distillation
of the CPRGS and other development strategies and plans, aimed at identifying a coherent
sequence o f key measures in each area over the medium term (see Figure 2). An important step
in this process was the preparation of the so-called Haiphong matrices, in October 2002. In a
consultation involving hundreds of stakeholders, comprehensive lists of policy actions were
discussed for each sector. The "expansion" o f CPRGS so as to appropriately address policies for
the development o f large-scale infrastructure was another important milestone. Further steps in
the process focused on identifying policy actions that were consistent with nationally-owned
development strategies and plans, sensible from an economic point of view, capable to make a
considerable difference inpractice, and concrete enough to be adopted and implemented within a
relatively short period of time. The choice of the set o f actions supported by each of the PRSC
operations is based on an ongoing policy dialogue with the government.

75.      The identificationof the policy actions needed to attain the development outcomes
spelled out in the CPRGS has been strongly influenced by analytical work carried out in
recent years, including the World Bank's analytical and advisory (AAA) program. The annual
Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs) have played a very important role in this respect. These
reports are prepared inpartnership between the World Bank and other donors, including many o f
those involved in the PRSC process. They also involve substantial inputs from Vietnamese
academicsand policy makers. VDRs serve to coordinate views on what the reform challenges are
and how to address them, and have a considerable impact on the policy debate and the research
agenda at the country level. The VDR 2003, completed shortly after the Haiphong consultation,
aimed to "translate" the CPRGS into a strategic direction for each of the policy areas covered by
the PRSC process. Subsequent VDRs, on Poverty, Governance and Business (the latter, under
preparation) address in more depth the challenges faced by Vietnam to keep development
inclusive, buildmodern institutions, and complete its transition to a market economy.

76.      The reform program supported by the current PRSC cycle covers a five-year
period, much the same as the CPRGS and the last SEDP. This is the reason why no further
operations beyond PRSC 5 were envisioned inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2003-
2006, or in its update. However, it is clear that Vietnam will still be confronted with challenging
reforms at the end o f the current five-year period. It is also clear that many o f the actions
supported by the PRSC process lend themselves quite naturally to follow-up measures in outer
years. As soon as the draft SEDP for 2006-2010 is completed, a new round o f analytical work
will aim at translating its development objectives and policy statements into a coherent sequence
of actions to be supported by the next PRSC cycle. The VDR 2007, to be produced in parallel
with the preparationo f PRSC 5, will articulate this vision, and serve as the analytical foundation
 for the policy dialogue inthe next period.

77.      There is also a strong synergy between PRSC operations and investment credits
which are processed in parallel. While PRSCs support the adoption o f significant policy
reforms, investment credits focus on their implementation, across a range of sectors. Some of
those credits, such as those for public financial management, payments system or customs
modernization, aim at strengthening the systems through which government operates, thus
making reforms effective in practice.        Other credits, like those for primary education for
disadvantaged children or forest sector development, provide the resources needed to deliver on
policy measures which could otherwise amount to declarations of intent. More generally, project
lendingand policy lendingare complementary inthis process.

78.      Lending under the PRSC process is aligned with the budget cycle, with operations
taking place annually and World Bank disbursements occurring towards the middle o f the
Vietnamese fiscal year. Disbursements by co-financiers take place in the weeks and months
following the approval o f each PRSC operation by the Board. CPRGS Progress Reports are
discussed at the CG Meetings in December o f every year. The associatedJoint Staff Assessment
(JSA), and now the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), provide feedback to the government on the
achievements and challenges inthe implementation of the reform agenda. The JSAN i s prepared
bythe World Bank and the IMF, but it involves consultation with the other donors supportingthe
PRSC process. The JSAN i s submitted to the Board ahead of the discussion o f each PRSC
operation. Jointly with the CPRGS Progress Report and the assessment o f the triggers, the JSAN
serves as the basis to determine whether to proceed with the preparation o f the following PRSC,
and whether to consider base-case or high-case lending.



                          VII.    POVERTY AND SOCIALIMPACTS



79.      A considerableamount ofanalyticalwork has been devotedin recentyears to assess
the social implicationsof the reform agenda supported by the PRSC process. This work has
focused on various aspects of such agenda, including the labor retrenchment associated with
SOEs restructuring, the development o f a land market, and increased integration with the global
economy. The work on labor retrenchment in SOEs was conducted as part o f the preparation for
PRSC 1, which provided support to the equitization process. The work on land stems from the
concern that some of the rapid gains in poverty reduction associated with the highly egalitarian
distribution of agricultural land to rural households in the early 1990s could unravel, were
adverse shocks to push farmers into landlessness. The work on global integration i s related to the
perception that it could accentuate income disparities between the skilled and the unskilled, as
well as across regions. While all these reforms have the potential to substantially enhance
efficiency, their side-effects interms o f redistributionwarrant closer examination.

80.      The analyses on the impact of job loss in SOEs led to the establishment of a well-
functioningsafety net for redundantworkers. Studies were conducted on the extent of over-
staffing in SOEs, using plant-level data, and on the expected earnings and welfare losses by
retrenched SOE workers, using household survey data. Attention was paid to the groups that
could in principle lose more from job separation, especially women. As a result o f this work, a
generous severance pay package was introduced in 2002, based on a formula that provides more
support, inrelative terms, to women than to men. The assistance scheme was also designed so as
to allow equitized SOEs to have access to it in the 12 months following divestiture, so as to
attract investors who could otherwise be deterred by the extent of over-staffing. The operation of


                                                   34

the safety net was evaluated in 2004, and a new tracer survey o f retrenched workers i s currently
going to the field. The 2004 evaluation focused on the employment status, earnings and well-
beingo f retrenched SOE workers assistedunder this program. It confirmed that the package had
been appropriately designed, as well-being had on average been preserved. The survey also
revealed that female workers and older workers were the groups with the highest satisfaction
levels.

81.     Work on the impactof the development of a land market is still ongoing. This work
makes extensive use o f household survey data to compare consumption levels o f ruralhouseholds
with and without land. The main methodological difficulty faced by this study is to distinguish
between households who have voluntarily sold their land, and moved on, and households who
sold their land under stress. While the first group i s expected to have improved its well-being, the
second one might have faced more difficulties escaping poverty, or staying out o f it.
Participatory poverty analyses conducted in 2004 suggest that land sales under stress are not
uncommon in the Mekong Delta. This is turn could fuel migration to HCMC and other cities in
the region, and be associatedwiththe development of urbanpoverty. The analysis onthe poverty
and social impacts o f the emergence o f a land market i s therefore complementary with analytical
work currently beingconducted on rural-urban migration. An important component o f this latter
work i s the processing o f the mid-term census o f HCMC, which has uncovered almost half a
million more rural-urbanmigrantsthan anticipated by GSO.

82.      While a large number of independent studies have been done on the impacts of
integrationwith the world economy, a better coordinated approach is now emerging. The
studies undertaken so far include simulations of trade liberalization based on computable general
equilibrium models, some of them supplemented by detailed assessments o f the consequences on
households with different characteristics. Other studies undertaken so far evaluate the impacts o f
specific policies such as the removal o f export subsidies on specific sectors of activity. Yet
others estimate the consequences o f changes in key prices on household well-being, using
microeconomic data. While interestingand informative on their own, these studies fail to provide
a coherent picture o fwhat the overall impacts o f WTO accession could be for Vietnam. Aware o f
the need to supplement the international integration agenda by appropriate measures at the
domestic level, the government has requested the Vietnamese Academy o f Social Sciences
(VASS) to take the lead inthe evaluation o fthe economic and social impactso fWTO accession.

 83.     Work on the impacts of WTO accession will be conducted in parallel with the
 preparationof the next poverty assessment, and in time to inform the next SEDP. VASS,
the largest institution conducting policy-oriented analysis in Vietnam, already has an extensive
trajectory in doing WTO-related work. During the critical period o f the WTO accession that
 started in mid-2003, VASS coordinated all the studies needed to inform the multilateral and
bilateral negotiations, inclose collaboration with the World Bank. VASS was also one o f the key
 domestic counterparts inthe preparation o f the VDR 2004, on Poverty, jointly with various other
 government agencies and think tanks. As the VHLSS 2004 becomes available, VASS will be
 coordinating the work o f the same group o f agencies and think tanks to produce the next poverty
 assessment, this time with donors in a supporting role. Preliminary results on poverty, and on the
 economic and social impacts of WTO accession, will be delivered in time to influence the final
 stages of the preparation of the SEDP.

                             VIII. OTHER CREDITFEATURES



A.       Steeringand Monitoring

84.      The National Steering Committee (NSC) for the implementationof the CPRGS and
PRSCs was established in 2002. It is chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung, and bringstogether the heads of all the relevant line ministriesand government agencies.
SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in close collaboration with the World Bank, for
preparation and implementation of PRSCs. A Deputy Governor of SBV acts as Standing Vice
Chairman o f NSC. This quasi-advisory body has several representatives from key economic
ministries and agencies, such as MOF, the Ministryof Trade (MOT), SBV, the Ministryof Labor,
Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA), the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Ministry o f
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET)
and the Ministryof Health (MOH), among others. Members of the NSC thus have authority over
the entire range of policy areas covered by the PRSC process. The participation o f the Office o f
the Government (OOG) andthe Party's Economic Commission (PEC) inthe NSC also allow for a
better coordination of policy decisions, and to elicit sufficient support for the most critical
reforms. Representatives from a total o f 24 lines ministries and government agencies participated
inthe preparationofthe proposed credit.

85.      Given the intensive and complex coordination that is required to manage this very
comprehensive reform program, SBV has created a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) with
dedicated staff from SBV. The PCU has helped facilitate the policy dialogue o f the World Bank
and donors with line ministries. It will be funded by co-financiers over the PRSC cycle. The
Department for International Development (DFID) has already agreed to provide financial
support duringthe preparation of PRSC 4 and 5.

86.      An inter-ministerial working group and a secretariat to implement and monitor the
CPRGS have also been established at MPI. The inter-ministerial working group includes
representatives from key economic ministries, such as MOF, MOT, SBV, OOG, PEC, MOLISA,
MOJ, MARD, MOET, and MOH, among others.                   Two Annual Progress Reports on the
implementation of the CPRGS have been prepared by the CPRGS secretariat under the guidance
o f the inter-ministerial working group. Among the goals o f the inter-ministerial working group is
the implementation of CPRGS at sub-national levels. The CPRGS Secretariat at MPI supports
provincial governments inadapting the CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans and
budgetsaccordingly. Since 2003, 20 provinces have initiated this process, with financial support
from donors. The decision to integrate the CPRGS approach into the preparation o f the next
SEDP at all levels amounts to scaling up the process nationwide, this time under clear planning
guidelines from MPI.

87.      The use of reliableinformationand analysis in policy makinghas improvedsteadily
over the PRSC process. Over the first three PRSCs, the government has made efforts to
improve the quality of data that can be used for monitoring PRSC outcomes. This fourth PRSC
continues to build on this experience. Key sources o f monitoring information for poverty and
program outcomes include the biennial VHLSSs, periodic participatory poverty assessments and
local consultations, enterprise surveys, public expenditure tracking surveys, as well as the
progress reports from the relevant sector ministries and committees implementing the reform
program. Inaddition, the strengthening o f management information systems for SOEs and for all
public spending, both led by MOF, i s an integral part of the PRSC program. Efforts to implement


                                                36

CPRGS at the provincial level rely on the development o f appropriate monitoring indicators as
well. While the number o f indicators presented in the CPRGS is much larger, these have been
reduced to about forty for monitoring PRSC outcomes at the provincial level. Many of the
indicators inthis narrower set will be generatedusingthe household living standard surveys to be
conducted biennially from 2002 onwards. At present, agreement is being reached on the set o f
indicators neededto monitor progress inthe implementation ofthe next SEDP.



B.      Administration

88.     Borrower and Credit Amount. The Borrower is the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and
this operation is a one-tranche Credit ofUS$ 100millionequivalent that would bemade available
upon credit effectiveness.

89.     Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The Credit will follow the
International Development Association (IDA) disbursement procedures for development policy
lendingoperations, and the Credit proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated
release conditions. Various measureshave been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies
and institutions are adequate to proceed with support from IDA and other development partners.
The analytical underpinnings for the operation are largely complete: (i)the cross-cutting
assessment o f the country's development policies (social, structural and sectoral) covering the
policy reforms and institutional development priorities for sustainable growth and poverty
reduction has been discussed with the government in a number o f recent joint reports; (ii)an
assessment o f the country financial accountability arrangements has been made in the PER-IFA,
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR). Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will have to be satisfied.

90.      Deposit Account. The Borrower will open and maintain in SBV a dedicated Deposit
Account in U S dollars for the Borrower's use once the Credit is approved by the Board. If after
deposit in the Deposit Account the proceeds o f the Credit or any part thereof are used for
ineligible purposes, as defined in the DCA, the Bank will require the Borrower to either return
that amount to the Deposit Account to be usedfor eligible purposes, or refundthe amount directly
to IDA.

91.      Through SBV, the Borrower will: (1) report the exact sum received into the Deposit
Account; (ii) insure that all withdrawal are for "eligible" expenditures; (ii)
                                                                             indicate to IDA details
o f the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese Dong equivalent o f the Credit proceeds will be
credited; (iv) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for the Deposit Account. These
processes and controls are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their
intended destination and are being used for their intended purposes, and are subject to the
Borrower's rules and regulations.

92.      CountryFinancialAccountability Assessment. The CFAA on Vietnam, completed in
2001, concluded that the public financial management system then represented some level of
fiduciary risk. Since 2001, a large number o f recommendations of the CFAA have been
implemented, or are in the process o f being implemented. The recent PER-IFA provided for an
update of the CFAA. It reviewed the accounting and reporting processes in the public sector, the
oversight functions inthe public sector, and financial reporting and auditing in SOEs. The PER-
IFA recognizes the recent changes to improve transparency and accountability in Vietnam.

Among the most recent ones is the new audit law passedby the National Assembly inMay 2005.
This law will significantly enhance oversight by the National Assembly and the provincial
People's Councils over public finances and substantially increase public access to information on
government finances. The data management, financial reporting, and internal control system o f
the SBV are also expected to be further improved through a planned IDA credit, in FY06. The
implementation o f the Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS) to
support establishment of an integrated financial management system inVietnam is also expected
to improve financial management in the public sector over time.         The PER-IFA identifies,
however, a large agenda for improvement. The key areas include, strengthening the effectiveness
o f the SAV, streamlining the internal control framework, and adopting international public sector
accounting standards. The implementation of the PER-IFA recommendations is being supported
bythe PRSC programand grant funds.

93.      Public Procurement. Nationwide open competitive bidding in public procurement was
introduced in 1996. This systemwas improved in 1999, by the introduction o f the concept o f the
"responsive lowest evaluated bid." Decree 66/2003/CP, adopted under PRSC 3, established a
department o f public procurement and strengthened the procurement process by mandating
standard bidding documents for procurement o f goods. These documents are expected to be
issued soon.     Standard bidding documents will promote consistency in the application o f
procurement regulations.    The government also put into use the paper version of a Public
Procurement Bulletin, and the contract for the establishment of an e-procurement bulletin i s
expected to be awarded shortly. A 10th draft o f the proposed Procurement Ordinance has been
prepared by MPI and sent to the government for comments, and has also been included in this
year's agenda o f the National Assembly's Standing Committee. The Ordinance, once passed, will
help consolidate the fragmented legal framework for procurement inVietnam. The government
has indicated its strong concern about corruption, and has instructedthe GI to design a new and
more effective anti-corruption strategy. The CPAR completed in 2002 lays out the needs for
capacity buildingover the coming years inpublic procurement.

94.      EnvironmentalAspects. The proposed PRSC 4 supports a number o f diverse reform
and policy activities and some o f them may cause significant effects (both positive and negative)
on Vietnam's environment, forests and other natural resources. Initiatives inprivate sector reform,
SOE reform, trade integration, and public sector management have potential implications for
environmental quality as well as Government's capacity to address future environmental risks.
As part of Development Policy Lending, the PRSC 4 is subject to OP 8.60, which requires that
country policies with likely significant effects be assessed based on relevant country-level or
sectoral environmental analysis. If significant gaps in the analysis or shortcomings in the
borrower's systems are identified, the program document describes how gaps and shortcomings
are to be addressed.

95.      Vietnam has shown strong, pro-poor economic growth, but with weak attention to its
environmental sustainability. To continuously support Vietnam in its efforts to improve
environmental sustainability, environmental objectives have been steadily mainstreamed in the
PRSC process. For example, natural resources management is being addressed in this and
previous PRSCs, particularly as it relates to the adoption and implementation o f a legal
framework for new forest use rights of households and communities and the transfer o f small-
 scale irrigation systems to water user groups, and the establishment of integrated river basin
management in Vietnam. Improving environmental management is also addressed in this and
previous PRSCs, particularly as it relates to advances in environmental assessment procedures,
regulations that address pollution control (on "polluter pays" fees and regulations on pollution
hotspots) and the conservation and sustainable use o f wetlands and amendment to the Law on


                                                 38

Environmental Protection. The proposed amended Law on Environmental Protection, submitted
to the National Assembly in the last year contains wide ranging improvements in environmental
management inVietnam, among them new policytools and remedies for pollution preventionand
cleanup and adjustments to cover the private sector, improved financial mechanisms for
environmental protection, and raising public awarenessand support for environmental protection.

96.      The proposed credit recognizes the links between of some of its proposed measures and
environmental, forests, and other natural resource aspects, and hence has as one o f its pillars
inclusive and sustainable development, through which it aims to address social inclusion and
environmental sustainability in an integrativeway. The Government o f Vietnam i s undertaking a
substantive    program of environmental capacity            building, institutional strengthening,
environmental and land use planning as well as physical investment projects addressing
environmental issues. Donor assistance to Vietnam is strong in these areas, particularly for the
environmental issues addressed by the PRSC: improvements in environmental policies and their
implementation, pollution prevention and control, sustainable management o f forest and water
resources.

97.      As additional due diligence and to ensure that gaps in the existing institutional
arrangements and incentives necessary for improved environmental governance are adequately
identified and addressed, the World Bank is engaged in supporting analytical work in
collaboration with the government of Vietnam which includes the ongoing Country
Environmental Analysis, Poverty-Environment Nexus analysis, and an annual environmental
monitoring series, among other analytical work. The Country Environmental Analysis
specifically targets pollution management issues within the broader context o f industrial
development and urbanization (including equitization of SOEs), environmental aspects o f trade
liberalization, public participation and public awareness on environmental issues, policy and
institutional capacity development regarding addressing environmental issues. The study on the
Poverty-Environment Nexus targets the direct interaction between environmental issues and
poverty specifically as it relates primarily to natural resource management (e.g. deforestation and
fragile lands), and to health (e.g. indoor and outdoor air pollution and lack o f access to
appropriate water and sanitation). Finally, the environment monitor series provides a snap shot o f
the state o f environment primarily as it relates to specific thematic areas. Inthe recent past, the
thematic areas included water and solid waste, andthe current monitor i s on biodiversity.



C.       Benefitsand Risks

98.      The proposed operation provides further support to Vietnam's policy and
institutionalreforms to maintain high growth and poverty reduction. It promotes greater
internal and external competition and improves efficiency and resource allocation in the
economy. It enhances transparency and accountability in SOE operations and in the banking
sector. It supports the initiation o f fundamental changes in the financial sector, designed to
transform the SBV into a modern central bank and strengthen the commercial orientation of
SOCBs. Overall, the increased efficiency should be reflected in increased private investment and
exports. This economic expansion should be associated with additional job creation, thus
providingemployment opportunities for the young and growing labor force.

99.      The proposedcredit also promotes humandevelopmentthrough upgradingthe quality
o f education (especially in poor zones), supporting the availability of medicines at affordable
prices, and leading to more secure asset ownership through the implementation o f a new Land


                                                  39

Law. Analytical work carried out as part o f the preparation o f the CPRGS emphasizes the
importance of addressing inequalities in health and education outcomes across regions and
population groups. The actions undertaken in PRSC 4 and proposed in the roadmap for future
reforms tackle an underlyingproblem o f resource allocation mechanisms in the social sectors to
ensure a stronger pro-poor focus. The proposed credit also encouragesimportant policy measures
leadingto more sustainable management of forests and improving environmental quality.

100.     The proposedcreditwill increasetransparency andaccountabilityof publicfinances
and improvelegal transparency and accessibility. Lack o f transparency undermines effective
resource allocation and service delivery at national and local levels o f government. Actions
undertaken in PRSC 4 complement the ongoing public financial management reform initiative,
including inthe area of financial disclosure of state budget entities. Also, the piloting o f MTEFs
is a key step to improve the coordination of capital and recurrent expenditures. Later actions
support fuller accountability in the planning and budget processes at the lowest level of the
administration, the commune. In addition, important initiatives in the legal reform area are
recognized in the PRSC 4 operation, supporting the implementation o f the government's
comprehensive and ambitious legal reform agenda.

101.     Some of the most important risks accompanying the proposed credit relate to
slippageinareas relatedto structuralreform. The government's ambitious objectives interms
of economic growth could conflict with its efforts to increasetransparency and contain the growth
of contingent liabilities. While some stakeholders emphasize the quality o f growth, the drive
towards increasing its quantity may result inpressuresto expand commercial and policy loans for
infrastructure development. These pressures could reduce the overall quality o f lending, thus
undermining the banking reform agenda, and resultingin substantial contingent liabilities for the
government in the medium-term. Meanwhile, benefits from WTO accession will accrue only if
complementary reforms take place in areas such as trade logistics, tax policy and administration,
and reforms targeted at improving the investment climate. While many o f these reforms are in
train, their pace would needto keep up with the speed and demands of international integration.

 102.    This risk is addressed by including some o f these reforms as part o f the PRSC process
and by ensuring that other World Bank and donor operations are directing support inthese areas.
As regards the banking sector, the recently decided classification o f loans based on IAS is bound
to reveal weaker positions than under local accounting standards. This translates into higher
fiscal costs than impliedby earlier government data. Furthermore, this information will sooner or
later be inthe public domain. To keep fiscal costs manageable and to retain public confidence in
the banking system the communication of this information must be accompanied or preceded by
credible strategies to address NPLs and strengthen SOCBs.             This entails backing up the
announcement to strengthen the commercial orientation and autonomy o f SOCBs with decisive
policy actions.

 103.    The ambitious reform agenda supported by the PRSC process, while improving
economic efficiency, could also leadto increasedinequalityand environmentaldegradation.
Risinginequality could result from differential returns to educational attainment at the household
 level. But this problem will likely be dwarfed by increasing rural-urban disparities, leading to
migration and possibly to increased urban poverty.         The government of Vietnam remains
 committed to social inclusion, with policies in health and education aimed at channeling more
 resources to the poor and improving the quality o f the services delivered. However, some key
programs are under-funded. The incentives given to service providers to charge fees have not
 been matched by sufficient accountability on the delivery o f basic services to be provided at low



                                                40

or no fee.     Regarding sustainability, an increasingly sophisticated legislation still needs to
translate into effective administrative, economic and information tools to protect the environment.

104.     Improvements in data availability and analytical work on issues arising from rural-urban
disparities, included as part o f the PRSC process, should help strengthen government policies to
address these problems. Similarly, the Country Environmental Assessment as well as the policy
actions on land, water, and environmental protection under the current series o f PRSCs should
help address threats to sustainable resource use and environmental quality. Early results from the
analytical studies should be available in time to influence the next SEDP, which in turn is
proposed to be supported by a cycle of PRSCs.

105.     Finally, there is a riskthat the opportunities for embezzlementcreated by a rapidly
growing economy will lead to increased corruption. While there has been considerable
progress on enhancing budgettransparency, the management o f state assets and liabilities remains
weak. Rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds could contribute to the
development o f infrastructure at the local level, but their transparency and accountability are still
matters of concern. The government i s also taking important steps towards more effective anti-
corruption policies, but in a rapidly growing economy the opportunities for graft could outpace
improvements inanti-corruption policies for some time.

106.     Initiatives are underway to provide effective counter mechanisms, however.                A
comprehensive diagnostic o f corruption and its modalities i s in its field stage at present, and its
findings will be publicly disclosed. An Anti-corruption Law, to be passed by the National
Assembly in October 2005 will introduce stronger accountability requirements for heads o f
agencies, the monitoring o f assets of senior government officials and their families, and the
introduction o f a more effective whistle-blowing mechanism. The MOHA i s setting up incognito
spot-checks across government offices to detect malpractices. The government and the Party
have also asked the media to apply a more proactive approach in detecting and reporting on
corruption issues. This promising anti-corruption agenda, including the wider efforts to build
modem governance, would benefit greatly from continued donor engagement. A second cycle o f
PRSCs would be a key instrument for coordinating such donor support inan effective manner.



             IX.      COORDINATIONWITHDONORSAND STAKEHOLDERS


A.       TheIMF

 107.    The IMP'Sthree-year loan arrangementwith Vietnam underthe PovertyReduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) expired on April 12, 2004. After successfully completing two
reviews in 2001 and 2002, the completion o f the third review was delayed and no disbursements
were made after June 2002. This was primarily because o f a lack of agreement on measures to
enable Vietnam to meet the IMF's general policy in regard to audit and accounting arrangements
for the central banks o f borrowing member countries.

 108.    However, the IMF remains fully committed to continuing an effective partnership
with the government of Vietnam to support the implementationof the CPRGS. The IMF
maintains a regular policy dialogue with the government, through missions and its resident
representative office in Hanoi, and seeks to build capacity through training activities in Vietnam
 and abroad. It supplements this dialogue with technical assistance in areas o f core Fund


                                                  41

expertise, including tax policy and administration, budget management, monetary and financial
sector policy, and macroeconomic statistics. The IMF continues to cooperate closely with the
World Bank in Vietnam, and to contribute actively to the broader dialogue between the
government and its development partners. In relation to the proposed credit, it will in time
provide the required Letter o f Assessment.

109.     Under the framework o f enhanced collaboration, the staffs o f the two institutions have
consulted closely with one another across a broad range o f issues, and have sought to maintain
appropriately-aligned positions in their areas o f policy engagement. While the World Bank has
taken the lead in supporting the government's structural and institutional reforms in a number of
sectors, the IMF has taken the lead inthe policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies. Ithas also
assumed responsibility for advising on the monetary policy functions o f the SBV and the fiscal
implications o f the restructuring of SOCBs, including NPL resolution and the resulting re-
capitalization.   Included in this has been work on minimizing directed lending, interest rate
liberalization, and the process and timing of the re-capitalization o f SOCBs.         The direct
involvement o f the IMF in some of the structural areas, such as the reform o f SOEs and SOCBs,
or trade liberalization, isjustified becauseof their potential impact on macroeconomic stability.



B.       Other Multilateral and BilateralDonors

110.     As many as 11bilateral and multilateraldonors are expectedto co-finance PRSC 4,
and 15 or more of them could support later stages of the PRSC process (see Table 6). The
first two PRSC operations were co-financed by three bilateral donors, namely Denmark, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These co-financiers together with Sweden contributed a
total of US$43 million to PRSC 1. For PRSC 2, a total o f US$31 million was provided as grant
finance by these donors to supplement the World Bank's US$ 100 million. In addition to these
three, ADB, Canada, the EC and Japan supported PRSC 3, mobilizingthe equivalent of US$ 122
million. ADB and Japan contributed through parallel lending, whereas all other co-financiers
have relied on grants. Other bilateral donors actively participated in the preparation o f this
preparation, with a view to join the process at some point. France, Ireland, Spain and Sweden
might be ina positionto co-finance PRSC 4.

 111.    Bilateral and multilateral donors have played an important role not only in
providing funding but also through their involvement in the policy dialogue with the
government.      In the preparation for this operation, the donors participating in the process
contributed human and financial resources to assess the policy challenges, coordinate their
approaches, and discuss the options with government, across a range o f policy areas. These were
chosen in accordance with their priorities and comparative strengths. The preparation o f this
credit was conducted in a joint manner since its inception, with regular donor meetings taking
place to reach consensus on how to proceed. Bilateral meetings between the World Bank and
specific donors have also proved useful to share information and put to good use the combined
insights and knowledge of all the parties involved. These meetings providedthe common ground
on sectoral priorities and broad timetables for the present operation.

 112.    Preparations for PRSC 4 have built on the foundations of the existing strong donor
commitment to support Vietnam's reform agenda through nationwide implementation o f the
CPRGS, and further galvanized interest for the reform program among many donors. This is
most clearly reflected in the intense meetingfrequency o f the different working groups that were
established to coordinate the views of co-financiers and share information pertainingto the PRSC


                                                 42

process. Joint working groups o f donors, government and international NGOs that meet on a
regular basis have helped carry the discussions on government's plans for reforms to a wide
group o f stakeholders. With the formation of working groups on banking, SOEs, trade, and
public expenditure, donors have had the opportunity to engage in discussions on reform with
government counterparts on an ongoing basis. Such an arrangement i s also helping to ensure
coherence across donors' programs of support, and to mobilize funding for highpriority tasks in
each policy area.



C.      Civil Society

113.    The nature and contents of the proposed credit were extensively discussed with civil
society organizations before the credit was appraised. With the support and cooperation o f the
NGO Resource Centre, a meeting was held with both international and local NGOs. The
discussion revealed a diverse agenda across organizations, although with a common focus on
poverty alleviation, human development and community participation. The NGOs participating
inthis meeting endorsed several of the policy actions supported by the proposed credit, and did
not identify any substantive gap in their main areas o f interest. Their views were especially
requested on the new MFI decree, and its implications for the operation of micro-credit schemes
that several o f them support.       Feedback on issues and measures related to community
participation and accountability at local levels was also sought after at this meeting, but the
outcome was not conclusive.

114.    Consultations with business associations during the preparation of this credit centered on
issues related to private sector development.      A well-functioning mechanism is in place in
Vietnam to conduct such consultations.        Prior to both the year-end CG meeting between
government and donors and the informal mid-year CG meeting, the Vietnam Business Forum
gathers to discuss the issues o f concern to a range of chambers and associations representing the
interests of enterprises. The discussion is organized around topics such as investment promotion,
transparency, tax, labor and land. Ineach of these areas, a list of main concerns is assembled, and
the focus is on assessingprogress towards solving them. Many of those concerns are addressed
through policy actions supported by the PRSC process. At the last Vietnam Business Forum, in
December 2004, the current cycle of PRSC operations was discussed, and feedback from the
participatingchambers and associations was sought

1.       With the draft Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010 now under
discussion within government, this is a very propitious time for us to review the implementation
o f Vietnam's Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), and assess the
outlook and challenges for the period ahead.

Developmentsand PolicyPerformancein2004

2.       As is well-documented in the government's CPRGS Progress Report, overall
economic performance was favorable in 2004, despite the adverse effects of droughts and
the outbreak of avian flu. Real GDP growth picked up to 7.7 percent, and great strides
continued to be made toward the achievement o f the CPRGS's socio-economic objectives, with
the incidence o f poverty declining to 26.2 percent, down from 32 percent in 2001. Export growth
was buoyant, underpinnedby strong demand in major export markets, improving terms o f trade,
and Vietnamese businesses' increasing penetration o f new markets. With receipts from tourism
and emigrants' remittances also recording large increases, the external current account deficit
remained manageable. Official reserves continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than in
2003, reaching a level of US$6.3 billion (about 8% weeks o f imports). Inflation, however, rose
from 3 percent in 2003 to 9.7 percent in 2004, as the above-mentioned domestic supply shocks
ledto sharp increasesinfood prices.

3.       Fiscal policy was managed prudently during 2004. While revenues were significantly
higher than budgeted, owing mainly to windfall receipts from oil exports, the authorities
contained the growth in expenditure. The state budget deficit (excluding amortization payments
and carry-overs o f funds from previous years) narrowed from 2 percent of GDP in 2003 to about
1% percent o f GDP in 2004. As the government also took steps to tighten the screening and
eligibility criteria for projects to be financed under the Development Assistance Fund(DAF), the
overall government deficit, including on-lending, declined from about 5 percent o f GDP in 2003
to less than 3% percent o f GDP in 2004.

4.       However, the surge in credit growth, which was already a cause for concern at the
time of the 2004 Article I V consultation, continued to gather pace through the end of 2004.
Credit expansion was spurred in large part by the launching o f a number o f new large investment
projects by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which are being financed mainly by state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs). Beginning in July 2004, rising inflation, together with concerns
about loan quality, led the authorities to take some measures to tighten monetary conditions.
However, the levels o f deposit and loan interest rates and the flow o f new bank lending did not
respond significantly to these measures. In addition, the expected cost o f foreign-currency
borrowing was reduced in August when the SBV announced that the dong would depreciate by
no more than 1percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in 2004. As a result, commercial banks' foreign-
currency lending rose by 58 percent over the full year, and total bank credit by 42 percent.

5.       Progress on structural reform was uneven in 2004. While continuing progress was
made in the area o f trade liberalization, and steps were taken to rationalize the legal framework
for foreign investment to pave the way towards Vietnam's accession to the WTO, the
restructuring and reform o f the SOCB and SOE sectors remained slow. The growing stock o f
contingent government liabilities in these sectors thus continues to be an important source o f
vulnerability and riskto medium-term debt sustainability.


                                                  46

Outlookfor 2005 and Challenges Ahead

6.        Although the external environment is projected to worsen somewhat in 2005, the
outlook for Vietnam remains broadly positive. Despite a weakening of external demand, and
intensified competition from WTO members whose textile quotas were recently eliminated, GDP
growth would remain at around 7%percent in 2005 on current trends. The external current
account deficit should continue to be financed primarily with ODA and FDIinflows, thus keeping
the overall balance of payments in surplus and the external debt burden manageable. However,
the relatively low import cover of reserves would leave the economy exposed to external shocks.
Inflation also remains a cause for concern. While the year-on-year rate of inflation leveled off at
8% percent as o f April, this has partly reflected delays in the pass-through o f recent increases in
the world prices of oil and other imported inputs. Thus, vigilance continues to be needed to
contain potential inflationary pressures.

7.        The main risks to this relativelypositive outlook stem from possible efforts to speed
up the pace of economic growthin the remainder of 2005 with expansionary policies, which
could well be counterproductive.Given that GDP growth has so far fallen somewhat short of
the 2001-2005 SEDP targets, it would have to rise to 8% percent in 2005 to meet the SEDP's
average annual target. But expansionary macroeconomic policies at the current juncture could
fuel higher inflation, further increase external vulnerability, and probably necessitate adjustment
measuresthat would hamper investment and growth down the road. Moreover, as is recognized in
the CPRGS Progress Report, continuing high inflation would have its worst impact on the real
incomes o fthe poorest households.

8.        To lessenthese risks, a balanced mix of prudentfiscal, monetary, and exchange rate
policies will need to be adopted. On the fiscal front, on-lending should continue to be tightly
managed, with a view to restraining the overall budget deficit to no more than 3 percent o f GDP
in 2005. A more concerted effort will also be neededto tighten monetary and credit conditions.
While official statements indicate that credit growth i s targeted to decelerate to 25-30 percent in
2005, and steps have been taken inrecent months to increase SBV's policy rates, there i s no clear
evidence o f the desired slowdown. Indeed, SOCBs seem set to finance a growing list o f large new
SOE projects during the second half of 2005. Moreover, the effective cost o f foreign-currency
borrowing is still low, as the dong has remained virtually stable vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, and the
SBV announced again inJanuary that it would depreciate by no more than 1percent in 2005. To
enhance the effectiveness o f monetary policy, facilitate adjustment to shocks, and protect the
SBV's reserves, a more flexible exchangerate policy should be adopted, with intervention limited
to smoothingexcessive fluctuations.

9.        Looking forward to the pursuit of the CPRGS's medium-term objectives, faster
banking sector reforms will be essential to protect debt sustainability, improve credit
allocation, and promote higher-quality investment and growth. The recently-approved new
 loan classification and prudential regulations for commercial banks are a welcome step in this
direction, and should be implemented without delay. However, to enable the SBV to enforce
these regulations in a credible manner, early action will also need to be taken to strengthen the
 SBV's independence and clearly establish its supervisory authority over all the banking
 institutions that operate in Vietnam. In the area o f SOCB reform, the authorities' equitization
plans need to be pursued without further delay. At the same time, government interference in the
 lending decisions o f SOCBs will need to be curtailed, and corporate governance significantly
 strengthened. We look forward to a fuller discussion o f the government's financial sector reform
 roadmap duringthe remainder o f these meetings, and hope that the most critical policy measures
 will be incorporated inthe 2006-2010 SEDP.


                                                 47

10.      Reform of the SOE sector should be another top priority. The restructuring o f key
SOEs will be necessary to alleviate their capacity and financial constraints, enhance their
operating efficiency, and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for partnerships with the
private sector for infrastructure development. As in the case o f the SOCBs, existing plans to
equitize and restructure SOEs will need to be accompanied by curbs on government interference
intheir management and incentives for themto operateon a commercial basis.

11.      The establishment of a fair and transparent policy and regulatory framework will
be key to improving the investment climate and fostering development of a vibrant and
competitive private sector. Early liberalization o f administered prices will be essential to
improve the transmission ofmarket signals and remove bottlenecks inthe supply o f key industrial
inputs, which could otherwise hamper growth. A rationalization of prices, together with SOCB
and SOE reforms, would also limit the scope for rent-seeking activities, and would thus
complement the administrative measures to prevent corruption that are detailed in the CPRGS
Progress Report. The authorities are also encouraged to pass as soon as possible the ambitious
agenda o f new laws that will need to be in place to increase the transparency o f Vietnam's legal
framework and bring it closer into line with those o f WTO members. While recent steps to
increase financial disclosure by SOEs are welcome, stronger efforts to upgrade the quality,
timeliness, and dissemination o f key economic and financial statistics will also be necessary to
improvethe government's own analysis o frecent developments as well as the quality o f its policy
dialogue with development partners.


ConcludingRemarks

12.      Vietnam has made solid progresstoward meetingthe objectives of the CPRGS, and,
with the right policies, it has good prospects for further gains in the period ahead. The
policy priorities are to take timely measures to protect macroeconomic stability and step up
needed structural reforms. The development of the SEDP for 2006-2010 provides a unique
opportunity for the government to make a decisive shift towards a more market-oriented policy
framework, consistent with its aspirations to reap the full benefits of international economic
integration. The authorities are urged to resist political pressures to boost short-term growth
through the use of overly expansionary macroeconomic policies. In addition, to help place the

Mr.James D.Wolfensohn

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

        The Government of Vietnam has been embarked in an ambitious economic
reform agenda since the beginning of Doi Moi, almost two decades ago. The current
directions of this agenda are described in detail in a series of Government strategies and
plans.    The broadest statement is provided by the Ten-Year Socio-Economic
Development Strategy 2001-2010. Key planning documents for the period covered by
the ongoing cycle of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) are the five-year Socio-
Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2001-2006, and the Comprehensive Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy(CPRGS).

        The proposed credit is fully in line with our development strategy. The policy
actions it supports reflect the reform directions set out in our planning documents and in
the CPRGS in particular. The CPRGS, approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002,
was presented in July 2002 to the Board of Executive Directors of the International
Development Association, who received it very favorably. In 2003, the CPRGS was
"expanded" to include a development policy for large-scale infrastructure and review its
role inpromotingeconomic growth and poverty reduction.

        The actions supported by the proposed credit also reflect the emerging reform
agenda for the next planningcycle, when the CPRGS approachwill be fully integrated in
the five-year SEDP 2006-2010. This integration implies that a broad consultation with
stakeholders in and out of Government will take place, that greater attention will be paid
to the attainment of development outcomes, including the Vietnam Development Goals,
and that stronger mechanisms to monitor progress over time will be set up. The
integration of the CPRGS approach into the SEDP, together with its previous expansion
to address infrastructure policies, removesthe need for two separate planningdocuments.

        At this stage, when we are comingto the end of one planningperiodand defining
the directions for the next one, we base many policy actions on both existing strategies
and emerging aspirations. The last two years have been characterized by intense efforts
to accelerate Vietnam's accession to the WTO and this, in turn, has influenced policy
actions related to international trade and the legal framework.       There has also been
considerable progress regarding public financial management. The recently completed

Public Expenditure Review IntegratedFiduciaryAssessment,jointly led by the Ministry
                             -
of Finance and the World Bank, is charting the way for reforms to public financial
management. The Government Inspectorateis leading a processto make anti-corruption
policiesand tools more effective. And the State Bank of Vietnamhas prepareda strategy
to acceleratethe reformof the banking system.

        All of these emerging directions, jointly with the CPRGS and other planning
documents of the Government of Vietnam, shape the policy actions supported by the
proposedcredit. The opening speechof Deputy Prime MinisterNguyenTan Dungto the
seventh session of the NationalAssembly, on May 5, 2005, articulatedthe same themes,
and reviewed some of the same actions, covered by PRSC 4. Deputy Prime Minister
NguyenTan Dungis also the Chairman ofthe SteeringCommittee for the PRSC process.
His speech to the National Assembly confirms that the proposed credit is fully aligned
with the reform agendaof Vietnam.

        One of the main objectives of our development strategy is to complete the
transitionto a marketeconomy, as reflected inPart I11sections Iand 11, and Part IV ofthe
CPRGS. Inthis respect, over the last twelvemonthswe havemade strongprogress inthe
multilateral and bilateral negotiations towards WTO accession. We have also reduced,
substantially, the number of activities where full state-ownership is to be retained, and
have strengthened the mechanisms to divest state-owned enterprises, especially through
the auctioning of shares. Regarding banking reform, an ambitious strategy has been
prepared for the coming five years, but some important steps have already been
undertaken in recent months. In line with the importance attached to policies for large-
scale infrastructure, the electricity sector is beingreorganized in a way that allows private
participationunder the guidance of a newlycreatedregulatory agency.

        Over the past twelve months we have also taken a number of important steps to
ensure that development in Vietnam remains socially inclusive and environmentally
sustainable. Inthis respect, the proposedcredit is grounded on Part V section I,Part III
sections Iand 111, Part IV section IV and PartV inthe CPRGS. Inline with the National
Education For All Action Plan 2003-2015, and our Education Development Strategy
2001-2010, we have taken steps to improvethe quality of primaryeducationand to open
up the tertiary education level to private providers. Recent measures also include the
passage of a new Law on Forest Protection and Development, improvements in the
 implementationofthe revisedLandLaw andthe development ofguidelines to governthe
transfer of larid from State Forestry Enterprises to households and communities. We
have also improved the regulation of the market for pharmaceutical products, and
 strengthenedthe mechanismsthat protectthe environment.

        The Government of Vietnam has also instituted a number of measures to build
 moderngovernance. This area is covered in Part VI1section I,and Part I11sections Iand
 I1 in the CPRGS.        In November 2004, the Government described progress in
 implementing the CPRGS in the second Annual Progress Report. This report, currently
 beingcirculated to the ExecutiveDirectorsof the World Bank andthe IMFalongwith an
 advisory note written by the staff of these organizations, explains the reforms we are




                                           74

introducing to the overall planning framework. The new direction is reflected in
instructions to base the SEDP on robust data and evidence, and to link the proposed
policies to both a monitoring framework and resource needs. We have also taken a
number of actions to strengthenpublic financial managementand increase transparency.
Increased financial disclosure for all state budget entities, and the transformationof the
State Audit of Vietnam into a independentspecialized agency, are amongthose actions.
As for the improved alignment of civil servants' salariesto the market, it can be traced to
commitments made in both the CPRGS and the Public AdministrationReform Master
Program.

       The need to tackle corruption is discussed in Part I1 of the CPRGS. More
recently, the Resolutionof the 6th Central Committeeplenum, in December2003, set the
framework for developing a comprehensive anti-corruption program. The building
blocks of this program are reducing opportunities for corrupt behavior and increasingthe
probability that those abusing such opportunities get caught. The Prime Minister has
recently instructed the Government Inspectorateto take the lead inthe designing of anti-
corruption policies. This instruction comes at a time when the first comprehensive
diagnostic of corruption, relying on an internationallyrecognized approach, is nearing
completion. Thisresearchwill informfuture anti-corruptioninitiatives.

        In developing and implementing our strategy for economic growth and poverty
reduction, we have benefited from assistance from the Association and a broadening
range of bilateral and multilateraldonors. The Association supported earlier stages of
this process through the first three PRSCs. We request the Association's assistance
through a fourth PRSC, in recognition ofthe steady progressinthe implementationof our
development strategy. While recognizing that many difficulties remain, we will pursue
our reform agenda and plan on key actions to complete the transition to a market
economy, keep development inclusiveand sustainable, and build modern governance. In
this connection, at the end of the calendar year we will furnish to the Association, for its
review and comment, an updated CPRGS Progress Report on achievements and
challengesin carryingout theprogram.

        We are determined to pursue our poverty reduction and growth strategy. We
requestthe Association's assistanceand lookforwardto itscontinued support.

                                     Yours sincerely,),
