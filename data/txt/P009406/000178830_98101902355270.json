  the first phase of a long-term program to overcome the major\n            problems of primary education. The four main objectives\n            would be: (a) increased access to primary schools,\n            especially for girls and for rural poverty groups, to be\n            achieved by: (i) providing school facilities and materials\n            (textbooks, uniforms); (ii) providing more female teachers;\n            (iii) enhanced supervision to improve teacher attendance and\n            performance; and (iv) increased community school control\n            through more parental involvement in School Management\n            Committees; (b) reduced wastage by reducing student dropout\n            and repetition; (c) improved quality of instruction through\n            teacher training refresher courses in better teaching\n            methods and class room management, and more frequent\n            supervision; and (d) reduced costs by employing a higher\n            student-teacher ratio, by having larger class and school\n            sizes and by employing assistant teachers in rural schools."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
