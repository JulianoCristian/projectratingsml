Reasons for Cancellation

        The credit was cancelled on August 14, 199'7(fourteen months after the signing
took glace) due to the failure of the Borrower to fulfill the conditions of effectiveness
despite several extensions of the terminal date of effectiveness. The Borrower was
informed about the imminent cancellation of the project, but has not submitted any
further requests for the extension of the closing date and has not indicated that it intends
to request a new extension.
