 Project (ASMP) will support the implementation and enhance\n            the effectiveness of the Government's ongoing civil\n            service reform and decentralization programs. These programs\n            have the broad objectives of creating a liberalized enabling\n            economic environment, conducive to promoting the private\n            sector as the engine of economic growth, and decentralizing\n            to the districts the responsibility for providing core\n            services and fostering rural development. Within this\n            framework, the three broad objectives of the project are to:\n            1) enhance analytical capacity for policy formulation and\n            monitoring in the agricultural sector, in general, and\n            within the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and\n            Fisheries (MAAIF), in particular; 2) improve the\n            responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of the MAAIF in\n            carrying out its redefined role in agricultural sector\n            management through reforming management systems and\n            improving internal procedures; and 3) strengthen\n            agricultural information systems. These objectives will be\n            implemented through three main components: 1) policy\n            formulation and strategic planning, which will involve four\n            sub-components: (a) analytical capacity building; (b) an\n            Agricultural Policy Research Fund; (c) agricultural sector\n            investment program; and (d) district planning and\n            implementation capacity; 2) management systems reform and\n            training including: (a) internal systems reform; (b)\n            management reform; and (c) training fund; and 3)\n            agricultural data and information systems strengthening."}, "docdt": "1996-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
