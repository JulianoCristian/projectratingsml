"The project would support the\n            Government's efforts to provide essential urban\n            services to low income groups in four major cities and\n            foster improvements in municipal management and\n            administration.  The project would include:  (a) the\n            provision of integrated basic services such as roads,\n            footpaths, water supply and sanitation, primary schools and\n            health clinics in low income neighborhoods (known as\n            Kampungs); (b) improvements in solid waste management and\n            surface drainage; municipal management studies in financial\n            planning, programming and budgeting, operations and\n            maintenance, cost recovery and revenue generation; and (d)\n            technical assistance for project implementation and\n            preinvestment and feasibility studies.  The project would\n            provide improved basic services to 1.2 million residents of\n            the four cities. About 760,000 would benefit from the\n            kampung improvement program.  Another 400,000 would share in\n            the benefits of the solid waste disposal program, which\n            would provide a cleaner physical environment and reduce\n            health risks, and the drainage improvement program, which\n            would minimize the risks of property damage, illness and\n            loss of life arising from periodic flooding."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
