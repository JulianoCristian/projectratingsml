Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) the Bank played a catalytic\n            role and the project provided the appropriate tool to\n            initiate and implement power sector reforms; 2) those\n            reforms, which are politically charged and very difficult to\n            implement, do take time to achieve the desired goals; 3) the\n            success of the project showed that it is important for the\n            Bank to adopt a flexible approach during implementation; and\n            4) the ideal situation for a reform-minded project is to\n            initiate it when the situation is stable, the government is\n            stable and government is reform-minded."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
