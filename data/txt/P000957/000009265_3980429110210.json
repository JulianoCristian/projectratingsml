and limited to the local area\n            where the road works will be carried out.  Severe\n            environmental impacts necessitating resettlement of\n            communities, or causing damage to fragile ecosystems will\n            not occur to a significant extent as a result of the\n            project.  Direct negative impacts will be limited to soil\n            erosion which may be due to improper designs or embandments\n            or side drains; scouring of the landscape due to opening of\n            borrow pits; destruction of vegetation due to clearing\n            right-of-way and a lack of adequate provisions for\n            revegetation; dust, fumes, noise, and vibrations during road\n            work; increased sediment loads in streams and rivers where\n            road crossings occur; and safety hazards created by\n            increased traffic flows and speed.  Secondary impacts from\n            reconstruction will also occur.  Prominent among them is the\n            possibilty of induced development along more accessible road\n            corridors and opening up areas to natural resources to\n            exploitation.  Positive impacts from road improvement\n            activities occur and indeed provide the rationale for this\n            project.  Examples include increase in value of agricultural\n            products due to improved access to markets, enhanced\n            roadside commerce and increased in social mobility."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
