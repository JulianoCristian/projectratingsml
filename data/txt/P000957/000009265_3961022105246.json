through\n            increased growth, largely in the agricultural sector. The\n            Highway Sector Investment Program Project will support this\n            by: 1) reducing vehicle operating costs through maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads; and 2) ensuring\n            that improvements are sustained by developing and\n            implementing cost recovery policies, building and utilizing\n            indigenous capacity in the public and private sectors, and\n            improving financial management and control. The main\n            components of the project are: 1) maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road network; 2)\n            institutional strengthening and capacity building, which\n            consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the\n            Ministry of Roads and Highways, the Ghana Highway Authority,\n            the Department of Feeder Roads, the Department of Urban\n            Roads, the National Development Planning Commission, and the\n            domestic construction industry through appropriate\n            institutional reforms, technical assistance, training and\n            logistical support; and 3) policy reform including the\n            following issues: cost recovery, private sector financing,\n            increased environmental sensitivity, axle load control and\n            road safety."}, "docdt": "1996-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
