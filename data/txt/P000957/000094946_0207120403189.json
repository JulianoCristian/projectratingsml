"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Highway Sector\n            Investment Program Project is rated as satisfactory,\n            sustainability as likely, institutional development impact\n            as sustainable, Bank performance as satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance as satisfactory. The Country Assistance\n            Strategy and the project objectives have been consistent.\n            The project design also closely reflected the\n            government's priorities as set out in their Road Sector\n            Expenditure Program for 1996-2000. The Bank also helped to\n            underscore the need to halt negotiated contracts, bring the\n            major cause of the arrears problem to a close. Key lessons\n            learned are as follows: The study undertaken to monitor the\n            poverty impact of road rehabilitated and maintained under\n            the project established direct correlation between improved\n            road condition and access to higher order social facilities.\n            The study also found other benefits accruing to people\n            living along the rehabilitated roads. The project attests to\n            the importance of program concept, which recognizes that\n            road networks are interdependent, and thus improvements and\n            extensions to the network must be planned within the context\n            of the whole. The arrears to contractors in the sector shows\n            clearly the need for comprehensive road sector management\n            and transparent reporting. The government needs to institute\n            a procurement policy to promote transparency. Development\n            partners need to have better coordination to avoid\n            duplication of technical assistance provision."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
