                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR includes the outcome of two supervision missions done respectively in May 17-26, 2010 and November 5-12, 2010 that was extended until early December 2010 because of
                         the necessity to collect field information from the 7 implementing agencies.
                         Implementation of the agriculture component is satisfactory with 81% of the total budget of this component already committed. It is likely that the component PDOs will be achieved.
                         Unfortunately, implementation of the component financed by the Rural Development Fund (RDF) is still very much behind schedule despite the restructuring of the project and the
                         commitment taken prior the restructuring.
                         Although 90 % of RDF allocation was already notified to all the Governors before May 1010, only 53% of these funds have been committed by the end of November 2010, and only
                         17 % have been paid one year prior the end of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To ensure execution of the socio economic infrastructures financed by the FDR, it is critical that :
                               (i) the Governors of the provinces of Boulemane, Khemisset, Khouribga, Sidi-Kacem, Taroudant and Tata monitor closely implementation of these socio economic
                         infrastructures projects and,
                               (ii) the national project coordination unit and the provincial implementing agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries need to ensure systematic and close
                         monitoring of the processing of all bids and contracts related to implementation of this component.
