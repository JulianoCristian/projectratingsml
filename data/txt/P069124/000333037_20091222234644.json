The changes\n            include the mainstreaming of project implementation in the\n            new institutional structures created by the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Marine Fisheries (MAMF) as part of the new\n            agricultural strategy plan Maroc Vert adopted in March 2008.\n            Specifically, the existing Project Management Unit (PMU) is\n            to be transferred from the land management directorate of\n            the MAMF to the newly created directorate for irrigation and\n            land management, division of land management of the same\n            MAMF.
