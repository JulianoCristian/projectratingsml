The Bank loan for the project will be US$41.5\n            million, which represents the foreign exchange cost. The\n            development of the road network has not kept pace with the\n            rapid growth of road transport in recent years. Heavy\n            traffic volumes on roads with inadequate design standards\n            have resulted in high road transport costs, unacceptable\n            levels of traffic congestion and a heavy accident toll. The\n            Government is aware of the need for adequate roads if growth\n            of the total economy is not to be impeded. It intends to\n            raise road investments, realizing that shortages of\n            qualified and experienced staff will have to be remedied and\n            that organizational improvements may have to be made to\n            ensure the proper execution of an expanding investment program."}, "docdt": "1977-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
