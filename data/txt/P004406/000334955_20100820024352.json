The government requests for an extension of\n            the project beyond June 30, 2010 to enable them to\n            effectively ban the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) (other\n            than banked supplies) in the servicing sector (small- to\n            medium-scale enterprises) as well as complete the remaining\n            support activities. This is consistent with the decision of\n            the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund of the\n            Montreal Protocol in its 21st meeting of parties to the\n            Montreal Protocol held last November 3-8, 2009, approving\n            the revised National CFC Phase out Project (NCPP) Annual\n            Program which describes the action plan and the disbursement\n            schedule for the remaining funds to complete the project.\n            Likewise, the ISP also received fresh funds from the Fund to\n            support its work on or before December 2011. However, the\n            World Bank finds it sufficient to extend the project up to\n            only until June 30, 2011 as the fresh funds released from\n            the Fund amounts to only $158,491.00 in addition to the\n            remaining project fund of US$1,865,000."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
