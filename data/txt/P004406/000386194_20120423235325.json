PROTOCOL,TF021931-OTF - PHILIPPINES ODS PHASE OUT\n            INV. PROJ.,TF056617-SWEDISH CONTRIBUTION TO THE\n            PHILIPPINE NATIONAL CFC PHAEOUT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Ozone Depleting\n            Substances Phase-out Project for Philippines were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            global environment outcome was moderate; Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: project duration. The project combined two\n            operations in one over a 17-year period. While this approach\n            may have had advantages from the point of view of\n            bureaucratic processing, it also had disadvantages. Notably,\n            closure of first phase when the investment sub-projects were\n            completed would have allowed a formal valuation of the first\n            phase implementation experience which could have contributed\n            to second phase design. Furthermore, having been designed as\n            part of an ongoing project rather than a self-standing new\n            operation, second phase did not benefit from a formal World\n            Bank appraisal, this might have uncovered some of the design\n            weaknesses that plagued second phase implementation.\n            Furthermore, due to the long duration of the project, the\n            evaluation of the earlier implementation years was\n            significantly constrained by staff changes in the relevant\n            Government agencies and the Bank, and changes in the\n            enterprises that benefitted from the Project. Monitoring\n            outcomes vs. outputs. A limited number of the planned\n            project outputs were achieved and contributed to the\n            achievement of the Global Environment Objective (GEO) during\n            second phase. The Philippines was reaching the objectives\n            set for the project mainly due to factors external to the\n            project, while a number of planned project outputs were\n            either not being generated or poorly generated.\n            Implementation progress monitoring. The project demonstrated\n            that the Bank could have better assessed implementation\n            progress. Voucher system design and implementation. The\n            experience with the voucher scheme implementation under the\n            project highlighted the need to make sure that financial and\n            time costs for service shops' participation in the\n            scheme are minimal, and a rigorous, adequately funded\n            monitoring system is in place from the very beginning to\n            ensure that no parties in the system engage in abuses, all\n            eligible beneficiaries receive proper equipment and use them properly."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
