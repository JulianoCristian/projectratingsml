                         individual sub-projects for enterprises, and (b) a national CFC Phaseout Plan, financed through the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol and implemented
                         through national institutions.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has fully achieved the agreed targets. As independent verification of 2009 imports of ODS covered by the Project (i.e., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon
                         tetrachloride (CTC), methyl chloroform, and methyl bromide) confirmed that only CFCs were imported in 2009. The total import of CFCs in 2009 was 208.7 ODP tons against the
                         target of 300 ODP tons. Since 1 January 2010, imports of these chemicals have been banned by the Government. Moreover, global production of these chemicals for controlled use

                         have also been terminated. Any residual demand of CFCs for servicing CFC-dependent equipment (old refrigerators and air-conditioners) in 2010 and beyond will be met through
                         recycled materials. A reclamation facility to collect and recycle CFCs was established in the Philippines in 2010. This facility is financed by the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project's closing date has been extended from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011 to enable the borrower to effectively ban the use and imports of virgin CFCs in the servicing
                         sector (small-and-medium-scale enterprises) as well as complete the remaining support activities. The next mission is tentatively scheduled for February 2011.
