project will enable the Government of the Philippines to meet its phase-
out obligations and to continue program 
implementation that will ensure the sustainable phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) use in the country. 
 
This covers investments, 
non-investments, technical assistance, and other support activities
 wherein assistance  
would be provided through the following components: 1) institutional strengthening project, 2) methyl 
bromide phase out project, 3) national CFC phase out plan i) manufacturing sector; (ii) service sector; (iii) 
project management.

(TF021931-PH) 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
The closing date for 
Philippines, MONTREAL PROTOCOL
 OZONE DEPLETING 
SUBSTANCES (ODS) PHASE OUT INVESTMENT PROJECT, 
P004406 
will be 
extended
 
from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.   
 
1. 
The government has mainstreamed, in its institutional structure and administrative 
and regulatory system, the phase-out of ODS consumption through a series of 
investments, financial subsidies, technical assistance, and other support activities. 
Important accomplishments are the conversion of the CFC-based manufacturing sector 
and servicing sector to use alternative, non-CFC technologies, the nationwide assessment 
and competency certification of refrigeration and air-conditioning service technicians,  
accreditation of service shops and the continuing education of the service technicians, 
and the collection, transport and storage of used ODS for reuse and recycling. In place is 
a
National Licensing System of ODS (Issuance of Certificate of Registration and Pre-
shipment Importation Clearance (PSIC)), the registration of dealers, resellers and retailers 
of ODS, and the enforcement of a plan to combat the illegal entry of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs), confiscation and seizure procedures. Despite the delays encountered, most 
components have already been completed meaning that the project’s objectives continue 
to be achievable.  
2. 
The project’s latest Implementation Status Report shows that the overall project 
implementation performance is moderately satisfactory. The recent problems/issues are 
well identified, the task team is on top of it and they will be remedied. The government 
has committed its own manpower and resources with detailed timelines in addition to the 
remaining project funds, to achieve the full completion of the outstanding activities of the 
project.   
3. 
The government requests for an extension of the project beyond June 30, 2010 to 
enable them to effectively ban the use of CFC (other than banked supplies) in the 
servicing sector (small- to medium-scale enterprises) as well as complete the remaining 
support activities. This is consistent with the decision of the Executive Committee of the 
Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol in its 21
st
 Meeting of Parties to the Montreal 
Protocol held last November 3-8, 2009, approving the revised NCPP Annual Program 
which describes the action plan and the disbursement schedule for the remaining funds to 
complete the project. Likewise, the ISP also received fresh funds from the Fund to 
support its work on or before December 2011. However, the World Bank finds it 
Page  6
6
sufficient to extend the project up to only until June 30, 2011 as the fresh funds released 
from the Fund amounts to only $158,491.00 in addition to the remaining project fund of 
US$1,865,000.       
 
4. 
The Bank agreed to the extension contingent on three conditions to be complied 
with by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) based on set 
agreements and timelines, namely:   
 
·
Refund of unjustified cash advances of Php1.4M to the project account before 
September 30, 2010; 
·
Resolve issue of faulty equipment provided by the 3 equipment suppliers, to date 
DENR agreed with one supplier on the mitigating measures to address the problems 
in the supplied equipment and prepared legal cases to be filed against the two 
suppliers that refuse to respond to the DENR following a timeline within the 
extension period which the Bank agreed to; and 
·
Formally accept and issue a management response to an operation audit, which 
DENR has fulfilled to date. 
 
5. 
The MP Meeting of Parties agreed that the project continue to pursue the 
following activities, to wit: 
 
·
Ensure sustainable phase-out of CFCs beyond 2010 with the enforcement of zero 
importation of CFCs including the confiscation of illegal, smuggled and unregistered 
refrigerants (Oplan-CFC).
 This includes operational support to the DENR’s Regional 
Offices for the monitoring of ODS handlers (dealers, resellers, retailers). 
·
An intensified information campaign on the details of the new Accreditation 
System for Service Shops shall be conducted with the servicing sector and local 
government units, including continued support to the assessment of service 
technicians nationwide as a requirement for accreditation. 
·
Setting up and operation of the reclamation facility including the tools and 
equipment to be used during the collection, transport & storage of recovered 
refrigerants. 
·
Trials, commissioning and completion of the last remaining Type 1 investment 
project shall be completed. Monitoring of the completed investment projects shall be 
completed. 
·
Strengthen the Management Information System, enhancement of the inter-
agency Database, upgrading its Communications Strategy including supporting the 
Regional Inter-agency Information Network/Centers and improving institutional 
linkages. 
·
Complete the consumption verification audit for 2009 and the conduct of a 
systems assessment and independent audit of the effectiveness and outcomes of the 
voucher grantees and the training institutes under the Voucher System.  
 
6. 
This will be the 2
nd
 extension of the project.
