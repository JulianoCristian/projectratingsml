Some lessons learned included: efforts to\n            restore native flora and fauna should take into account both\n            the level of public awareness and competing public values\n            concerning invasive alien species. Biodiversity values will\n            need to be balanced against other public use values such as\n            recreation, as in the case of the decision to remove the\n            pine trees from Table Mountain National Park. A decision to\n            eradicate one alien species in favor of another native one\n            such was the case concerning the removal of the Himalayan\n            tahr in favor of the Klipspringer should be vetted publicly\n            and options other than eradication should clearly be\n            considered. Public consultation and consensus building\n            campaigns can help to determine the optimal level of\n            eradication of local flora and fauna that will benefit the\n            biodiversity agenda and secure community support for local\n            conservation efforts. Projects that finance research,\n            whether basic or applied, should include a mechanism to\n            adapt research findings into ongoing implementation of\n            complementary project activities. A heavy investment was\n            made in invasive alien species clearing and rehabilitation,\n            both through a subcomponent of this project and through\n            several applied research grants funded by the Table Mountain\n            Fund (TMF). This research was published and disseminated,\n            but not systematically incorporated into the ongoing overall\n            program. A mechanism was also needed to channel information\n            arising from implementation to update the Table Mountain\n            Fund's grant proposal processes to align it with\n            program needs i.e. so that the Fund could effectively serve\n            as a think tank for on-the-ground project implementation.\n            Managing a small grant mechanism for biodiversity\n            conservation requires an investment in project development\n            to assure that the fund as a whole is geared toward\n            achieving its programmatic (and landscape) goals. Project\n            development necessarily involves thinking about\n            partnerships, often at the design stage, since the right\n            combination of actors will be needed to apply and adapt\n            research beyond the small pilot applications supported by a\n            fund such as the TMF. A range of partners should be brought\n            into the project development process, including local land\n            use decision makers in the government and/or conservation\n            agencies, community based organizations and non-governmental\n            organizations (NGOs) that can provide follow-on resources,\n            universities interested in furthering the research aim,\n            donors, and the private sector. Since applied research will\n            need to be adapted and scaled-up, getting buy-in from those\n            key constituents that are charged with land-use decisions\n            up-front can help to prioritize grant approval processes and\n            can contribute to enhanced sustainability of the outcomes of\n            successful interventions."}, "docdt": "2010-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
