Some lessons suggest the following. This\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) investment in South\n            Africa, in the immediate post-conflict period took advantage\n            of the \"window of opportunity\", offered by the\n            fluid policy and institutional environment, to catalyze a\n            paradigm shift in the way in which biodiversity conservation\n            is undertaken, establishing the conditions for more\n            effective conservation in the country. In addition, the\n            project benefited significantly from a broad-brush\n            Log-frame, which clearly set the objectives, and key\n            performance indicators, but avoided detail (10 percent\n            design and 90 percent implementation). This created\n            sufficient flexibility and robustness to allow adjustments\n            where necessary, and facilitated innovative approaches, and\n            solutions. A free hand was given to the architects of the\n            project to be innovative and to take risks. Learned from\n            this project, in a complex regional program, the roles of\n            various stakeholders should be differentiated (in\n            consultation with stakeholders) to determine a range of\n            levels, and forms of involvement appropriate to the needs of\n            the project and those of stakeholders. Key stakeholders\n            should be deeply involved in project governance from\n            inception. Highlighted is the alignment of objectives, work\n            programs and budgets of partner agencies, with the goals of\n            the CAPE Strategy, which leveraged huge benefits for\n            implementation. Nevertheless, the executing agencies\n            indicated that their work could have been better facilitated\n            if they had a deeper knowledge of GEF financial, and\n            procurement procedures."}, "docdt": "2006-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
