the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) when\n            starting a reform program in a difficult area such as\n            improvement in food and drug quality and safety, it is\n            prudent to be less ambitious in what can be achieved in the\n            first operation and to build capacity for implementing\n            reforms over the long term; 2) capacity building for complex\n            regulatory functions needs a well coordinated approach. To\n            achieve a significant increase in quality and quantity of\n            lab tests for example, it is not sufficient to build a new\n            lab, hire lab staff and procure equipment. At the same time,\n            the number of inspectors who collect samples in the field\n            also needs to be increased to provide the additional samples\n            and make use of the increased lab capacity; 3) prior to\n            launching the project, the administrative steps necessary\n            and time requirements for creating positions and recruiting\n            public servants could have been investigated and addressed\n            proactively on a high level in order to avoid the delays in\n            creating and filling positions encountered during\n            implementation; 4) procurement of simple office equipment\n            and standard lab equipment could be done better locally in\n            states, possibly under a framework contract that provides\n            favorable terms and prices; 5) delivery of new equipment,\n            installation, validation, and application training need to\n            be closely supervised by the procuring unit in order to\n            ensure the full functioning of specialized equipment; and 6)\n            the onus of obtaining utility connections (electricity and\n            water) for the facility could be built into the contract to\n            avoid delay in making the facility functional before the\n            defect liability period."}, "docdt": "2009-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
