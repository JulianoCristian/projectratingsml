{"cdata!": "One of the key areas within the Food and\n            Drug Capacity Building Project, relates to the upgrading of\n            capacity, and competency of the Central and State Food and\n            Drugs testing laboratories, which entails handling, and\n            management of hazardous chemicals, and bio-hazardous wastes\n            generated in such laboratories. To this end, this\n            Environmental Management Plan (EMP) enables review, and\n            mitigation of environmental risks as foreseen within the\n            project. Although the existing laws in India do establish\n            standards on occupational health, safety, waste management,\n            and environmental protection for manufacturing, they do not\n            specifically provide for environmental health, and safety in\n            food and drug quality testing laboratories; but while some\n            international standards may not be appropriate to conditions\n            in Indian laboratories, some manuals (in particular the\n            United States' Environmental Protection Agency and Food\n            and Drug Administration manuals) are directed to smaller\n            laboratories, and may be replicated in laboratories under\n            this program. The EMP process will be phased beginning with\n            an assessment of health, safety and environmental practices\n            in testing laboratories, followed by a national workshop to\n            discuss findings, draft guidelines for best practices, and\n            formulate detailed operating manuals for laboratories. Based\n            on this, training modules will be developed, with checklists\n            to monitor each laboratory practice. The report includes a\n            current chart of categories of biomedical wastes, and\n            treatment/disposal activities to mitigate impacts, which\n            include incineration, burial at selected landfill sites,\n            disinfection practices, drainage of treated discharges, or\n            municipal landfill disposal."}, "docdt": "2002-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
