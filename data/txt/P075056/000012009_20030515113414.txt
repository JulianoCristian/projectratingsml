Project Development 
Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
a 
long-run 
program 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
foods 
and drugs 
in 
India 
by 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
incorporating 
components 
of 
consumer 
education 
and 
public-private 
partnerships. 
Some 
important related 
areas 
such 
as 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
medical 
devices 
and biologicals 
have 
been 
left 
outside the 
ambit 
of 
this 
project 
to 
enable a 
sharper 
focus 
on 
the 
most 
basic problems 
affecting 
the 
quality 
of 
foods 
and 
drugs. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Aruiex 
1) 
Specific indicators 
would 
include 
the 
following: 
0 
0 
0 
The 
Government 
develops recommendations 
and 
options 
for 
appropriate 
policies 
and 
measures 
for 
improving 
food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
and 
safety, 
in 
line 
with 
its 
new 
approach. 
Increased consumer 
awareness 
and 
knowledge 
(to 
be 
measured 
through 
household 
surveys). 
Increased capacity, 
quality 
and 
timeliness 
of 
food 
and 
drug 
testing  (to 
be 
measured 
through 
audits 
by 
independent 
experts; a 
composite 
quantifiable 
indicator 
has 
been 
designed 
and 
details 
are 
given 
in 
Annex 
2). 
Hazard Analysis and 
Critical Control 
Point (HACCP) 
standards 
and 
procedures 
are 
developed 
and 
introduced 
in 
selected 
priority food 
sectors.

Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS)  goal supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
22541-IN 
(CAS) 
The 
proposed 
project 
supports 
the health 
goals 
articulated 
in 
the 
CAS, 
in 
particular 
the 
objective 
of 
developing 
the 
capacity 
to 
manage 
public 
health 
programs 
effectively, 
such 
as 
surveillance 
and 
food 
and 
drug 
control. 
It 
also draws 
on 
lessons 
leamed 
from 
the 
large 
ongoing health 
portfolio 
and 
analytical 
work 
by 
building 
into 
project 
design 
the 
following 
areas 
of 
emphasis 
in 
the 
CAS: 
(a) 
building 
state 
capacity 
to 
manage 
health 
systems 
more 
effectively, and 
(b) 
supporting 
strategies 
for 
public 
private 
partnerships 
which 
focus 
more 
than 
before 
on 
the 
relative 
strengths 
of 
various 
sectors. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
June 27, 
2001 
The 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
recent 
Bank 
analytical 
work 
on 
the 
health 
sector, 
which 
has 
highlighted 
"government 
oversight" 
as 
a 
critical 
function 
of 
the 
health 
system. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The 
major 
generic 
health 
sector 
issues 
are: 
wide 
disparities 
in 
health 
status 
among 
regions 
and 
between 
poor 
and 
non-poor 
households; 
inadequate 
institutional 
arrangements 
and weak 
program 
management; 
low 
quality 
of 
services 
in 
both 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors; 
ineffective 
targeting 
of 
public 
funds 
to 
the 
poor; 
inadequate 
framework 
for 
engaging 
the 
private 
sector; 
low 
efficiency 
and 
limited 
financial 
resources; 
and 
poor 
governance.  These 
problems exist 
within 
a 
general 
institutional 
environment 
of 
poor 
oversight 
and 
inadequate measurement 
of 
health 
system performance. 
Food 
and 
drugs 
oversight 
is 
an 
essential 
public 
health 
function. 
Monitoring 
of 
foods and 
drugs 
for 
safety 
and 
effectiveness 
including 
licensing 
new 
drugs 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
Food 
and 
drugs 
oversight 
is 
on 
the concurrent 
list 
of 
the 
Indian 
Constitution 
with 
responsibility 
shared 
between 
the 
-2- 
Page  9
Central 
government and 
the 
States. 
Issues 
in 
Food 
Safety 
There 
is 
an 
increasing concern 
in 
the 
country 
about unsafe foods and 
their 
effect on 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population. 
WHO 
estimates 
indicate 
that 
in 
low-income 
countries about three-fourths 
of 
all 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea 
are 
caused 
by 
unsafe water and 
poor 
sanitation, 
with 
the 
remaining one-fourth 
mostly 
attributable 
to 
food 
borne infections. 
While 
there 
are 
regulations 
for 
ensuring 
food 
safety, enforcement 
is 
weak 
and 
methods outdated. 
Specific 
issues 
include: 
Insuflcientpublic 
awareness 
about 
food 
safety. 
A 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
Indian 
population 
depend 
upon 
the 
small, 
unorganized 
and 
street 
food 
vendors. 
Food 
handlers 
in 
this 
informal 
sector 
generally 
lack 
awareness 
of 
safety 
and 
quality 
control 
issues. 
The 
problem 
is 
aggravated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
many 
households also 
lack 
the 
knowledge 
for 
safe 
handling 
of 
foodstuffs. 
The 
single 
most 
promising 
intervention 
to 
improve 
food 
safety 
would 
be 
to 
enhance 
public 
awareness 
and 
knowledge 
of 
food 
safety 
issues. 
Except 
for 
a 
limited 
group 
of 
consumer advocacy 
NGOs, 
there 
has 
been 
little 
participation 
from 
the 
public 
in 
food 
safety and 
quality 
control. 
Weak 
enforcement 
of 
existing regulations. 
Traditionally, 
the 
system 
has 
depended 
on 
spot-checks 
of 
manufacturing 
conditions 
and 
random 
sampling 
of 
final 
products. 
Even 
this 
system 
is 
not 
evenly 
enforced 
at 
all 
levels. 
States 
have 
shown 
varying 
degrees 
of 
cooperation, 
commitment 
and 
participation 
in 
enforcing 
the 
Prevention 
of 
Food 
Adulteration 
(PFA) 
Act. 
Incidence 
of 
food 
adulteration 
is 
higher 
in 
the 
states 
where 
the 
PFA 
administration 
is 
generally 
weaker. 
The 
institutional 
ability 
of 
the 
center 
to 
effectively 
manage 
and coordinate 
oversight 
activities 
is 
limited 
and 
is 
further 
constrained 
by 
lack 
of 
systems 
for 
quick 
flow 
of 
information 
between 
the 
center 
and 
the 
States. 
Many 
States 
report 
inadequate 
number 
of 
staff to 
cany 
out 
the 
required 
functions 
and have 
difficulties 
in 
filling 
food 
inspector positions 
with 
personnel 
having 
the 
qualifications 
mandated 
by 
the 
PFA. 
Regulation 
of 
food 
safety 
is 
further 
compromised 
by 
lack 
of 
transparency 
in 
transactions 
by 
some 
businesses 
and regulators. 
Inadequate capacity 
of 
food  testing 
laboratories: 
The 
four 
central and 
79 
State 
laboratories, 
including 
13 
food 
laboratories 
managed 
by 
local 
bodies, 
do 
not 
have 
sufficient 
capacity to 
perform 
analysis 
to 
respond 
to 
current 
needs 
or 
to 
meet 
future 
growth. 
The 
majority 
of 
State 
laboratories 
are 
able 
to 
perform only 
basic analysis and cannot 
perform 
comprehensive testing, 
including 
analyzing 
samples 
for 
microbiological 
contaminants. 
Alignment 
with 
International 
Standards: 
The 
Hazard 
Analysis 
and 
Critical 
Control Point 
(HACCP) 
system 
is 
the 
new, 
efficient 
and 
internationally 
accepted 
scientific 
way 
of 
monitoring 
food 
safety. 
HACCP 
renders 
the 
identification, 
evaluation, and 
control 
of 
health 
hazards 
systematic. 
It 
can 
be applied 
at 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
cycle, 
from 
primary production to 
final 
consumption. 
There 
is 
a need 
for 
technical 
assistance 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
HACCP 
programs 
in 
the domestic 
food 
industry. 
Issues 
in 
Drugs 
Quality and 
Safety 
As 
with 
food, 
public 
interest 
in 
ensuring 
that 
drugs 
sold 
in 
the 
country 
are 
of 
good 
quality 
is 
starting to 
take 
hold. 
The 
Indian 
pharmaceutical 
market, 
with 
annual 
sales 
of 
USs7.2 
billion 
(1999), 
ranks 
third 
in 
the 
world. 
While 
the 
Indian 
govemment 
has succeeded 
in 
realizing 
its 
policy 
objectives 
of 
ensuring 
the 
availability 
of 
reasonably 
priced 
drugs 
and 
promoting 
the 
growth 
of 
a vibrant 
domestic 
industry, 
the 
objective 
of 
ensuring 
uniform 
good 
quality 
still 
needs 
to 
be 
effectively 
addressed. 
Currently, 
75 
percent 
-3- 
Page  10
of 
the 
industry's 
production 
is 
accounted 
for 
by 
150 large manufacturers out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
about 
9,000 
firms. 
These 
large 
manufacturers 
generally 
produce 
quality 
products 
as 
per 
current 
WHO 
Good 
Manufacturing 
Practices 
(GMP). 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
smaller 
production 
units 
are 
often 
not 
producing 
up 
to 
the 
required 
standards. 
However, 
the 
state 
policies 
to 
encourage the 
growth 
of 
small 
scale 
industry 
and 
poorly 
regulated 
rural 
markets 
encourage 
such 
units 
to 
thrive. 
The specific 
issues 
regarding 
drugs 
quality largely 
mirror 
those 
for food 
safety: 
Insuflcient 
consumer awareness. 
There 
has 
been 
a general 
absence 
of 
consumer 
awareness 
regarding 
issues 
of 
drug 
quality 
and 
of 
misuse 
of 
drugs. 
Some 
consumer groups 
are 
beginning 
to 
emerge 
but 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
issues 
such 
as 
acceptance 
of 
generic 
drugs 
and 
rational 
prescription 
behaviors 
by 
the 
physicians and 
users. 
Weak 
enforcement 
of 
existing regulations. 
The 
system 
for 
ensuring 
drug 
quality 
is 
inadequate. 
There 
is 
a 
high 
level 
of 
heterogeneity 
in 
institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements. 
Nineteen 
states 
and 
Union 
Territories 
have 
full-time 
Drug 
Controllers, 
while 
in 
12 
states 
the 
Directors 
of 
Health 
Services 
perform 
this 
duty 
along 
with 
other 
responsibilities. 
Similarly, 
enforcement 
of 
GMP 
is 
highly 
variable. 
The 
quality 
of 
training 
for 
Drug 
Inspectors 
has 
been 
uneven. There 
is 
anecdotal evidence 
of 
lack 
of 
transparency 
in 
granting 
of 
licenses 
in 
manufacturing 
and retailing. 
Inadequate 
capacig 
of 
Drug 
Testing 
Laboratories: 
States' 
drug 
testing 
facilities 
differ 
in 
capacity. 
Of 
the 
19 
drug 
testing 
laboratories 
functioning 
in 
35 
States/Union Territories, 
only 
seven 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
perform 
a 
full 
range 
of 
tests. 
In 
both public 
and private 
drug 
testing 
laboratories, 
skills 
of 
analysts need 
to 
be 
updated. 
Alignment 
with 
International 
Standards: 
The 
Indian 
Pharmacopeia, 
the 
official 
book 
of 
standards 
for 
drugs 
and 
their 
formulations, 
is 
outdated and 
does 
not 
reflect many recently 
developed 
drugs. 
Government Strategy 
Traditionally, 
the 
Indian 
Government 
has 
relied on 
regulation 
as 
the 
main 
instrument 
for 
ensuring 
food 
safety 
and 
adequate 
quality 
of 
drugs. 
For 
example, a 
recently 
gazetted 
ordinance 
seeks 
to 
enforce 
Good 
Manufacturing 
Practices 
in 
the 
drug 
producing 
industry 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2004, 
including 
the 
closure 
of 
units 
that 
fail 
to 
comply. 
It 
has 
also started 
to 
conduct external 
audits 
of 
public 
and 
private 
drug 
testing 
laboratories. 
While 
many 
regulations 
are 
in 
place, enforcement 
is 
weak 
and 
methods outdated. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Government 
has 
started 
to 
develop 
a 
new 
approach, 
which 
during 
the 
next 
15 years 
would 
aim 
to 
improve 
food 
and 
drug 
safety 
and 
quality 
in 
India 
and harmonize 
Indian 
norms 
with 
internationally 
accepted 
standards. 
To 
achieve 
this 
vision, 
India 
aims 
to 
support consumer 
education and 
partnerships 
with 
the 
industry 
in 
addition 
to 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
framework. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
assist 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
this 
evolving 
program.

issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
project 
would 
address 
the 
issues 
in 
food 
safety and 
drugs 
quality 
that were 
highlighted 
in 
section 
B.2. 
It 
would 
do 
this 
by 
supporting 
activities 
and 
reforms 
that 
are 
in 
line 
with 
India's 
emerging 
approach 
for 
public 
policy 
in 
this 
area 
--Le., 
it 
would 
support the strengthening 
of 
government's oversight 
and 
regulatory 
capacity 
through training 
and 
the 
improvement 
of 
laboratories and 
information 
systems. 
But, 
in 
addition, 
the 
project 
would 
support 
policy 
development, consumer 
education 
programs, and 
public-private 
partnerships 
including 
training 
of 
private 
sector 
staff 
and 
the 
updating 
and 
dissemination 
of 
standards.

Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
main 
benefits 
from 
the 
project 
would 
accrue 
to 
the 
society 
at 
large.  Increased safety and 
quality 
of 
foods 
and 
drugs 
would 
result 
in 
lower morbidity 
and premature 
mortality. 
The 
poor 
would 
especially 
benefit 
because 
they 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
victims 
of 
poor 
quality 
foods. 
For 
example, recent 
household 
surveys 
in 
India 
indicate 
that the 
incidence 
of 
diarrhea 
in 
children 
under 
five 
is 
20 
percent 
higher 
for 
the 
lowest 
income 
quintile 
(Le., 
poorest) 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
highest 
(i.e., 
richest) 
quintile. 
The 
true 
difference 
is 
probably 
greater, 
since 
poor 
households 
are 
known 
to 
under-report 
illnesses. 
In 
the 
private 
sector, 
medium 
and 
small 
scale 
manufacturers 
would 
benefit 
from 
the 
opportunities 
for 
training 
and 
assistance 
in 
improving 
manufacturing 
processes 
and 
product quality. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Central 
Government. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
part 
of 
a 
Central 
program. 
The 
Central 
Government 
through 
the 
MOHFW 
would 
provide financial 
sponsorship 
and 
be 
responsible 
for policy 
development, 
overall program coordination 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the project. 
In 
addition, 
MOHFW 
would 
coordinate 
the 
implementation of 
skill 
development and consumer-focused 
activities 
working 
closely 
with 
the 
States 
and 
with 
the 
technical 
support 
from 
expert 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
National 
Institute 
for 
Pharmaceutical 
Education 
and 
Research, 
and 
the 
National 
Institute 
of 
Nutrition 
and 
Central 
Food 
Technology 
Research. 
The 
MOHFW 
would 
coordinate 
project activities 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Food 
& 
Agriculture 
and 
other stakeholder organizations 
including private 
sector associations 
(Confederation 
of 
Indian 
Industries, 
Federation 
of 
Chambers 
of 
Commerce 
of 
India), 
NGOs 
and 
consumer groups 
using 
existing 
institutional 
mechanisms such 
as 
the 
National 
Codex Committee. 
The 
existing network 
of 
home 
science 
colleges 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Human 
Resource 
Development 
would 
be 
actively 
involved 
in 
carrying 
out 
household 
surveys. 
The 
MOHFW 
would 
engage 
a 
procurement 
agent 
for 
procurement 
of 
all 
goods 
and 
works 
for 
the 
central 
laboratories 
as 
well 
as 
of 
major 
goods 
and 
works 
at 
the 
State 
laboratories. Such 
procurement 
support 
from 
center 
to 
the 
States 
is 
expected 
to 
ensure 
adequate 
technical 
oversight 
for 
sophisticated 
equipment 
as 
well 
as 
better 
price. 
States. 
All 
states 
in 
India 
benefit 
from 
project 
support 
to 
consumer 
(and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
drugs 
also 
prescriber) 
education 
and 
training. However, 
new 
constructions 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
few 
states, 
especially 
those 
newly 
created. States 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
appointment 
of 
incremental 
staff, 
deputation 
of 
staff 
for 
skill 
enhancement 
training, 
providing 
sites 
free 
of 
encumbrances 
for 
buildinglrenovation 
of 
laboratories, 
and 
procurement 
of 
consumables 
and 
furniture 
for 
the 
program. 
A 
nodal officer 
from 
each 
State 
would 
be 
designated 
to 
prepare annual 
action 
plans 
for 
the

coordinate and 
monitor 
program 
implementation 
in 
the 
State, 
and 
provide 
quarterly 
feedback 
to 
the 
center 
in 
the agreed format. 
The 
funds 
flow 
to 
the 
states 
would 
be through existing 
State 
Aids 
Controllintegrated health 
societies 
as 
being 
done 
in 
other 
IDA 
financed 
centrally 
sponsored programs 
in 
India. 
Past 
experiences 
suggest 
that such 
mechanism 
ensures 
timely 
availability 
of 
funds 
to 
the 
implementing 
entities and better 
financial 
monitoring. 
Private 
Sector. 
Industry, 
NGOs 
and 
consumer groups 
would 
play 
an 
active 
role 
in 
creating 
consumer 
awareness 
of food and 
drug 
regulations, 
standards, 
food 
handling, 
and 
hygiene. These groups 
are 
already 
members 
of 
key 
advisory bodies 
such 
as 
the 
National 
Codex 
Committee 
for 
promotion 
of 
food 
standards. 
They 
would 
also 
extend 
help 
in 
ensuring 
nomination 
of 
appropriate 
candidates 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
for 
the 
skill 
enhancement 
training 
under 
the 
project. 
International 
Partnerships. 
The 
World 
Health 
Organization 
and 
the 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
Organization 
are 
already 
key 
partners 
in 
developing 
the 
food 
and 
drug 
safety 
program 
and 
would

Management 
of 
Project 
Implementation. 
At 
the 
central 
level 
in 
MOHFW, 
the 
project 
would 
be 
implemented through 
the 
existing 
directorates responsible 
for food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
control: 
the 
Prevention 
of 
Food 
Adulteration 
(PFA) 
directorate 
and the 
Drugs 
Control 
directorate 
under 
the 
Drug 
Controller 
General 
(see 
figure 
below). 
These 
units 
would 
manage 
their 
respective components. 
A 
Program Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
has 
been 
formed 
within 
the 
Ministry 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
Joint 
Secretary 
of 
Health. 
The 
PCU 
would 
include: 
(i) 
an 
IECiNGO 
consultant 
responsible 
for 
promoting 
consumer (and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
drugs, 
prescriber) 
awareness 
and 
knowledge 
through media 
and 
NGO 
channels; 
(ii) 
a 
procurement specialist; 
(iii) 
a 
financial controller 
and accountants;  and 
(iv) 
architects. 
All 
of 
these 
posts have already 
been 
filled 
except 
for 
the 
IECiNGO 
consultant. 
A 
senior 
officer 
from 
the 
financelincome 
tax 
cadre, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
Deputy 
Secretary, 
would 
act 
as 
Financial 
Controller 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
PCU 
would 
coordinate 
the 
activities 
of 
participating 
organizations 
and 
States, 
and 
would 
be 
integrated 
within 
the 
MOHFW 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
Joint 
Secretary, 
MOHFW 
would 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
the 
project 
and 
would 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
Drug 
Controller 
General 
of 
India 
and 
the 
Assistant 
Director 
General (PFA). 
The 
Consumer/Prescriber 
Awareness 
and 
Education 
program 
(sub-components 
2.a. 
and 
3 
.a. 
in 
the 
summary cost 
table 
in 
Section 
C.1.) 
is 
a 
critically 
important part 
of 
the 
proposed 
project. 
It 
is 
also 
a 
program 
where 
the 
MOHFW 
and 
the 
States 
would 
need 
outside expertise 
for 
successful 
implementation. 
Apreliminavy 
action 
plan 
for 
this 
program 
would 
be 
prepared 
by 
the 
MOHFW 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
Negotiations. 
The 
MOHFW 
would 
also 
contract 
with 
a 
specialized 
private 
firm 
with 
expertise 
in 
mass 
media 
and interpersonal communications 
to 
assist 
in 
finalizing 
the action 
plan 
and 
in 
implementation.

Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
1. 
Maintaining 
the 
Status 
Quo. 
As 
already noted, 
the 
current 
approach 
to 
ensuring 
safety 
and quality 
of 
foods 
and 
drugs 
has 
not 
been 
effective. 
A 
new 
approach 
needs 
to 
be 
developed 
which 
supplements 
regulation 
with 
other 
policy 
instruments. 
2. 
Addressing 
Food and 
Drugs Quality 
Separately. 
This 
alternative 
was 
rejected 
because 
it 
makes 
more 
sense 
to 
address 
food 
and 
drugs 
simultaneously. 
The 
two 
programs face 
similar 
challenges. 
Moreover, 
at 
the Central 
level 
food 
and 
drugs 
units 
are 
under 
combined 
management 
in 
the 
MOHFW, 
and 
the 
same 
is 
true 
in 
several 
States 
(e.g. 
Maharastra). 
3. 
Strengthen 
the 
Central Level or 
the 
State 
Level 
Only. 
The 
unevenness 
of 
food 
and 
drug 
quality 
assurance systems across States 
is 
an important 
concern. 
In 
addition, the 
easy 
movement 
of 
foods and 
drugs 
among the 
States 
call 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
national 
program 
rather 
than 
a series 
of 
State-specific 
programs.  Strengthening the 
central 
level 
only 
would 
also 
not 
suffice 
since 
the responsibilities between 
center 
and 
States are 
complementary.

An 
effective national 
commitment to 
food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
and safety 
requires 
shared 
responsibility 
by 
government, 
consumers, 
industry, 
consumer organizations, and 
NGOs. 
There 
has 
been a 
global 
shift 
in 
the 
approach 
to 
ensuring 
food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
and 
safety, 
which 
has 
broadened 
national 
programs 
beyond mandatory 
inspection, 
sampling 
and 
prosecution 
of 
offender. 
Alignment 
with 
international 
standards 
for 
food 
and 
drugs 
improves 
quality 
and

has 
been 
included 
in 
the 
10th 
Five 
Year 
Plan 
and 
the 
MOHFW 
is 
keen 
to 
start 
implementation 
in 
FY 
2003-04. 
17 
States 
have 
provided 
Letters 
of 
Undertaking 
for 
effectively 
implementing 
the 
project. 
An 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
has 
been 
prepared and

as 
per 
IDA 
disclosure 
policy. 
Site 
surveys 
have 
been 
completed 
for 
five 
major 
civil 
works planned 
for 
the

5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
a 
vehicle 
to 
support 
the 
long 
run 
vision 
of 
government 
in 
an 
important 
aspect 
of 
social welfare. 
Among 
the development 
assistance agencies, 
the 
Bank 
is 
best 
positioned 
to 
assist 
in 
major long-term 
policy 
reforms 
such 
as 
this 
one. 
The 
Bank 
also 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
tap 
international 
experience and coordinate 
with 
other donors 
with 
an 
interest 
in 
food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
and 
safety. 
It 
has 
an 
ongoing 
partnership 
with 
WHO 
and 
FA0 
and 
would 
further 
strengthen 
its 
collaboration 
with 
these 
agencies 
under 
the 
project.

of 
the

was 
carried 
out 
and 
is 
described 
in 
more detail 
in 
Annex

The 
estimates 
of

are 
based 
on 
benefits 
arising 
from 
improved 
food 
safety 
only; benefits 
from 
improved quality 
and 
safety 
of 
drugs 
and 
more rational 
use 
of

were 
not included 
because 
of

Improved 
food 
safety 
would 
result 
in 
the 
prevention 
of 
many 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections. 
The 
economic 
benefits 
associated 
with 
such 
prevention 
would 
include 
(i) 
medical 
costs 
avoided; 
(ii) 
loss 
of 
earnings avoided; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
value 
of 
years 
of 
life 
saved 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
lost 
because 
of 
premature death caused 
by 
food 
borne 
infections. 
For 
young 
children, 
because 
of 
better 
nutritional 
status 
from 
avoiding 
repeated 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea, 
there 
could 
also 
be 
benefits 
in 
the 
form 
of 
higher 
cognitive abilities 
later 
in 
childhood 
and 
higher 
productivity 
once 
employed. 
In 
the 
present 
illustrative 
cost 
benefit 
calculations 
only 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
have 
been 
included. 
Costs 
included 
in 
the 
calculations 
are 
the 
estimated 
costs 
of 
the 
entire 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
costs 
of 
sustaining 
the 
activities 
initiated 
under 
the 
project 
up 
to 
2017. 
Main 
assumptions 
for 
the 
cost-benejt 
analysis: 
In 
the 
base 
case, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that the 
number 
of 
annual 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
is 
initially 
(i.e., 
in 
2003) 
around 
655 
million 
(estimated 
as 
25% 
of 
total 
annual 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea). 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
this 
number 
would 
remain 
constant 
throughout 
the 
projection period 
(2003-2017). 
With 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
annual 
number 
of 
food 
borne-infections 
would 
decline 
by 
5% 
by 
year 
5 (relative 
to 
the 
2003 figure), 
remaining 
at 
that 
level 
thereafter. 
With 
these 
assumptions, 
about 
380 
million 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
are 
estimated 
to 
be 
prevented 
during 
the 
15-year 
period 
2003-20 
17- 
out 
of 
which 
about 
357 
million 
episodes 
would 
be 
mild 
and 
the 
remaining 
23 
million 
moderate 
to 
severe. 
It 
was 
also 
assumed 
that 
the 
average 
number 
of 
days 
of 
work 
lost 
per 
mild 
episode 
of 
food-borne 
infection 
is 
one day 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
child 
(wages 
lost 
by 
attendant) 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
adult 
(wages 
lost 
by 
self). 
In 
cases 
of 
moderate 
to 
severe 
episodes, 
four 
days 
of 
wages 
are 
assumed 
to 
be 
lost 
in 
case 
of 
children 
(one parent's 
wages) 
and 
seven 
days 
in 
case 
of 
adults 
(four 
days 
for 
self 
and 
three 
days 
for 
attendant). 
Average 
daily 
earnings were 
assumed 
to 
be 
US$2 
initially, 
increasing 
by 
3% 
per 
year thereafter 
(at 
constant prices).  Average 
medical 
treatment 
costs 
per 
episode 
of 
food 
infections 
were 
estimated 
to 
be 
around 
US$1 for 
mild 
episodes 
and 
US$10 
for 
moderate 
to 
severe episodes. 
A 
discount 
rate 
of 
10% 
per 
year 
was 
used 
to 
compute present 
values. 
Cost-benejt 
Results 
in 
the Base 
Case 
The 
net 
present 
value 
(NPV) 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
base case 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
positive 
at 
US$733 
million. 
About 
one-third 
of 
the 
benefits 
are 
in 
the 
form 
of 
medical 
treatment 
costs 
avoided, 
and 
the 
remaining 
two-thirds 
in 
the 
form 
of 
lost 
earnings avoided. 
The 
simulations conducted around 
the 
base 
case 
show 
that 
the 
result 
of 
a 
positive 
NF'V 
is 
robust 
(Annex 
4).

Justification for  Government 
Financing 
The 
services 
provided 
by 
a 
program 
to 
ensure 
food 
safety and 
good 
quality 
of 
drugs 
for 
a country's 
population 
(deterrence 
of 
hadl 
practices 
by 
industry 
through oversight 
and legal 
action, consumer 
education, encouragement 
of 
self-regulation) 
are 
by 
and large 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
apublic 
good 
in 
the 
Public 
Finance 
sense 
--i.e., 
the 
"consumption" 
of 
such 
services 
by 
a 
given 
person 
or 
household 
does 
not 
detract 
from 
the 
ability 
of 
other persons 
or 
households 
to 
consume 
the 
same 
services. 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
program 
accrue 
automatically 
to 
the 
entire 
population, 
and 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a government's 
program 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
(though 
not 
impossible) 
for 
private 
business 
to 
provide 
the 
same 
services and make a 
profit. 
Because 
of 
these 
considerations, 
throughout 
the 
world 
services 
to 
ensure 
food 
and 
drugs 
safety 
and 
quality 
are 
a government 
function. 
Net 
Fiscal Impact 
An 
estimate 
was 
made 
of 
the 
net 
fiscal 
impact 
the 
project 
would 
have, 
under 
the 
assumptions 
of 
the 
Base 
Case, 
and 
with 
the 
following 
additional 
assumptions: 
one 
half 
of 
moderate 
to 
severe 
ones are 
met 
by 
the 
Government. 
About one-third 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
medical 
treatment 
of 
mild 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
and 
The 
tax rate 
on 
forgone 
earnings 
avoided 
is 
13% 
(mostly consisting 
of 
indirect 
taxes). 
With 
the 
above 
assumptions, 
the 
Net 
Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
the 
project 
(in 
Present 
Value) 
would 
be positive 
at 
US$85 
million. 
This 
figure 
is 
obtained 
by 
subtracting 
the 
PV 
of 
government 
outlays 
(the 
government's 
share 
of 
project 
cost 
financing 
and 
the 
repayments 
of 
the 
IDA 
credit) 
from 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
PV 
of 
tax 
gains 
(US$74 
million) 
and 
the 
PV 
of 
government 
spending 
avoided 
on 
account 
of 
averted 
medical 
treatment 
(US$107 
million). 
Poverty 
Aspects 
As 
already noted, 
while 
the 
benefits 
of 
an 
enhanced 
food 
and 
drugs safety 
and 
quality program 
would 
be 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
entire 
population, 
a 
strong 
program 
would 
be 
especially 
important 
for 
poor 
households. 
Household 
studies 
suggest 
that 
Indian 
children 
born 
in 
households 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintile 
have 
20 
percent 
higher 
risk 
of 
suffering 
from 
diarrhea 
--a 
common manifestations 
of 
unsafe 
food-- compared 
to 
those 
from 
in 
the 
richest 
quintile. 
Market 
Analysis 
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
project included 
a basic analysis 
of 
the 
market 
for 
pharmaceuticals 
in 
India. 
The 
analysis shows a 
thriving 
industry, 
with 
an annual 
growth 
of 
about 
10% 
in 
recent 
years. 
An 
enhanced 
program 
to 
improve 
drugs 
quality 
for 
the 
Indian public 
may 
also 
be 
helpful 
in 
opening 
increased export 
opportunities 
for Indian 
industry. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex

NPV=US$ 
million; FRR

(see 
Annex

Financial 
Management 
Issues 
Financial 
management 
issues 
are 
discussed 
in 
section 
(4.4) 
below 
and 
Annex 
6(B). 
Financial 
Sustain ability 
The 
burden 
of 
recurrent 
government 
expenditure 
generated 
by 
the 
proposed 
project 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
US$10 
million 
per 
year 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project.  This 
is 
a 
very small 
amount 
by 
comparison 
with 
total 
government spending 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
(currently 
about 
US$2 
billion 
per 
year 
for 
the 
central 
government 
and 
States 
combined). 
Thus, 
since the 
program 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
given 
high 
priority 
by 
future 
governments, 
financial sustainability 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
be 
an 
issue.

Fiscal Impact: 
The 
net 
fiscal impact 
of 
the 
project 
was 
discussed 
under 
the 
economic analysis section. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
new 
government 
vision 
and enhanced 
program 
for 
ensuring 
food 
and 
drugs 
safety and 
quality, 
of 
which 
the 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
part, 
are 
in 
line 
with 
current 
international 
thinlung. 
Experience 
from 
many 
countries 
has 
shown 
that 
regulation 
by 
itself 
often 
does 
not 
produce 
the 
desired 
results, 
and 
this 
is 
true 
a 
fortiori 
in 
developing 
countries. 
This 
does 
not 
mean that 
regulation should 
be 
given 
up, 
but 
rather 
that 
it 
should 
be 
complemented 
by 
other 
approaches, 
such 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
India's 
envisaged 
enhanced 
program. 
At 
the 
same 
time, the government's 
regulatory 
apparatus 
should 
be 
provided 
with 
adequate 
resources (laboratories, 
skilled 
personnel, 
etc.) 
to 
do 
the 
job. 
4. 
Institutional: 
The 
project 
would 
have an 
important 
element 
of 
institution 
building 
within 
the 
public 
sector. 
Consumer 
education 
activities 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
are 
likely 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
consumer advocacy 
groups. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
project 
would 
be 
implemented 
through 
existing 
organizational 
arrangements 
at 
the 
center 
and 
State 
levels, 
which 
would 
be 
strengthened. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
Joint 
Secretary, 
MOHFW 
would 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
assisted 
by 
the 
Drug 
Controller 
General 
and 
the 
Assistant 
Director 
General, 
PFA. 
A 
Program Coordination 
Unit 
would 
be 
assigned 
within 
MOHFW 
to 
coordinate 
project activities and 
the 
proposed 
staffing 
is 
adequate 
to 
perform 
this 
function. 
See 
also 
Section 
C.4. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Guidelines 
for 
Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits 
(January 
1995, 
revised 
in 
January and 
August 
1996 
and 
in 
September 
1997 
and January 
1999) 
would 
apply 
to 
all 
goods and 
works 
financed 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
Guidelines 
for 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers 
(January 
1997, 
revised 
in 
September 
1997 
and January 
1999) 
would 
apply 
to 
all 
consultants' 
services 
financed 
under 
the 
project. 
Civil 
works 
in 
this 
project 
involve new 
construction 
as 
well 
as 
renovation 
of 
laboratories 
both 
at 
the 
State 
and central 
levels. 
Other 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
would 
be 
procured 
under 
the 
proposed 
project include 
laboratory materials and 
supplies, 
furniture, 
lab 
equipment, 
training 
and workshops, 
local 
I 
foreign 
consultants, 
fellowships,  and 
contracts 
for 
NGO 
services. 
Procurement 
of 
small 
items 
of 
low 
value 
would 
be 
at 
the 
State 
level. 
Remaining 
items 
would 
be 
procured 
at 
the 
central 
level 
through 
a 
procurement 
agent 
using 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding 
(NCB) 
and 
International Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB). 
The 
Hospital 
Services 
Consultancy Corporation 
(HSCC), 
a 
dependent agency 
of 
MOHFW, 
has 
been 
appointed 
on 
a 
single 
source basis 
as 
procurement 
agent 
for 
the 
project. 
All 
civil 
works, 
goods, 
equipment 
and 
furniture 
will 
be 
procured through 
this 
agency. Procurement schedules 
for 
the 
first 
year 
have 
been 
prepared 
and 
reviewed 
by 
IDA 
and 
technical specifications 
of 
equipment 
planned 
to 
be 
procured 
in 
the 
first 
year have been 
agreed. 
Detailed 
site 
surveys 
and 
plans 
for new 
works planned 
during 
the 
second year 
of 
the 
project 
also have 
been 
completed 
and 
reviewed 
by 
IDA.

Procurement 
is

in 
Annex 
6(A). 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
This 
is 
the 
first 
IDA 
project 
that 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
food 
and 
drug 
directorates 
within 
the 
MOHFW. 
The 
proposed 
financial 
management arrangements 
for 
the 
project 
are 
detailed 
in 
Annex 
6(B). 
The 
project 
would 
has 
a 
financial 
management 
system 
which would 
be 
able 
to 
adequately account 
for 
project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
Approx 
75% 
of 
the 
project 
expenditures, 
which 
includes 
the 
bulk 
of 
physical 
works, 
goods 
and 
equipment, 
services, 
trainings 
and workshops 
(delivered 
both 
at 
the 
central and 
State 
levels) 
would 
be 
budgeted, 
paid 
for 
and accounted 
for 
at 
the 
central 
level 
by 
the 
PCU. 
The 
procurement 
at 
central 
level 
would 
be 
done 
mainly 
by 
the 
central procurement 
agent 
and 
would 
include 
civil 
works, goods 
& 
equipment, 
furniture, 
and consultant services. 
The 
procurement 
agent 
would 
be 
advanced 
funds 
by 
the 
MOHFW 
and 
the 
invoices 
I 
bills 
after 
payment 
to 
the 
suppliers1 contractors 
would 
be 
certified 
by 
the 
central 
procurement 
agent 
as 
per 
the 
contractual 
terms 
and 
would 
be 
passed 
on 
to 
the 
finance and 
accounting 
section 
of 
the 
PCU 
for 
settlement 
of 
advances. 
The 
funds 
at 
the 
central 
level 
would 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
line ministry 
(MoWW) 
through 
separate 
identifiable 
budget 
heads 
in 
the 
Union 
budget 
under 
Central Administration 
of 
Drug 
Control 
and Prevention 
of 
Food 
Adulteration 
(different 
components 
I 
activities 
under 
separate 
heads). 
The 
costs 
paid 
at 
the 
State 
level 
would 
essentially 
be 
incremental operational 
costs (salaries, 
vehicle 
hire, 
office 
operating 
cost, 
maintenance 
of 
equipment and 
buildings 
and 
purchase 
of 
consumables). 
The 
funds 
for 
the 
expenditure 
at 
the 
States 
would 
be 
routed 
through 
the 
State 
Aids 
Control 
Societies (SACS) 
and 
would 
be 
available to 
the 
States 
on 
a 
reimbursement 
basis. 
A 
Financial 
Management System 
(FMS) 
for 
the 
project, 
based 
on 
a 
simplified 
software 
platform, 
has 
been designed 
to 
accurately 
record 
and 
report 
the 
project 
expenditures 
at 
the 
aggregate 
project 
level 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
within 
the 
overall reporting 
system 
as 
required 
within 
the 
government. 
The books 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
overall project 
would 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
PCU 
using 
double 
entry 
book-keeping 
through 
an 
off 
the 
shelf 
accounting software 
with 
a 
modified 
focus 
on 
using 
the 
financial information 
and 
reports 
for 
managerial 
decision-making. 
This 
would 
be 
an 
enhancement 
of 
the 
existing 
Government 
accounting 
system. 
A 
finance 
manual 
laying down 
the 
financial 
policies 
and 
procedures, 
reporting 
formats, 
flow 
of 
information, 
chart 
of 
accounts, 
external 
and 
internal 
audit 
for 
the 
project 
and operation 
of 
the 
FMS 
has 
been 
prepared. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
have 
been 
designed 
in 
consonance 
with 
the 
project 
components 
to 
track 
financial, 
physical 
and 
procurement 
related 
progress 
of 
the 
project 
and 
would 
meet the 
needs 
and 
requirements 
of 
MOHFW, 
IDA, 
and 
the 
project 
management. 
They 
would 
be 
submitted 
at 
quarterly intervals. 
Staffing 
arrangements:The 
Finance 
wing 
of 
the 
Project 
would 
be 
headed 
by 
a 
Financial 
Controller 
(of 
a 
rank 
of 
Deputy 
Secretary, 
Central 
Govt.) 
and 
would 
be 
assisted 
by 
a 
finance 
professional, 
designated 
as 
Finance Manager 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
other 
members 
of 
the finance 
team 
would 
include 
2 
junior 
level 
accountants 
(with 
IT 
background) 
& 
and other support 
level staff 
as 
required 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
SACS 
are 
adequately 
staffed 
with 
a 
financial 
controller1 Finance 
manager 
heading 
the 
finance 
function 
in 
each 
of 
the 
SACS 
and adequately supported 
by 
a 
accountant 
and 
support 
accounting 
staff. 
There 
may 
however 
be 
a 
need 
for 
additional 
staff 
(one 
accountant) 
in 
the 
larger 
states 
(five 
to 
six 
in 
number) 
from 
the 
second 
year 
onwards. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
additional 
staff, 
if 
necessary, 
would 
be 
employed 
by 
SACS 
in 
consultation 
and 
concurrence 
with 
the 
PMU of 
this 
project 
and 
the 
expenditure 
would 
be 
met 
out 
of 
this 
project. 
A 
training 
plan, 
which 
is 
detailed 
in 
the 
PIP, 
has 
been 
drawn 
up 
which 
aims 
at 
providing 
sufficient 
training to 
the 
finance staff 
in 
the proposed 
Financial 
Management 
System,

disbursement 
policies and 
procedures and the 
financial reporting 
requirements. 
Disbursement 
& 
Payment 
arrangements: 
An 
advance 
would be paid to 
the 
Central 
Procurement 
Agency 
and the 
bills 
and 
invoices 
in 
respect 
of 
civil 
works, 
goods (equipment, 
including 
office 
and laboratory 
equipment, 
furniture, materials 
and 
supplies), 
and 
services 
I 
consultancies, 
which would 
be 
procured 
through 
the 
central 
procurement 
agent, 
would 
be 
certified 
by 
this 
agent 
in 
terms 
of 
contractual 
arrangements, 
deliverables, 
quality, 
etc., 
and 
would 
be 
passed 
on 
to 
the 
PCU 
for 
settlement 
of 
advances. 
The 
Finance Section 
of 
the 
PCU 
would 
scrutinize 
the 
bills 
and 
would 
recommend 
for 
settlement 
of 
the 
advance.GO1 
would 
open 
a 
special account 
with 
the 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
India to 
receive 
the 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
credit 
would initially be 
made 
in 
the 
traditional 
system 
(reimbursement 
with 
full 
documentation and 
against statement 
of 
expenditures) 
and could be 
later 
converted 
to 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Report 
(FMR) 
based 
disbursement at 
the 
option 
of 
GO1 
and 
the 
participating 
States 
after the 
project 
entities successfully 
demonstrate 
capacity 
to 
generate 
good quality 
FMRs. 
Expenditure to 
be 
incurred 
at the 
States 
would 
be 
made available 
to 
the 
States 
on 
a 
reimbursement basis 
through 
the 
respective 
States 
Aids 
Control 
Societies. 
Retroactive 
Financing: 
Retroactive 
financing 
up 
to US$2 
15,000 
equivalent 
from 
the 
credit 
amount 
would 
support 
training, 
consultancies, 
travel, 
conferenceslmeetings, 
furniture 
and 
equipment, 
civil 
works 
for 
eligible project 
expenditures 
incurred 
one year 
before 
project 
effectiveness. 
Audit- External 
: 
Under 
the proposed audit 
arrangement 
for 
this 
project, 
unlike 
other 
centrally 
sponsored 
schemes, 
IDA 
would 
receive 
two 
sets 
of 
annual 
audit 
reports 
under the project: 
(i) 
an 
audit 
report 
in 
respect 
of 
the central 
PCU 
(including project financial 
statement) 
audited 
by 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Controller 
and 
Auditor 
General 
of 
India, 
which would 
be 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
as 
an 
independent auditor, 
under 
terms 
of 
reference agreed 
with 
IDA, 
and 
(ii) 
a 
comprehensive 
audit report 
(including 
project 
financial 
statement) 
compiled 
at 
the 
national 
level 
in 
respect 
of 
all 
the SACS, 
audited 
by 
an 
independent auditor, 
under 
terms 
of 
reference agreed 
by 
IDA. 
As 
the 
expenditure 
in 
the 
States 
would 
be 
incurred and 
accounted 
for 
by 
the 
SACS (which 
are 
currently 
audited 
by 
independent 
Chartered Accountants 
firms), 
the 
TOR 
currently 
approved 
for 
the audit 
of 
SACS 
would be 
suitably 
modified 
to 
include 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
proposed project. 
All 
such 
audit 
reports (along 
with 
project financial 
statements) 
would 
be 
consolidated 
into 
a 
single 
audit report 
by 
a 
firm 
of 
chartered 
accountants/ 
independent 
auditor 
appointed 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
Audit 
- 
Internal: 
An 
internal auditor 
would 
assess 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
project's 
financial 
management 
system, 
including 
the 
review 
of 
internal control 
mechanisms 
and procurement 
process, 
and 
suggest 
remedial 
measures 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
to 
the 
project 
management. 
The office 
of 
the 
Chief 
Controller 
of 
Accounts 
within 
MoHFW 
has 
the 
mandate 
for 
conducting 
internal audit 
of 
the 
entire 
ministry. 
A 
TOR 
specific 
to 
the 
project 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
the 
Chief 
Controller 
of 
Accounts 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
India.

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The  project 
proposes 
the 
construction 
of 
new  food 
and 
drug 
laboratories, 
and 
the 
renovation 
and 
upgrading 
of 
existing 
laboratories. 
An 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan (EMP) 
has 
been 
prepared 
and 
disclosed. 
It 
would 
minimize 
negative  environmental  impacts 
of 
current 
and 
future 
operations  and 
increase 
the 
overall 
safety  at 
the 
laboratories. 
The project 
would 
allow 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
existing national 
Good 
Laboratory 
Practices 
(GLP) Guidelines 
with 
an 
environmental 
management 
health 
and 
safety 
component 
and 
standard Codes 
of 
Practice. 
These 
would 
include 
specific 
provisions 
for 
improved 
environmental 
practices, 
worker 
safety, 
and 
activities related 
to 
procurement, 
storage

handling 
of 
chemicals 
and 
management 
of 
wastes 
in 
food 
and 
drug 
testing 
laboratories. 
A 
field 
study 
was undertaken 
of 
a sample 
of 
drug 
and 
food 
testing 
laboratories. 
Most 
of 
them 
are 
small 
laboratories, 
with 
few 
workers and 
minimal 
amount 
of 
materials 
usage 
and 
waste generation. 
While 
there 
are 
basic 
standards 
for 
safe 
management 
of 
hazardous 
chemical materials 
and 
safety 
protocols 
related 
to 
treatment 
and 
disposal 
of 
hazardous 
chemical 
wastes, 
capacity 
and 
awareness 
training 
is 
required to 
ensure 
implementation 
of 
existing 
environmental 
rules.  Site 
investigations 
indicated 
that 
there 
are 
no 
trained 
staff 
in 
environmental health and 
safety 
management 
in 
most 
of 
the laboratories. 
At 
the 
policy 
level, 
there 
is 
an 
urgent 
need 
to refine 
the 
existing 
set 
of 
laws and regulatory 
provisions 
currently 
in 
place 
to 
clearly and specifically 
address 
the 
handling 
and 
management 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals 
and 
biohazardous 
wastes 
used 
and 
generated 
in 
drug 
and 
food 
testing 
laboratories. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
EMP 
defines the 
potential 
impacts 
of 
laboratory 
upgrading and 
new 
construction and 
details 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures. 
Since the laboratories 
under the 
project 
do 
not 
handle 
drug 
development, the 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
manageable 
and 
the 
proposed 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
be 
implemented 
are standard. 
The mitigation 
measures 
recommended 
in 
the 
generic 
EMP 
will 
be 
adapted 
and 
implemented 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
identified 
project 
sites. 
The 
EMP 
envisages a 
phased 
approach, 
including 
an 
assessment 
of 
a 
representative sample 
of 
laboratories, 
formulation 
of 
Standard 
Operation 
Procedures 
and training 
modules, 
and 
implementation 
of 
monitoring. 
An 
environmental 
management 
framework 
for mitigation 
of 
main 
environmental 
issues has 
been 
prepared 
prior to 
Negotiations.

How 
have 
stakeholders 
been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the environmental impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan?  Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
The 
key 
stakeholders 
consulted 
include 
laboratory 
staff, 
food 
and 
drug 
regulatory 
personnel 
and 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
promoting 
food 
and 
drug 
safety 
and environment. 
These 
consultations 
were 
held 
through 
site 
visits 
and 
interviews. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Monitoring 
plans 
for 
implementation 
of 
safe 
laboratory 
procedures 
would 
be 
developed 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
MOHFW 
would 
be 
the 
lead 
agency 
coordinating implementation 
supported 
by 
the 
PCU. 
Each 
laboratory 
would 
have 
one 
officer 
designated 
as 
Environmental 
Health 
and 
Safety 
Officer 
(EHSO), 
who would 
be 
accountable 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMP. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
EMP 
would 
be 
included 
into 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
quality 
audit 
of 
laboratories, 
to 
enable 
periodic 
feedback, 
based 
on 
which 
refresher 
training 
on 
safety 
issues 
can 
be 
provided. 
Two 
health, safety 
and 
environmental 
surveys 
would 
be 
undertaken 
(once 
during 
the 
mid-term 
review 
and 
another 
prior 
to 
project 
closure) 
by 
a 
competent independent 
agency.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specify the 
project's 
social 
development outcomes. 
The 
key 
social 
challenge 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
engaging consumers 
and 
consumer organizations, 
as 
-I/ 
- 
Page  24
well 
as 
the 
food 
and 
drugs 
industry 
(formal 
and 
informal; 
manufacturers and 
retailers) 
in 
safety 
and 
quality 
assurance 
issues. 
The 
poor 
and uneducated 
are 
less 
aware 
of 
the 
potential 
dangers 
from 
consuming 
unsafe 
food 
and sub-standard 
drugs 
and 
are 
victims 
of 
(i) 
the 
unsafe 
practices 
in 
food 
production, 
distribution, 
and 
handling 
within 
the 
household, 
and 
(ii) 
bad 
quality 
drugs 
and inappropriate 
drug 
use 
based 
on 
non-professional 
advice. 
Existing 
consumer groups 
would 
have 
to 
be 
effectively 
used 
to 
create 
awareness 
among 
the 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Small manufacturing 
firms 
of 
food 
and 
drugs, 
and 
street 
vendors 
could 
be 
affected 
if 
regulatory 
capacity 
is 
enhanced. 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
these 
groups 
by 
providing 
guidelines 
and 
technical 
training 
on 
good manufacturing 
practices and common 
testing 
facilities. 
Information 
dissemination and 
awareness 
generation 
are 
critical 
for 
improving 
the 
public's participation 
in 
food 
and 
drug 
quality 
control. 
A 
participation 
strategy 
would 
be 
evolved 
during 
project 
implementation 
with 
roles 
for 
different 
stakeholders. 
Specific 
strategies 
would 
address 
the 
information 
needs 
of 
women's groups, female 
vendors, 
poor 
households and the 
tribal 
populations. 
The 
Information, 
Education 
and 
Communications 
(IEC) strategy 
would 
take account 
of 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
both 
providers 
(drug 
dispensers, 
food 
vendors) 
and 
consumers. 
Household 
surveys 
would 
ensure 
coverage 
of 
women, 
poor 
households and 
the 
tribal 
populations. 
No 
land 
acquisition 
would 
be 
required 
as 
the 
laboratory 
constructions 
would 
take 
place 
on 
land 
already 
in 
the possession 
of 
the 
Government. 
The 
Government 
would 
provide 
a 
certificate 
documenting that 
the 
land 
is 
free 
of 
encroachment 
and that 
no 
resettlement 
is 
warranted 
as 
there 
are 
no 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
anybody. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
Drug 
Quality 
: 
Stakeholders 
would 
include 
representatives 
of 
drug 
manufacturing 
organizations, 
medical 
practitioners, 
drug 
control 
organizations, 
Central 
Government laboratories, 
Government 
drugs 
procurement 
agencies, 
retail 
chemists, 
and 
consumers. 
Food 
Safety 
: 
Stakeholders 
would 
include 
representatives 
of 
food 
manufacturing 
organizations, 
food 
testing 
laboratories 
(government and 
private), 
consumers, 
food 
quality 
control 
agencies, 
hotels, 
street 
food 
vendors, groceries 
and 
provision 
stores. 
The 
roles 
that have been envisaged 
for 
the 
major 
stakeholders 
in 
project implementation 
are 
as 
follows: 
1. 
Food 
and 
drug 
government units 
at 
the center 
and 
State 
levels: 
To 
play 
a 
proactive 
role 
and 
move 
from 
only policing 
to 
being 
change 
agents 
- 
educating 
and 
creating 
awareness; 
2. 
Private 
sector 
: 
Food 
and 
drug 
producers 
and 
distributors 
to 
enhance 
technical quality, employ 
better 
testing 
mechanisms 
for 
process 
quality 
control. 
3, 
Consumer 
groups 
and 
NGOs: 
Greater 
role 
in 
policy 
dialogue and 
program 
actions.  Consumer 
groups 
as 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Codex Committee 
are 
playing 
an 
important 
role 
in 
public 
awareness 
and 
participation 
through 
creating 
consumer 
awareness 
of 
food 
safety 
and 
drug 
quality 
issues. 
4. 
Panchayati 
Raj Institutions 
- 
Explore possibility 
of 
better 
engagement 
of 
PRIs 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
laws 
- 
especially 
the 
food 
laws. 
5. 
Expert 
Institutions: 
Expert institutions 
would 
be closely 
involved 
in 
training, 
carrying 
out 
surveys 
and 
strengthening 
information 
systems. 
Home 
Science 
Colleges 
would 
revise 
their 
curriculae 
to 
emphasize 
hygiene, 
GMP 
and 
HACCP 
issues 
as 
well 
as 
help 
enhance 
voluntary 
compliance 
of 
food 
safety 
measures 
in 
the 
small 
scale 
food 
manufacturing 
and 
service 
industry. 
6. 
International 
Partnerships. 
The 
project 
would 
seek 
to 
complement 
the 
ongoing 
actions 
of 
WHO 
and 
FA0 
on 
providing 
training 
and 
updating 
standards.

How 
does 
the project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Many 
key 
consumer 
groups 
and 
industry 
associations 
are 
already 
involved 
with 
government 
on 
working 
committees 
related 
to food 
and 
drug 
regulation. 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
other 
health 
programs 
would 
be 
contacted 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
planned 
series 
of 
consultations 
with 
States 
and expert institutions. 
The 
home 
science 
college 
network 
has 
organized 
a 
set 
of 
consultations 
with 
its 
members, 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups interested 
in 
nutrition. 
Similarly VOICE, 
an umbrella 
group 
for 
consumer 
agencies, 
and 
the 
Delhi 
Society 
for 
Promotion 
of 
Rational Use 
of 
Drugs 
(DSPRUD) 
would 
be 
involved 
in 
the program. 
Natural 
Habitats 
(OP 
4.04, 
BP 
4.04, 
GP 
4.04) 
Forestry 
(OP 
4.36, 
GP 
4.36) 
Pest 
Management 
(OP 
4.09) 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
these 
NGOs, 
consumer groups 
and 
institutions 
would 
be 
enhanced through: 
1. 
Developing 
Client 
Charters 
for food 
and 
drugs 
laboratories 
to 
enhance 
transparency 
(at 
least 
5 
by 
mid-term). 
2. 
Designing and implementing an 
effective 
IEC 
strategy, 
and 
monitoring 
based 
on 
detailed 
surveys 
capturing the 
attitudes, 
beliefs 
and 
practices 
regarding 
food 
and 
drug 
safety 
issues. 
3. 
Creating 
a 
network 
of 
NGOs, 
industry 
associations 
and 
expert 
institutions 
such 
as 
home 
science 
colleges, 
research 
institutions 
and 
consumer 
groups 
to 
make 
the 
regulatory 
mechanism 
more 
effective 
and 
sustainable. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
PCU 
is 
to 
have 
an 
IEC/NGO 
consultant responsible 
for 
promoting 
consumer 
awareness 
through 
both 
media 
and 
NGO 
channels. 
The 
project 
design 
makes 
provision 
for 
implementation 
of 
activities 
by 
stakeholders 
including 
NGOs 
and 
industry 
associations.  These 
involve 
joint 
training, 
pilots 
for 
promoting community 
feedback 
and 
voice (complaint 
systems), 
participation 
in 
key 
working 
committees 
and 
campaigns 
to 
raise 
consumer 
awareness. 
Professional 
media 
agencies 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
promote 
public 
awareness 
and 
behavior 
change 
giving 
special 
attention 
to 
non-literate 
and 
disadvantaged 
populations. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
The 
project 
would 
monitor 
through 
surveys 
and 
special 
studies 
(e.g., 
to verify 
increased 
knowledge 
and 
behavior 
change 
among 
the 
public) and 
feedback mechanisms such 
as 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
public 
to 
lodge 
complaints.

1. 
Sustainability: 
Financial

See 
section 
E(2). 
Institutional 
Sustainability. 
As 
noted 
in 
section 
A( 
l), 
the 
project 
is 
part 
of 
a 
long-term 
program 
to 
develop 
and implement 
a 
new 
approach 
to 
food 
and 
drugs 
quality 
and 
safety. 
As 
such, 
activities 
supported 
under 
the 
project 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
continued, 
and 
reforms 
deepened, 
beyond completion 
of 
the 
proposed project.  Moreover, 
the 
project 
would 
be 
implemented through existing institutional 
arrangements 
which 
would 
also 
facilitate 
sustainability. 
Political 
Sustainability. 
As 
the 
nation 
develops 
and 
the 
population 
becomes 
increasingly 
sophisticated, 
it 
can 
be 
expected 
that the 
public’s 
demands 
for 
collective 
action 
to 
ensure 
the safety 
and 
quality 
of 
foods 
and 
drugs 
would 
grow 
steadily. 
This 
in 
turn 
would 
make 
maintaining 
and 
further developing the 
mechanisms 
for 
such 
collective action 
a 
prominent 
aspect 
of 
the regular 
political 
agenda.

The government 
of 
India 
has 
demonstrated 
a 
strong 
commitment 
by 
developing 
a 
policy 
note 
articulating 
its 
long 
term vision 
and 
the 
project 
is 
being 
proposed 
on 
the basis 
of 
this. 
Strong 
consumer 
demand 
through implementation 
of 
effective 
IEC 
strategy 
is 
expected 
to 
support 
development 
of 
enabling 
policies and 
mearues. 
The 
contents 
of 
the project’s 
IEC 
strategy 
would 
emphasize 
simple 
principles 
for 
households 
to 
recognize 
signs 
of 
unsafe 
food 
in 
the 
market 
and 
the 
hygienic 
handling 
of 
food 
within 
households. 
Periodic household 
surveys 
would 
assess 
how 
well 
the strategy 
is 
working 
and corrections 
would 
be made accordingly. 
Households 
without 
adequate 
water 
facilities 
may 
find 
it 
difficult to 
implement 
some 
of 
the 
hygiene-related 
messages 
such 
as 
frequent 
washing 
of 
hands. 
This 
is 
a 
constraint 
being 
addressed 
by 
various 
other 
government 
and 
NGO 
programs 
which 
seek 
to 
improve 
household water facilities,

households 
to 
recognize 
the 
dangers 
of 
making 
inappropriate 
use 
of 
drugs 
on 
their 
own 
initiative 
(e.g., 
their 
abuse 
of 
antibiotics). 
Periodic 
household 
surveys 
would 
assess 
how 
well 
the 
strategy 
is 
working 
and 
corrections 
would 
be 
made 
accordingly. 
It 
would 
be 
more 
difficult for 
the 
households 
to 
be 
able 
to 
recognize 
(and 
stay away 
from) 
sub-standard 
quality 
drugs 
being 
sold 
in 
the 
market, 
so 
that 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
IEC 
program may 
be 
modest 
concerning 
this 
second 
objective. 
There 
is 
no 
easy 
solution 
to 
this 
problem, 
and 
it 
will 
probably 
take 
many 
years 
before 
it 
can 
be 
ensured 
that 
regulatory 
staff 
have 
the 
right 
incentives, 
i.e., 
that 
their 
main 
concern 
be 
to 
serve 
the 
public 
(and 
it 
is 
precisely 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
it 
is 
very important 
that 
India’s 
approach 
to 
ensuring 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
foods and 
drugs 
be 
expanded 
to 
include 
consumer 
education and 
measures 
to 
encourage 
industry 
self-regulation). 
For 
laboratory 
staff, 
the 
project 
would 
support 
independent 
audits, 
which 
would 
to 
an 
extent 
deter 
inappropriate 
behavior 
by 
laboratory 
staff. 
This 
problem 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
immediately 
above, 
i.e., 
incentives 
of 
regulatory staff 
are 
no 
conducive 
to 
uniformly 
good 
behavior. 
In 
addition 
to 
strong 
focus 
on 
consumer 
education, 
in 
some states 
client 
charters 
would 
be 
piloted 
to 
give 
better 
voice 
to 
the 
consumers. 
The 
importance 
of 
this 
risk 
is 
difficult 
to 
assess 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a detailed economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
small 
and 
medium 
size 
segments 
of 
the 
food 
and 
drugs 
industries. 
It 
is 
reasonable 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
certain 
distribution 
of 
the 
firms 
by 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
potential 
profit 
gain 
or 
loss 
from 
adopting 
HACCP, 
and that 
the 
firms 
that 
would profit 
from 
such 
move 
would 
be 
the 
ones 
to 
adopt 
HACCP. 
A 
similar 
argument 
as 
in 
the 
risk 
immediately 
above 
would 
apply 
here 
also.

As

The

from

is 
unlikely 
to 
provoke 
much 
opposition,

what 
could be 
the

Detailed Project Description 
INDIA: 
Food 
and Drugs Capacity Building Project 
Project Objectives and Description 
Food 
and 
drug 
regulatory 
activity 
is 
an essential 
public 
health 
function 
that 
contributes 
to 
good 
health. 
In 
India, 
quality 
assurance 
monitoring 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
while 
the 
production 
of 
drugs 
is 
overseen 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Chemicals 
& 
Fertilizers. 
The 
Ministries 
of 
Commerce 
and 
Agriculture 
are 
also 
involved 
in 
the 
food 
chain 
and safety 
standards. 
Food 
and 
drugs 
administration 
is 
on 
the 
concurrent 
list 
of 
the 
Indian 
constitution 
with 
substantial 
responsibility 
being 
shared 
with 
the 
States. 
India 
has 
a large and 
rapidly 
expanding 
food 
and 
drugs 
industry. 
The 
pharmaceuticals 
industry 
now 
ranks 
as 
the 
worlds 
third 
largest 
in 
terms 
of 
volume 
and 
is 
growing 
at 
over 
10% 
annually. 
Drugs 
are 
widely 
available 
in 
the 
Indian 
market 
and pharmaceuticals 
are 
a large and 
growing 
component 
of 
health 
care 
expenditure. 
On 
the 
food 
side, 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
Indian population 
continues 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
small 
and 
informal 
sectors, 
including 
street 
food 
vendors. 
However, 
with 
growing 
urbanization, increasing 
numbers 
of 
Indians 
are 
consuming 
processed 
food 
products 
- 
both 
domestic 
and 
imported. 
There 
is 
increasing concern 
for 
consumer 
protection, 
particularly 
for 
the 
poor, 
from 
unsafe and 
poor 
quality 
foods 
and 
drugs. 
While 
there 
are 
regulations 
for 
quality 
assurance, 
enforcement 
is 
weak and 
methods outdated.  Together 
with 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructure, a 
new 
approach, 
based 
on 
self-regulation,  consumer education, and 
public-private 
partnerships, 
is 
needed 
for 
carrying 
out 
these 
essential 
public 
health 
functions. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
primary 
concern 
for public 
safety, 
investments 
in 
food 
and 
drug 
safety have an 
intemational 
trade dimension. 
Improved food 
and 
drug 
regulation 
and safety 
would 
contribute 
to 
increased 
confidence 
in 
Indian 
products, 
making 
them 
more 
competitive 
internally 
and 
for 
exports 
in 
global 
markets. 
The 
scope 
of 
the 
project’s physical 
investments 
will 
comprise 
central and 
selected 
state 
laboratories, 
based 
on 
needs. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
several studies 
and 
reviews 
will 
be 
conducted 
to 
facilitate 
an 
informed 
policy 
dialogue 
on 
the 
evolving 
functions and 
long 
term 
development 
of 
food 
and 
drug 
administration 
in 
India. 
The 
project 
is 
part 
of 
a Central 
Sector Program, 
with 
both 
financial 
sponsorship 
and 
major 
implementation 
role 
by 
the 
Center and 
active 
participation 
of 
the 
states.  Some 
important related 
areas, 
such 
as 
prescribing 
practices, 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
medical 
devices 
including 
those 
emitting 
radiation, and 
biological 
products 
such 
as 
vaccines, have 
been 
left 
outside 
the 
ambit 
of 
this 
project 
to 
enable 
a 
sharper 
focus 
on 
the 
most 
basic 
problems 
affecting 
the 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
foods 
and 
drugs. 
The 
Project 
consists 
of 
three 
components 
as 
described 
below. 
By

would 
support 
studies 
and technical 
assistance 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing options 
for 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
in 
the 
following

more 
specific roles 
in 
public 
and 
private 
partnerships 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
rule-making, auditing, 
reporting 
on 
compliance; 
(viii) 
improving 
governance, 
especially 
in 
markets 
patronized 
by 
the 
poor, 
and 
(ix) obtaining 
consumer 
feedback. 
e 
Workshops 
and consultations 
with 
various 
groups 
of 
stakeholders 
concerning options 
for 
institutional 
and 
policy 
reform. 
The establishment 
and operation 
of 
a 
central Program Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU). 
A 
Program 
Coordination 
Unit 
would 
be 
established 
at 
MOHFW. 
Key 
functions 
of 
the 
PCU 
would 
include: 
coordination 
with 
other 
line 
departments, 
ministries 
and technical 
agencies; 
project 
implementation 
including 
preparation 
of 
annual 
action 
plans; 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation; 
financial 
management; 
and procurement 
of 
project 
inputs. 
The 
functions 
of 
this 
unit 
will 
be 
integrated 
within 
MOHFW 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project. 
Improvement 
of 
central physical facilities for 
food 
and 
drugs oversight, 
and related staffing. 
This 
sub 
component 
would 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
central 
government 
through 
critical 
infrastructure 
and 
human 
resource development 
inputs 
such 
as 
training 
and 
fellowships. 
Monitoring 
activities, 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
household 
surveys 
to 
assess 
public 
perceptions 
and 
knowledge 
about 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
foods and 
drugs, 
and 
the 
organization 
of 
independent audits 
of 
public 
and 
private 
laboratories. 
1. 
Annual 
household surveys. 
These 
surveys 
would 
be 
undertaken 
by 
independent 
agencieslconsumer groups 
covering 
a representative sample 
of 
population 
using 
standardized 
instruments 
to 
understand 
community 
perceptions 
and 
practices 
related 
to 
food 
safety 
and 
drug 
quality. 
An 
expert 
committee 
would 
provide 
technical 
advice and 
monitor 
the 
quality 
of 
these 
surveys. 
Four 
regional 
agencies 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordination 
of 
survey 
activities, 
selection 
of 
survey 
agencies, 
quality 
assurance 
and 
compilation 
of 
the 
reports. 
In 
each 
of 
the 
major 
States 
one 
survey 
agency 
would 
be 
selected 
to 
undertake 
the 
household 
survey 
covering 
a 
representative sample 
between 
500-600 
households. 
Three 
rounds 
of 
households 
surveys 
are 
envisaged 
during 
the 
project 
period. 
After 
analysis 
of 
data 
the 
findings 
would 
be 
discussed 
in 
each 
region 
in 
a 
workshop 
which 
would 
be followed 
by 
a 
national 
consultation. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
survey 
would 
be 
used 
as 
inputs 
for 
validating 
and 
improving 
IEC 
messages. 
2. 
Audit 
ofprivate 
andpublic 
testing 
laboratories. 
MOHFW 
already 
has 
a 
panel 
of 
independent 
experts 
for 
auditing 
public 
testing 
laboratories 
and 
assess 
the 
implementation 
status 
of 
good 
manufacturing and 
laboratory 
practices 
introduced 
under 
the schedule 
M 
of 
the 
Drugs 
and 
Cosmetics 
Act. 
This 
system 
which 
is 
well 
implemented 
in 
the 
drug 
sector 
would 
be 
continued 
under 
the 
project 
and 
extended 
to 
cover recognized 
private 
testing 
laboratories 
also.

audits have also been started 
for 
the 
food 
sector. 
3. 
Auditing 
for 
compliance 
of 
environmental 
management 
plan. 
A 
consultant 
agency 
would 
be 
hired 
to 
oversee 
the 
implementation 
of 
agreed 
environmental 
management 
plan. 
e 
The 
establishment 
and operation 
of 
a 
computerized 
management 
information 
system 
to 
enhance 
information flows 
and 
coordination 
between 
the 
central and 
State 
regulatory 
agencies. 
A 
computerized 
information networking 
system 
for food 
safety-related 
oversight 
would 
be 
supported 
to 
ensure 
timely 
and comprehensive 
exchange 
of 
information 
between 
the 
central 
and 
State 
food 
laboratories. 
GO1 
is 
already 
in 
the 
final 
phase 
of 
implementing 
a 
similar 
networking 
system 
for 
drug 
regulatory 
agencies. 
The 
Policy 
Development, 
Program Coordination 
and 
Monitoring 
component 
would 
finance consultants 
for 
studies 
and technical 
assistance, 
workshops, 
goods 
including 
computers 
and 
software, 
civil 
works, 
and 
incremental operating 
costs. 
Project Component 
2 
- 
US$44.35 
million 
Food 
Quality 
and 
Safety 
This 
component 
would 
consist 
of 
activities 
to 
strengthen 
the 
government's 
oversight 
and 
regulatory 
capacity 
for 
food 
safety 
at 
the 
central 
and 
State 
levels, 
to 
educate 
consumers 
on 
matters 
related 
to 
food 
safety, 
and 
to 
upgrade 
related 
skills 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Specific 
activities 
would 
include: 
A 
new 
program 
for 
building 
consumer awareness 
and 
knowledge 
of 
food 
safety 
issues. 
This 
sub-component 
would 
support 
initiatives 
to 
raise consumer 
awareness 
and knowledge 
of 
and 
participation 
in 
issues 
concerning 
food 
safety. 
It 
would 
also support strategies 
to 
disseminate 
such 
information 
along 
the 
food 
supply 
chain, 
including 
small 
manufacturers, 
retailers 
and 
street 
food 
vendors. 
The 
objective 
would 
be 
to 
encourage 
consumers 
to 
adopt 
quality 
and safety 
as 
criteria 
in 
making 
choices 
of 
food 
products, 
retail 
outlets and 
street 
vendors, 
as 
well 
as 
adopting 
safe 
practices 
for 
the 
handling 
of 
food 
within 
the 
household.  Services 
of 
professional 
media 
agencies, 
NGOs 
and consumer organizations 
would 
be 
utilized 
to 
develop and 
implement 
strategies. 
Training 
of 
about 
2,000 
inspectors 
and 
500 
analysts 
in 
public 
sector 
laboratories 
and 
recruitment 
of 
additional 
qualijied 
stafJ: 
Training 
of 
about 
1,000 
stafffrom  the 
private 
sector. 
Training in 
advocacy 
and 
other 
skills 
for 
20 
umbrella 
consumer 
organizations. 
The 
training 
sub-component 
would 
support 
enhancement 
of 
regulatory 
staff 
skills 
through 
in-service 
training, 
and 
joint 
training 
of 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
personnel. 
For 
private 
sector personnel, 
emphasis 
would 
be 
placed 
on 
the 
adoption 
of 
processes 
such 
as 
GMP 
and 
HACCP. Priority would 
be 
given 
to 
personnel 
from 
small 
and 
medium 
sized 
manufacturers 
for 
such 
training. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project, 
2000 
food 
inspectors, 
500 
analysts 
working 
in 
public 
laboratories 
and 
1000 
professionals 
from 
private 
sector 
and 
consumer organizations 
would 
have 
been 
trained 
by 
national 
apex 
training 
centers. 
e 
Development 
and 
dissemination 
of 
Hazard 
Analysis 
Critical 
Control 
Point 
(EtACCP) 
standards. 
The 
Hazard Analysis 
and 
Critical 
Control 
Point (HACCP) 
system 
is 
the new, 
efficient 
and 
internationally 
accepted 
scientific 
way 
of 
quality 
assurance. 
HACCP 
renders 
the 
identification, 
evaluation, 
and 
control 
of 
health 
hazards 
systematic 
by 
primarily 
stressing 
on 
quality control 
at 
the 
source 
i.e., 
at 
the 
manufacturing level. 
It 
can 
be 
applied 
at 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
cycle, 
from 
primary 
production to

New 
construction, renovation 
and 
equipping 
of 
central 
and 
State 
laboratories. 
During 
preparation a 
number 
of 
key 
infrastructure 
gaps 
were 
identified 
that hamper 
timely 
and 
comprehensive 
testing 
of 
food 
samples 
by 
central 
government laboratories. 
This 
sub-component 
supports 
inputs 
to 
fill 
those 
gaps, 
as 
well 
as 
gaps 
at 
the 
State 
level. 
With 
increased 
international 
trade 
in 
food 
products, 
the 
central 
laboratories 
handling 
food 
imports 
and exports 
at 
ports 
and 
international 
borders 
would 
be 
given 
priority for 
upgrading. 
Specifically, 
the 
following 
central 
government 
facilities 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(i) 
new construction 
and 
equipping 
of 
10 
laboratories 
in 
Mumbai, 
Ghaziabad, 
Kandla, 
Attari, 
Raxaul, 
Sonali and 
four 
locations along 
the 
Indo-Nepal 
border; 
(ii) 
renovation, upgrading, 
and 
equipping 
of 
11 
laboratory 
facilities 
and 
public 
health offices 
at 
the 
following 
cities 
and 
border 
sites: 
Kandla, 
Mumbai, 
Chennai, 
Kolkata, 
Delhi 
including 
ICD, 
Kochi, 
Visakhapatnam,

Jodhpur, Raxual, Sonali, 
National 
Institute 
of 
Nutrition, 
Hyderabad 
and 
Central 
Food 
Technology 
Research 
Institute, 
Mysore. 
At 
the 
State 
level, 
there 
are 
currently 
79 
food 
testing 
laboratories, 
including 
some 
managed 
by 
local 
bodies. 
Most 
of 
these 
laboratories 
are 
able 
to 
perform 
only routine 
analysis 
and 
are 
not 
in 
a 
position to 
test 
the 
latest 
food 
additives and 
high 
risk 
contaminants, 
including microbiological 
contaminants, 
which 
are 
emerging 
as 
important 
challenges 
of 
the 
future. 
Further, 
the 
three 
newly 
created 
states 
(Chattisgarh, Jharkhand 
and Uttaranchal) 
urgently 
need 
food 
testing 
laboratories 
to 
perform 
their 
statutory 
oversight 
function. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
infrastructure 
inputs 
for 
these 
new 
and 
existing 
laboratories. 
The 
project 
would 
ensure 
that 
all 
State 
laboratories adopt 
minimum 
quality 
standards 
in 
testing 
by 
filling 
critical 
infrastructure 
gaps. 
Specifically, 
the 
project 
would 
finance 
civil 
works, 
furniture, 
equipment, 
laboratory 
supplies, 
and 
incremental 
operating 
and maintenance 
costs 
in 
order 
to: 
(i) 
construct 
and 
equip 
nine 
State 
laboratories 
in 
Visakhapatnam, Gangtok, 
Imphal, 
Chennai, 
Raipur, 
Ranchi, Rudrapur, 
Panaji 
and Gorakhpur; 
and 
(ii) 
renovate 
and 
upgrade 
existing facilities 
at 
six 
places 
in 
Shillong, 
Kohima, 
Jaipur, Baroda, 
Bhuj 
and 
Moreh. 
The 
Food 
Safety component 
would 
finance 
training, technical 
assistance, 
consultants, 
contracting media 
agencies 
and 
NGOs, 
media 
time, equipment,

Project 
Component 
3 
- 
US$21.65

This 
component 
would 
consist 
of 
activities 
to 
strengthen 
the 
government's 
oversight 
and 
regulatory 
capacity 
for 
ensuring 
drugs 
quality 
at 
the 
central and 
State 
levels, 
to 
educate 
consumers 
on 
matters 
related 
to 
drugs 
quality 
and 
safety, and 
to 
upgrade 
related 
skills 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Specific 
activities 
would 
include: 
Information  and 
education 
activities 
to improve 
consumer 
and 
prescriber 
awareness 
and 
behavior 
regarding quality 
and 
rational 
use 
of 
drugs, 
carried 
out 
with 
the 
support 
of 
professional 
media 
agencies 
and 
NGOs. 
This 
sub 
component 
would 
support 
initiatives 
to 
raise 
consumer 
and 
prescriber 
awareness 
and knowledge 
of 
and 
participation 
in 
issues 
concerning 
drug 
quality 
and 
safety. 
It 
would 
also support strategies 
to 
disseminate such 
information 
along 
the 
drug 
supply 
chain, 
including 
small 
manufacturers 
and retailers. 
The 
objective 
would 
be 
to 
encourage consumers 
to 
adopt 
quality 
and 
safety 
as 
criteria 
in 
making 
choices 
of 
drugs 
and 
retail 
outlets.  Services 
of 
professional 
media 
agencies, 
NGOs 
and 
consumer 
organizations 
would 
be 
utilized 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
strategies.

and 
joint 
training 
of 
public

The 
emphasis 
would 
be 
on 
skill

for 
personnel 
of 
small

By 
the 
end 
of 
the

workers 
from 
small

industry, 
and 
625 
staff 
and

would 
have 
been

Updating 
and

ofpharmaceutical 
standards. 
The 
Indian 
Pharmacopoeia, 
the 
official 
book 
of 
standards 
for 
drugs 
and 
their 
formulations, 
is 
outdated 
and 
does 
not 
reflect 
many 
recently 
developed 
drugs. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
the 
updating 
of 
the 
Pharmacopoeia and 
its 
dissemination. 
New 
construction and equipping 
of 
one 
central 
andfive 
State 
drug

laboratories. 
Renovation 
and equipping 
of 
one 
existing 
drug 
testing 
laboratory at 
central 
and 
twelve 
laboratories 
at 
State levels. 
As 
per 
the 
national 
drug 
policy, 
the 
central 
govenunent laboratories 
are 
to function 
as 
appellate 
authorities 
and 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
test 
the 
imported 
drugs 
as 
well 
as 
blood 
products. 
To 
reduce 
the 
backlog 
and 
enhance 
the 
range 
of 
tests, 
the 
project 
would 
support 
building 
of 
a 
new 
Central 
drug 
laboratory 
at 
Mumbai 
and 
renovation 
of 
the 
Central 
India 
Pharmacopoeia laboratory 
at 
Ghaziabad. 
At 
the 
State 
level, 
limitations 
in 
testing 
drug 
samples 
are 
related 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
sophisticated 
instruments, 
lack 
of 
trained 
analysts, shortage 
of 
funds 
to 
procure 
reagents 
for 
the 
new 
instruments, 
lack 
of 
adequate 
instruments 
and understaffing. 
To 
address 
these 
constraints and 
to 
increase 
sample 
testing 
three-fold 
(from 
about 
36,000 
to 
100,000) 
over 
the 
project 
period, 
this 
sub 
component 
would 
finance 
civil 
works, 
furniture,

laboratory 
supplies, 
and 
incremental operating 
and maintenance 
costs 
to construct 
and

If 
the difference 
between 
the present 
value 
of 
financial and 
economic 
flows 
is 
large and 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
taxes 
and 
subsidies, a 
brief 
explanation 
of 
the 
difference 
is 
warranted, 
e.g. 
"The value 
of 
financial 
benefits 
is 
less 
than that 
of 
economic benefits 
because 
of 
controls 
on 
electricity 
tariffs." 
Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
Improved 
food 
safety 
would 
result 
in 
the 
prevention 
of 
many 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections. 
The 
economic 
benefits 
associated 
with 
such 
prevention 
would 
include 
(i) 
medical 
costs 
avoided; 
(ii) 
loss 
of 
earnings avoided; and 
(iii) 
the 
value 
of 
years 
of 
life 
saved 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
lost 
because 
of 
premature death 
caused 
by 
food 
borne infections. 
For 
young 
children, 
because 
of 
better 
nutritional 
status 
from 
avoiding 
repeated 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea, 
there 
could 
also 
be 
benefits 
in 
the 
form 
of 
higher 
cognitive abilities 
later 
in 
childhood 
and 
higher 
productivity 
once employed. 
In 
the 
present 
illustrative 
cost 
benefit 
calculations 
only 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
have 
been 
included. 
The 
calculations 
do 
not 
include 
any 
benefits 
accruing 
to 
society 
on 
account 
of 
better 
quality 
drugs 
and 
more 
rational 
use 
of 
drugs 
by 
consumers (the 
types 
of 
benefits 
in 
the 
case 
of 
drugs 
would 
be 
similar 
to 
those described 
for food 
safety). 
Costs 
included 
in 
the 
calculation 
are 
the 
estimated 
costs 
of 
the 
entire 
project, 
which 
are 
shown 
in 
Annex 
3. 
The 
post-project annualized 
costs 
of 
continuing 
the 
project activities 
up 
to 
2017 have 
been 
estimated 
at 
USSlO 
million 
per 
year. 
Main 
assumptions 
for 
the cost-benept 
analysis: 
In 
the 
base 
case, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
number 
of 
annual 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
is 
initially 
- 
35 
- 
Page  42
(i.e., 
in 
2003) 
around 
655 
million 
(estimated 
as 
25% 
of 
total 
annual 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea). 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
this 
number 
would 
remain 
constant 
throughout the 
projection period 
(2003-2017). 
With 
the project, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the annual number 
of 
food 
borne-infections 
would 
decline 
by 
5% 
by 
year 
5 
(relative 
to 
the 
2003 
figure), 
remaining 
at 
that 
level 
thereafter. 
With 
these 
assumptions, 
about 
380 
million 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
are 
estimated 
to 
be 
prevented 
during 
the 
15-year 
period 
2003-2017-- 
out 
of 
which 
357 
million 
episodes 
would be 
mild 
and the 
remaining 
23 
million 
moderate

severe. 
Other 
assumptions used 
in 
the 
cost-benefit

are:

Cost-benefit Results 
in 
the Base 
Case 
The net 
present value 
(NPV) 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
base 
case 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
positive 
at

About 
one-third 
of 
the benefits 
are 
in 
the 
form

Net 
Fiscal 
Impact 
An 
estimate 
was 
made 
of 
the 
net fiscal 
impact 
the 
project 
would 
have, 
under the 
assumptions 
of 
the 
Base 
Case, 
and 
with 
the 
following 
additional 
two 
assumptions: 
e 
About 
one-third 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
medical 
treatment 
of 
mild 
episodes 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
and 
The 
tax 
rate 
on 
forgone 
earnings 
avoided 
is 
13% 
(mostly consisting 
of 
indirect 
taxes). 
one 
half 
of 
moderate 
to 
severe ones are 
met 
by 
the Government. 
e 
With 
the 
above 
assumptions, 
the 
Net 
Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
the 
project 
(in 
Present 
Value) 
would 
be 
positive 
at 
USS85 
million. 
This 
figure 
is 
obtained 
by 
subtracting the 
PV 
of 
government 
outlays 
(the government’s 
share 
of 
project 
cost 
financing and 
the 
repayments 
of 
the 
IDA 
credit) 
from 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
PV 
of 
tax 
gains 
(US$74 
million) 
and 
the 
PV 
of 
government spending 
avoided 
on 
account 
of 
averted 
medical 
treatment 
(US$107 
million).

Sensitivity analysis 
/ 
Switching 
values 
of 
critical 
items: 
The most 
uncertain 
variables 
in 
the 
above 
estimate 
of 
Net 
Present 
Value 
are: 
(i) 
the annual number 
of 
food-borne 
infections 
in 
the 
without-project situation 
and 
(ii) 
the 
percentage 
of 
such 
episodes 
that 
would 
be 
prevented 
in 
the 
with-project situation. 
Some 
alternative 
scenarios were 
examined 
in 
this 
regard. 
The 
NPV 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
lower 
the 
lower 
the 
number 
of 
food-bome 
infections 
in 
the 
without-project situation 
and the 
lower 
the 
percentage 
of 
episodes 
prevented 
in 
the 
with-project situation. 
For 
example, 
keeping 
(i) 
as 
in 
the 
Base 
Case, 
if 
we 
assumed 
that 
in 
the 
with-project 
situation 
the number 
of 
infections 
would 
be 
lower 
by 
2% 
instead 
of 
5% 
as 
in 
the Base 
Case, 
the 
NPV 
would fall 
to 
US246 
million. 
If 
it 
were 
lower 
by 
only 
1%, 
the 
NPV 
would 
still 
be 
positive 
at 
US$69 
million. 
Hence 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
infections 
in 
the 
with-project 
case 
would 
have 
to 
be 
less 
than 
1% 
for 
the 
NPV 
to 
fall 
to 
zero. 
Conversely, 
if 
we 
kept 
(ii) 
as 
in 
the 
Base 
Case, 
and 
assumed 
that 
the 
number 
of 
infections 
in 
the 
without-project situation 
would 
be 
only 
50% 
of 
what 
was 
assumed 
for 
the Base 
Case, 
the 
NPV 
would 
fall 
to 
US316 
million. 
Even 
if 
(i) 
were 
only 
20% 
of 
what 
was 
assumed 
in 
the 
Base 
Case 
the 
NPV 
would 
still 
be 
positive 
at 
US$62 
million. 
An 
NPV 
value 
of 
zero 
is 
only 
reached 
when 
(i) 
is 
only 
about 
15% 
of 
what 
was 
assumed 
in 
the 
Base 
Case. 
The 
above 
results, together 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
several 
important 
categories 
of 
project 
benefits 
were 
left 
out 
of 
the 
calculation 
(as 
already 
indicated), 
suggest 
that 
the 
NPV 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
positive.

awarded 
under 
National 
Shopping 
procedures 
by 
the 
Laboratories and 
at 
National 
Level 
by 
the 
Procurement Support 
Agency 
as 
the 
value 
of 
each 
contract 
will 
be 
below 
US 
$30,000 
equivalent. 
Furniture: 
The 
scope 
involves 
procurement 
of 
office 
furniture 
like 
chairs, tables, 
[iv] 
reagents,

944 
packages 
in 
the 
range 
of 
US 
$0.0001 
million 
to

million. 
Since 
the 
value 
of 
each 
item 
will 
be 
small, 
materials 
are 
hazardous 
/ 
inflammable and 
also breakable, 
these 
will 
be 
procured 
by 
the various laboratories 
under 
National 
Shopping 
procedures. 
Materials 
& 
Supplies: 
The 
items 
to

standards 
are 
used 
by 
the 
Central

Indigenous 
production 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
demand and 
these are 
to 
be 
imported 
from 
overseas. 
These 
will, 
therefore, 
be 
procured 
under

I. 
Post 
Award 
Review: 
Because 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
operation, 
a 
large 
number 
of 
contracts 
would 
be 
below 
prior 
review 
limits. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
project 
will 
have about 
4,000 
contracts 
over a 
five 
year 
period. Except 
a 
few 
contracts, 
all 
other contracts 
will 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
US 
S 
100 
to 
S 
30,000. 
The 
project 
itself 
provides 
for 
a 
self 
audit to 
be 
conducted 
by 
independent 
auditors 
hired 
by 
the 
Borrower for 
expenditures 
as 
well 
as 
procurement reviews 
for 
contracts 
under 
national 
shopping 
procedures. 
The 
normal 
Bank’s 
requirement 
of 
ex-post 
review 
of 
not 
less 
than 
1 
in 
5 
contracts 
for 
high 
risk 
project 
can 
not 
be 
achieved 
in 
this 
project 
due 
to 
resource constraints, since annual 
budget 
allocations 
only 
allow for 
a 
total 
of 
roughly 
1,000 
ex-post contract 
reviews 
for 
the 
entire 
India 
Portfolio.  Given 
the 
sheer 
numbers 
of 
contracts 
envisioned 
in 
this 
project, 
the 
Bank’s resource constraints, 
the 
mitigating 
effect 
of 
the 
self 
audit and 
technical 
audits 
mentioned 
above, 
we 
would 
consider 
the 
“benchmark’ 
review 
level 
of 
1 
in 
5 
contracts 
to 
be 
excessively large 
for 
this 
type 
of 
operation. 
In 
addition 
to 
a 
review 
of 
the 
independent 
self-audit reports 
called 
for 
in 
this 
project, 
Bank 
staff 
will 
also 
conduct 
post award reviews 
during 
supervision 
missions. 
These 
reviews 
will 
be 
periodically 
supplemented 
by 
an 
appropriate 
allocation 
of 
random 
ex-post 
reviews conducted 
by 
firms 
engaged 
by 
the 
Region 
for 
post award 
review 
coverage 
on 
the 
India portfolio 
as 
a 
whole.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial Management 
Assessment 
The 
project 
has 
a 
financial 
management 
system, 
which 
would 
be 
able 
to 
adequately 
account 
and 
report 
the project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
Mitigation 
Controller 
Finance 
(Deputy 
Secretary) 
and 
Finance 
Manager 
(qualified 
finance professional) have 
been 
olaced 
at 
the 
PCU. 
Country 
Specific 
Issues 
An 
existing 
accounting 
system 
which 
primarily 
focuses 
on 
book 
keeping, 
and 
not 
on 
financial 
management 
The 
following 
generic 
country 
level 
issues 
and 
specific 
resolutions 
will 
apply: 
A 
simple 
FMS, 
with 
required 
levels 
of 
computerization, 
has 
been 
developed 
under 
the 
project. 
A 
Finance 
manual 
has 
also 
been developed 
for 
the project, 
which 
focuses 
on 
financial 
reporting 
and monitoring. 
(i) 
GoI’s 
existing 
accounting 
system 
concentrates 
mainly 
on 
book 
keeping 
and 
transactional 
control 
over 
expenditures 
and 
there 
is 
little 
in 
the 
way 
of 
a 
concept 
of 
financial 
management 
information being 
used 
for 
decision 
making. 
However, a 
separate 
projectfinancial 
management system has 
been 
designed 
for 
the 
project to 
address 
this 
issue 
which 
will 
enable 
generation 
of 
reliable 
financial 
reports 
for 
enabling 
timely managerial decision making. 
(ii) 
The 
issue 
of 
availability 
of 
funds 
on 
a 
timely 
basis 
to 
the 
project 
implementing 
entity 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
this 
project 
as 
the 
funds 
to 
meet 
the expenditure 
at 
the 
States 
will 
be 
remitted directly 
to 
the 
State 
Aids 
Control 
Societies 
(SACS) 
(iii) 
Quality and 
timeliness 
of 
audit 
reports 
as 
the audit 
of 
the 
project 
(PCU) 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
C 
& 
AG, 
India for 
centrally funded 
portion 
of 
the project. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
the 
MoHFW& 
C&AGS 
office 
that 
the 
project 
financial 
statements generated 
by 
the 
project would 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
TOR 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
consented 
to 
by 
the 
C 
& 
AG’s

Finance 
Staffing 
& 
training 
The 
Finance 
wing 
of 
the 
Project 
would 
be 
headed 
by 
a 
Financial Controller 
(of 
a 
rank 
of 
Deputy 
Secretary, 
Central 
Govt.) 
and 
would 
be 
assisted 
by 
a finance 
professional, designated 
as 
Finance 
Manager 
for 
the 
project. 
They 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
establishment 
of 
the agreed 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
including 
Project 
Financial 
Management System (PFMS), 
providing 
timely 
financial 
reports 
to 
the 
stakeholders 
including 
the 
Bank, 
ensuring 
smooth and 
timely 
flow 
of 
funds 
and 
providing 
overall 
guidance 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
issues 
for 
the 
project.  The 
other 
members 
of 
the 
finance team 
would 
include 
2 
junior 
level 
accountants 
& 
and other support 
level 
staff 
as 
required 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
SACS 
are 
adequately 
staffed 
with 
a 
financial 
controller1 Finance 
manager 
heading 
the 
finance 
function 
in 
each 
of 
the 
SACS 
and 
adequately supported 
by 
a 
accountant and 
support 
accounting staff. 
As 
the expenditure 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
states 
is 
projected 
to 
be 
limited, 
it 
has 
been 
discussed and agreed 
with 
the 
NACO 
(the 
PCU 
of 
the 
2nd 
National 
Aids 
Control 
Project that 
the 
existing 
staff 
would 
be 
adequate 
to 
take 
care 
of 
the 
accounting function. 
There 
may 
however 
be 
a 
need 
for 
additional staff 
(one 
accountant) 
in 
the 
larger 
states 
(5-6 
in 
no.) 
from 
the 
second 
year onwards. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed that 
additional 
staff, 
if 
necessary, 
would 
be 
employed 
by 
SACS 
in 
consultation 
and 
concurrence 
with 
the 
PMU 
of 
this 
project 
and 
the 
expenditure 
would 
be 
met 
out 
of 
this 
project. 
A 
training 
plan, 
which 
is 
detailed 
in 
the 
PIP, 
has 
been 
drawn 
up 
which 
aims 
at 
providing 
sufficient 
training to 
the finance 
staff 
in 
the 
proposed 
Financial 
Management 
System, 
disbursement 
policies 
& 
procedures 
and 
the 
financial reporting 
requirements. 
The 
staff 
would 
also 
be 
provided 
on-the-job 
training 
at 
other 
projects 
executed 
at 
the 
central Government 
of 
India 
(MoHFW 
and 
Mom) 
Budgeting, 
Fund 
Flows 
and expenditure booking 
More 
than 
75% 
of 
the 
project 
expenditures 
would 
be 
budgeted, 
paid 
for 
and 
accounted 
at 
the 
central 
level 
by 
the 
PCU. 
This 
would 
also 
include 
the 
bulk 
of 
physical 
works,  goods 
& 
equipment, 
services, 
trainings  and 
workshops 
which 
will 
be 
delivered 
both 
at the central 
& 
state 
level. 
The 
procurement 
at 
central 
level 
would 
be 
done 
mainly 
by 
the 
central procurement 
agent 
and 
would 
include 
civil 
works, 
goods 
& 
equipment, 
furniture,  and 
consultant 
services. 
The 
MOHFW 
would 
advance 
funds 
to 
the 
procurement 
agent 
and 
the 
invoices 
I 
bills 
after 
payment, 
would 
be 
certified 
by 
the 
procurement 
agent 
as 
per 
the 
contractual 
terms 
and 
would 
be 
passed 
on 
to 
the 
Finance

section 
of 
the 
PCU 
for

be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
line 
ministry 
(MOHFW) 
through 
the 
Union 
budget (after 
project 
effectiveness) 
and 
would 
be 
budgeted 
in 
a 
manner 
to 
facilitate 
performance 
monitoring 
(different 
components 
I 
activities 
under 
separate 
heads). 
The 
annual 
budget 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
annual 
work 
program 
at 
the 
central 
PCU 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
participating 
states 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
specific 
annual 
work 
plans. 
The 
respective 
State 
Aids 
Control 
Societies  (SACS) 
set 
up 
under 
the 
2nd 
national 
Aids 
Control 
Project 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
routing 
the 
funds 
and 
accountinglreporting 
of 
the expenditure. 
The 
funds 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
states 
on 
a 
reimbursement 
basis 
every 
quarter based 
on 
submission 
of 
certified 
invoices 
and 
other 
supporting 
documentation. 
A 
separate 
bank 
account 
for 
depositing 
the 
funds 
of 
this 
project 
will 
be 
opened 
and 
initially 
books 
of 
account 
will 
(cash 
book, 
general 
ledger 
etc) 
will 
be 
maintained 
manually 
and 
subsequently 
modification 
of 
the 
chart 
of 
accounts 
in 
the 
CFMS 
used 
by 
the SACS 
will 
be 
considered. 
The 
initial 
allocation 
for 
States 
will 
be 
based 
on 
their 
cash 
flow 
forecasts 
(which 
in 
turn 
would 
be 
based 
on 
their 
work 
programs  and 
budgets). 
Subsequent 
funding 
will 
also  take 
in 
to 
consideration 
state 
performance 
and 
the 
projected 
funds 
requirement 
for 
the 
next 
period. GO1 
would 
make the 
funds 
available 
to 
MoHFW, 
on 
a 
pre-funding 
basis, 
under 
the 
budgetary mechanism 
for 
central 
level 
spending. 
As 
this 
is 
100% 
centrally 
sponsored 
scheme, 
funds 
would 
be 
made 
available  to 
the 
States, 
on 
a 
full 
grant basis.

Accounting 
Policies 
& 
Procedures 
The 
accounting 
policies 
& 
procedures and 
the 
formats 
for 
existing financial 
reports 
for 
Go1 
are 
captured 
in 
the 
various accounting forms (‘Books 
of 
Forms’), 
cash 
book, 
the 
reports, 
the 
public 
works 
account 
code, 
the 
CPWD 
manual and 
General 
Financial 
Rules 
(GFR) 
as 
issued 
from 
time 
to 
time. 
These 
policies 
and 
procedures 
are 
exhaustive and capture 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
A.G., 
Department 
of 
Finance and 
other stakeholders 
requiring 
financial information. 
In 
spite 
of 
an 
well 
established system 
of 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
the 
expenditures, 
this 
system, 
however, 
has 
no 
established 
method 
for 
capturing physical 
information 
and 
integrating 
I 
linking 
it 
with 
the 
financial information. 
Further 
as 
the 
system 
is 
maintained 
on 
a manual 
basis, 
the 
retrieval 
of 
information 
for 
evaluation 
purposes, because 
of 
voluminous 
data, 
is 
very 
time 
consuming 
and 
difficult.Under 
the 
project, 
the 
current 
system 
of 
book 
keeping 
has 
been 
enhanced, 
by 
implementing 
a 
project financial 
management 
system 
(based 
on 
double entry 
book 
keeping 
and 
cash 
basis 
of 
accounting) 
with 
required 
levels 
of 
computerization 
at 
centre 
to 
facilitate 
timely 
and 
qualitative financial reporting 
under 
the 
project. 
Expenses 
would 
be 
recorded 
on 
cash 
basis 
and 
would 
follow 
the 
government classifications, 
project 
components and 
activities 
for 
ease 
in 
reporting to 
various 
stakeholders.

with 
a 
focus 
on 
using

This 
would 
be 
an 
enhancement 
of 
the

has 
been 
developed 
for 
the

as 
part 
of

to 
be 
captured 
and 
classified 
by 
expenditure center, 
budget 
heads, 
project 
components, 
activities 
and 
disbursement 
categories. 
This 
would 
match 
closely 
with 
the 
classification 
of

Audit 
- 
External 
: 
This 
is 
the 
first 
IDA 
assisted 
project 
being 
implemented 
by 
the 
Food 
& 
Drug 
Directorate 
(within 
MOHFW) 
at 
Central 
Government. 
Under 
the 
proposed 
audit 
arrangement 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
current project, 
unlike 
other 
centrally 
sponsored 
schemes, 
the 
project 
would 
be 
required 
to 
submit 
two 
sets 
of 
annual 
audit reports 
to 
be 
shared 
with 
the 
Bank, 
1. 
an 
audit 
report 
in 
respect 
of 
central 
PCU 
at 
MoHFW 
(including 
project financial 
statement) 
audited 
by 
C&AG,  who shall 
be 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
as 
an 
independent 
auditor, 
under 
terms 
of 
reference 
agreed 
with 
IDA 
and 
2. 
a comprehensive 
audit 
report 
(including 
project financial 
statement) 
consolidated 
at 
the 
national 
level 
based 
on 
audited 
accounts 
of 
all 
the 
SACS, 
audited 
by 
an 
independent 
auditor, 
under 
terms 
of 
reference 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank. 
In 
addition, 
an 
audit 
report 
for 
special account 
held 
at 
Go1 
would 
also 
be 
submitted 
in 
usual 
manner. 
The 
existing 
audit 
arrangements 
at 
the 
SACS 
will 
be 
suitably 
modified 
to include 
the 
Food 
& 
Drugs 
Component 
also. 
All 
such 
audit reports (along 
with 
project financial 
statements) 
will 
be 
consolidated 
into 
a 
single 
audit 
report 
by 
a 
firm 
of 
chartered accountants/ independent 
auditor 
appointed 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
The 
annual 
project financial 
statement 
to 
World 
bank 
would 
include: 
(i) 
a summary 
of 
funds 
received 
(showing 
funds 
received 
from 
the 
IDA, 
and 
a Summary 
of 
expenditures 
shown 
under 
the 
main 
project 
components/ 
activities 
and 
by 
main 
categories 
of 
expenditures; 
and 
(b) 
a 
Balance 
Sheet 
showing 
accumulated 
funds 
of 
the Project, 
bank 
balances, 
other 
assets 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
liabilities, 
if 
any. 
The 
audit 
of 
the 
project 
accounts 
would 
also 
include 
an 
assessment 
of 
(a) 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
accounting 
and 
internal 
control 
systems, 
(b) 
the 
ability 
to maintain 
adequate 
documentation 
for 
transactions 
and 
(c) 
the 
eligibility 
of 
incurred 
expenditures 
for 
Bank 
financing.  The 
annual 
project 
financial 
statements 
duly 
audited 
would 
be 
submitted 
within 
6 
months 
of 
the 
close 
of 
GoI's fiscal 
year.

Internal 
Audit 
An 
internal 
auditor, 
under 
the

would 
assess 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
project financial 
management 
system, 
including 
review 
of 
internal control 
mechanisms and procurement process and 
suggest 
remedial 
measures 
in 
a

The 
office 
of 
the 
Chief 
Controller 
of 
Accounts 
(CCA) 
within

with 
CCA 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Controller 
General 
of 
India. 
The 
Internal 
auditors 
would 
report on 
a

basis 
on 
its 
findings 
to 
the 
Project 
Management 
and 
any 
issues 
arising 
in 
the 
external

would 
need 
to 
be 
promptly

timely 
addressed 
by 
the

Supervision Plan 
INDIA 
Food 
and Drugs Capacity Building Project 
The project 
will 
require intensive supervision 
during 
the 
first 
year, 
given 
the 
nation-wide 
scope 
and 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
early 
implementation 
of 
software 
activities 
related 
to 
consumer education. 
Being 
the 
first 
Bank 
supported 
project 
in 
this 
sector, 
project 
management 
at 
national 
and 
state 
levels 
will 
require 
additional 
assistance 
and supervision 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
development 
of 
comprehensive 
IEC 
strategy, 
and 
designing 
and implementing 
the 
household 
surveys. 
The 
project 
supports 
more formal 
consultations 
between 
the center 
and 
states 
at 
regular intervals 
including 
development 
of 
annual 
plans 
of 
action. 
The 
first 
year 
will 
provide 
a 
critical 
opportunity 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
these 
processes 
are 
in 
place 
in 
a 
timely, 
transparent 
and 
accountable manner and 
well 
integrated 
into 
the 
national and 
state 
programs. 
During 
the 
first 
year 
of 
implementation, the 
project 
will 
have 
three 
formal 
supervision 
missions, 
in 
addition 
to 
ongoing implementation 
support 
by 
Bank 
staff 
located 
in 
New 
Delhi 
office. 
The 
core 
supervision 
team 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
members: 
(i) 
Task Team 
leader, 
with 
experience 
in 
public 
health 
program 
operations 
in 
development countries; 
(ii) 
Financial 
management 
specialist 
who 
will 
review 
project's 
adherence 
to 
fiduciary 
requirements; 
(iii) 
Procurement Specialist 
who 
will 
review 
and 
advice 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
procurement, 
in 
particular 
selection 
of 
consultants 
and 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
works; 
(iv) 
IEC 
specialist 
who 
will 
focus 
on 
development 
and implementation 
of 
IEC 
strategy; 
(v) 
MIS 
specialist 
who 
will 
review 
the household survey 
design 
and 
monitoring 
arrangements; 
(vi) 
Environmental specialist 
who 
will 
review 
the 
implementation 
of 
environment 
management 
plan; 
and 
(vii) 
Social 
Development Specialist 
who 
will 
review 
the 
implementation 
of 
NGO 
activities. 
In 
addition, 
the 
team 
will 
rely 
on 
support 
from 
WHO 
staff 
who 
have 
been 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
for 
development 
of 
standards 
which 
will 
be 
continued 
during 
the 
project 
implementation. 
The 
first 
mission 
will 
take 
place shortly after 
the 
Board 
presentation 
and 
will 
pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
following 
areas: 
(i) 
preparatory activities 
and 
consultations 
for 
development 
of 
IEC 
strategy; 
(ii) 
launch workshop 
to 
familiarize implementing 
authorities 
at 
state 
level 
with 
the 
Bank 
procedures; 
(iii) 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
arrangements; 
(iv) 
development 
of 
information 
systems; 
(v) 
formation 
of 
technical advisory committee 
for 
designing household 
surveys 
(vi) 
initiation 
of 
procurement 
actions 
for 
good 
and 
works planned 
during 
the 
first 
year. 
The 
mission 
will 
also 
follow-up 
on 
the 
recommendations 
and 
actions agreed 
upon 
between 
Bank 
staff 
and Government 
of 
India 
in 
developing 
the 
standards. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
missions 
will 
include 
field 
visits 
to major 
states, 
particularly 
Maharashtra 
and 
Utttar 
Pradesh 
to identify 
implementation 
issues 
and 
challenges 
faced 
by 
state 
governments, 
food 
and 
drug 
authorities, 
state 
aids 
control 
societies 
and 
NGOs. 
During 
the 
subsequent 
years, 
two 
supervision missions 
are 
planned every 
year 
with 
a 
mid 
term 
review 
in 
2005.
