         (DPL-5) Project is the fifth in a series of policy loans to\n            Indonesia, but the first proposed under the FY09-FY12\n            Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was approved by the\n            Board in September, 2008. The 4 earlier DPLs from 2004 to\n            2007 constituted a program of annual, single tranche loans\n            anchored to the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n            The overall goal of the DPL-5 program is to help the\n            Government of Indonesia (GoI) achieve its medium-term growth\n            and poverty reduction objectives. The DPL-5 supports the\n            GoI's reform efforts in the following objectives: (i)\n            improve the investment climate; (ii) enhance public\n            financial management and governance; and (iii) improve\n            service delivery to the poor. The investment pillar is\n            aligned to the CPS objective of enhancing the environment\n            for private sector development to foster accelerated growth\n            and poverty reduction and strengthen competitiveness and\n            inclusiveness. The public financial management triggers are\n            also designed to support another key policy area of the CPS\n            on strengthening central government institutions and systems\n            through increasing accountability and transparency in\n            government financial management and to enhance public\n            financial management and governance to increase the\n            development impact of priority budget expenditures. Finally,\n            improving the institutional capacity to better target\n            poverty alleviation programs is a critical step to achieving\n            the CPS objective of more efficient delivery of public\n            services to reduce poverty levels and improve equity."}, "docdt": "2008-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
