                  PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA


                I. INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT
1.     This proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) aims to strengthen the financial
sector regulatory and supervisory regime and mitigate key vulnerabilities of the bank and
non-bank sectors. The proposed operation is designed to support the Government’s reform
agenda to address key challenges across the financial sector. The operation is structured around
three pillars: (i) strengthening regulation and supervision of the banking sector and financial
safety net; (ii) expediting the resolution of NPLs; and (iii) strengthening the regulation and
supervision of NBFIs. This is a standalone operation in the amount of US$100 million.

   A. COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.      Domestic and external vulnerabilities are high and continue to pose risks to
macroeconomic stability. Public debt and fiscal financing needs are among the highest in the
region. Heavy trade, financial and remittance dependence on Italy and Greece remain important
potential sources of vulnerability. The country’s limited export base and vulnerability to shocks
pose additional external risks. Insufficient fiscal consolidation efforts or slow progress on
structural reforms could undermine investor confidence and increase rollover risks for
government debt.

3.     Albania’s sustained high economic growth in the decade prior to the 2008 global
financial crisis helped it achieve a middle income status and reduce poverty. During 1998-
2008, annual growth averaged 6 percent in real terms with a fivefold increase in per capita GDP
to above US$4,000. Although this period of strong growth was not matched by the same level of
employment creation, it was successful in terms of poverty reduction. Absolute poverty halved
from 25 percent in 2002 to about 18 percent by 2008.

4.      However, Albania was hit hard by the global crisis, although it was able to avoid a
recession. The crisis led to lower remittances and other flows, which in turn contributed to lower
growth, particularly in the construction sector. GDP grew by an average of below 3 percent
between 2009 and 2012. The Eurozone crisis further compounded the challenge of recovery, as
Albania has close links to the Greek and Italian economies via exports, remittances, and financial
flows. The economy has been slowing significantly since 2012, as weak credit growth and rising
government payment arrears have contributed to weaknesses in domestic demand. External
demand has been the primary driver of growth in the last two years, but remains limited due to
continued weaknesses in the Eurozone, including in the trading partners, and a narrow export
base. In 2013 growth is estimated to slow to 0.7%, and averaging 2 percent between 2013 and
2016.

5.     Albania made significant progress in poverty reduction up until 2008, which has
since been reversed. Albania was propelled from being one of the poorest countries in Europe in
the 1990s to middle income status in 2008. Between 2002 and 2008 alone, Albania’s poverty
was halved, falling from 25.4 percent in 2002 to 12.8 percent in 2008. Since 2008 poverty has,
however, been on the rise. Results from the 2012 LSMS data show an increase in poverty to 14.3
                                                4
percent. This increase translates into 28,900 people being pushed into poverty. Extreme poverty,
defined as having difficulty meeting even basic nutritional needs, decreased from about 5 percent
in 2002 to 1.2 percent in 2008, but increased to 2.2 percent in 2012. Most of the poverty increase
was in urban areas, narrowing the gap in living standards between rural and urban areas. 1

6.     Similarly, shared prosperity - consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent -
improved between 2005 and 2008, but has since deteriorated. Household expenditure 2
increased from 2005 to 2008 across all percentiles, but particularly for those in the bottom 40
percent. The mean expenditure of the bottom 40 percent grew at an annualized rate of 2.6
percent, exceeding the growth rate of the country’s average household expenditure of 1.3
percent. Between 2008 and 2012 consumption growth declined for all economic groups (-1.3
percent), including those in the bottom 40 percent (-1.2 percent), as growth slowed down.

7.      The new Government is committed to correct economic imbalances and undertake
key reforms to restore sustainable economic growth. The strong election mandate augurs well
for political stability in the period ahead, as the authorities are keen on launching upfront policy
and structural reforms. Since the early 2000s, Albania has implemented a range of institutional
and structural reforms that has moved it closer to EU membership. After parliamentary elections,
the European Commission recommended in October 2013 that Albania be granted a candidate
status conditional on the completion of key judicial and public administration reforms. On
December 13, 2013, the Dutch parliament, however, vetoed the candidate status, which will be
reconsidered in the summer of 2014.

      B. FINANCIAL SECTOR CONTEXT

8.      Following the 2008 global financial crisis, the banking sector has remained stable
with adequate capital and liquidity, though key channels of vulnerability remain. High
financial euroization, strong financial links between banks and government debt holdings, and
the dominant presence of subsidiaries of foreign banks increase the banking sector’s
vulnerabilities to potential shocks. NPL ratios are amongst the highest in the region, leading to a
sharp slowdown in credit growth as banks take a conservative approach to lending. Risks to the
banking sector may be exacerbated in the event of further Eurozone financial stress or
deleveraging, which could hurt the economy through spill-over effects (through trade,
investment and remittances channels), and thus could negatively impact financial stability.

9.       The decline in bank profitability and the high NPL rates present key risks to the
banking sector, and undermine credit growth. Bank profitability has declined sharply with the
return on equity falling from over 20 percent in 2007 to below 6.4 percent in 2013. NPLs have
increased from 3 percent at end-2007 to more than 23 percent at end- 2013, and provisions
covered 65 percent of NPLs at end-2013. NPLs have risen significantly due to a combination of
factors, including past poor credit underwriting practices by banks, the credit boom experienced
prior to 2008, the general economic slowdown, the rise in government arrears (as a result of poor

1
 In 2012, poverty is higher for male-headed households (15 percent) than for female-headed households (10
percent). These estimates, however, mask self-selection, as women heading households (less than 9 percent of all
household heads) tend to have different characteristics than other women.
2
    Expenditure includes consumption and non-consumption expenditures as a proxy of household income.

tax revenue performance and continued infrastructure spending), and a protracted, unreliable
collateral execution regime. Due the large hangover of NPLs in the banking system, credit
growth turned negative at end-November 2013, declining by 2.4 percent (year-on- year) (Figure
1).

10.     High financial euroization and significant foreign bank presence increase the
vulnerability of the financial system to external shocks. There are potential risks connected
with the widespread use of the euro. About half of banks’ loan portfolio is denominated in
foreign currency and unhedged, which in combination with large maturity mismatches, could
create further risks in case of a depreciation of the lek. In addition, the largely foreign-owned
structure of the banking sector with Austrian, Greek, Italian, and Turkish banks presents
additional risks. Financial difficulties in parent banks can affect the Albanian subsidiaries
through direct contagion due to spill over fears or defunding pressures when parent banks are
unable to provide capital support to the local subsidiaries. The conversion of bank branches to
subsidiaries in 2012 was a timely step that served to limit deleveraging, as prudential limits on
capital adequacy and liquidity were set at the level of the subsidiary rather than the group.

11.     The strong financial links between banks and the government further increase the
vulnerabilities. A large share of bank assets is invested in government securities, representing
more than 60 percent of government debt. This significant interdependence presents systemic
risks for banks, which are vulnerable to changes in the value of longer term debt securities, and
for the government, which depends on regular roll over of debt by banks. The risk is heightened
by the lack of a well-functioning secondary market and the emergence of investment funds,
which are attracting new investments, and face significant liquidity risk and challenges regarding
asset valuation. On the government side, public debt management capacity has been undermined
by staff reductions at the Ministry of Finance Public Debt Management Department.

12.   The nonbank sector is small but new risks have emerged, coupled with a regulatory
and supervisory framework that can be significantly strengthened. Investment funds have
grown considerably since 2012, but while these funds have helped diversify the ownership of
government securities, their emergence has not been matched with an adequate regulatory and

                                                         6
supervisory regime. Moreover, given the close links of the investment funds with banks,
redemption pressures may spill over onto banks. The insurance market also faces significant
challenges as insurance companies are not financing outstanding liabilities in full. The
underwriting performance of non-life insurance sector has been negative in recent years with a
major deterioration in 2013. Due to the need of major institutional reform to achieve financial
and operational independence of the nonbank regulator, the regulation and supervision of the
sector has lagged behind.

13.    The deposit insurance framework, managed by the Albanian Deposit Insurance
Agency (ADIA), broadly conforms to international best practice. ADIA was established in
2002 pursuant to the Deposit Insurance Law, as amended in 2009 and 2012. ADIA protects
deposits of natural persons up to the maximum of 2.5 million Lek (about $25,000) per bank
depositor, and it ensures approximately 58 percent of deposits in the banking system. ADIA has
made impressive progress in improving its operations and building its organizational structure.
The ADIA law was amended in 2012 to address a key set of reforms to extend coverage to
Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs), facilitate a prompt pay-out after BoA intervention, and
expanding ADIA powers to contribute to a purchase and assumption or bridge bank resolution.

14.     In sum, the financial sector authorities have undertaken significant measures to
minimize vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and are currently working on the
implementation of several other key reforms to further mitigate risks. Amendments to the
Banking Law adopted in 2011 provided the BoA with more options for bank resolution. BoA
also strengthened its crisis management framework by enhancing its monitoring and analytical
tools for assessing financial stability. Additionally, key amendments to the Civil Procedure Code
adopted in 2013 enhanced the collateral execution process.


                II. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK

   A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

15.     The global financial crisis and the subsequent Eurozone crisis have led to a
significant slow-down in Albania’s growth. In the years preceding the global crisis, 2005-08,
the economy grew at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent enabling an increase in household
expenditures of the bottom 40 percent by 2.6 percent per year. Growth was driven primarily by
domestic consumption followed by investment. With expanding imports, net exports had
negative contribution to growth during this period. On the production side, services were the
largest contributor to economic growth, followed by construction. The global financial crisis in
2008 and the subsequent Eurozone crisis slammed the brakes on Albania's growth. Albania was
able to avoid a recession but GDP growth slowed to less than 3 percent on average between 2009
and 2012 as exports, remittances and inflows suffered, in particular from Albania’s close ties to
the Greek and Italian economies.

16.    Large external imbalances that accumulated in the years preceding the crisis have
been slowly correcting. The current account deficit which reached 15.5 percent of GDP in 2008
has subsequently improved and declined to 9.0 percent of GDP in 2013 (Table 1). The
improvement has been due to favorable weather and the resulting hydroelectricity exports (in

                                               7
2010 and 2013) and crude oil exports (in 2011), which combined, have helped exports to
increase by 34.5 percent since 2009. In parallel, imports have declined since 2009 due to weak
domestic demand.

17.     Inflation has remained low. The Bank of Albania maintains an inflation-targeting
monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate regime with relatively little intervention. These
policies, along with flexible wage setting, have been effective in containing inflation and unit
labor costs. Inflation was 2 percent in 2012 and 2013, and the Lek-euro value was largely flat in
2011 and 2012. The IMF assessed in January 2014 that the exchange rate appears broadly in line
with fundamentals using the Equilibrium Real Exchange rate approach, but modestly overvalued
using other methodologies.

18.     Albania’s fiscal deficit widened significantly in 2013 to an estimated 6.2 percent
(Table 2). Its fiscal deficit averaged 3.4 percent between 2005 and 2012, except in 2008 and
2009, when it deteriorated sharply. Revenues as a share of GDP climbed from 25.1 percent in
2005 to 26.7 percent in 2008 but declined to 24 percent in 2013 due to a reduction in the
corporate income tax rate in 2009, increases in VAT exemptions and declining revenue
collection. As revenues fell, so did budgeted spending. Personnel expenditures declined from 6.1
percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent in 2013. Capital expenditures also contracted. However, social
transfers as a share of GDP have risen steadily since 2000, reaching 8.6 percent in 2008 and then
9.4 percent in 2013. The pension system deficit, including rural subsidies, reached 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2012 largely as a result of contribution rate cuts in 2006 and 2009, unfunded increases in
benefits, and perverse incentive effects that threaten the longer term financial stability of the
system despite the relatively young population. In 2013, a slowdown in the economy together
with general elections in June 2013 led to an expansionary fiscal policy during the first half of
2013. In addition to higher expenditures, tax revenue underperformed considerably. The sharp
deterioration in revenues pushed the fiscal deficit up to 6.2 percent of GDP from 3.5 percent
planned initially.

19.    Public debt has surged since the 2008 crisis. In 2008, Albania amended the Organic
Budget Law to include a legal limit on public debt equal to 60 percent of GDP. At that time,
public debt was about 54.7 percent of GDP but loose fiscal policy, combined with a depreciation
of the Lek, caused public debt to climb to 60.3 percent by 2011. Fiscal pressures rose further
during the energy shortage in 2012 as the government provided support to the power generation
company KESh in the form of guarantees. Ad-hoc increase in pensions and declining revenues
have also added to a widening of the fiscal deficit. In the run-up to elections the government

                                                         9
requested Parliament to revoke the 60 percent of public debt-to-GDP limit. In December 2012,
the Parliament did so, without proposing any other fiscal or debt anchor. Public debt has since
increased by more than 8 percent of GDP, reaching 70.5 percent at end-2013 due to a large fiscal
deficit in the run-up to elections, recognition of the stock of payment arrears, and a downward
GDP revision. 3

20.      High and growing public debt poses both interest rate and rollover risks,
highlighting the need for fiscal consolidation. Spending on interest, at about 3.2 percent of
GDP in 2013, is much higher than in other countries of South East Europe. In 2013, about 58.9
percent of Albania’s public debt was domestic and about 16.4 percent of domestic debt had
floating interest rates. In 2012, the implied interest rate on domestic debt was 7.6 percent.
Further, over 55 percent of domestic debt (almost 30 percent of GDP) needs to be rolled over
within a year, exposing the government to changes in market conditions. Commercial banks are
the main holders of Albania’s domestic debt, with Raiffeissen Bank and the Bank of Albania
holding 35 percent of it. With some European banks recently taking steps to reduce their
exposure due to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the weak European growth outlook,
concerns about rollover risk have risen. Increased public borrowing also damages growth
prospects by crowding out the private sector. Fiscal consolidation has now become imperative to
reduce the risks of high public debt—rollover risks, high interest expenditures, and crowding out
of private sector borrowing—and ensure Albania’s fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic
stability.

21.     The government has accumulated significant budgetary arrears. Despite declining
public investment budgets in the wake of the 2008 crisis, contractors continued implementing
multi-year public works projects as planned, often by drawing on commercial loans and thereby
contributing to a buildup of government payment arrears, driving up NPLs and eroding private
sector liquidity. In addition to arrears related to public works, there are budgetary arrears related
to health (mostly drugs), education, water, VAT refunds, corporate income tax (CIT)
repayments, electricity bills and social benefits. The stock of payment arrears is estimated at
about Lek 72.5 billion or 5.3 percent of GDP. Serious efforts are now needed to audit and pay
the arrears and institute a commitment control system in the treasury to prevent their recurrence.

22.     The energy sector poses significant fiscal risks. About 98 percent of Albania’s energy
is generated from hydropower, and recurrent energy shortages due to fluctuations in rainfall,
coupled with persistently high distribution losses (about 43 percent in 2013) and regulated tariffs
below energy costs, have resulted in sustained fiscal support from the government, in the form of
guarantees and liquidity injections, to the energy generation company KESh. 4 In the distribution
sector, the low collection rates from households, businesses and public institutions (84 percent in
2012) have contributed to the financial woes of the former private distribution company, CEZ
Sh, and now the distribution sector operator. Because of an ongoing legal dispute between the
government and the private distribution company (CEZ Sh), the Albania energy regulatory

3
  About 5.8 percent of GDP was due to a GDP revision that resulted from a methodological change in the treatment
of implicit subsidies to the energy sector, while the remainder was due to the fiscal deficit. The revision affected
GDP in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
4
  As of spring 2013, the guaranteed overdraft of KESh was estimated at about US$200 million (or 2 percent of
GDP).


                                                        10
agency, ERE, in January 2013 revoked the CEZ Sh. license and appointed a temporary state
administrator to run the distribution system. Consequently, the distribution losses, amounting to
an average of euro 100 million/yr, are now effectively part of the state’s obligations to the sector,
thus increasing the fiscal risks coming from the sector. Serious reform efforts are needed in the
energy sector to reduce the risks to the budget as well as to growth (through possible power
shedding due to shortages).

   B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

23.     Growth is expected to increase gradually over the medium term. Real GDP growth is
projected to rise moderately from 0.7 percent in 2013 to 2.1 percent in 2014, 3.3 percent in 2015
and 3.5 percent in 2016. Improvements in the external environment through increased demand
and remittances are expected to be the main drivers of growth over this period. Private
investment is expected to gradually pick up in response to arrears clearance and credit expansion
as well as sustained improvements in the business climate. As the government seeks to contain
over-commitments and arrears and introduce improved budget planning and public financial
management, the contribution of public investment to growth is expected to slow down
somewhat in the medium term. As domestic demand picks up and FDI accelerates, imports are
also expected to increase. Inflation is expected to increase to 3 percent by 2016, which is
consistent with the Bank of Albania’s target range.

24.     The current account is projected to widen over the medium term due to FDI-related
imports (Table 3). The current account deficit is expected to increase due to FDI related imports,
especially for energy-related investments. The repayment of government arrears will also
contribute to a widening of the fiscal and current account deficits. The current account is
projected to peak in 2016 and then to narrow to 9.6 percent in 2018 and 7.9 percent in 2019.
External debt as a share to GDP is projected to peak at 43.1 percent in 2015 before trending
downwards.

25.      The fiscal deficit for 2014 is projected to reach 6.7 percent of GDP as the
government clears arrears equal to 2.5 percent of GDP. The government has started the
arrears clearance process and is committed to proceed in a transparent manner to ensure its
credibility. The Council of Ministers approved an arrears clearance and prevention strategy in
February 2014, which details: (i) stocktaking and verification of claims; (ii) clear and transparent
criteria for the order of settling the claims; and (iii) scheduling and monitoring of the payment
process. Arrears are expected to be cleared in up to three years across all sectors to spread the
fiscal impact. The clearance will likely help reduce the stock of NPLs and unlock credit to the
private sector, providing a basis for renewed private sector growth.

26.     In parallel, the government will proceed with fiscal consolidation. The budgeted
fiscal deficit without arrears is 4.2 percent in 2014 which compares to a budget deficit of 6.9
percent in 2013. With respect to revenues, the budget raises the corporate income tax (CIT) rate
from 10 to 15 percent; excises rates on cigarettes, tobacco, beer, wine, alcoholic drinks and
coffee; circulation tax, equivalent to an increase in gasoline and diesel fuel prices of about 6.6
percent; and property tax rates paid by businesses (local tax). Revenues from CIT, excise taxes
and other taxes as a share of GDP are projected to be 0.5 percent, 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent
higher, respectively, in 2014 than in 2013. To limit the impact of these tax increases on lower
income Albanians and small businesses, the government has introduced a progressive income tax
system, abolished the small business tax (local tax), and reduced the rate for the simple tax on
profit for small businesses to half the corporate tax rate. 5 A foreign consultant (Crown Agents) is
already assisting with tax collection at customs. On the expenditure side, the budget freezes
public sector salaries in 2014, with the exception for police officers; and limits pension increases
to around 2 percent.

27.     The fiscal deficit is projected to decline further to 4.8 and 3.4 percent of GDP,
respectively in 2015 and 2016, reflecting a gradual ending of the arrears clearance process
coupled with continued fiscal consolidation. Under the baseline, revenues and all expenditure
items, with the exception of interest                Figure 2: Public Debt-to-GDP scenarios
payments, are expected to remain constant
as a share of GDP over the medium-term.
Fiscal consolidation measures of 1.2 percent
of GDP in 2015 and 2.4 percent in 2016,
which are not specified under the baseline,
will be achieved through spending
constraints combined with further tax
measures and pension reform. The
government approved a Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework in February 2014, which
imposes expenditure ceilings on all line
ministries for 2015 and 2016 in line with the
fiscal deficit targets. According to this

5
  The government also plans to refund the VAT paid on agricultural inputs, exempt medicines and medical services
from VAT in line with EU regulations, and improve tax administration.

framework, about half of the fiscal adjustment would fall on revenues and the other half on
expenditures

28.     Albania’s public debt is projected to peak at 71.7 percent in 2014 and decline to 69.3
percent of GDP by 2016. Assuming medium-term fiscal targets are achieved, gross public debt
is projected to decline to 63.1 percent of GDP by 2018. Debt sustainability analysis indicates that
the debt trajectory is particularly vulnerable to primary balance shocks, increased pension
expenditures as well as realization of contingent liabilities in the energy sector. Still, the public
debt to GDP ratio trends downward under most scenarios with the exception of the constant
primary balance scenarios. In the latter case, the debt to GDP ratio is projected to approach 85
percent by 2018 (Figure 2).

29.     Downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook are substantial. Slow progress of
energy sector reforms could mean accumulation of contingent liabilities which could hit the
budget and thereby negatively affect fiscal indicators and growth. Rainfall sharply affects the
supply of electricity which has a direct impact on import needs and the cost of electricity. These
fluctuations have had significant (positive and negative) effects in the past and will almost
certainly recur, although the impact--especially the fiscal impact--could be significantly
dampened by appropriate policies. In addition, the country faces significant external risks. A
slower than projected pace of recovery in the Euro area could lead to lower than expected
growth, revenue collection and fiscal consolidation. 6 Domestic recovery could also be
endangered by a continuation of the credit crunch in the context of deleveraging pressures from
parent banks on the 90 percent foreign-owned banking sector. Although high capital adequacy
requirements have thus far been met through capital increases, further deterioration in the
portfolio asset quality could force banks to shift their holdings into low risk assets and reduce
credit to the private sector.

30.     The macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate. The government is
committed to fiscal consolidation, as well as arrears clearance, putting public debt on a
downward trajectory. The 2014 budget includes significant fiscal consolidation measures with
immediate effect. Fiscal policy is calibrated to accommodate a gradual recovery of real sector
growth while steadily reducing public sector debt from 2014 onwards. Achieving a public debt
ratio below the 60 percent of GDP already in the medium term would entail even deeper fiscal
consolidation that is not feasible in the context of arrears clearance, and not recommended due to
negative growth and poverty effects. The planned pace of fiscal consolidation is also supported
by structural policies in support of growth, such as reforms of the energy and financial sector as
well as improvements in the business climate.

31.   In parallel to the preparation of the Financial Sector Modernization DPL, the
proposed ‘sister’ First Public Finance and Growth DPL is the first in a series of two
programmatic development policy loans that aim to minimize the macroeconomic
vulnerabilities, by improving Albania’s public finances and sustain poverty-reducing
growth. The series focuses on addressing weaknesses in public finance management that have

  Albania has a relatively high exposure to developments in neighboring countries, especially Greece and Italy,
through remittances, exports and foreign investment.


                                                         13
resulted in the accumulation of general government arrears and improving Albania’s fiscal
outlook through revenue-enhancing measures, pension, and energy sector reforms. Arrears and
high public debt are now weighing heavily on Albania’s growth prospects and threatening to
reverse the significant progress that has until recently been made on reducing poverty. The
government recognizes that steps to strengthen public financial institutions and reduce fiscal
vulnerabilities are critical for Albania to protect the fiscal space for growth-enabling investment
and poverty-alleviating social services. In addition, the IMF’s program complements these
reforms by supporting fiscal consolidation and prevention and clearance of government arrears to
enhance macroeconomic stability, as well as structural reforms to improve the business
environment.

32.     Reducing large public arrears and beginning to execute on a time-bound plan to
tackle the longstanding energy sector reforms will yield positive effects on the business
environment and enterprises alike. Together, if well implemented by the authorities, these
parallel initiatives could have a catalytic effect to spur new domestic and foreign investment,
thereby stimulating economic growth. These and related measures supported through World
Bank lending operations under preparation will positively impact the banking sector, as
corporate (particularly infrastructure) borrowers would receive overdue payments necessary to
better fulfill obligations to the banking sector, and manufacturing firms would be less effected by
periodic power outages.

      C. IMF RELATIONS

33.    Albania has reached an agreement for an Extended-Fund Facility (EFF) with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). The EFF was approved by the IMF Board on February
28, 2014 (see Annex 2 for press release). The arrangement is intended to provide budget support
in the amount of EUR 330.1 million (about US$457.1 million) over a three-year period. The
World Bank and the IMF are collaborating closely on the reform program to ensure
complementarity of key fiscal and financial sector policy measures.


                           III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
34.     The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2007-2013
outlined the Government’s economic and social development program. The strategic goals
of the NSDI were: (i) integration to the European Union (EU) and NATO; (ii) strengthening the
rule of law and democratization; and (iii) achieving rapid and sustainable economic and social
development. The authorities have made progress towards the NSDI goals. First, Albania joined
NATO in 2008 and submitted its application for EU membership in 2009. In October 2012, the
EU first recommended Albania as an official candidate for admittance into the economic block 7.
Second, its GDP growth continued throughout the global financial crisis, while poverty
continued to decline. However, despite adopting some business environment reforms, Albania
decined in its overall ranking on the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business (DB) Indicators to the
90th position.

                                                          14
35.    The Government is in the process of finalizing the National Strategy for
Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2014- 2020. The NSDI for 2014- 2020 is expected to
be finalized by end-2014. The current draft, which is undergoing a consultative process, has
three broad pillars or overarching goals: (i) growth through fiscal stability and increased
competitiveness; (ii) sustainable growth through efficient use of resources; and (iii) investing
in people. Improving good governance and the rule of law forms its foundation. The strategy
will be the basis for the design of medium-term budget programming and the orientation of
donor funding, especially from the EU’s Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA).

36.      The Albanian financial sector authorities have undertaken significant reforms in
recent years to address vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Amendments to the Banking
Law in 2011 provided the BoA with more options for bank resolution, through the establishment
of bridge bank and purchase and assumption transactions, and allowed for the transformation of
branches of foreign-owned banks into subsidiaries. The BoA also enhanced its monitoring and
analytical tools for assessing financial stability and widened the list of collateral for Emergency
Liquidity Assistance. Additionally, key amendments to the Civil Procedure Code were adopted
in 2013 to shorten and simplify collateral enforcement procedures. In addition, ADIA law was
amended in 2012 to address a key set of reforms to extend coverage to Savings and Credit
Associations (SCAs), facilitate a prompt pay-out after BoA intervention, and expand ADIA
powers to contribute to a purchase and assumption or bridge bank resolution. To better assess
market developments and identify emerging risks in the financial sector, in 2012 the authorities
re-constituted a high level Financial Stability Advisory Group (FSAG) composed of the MoF,
BoA, FSA, and the ADIA, which meets on a quarterly basis to monitor developments and risks
to the financial system.

37.    The authorities are committed to continue a series of short to medium term reforms
to encourage the development of the financial sector, complementing and building on the
reforms supported by the proposed operation. The reforms are in the following areas: (i) NPL
management and resolution; (ii) resolution regime for SCAs; (iii) enhancement of the deposit
insurance framework; (iv) insurance market development; (v) pension reform; (vi) public debt
management and government bond market development; (vii) regulatory framework for
investment funds; and (viii) corporate financial reporting. The authorities have requested World
Bank Group assistance with the implementation of these reforms.

38.     The authorities to continue their efforts to strengthen NPL management and
resolution. With TA from the Financial Sector Advisory Centre (FinSAC) beginning in 2012,
key Civil Procedure Code changes were approved by Parliament in 2013 that removed key
impediments to speedy enforcement of collateral executions. The authorities recognize the
complexities and need to adopt measures that in the medium term would contribute to the
reduction of NPLs. FinSAC will continue to provide TA to BoA to develop the Recovery and
Resolution (RRP) framework in line with new EU regulatory initiatives in this area, including on
enhancing the legal and regulatory framework, integrating the RRP assessment within the
supervisory review process, and improving the supervisory capacity in the RRP review. To
further enhance the NPL resolution framework, BoA also plans to modify its regulatory and
supervisory approach towards non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to facilitate the sale of
NPL portfolios to specialized bad debt collection companies. In addition, the authorities are keen
to improve the insolvency and debt resolution system would also contribute to reducing NPLs. In

                                                15
this context, the IFC has designed a comprehensive three year Debt Resolution and Business Exit
Project for the Ministry of Justice, which aims to improve the insolvency legislation, debt
restructuring, and institutional practices of the Bankruptcy Supervisory Agency.

39.      The authorities are also working to enhance the deposit insurance framework.
ADIA has secured a back-stop funding facility from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) in the amount of 100 million euro, to be called upon if needed to fulfill
ADIA’s obligations to insured depositors. The facility will be finalized once approved by the
Ministry of Finance. Additionally, in order to incorporate SCAs within the deposit insurance
scheme to provide protection to small depositors at such institutions, the BoA will amend the
SCA Law in 2014 to provide for a resolution framework for those SCAs which will not qualify
to join the deposit insurance scheme in 2015.

40.     Significant reforms are also a priority in the areas of insurance market
development, pension reform, public debt management and government bond market
development. TA in these areas is expected to be provided the authorities with support from the
FIRST Initiative. TA in these areas compliment the proposed DPL, as some are relevant to Pillar
III of the operation that focuses on strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for
NBFIs. More specifically, areas of TA include assisting the AFSA to: (i) develop actuarially
sound MTPL claims reserving requirements; (ii) draft the law on National Earthquake Insurance;
(iii) develop specific insurance regulation and supervision manuals; (iv) strengthen the
supervision of private pension funds through the implementation of risk based supervision and
expand third pillar pension coverage; and (v) enhance its enforcement capacity. In addition, a
separate FIRST Initiative TA grant facility is slated to assist the government to implement
reforms for improving public debt management and developing the government securities
market.

41.     In addition, the authorities recognize the need to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework for investment funds. TA from the World Bank has been requested in
this area, centered on developing regulations for liquidity, capital adequacy, and consumer
protection provisions. This TA will be undertaken in close collaboration with the IMF, which
will provide technical assistance to develop the methodology for the calculation of investment
funds’ unit values on mark-to-market principle.

42.      The government also aims to also implement reforms in corporate financial
reporting. It has requested the World Bank’s Centre for Financial Reporting Reforms (CFRR) to
further such reforms. A national Corporate Financial reporting Enhancement Project is being
implemented to: (i) upgrade financial reporting legislation closer to the EU standards, with a
roadmap for further legislation modernization; (ii) enhance capacity of national standards setters
to translate and adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and develop national
accounting standards for SMEs; (iii) establish audit oversight and quality assurance systems; (iv)
initiate reforms in accountancy education and certification curricula. The potential second phase
of the project in 2014-2017 will expand the activities of institutional capacity building, including
enforcement activities by financial sector regulators.

43.   In addition to the reforms proposed in this DPL and others outlined above, the
agenda for undertaking comprehensive reforms to strengthen financial sector stability and

                                                16
development remains broad. The FSAP 2013 highlighted steps to enhance for financial sector
stability and development going forward. The reforms supported by this DPL and outlined above
will advance selected key short and medium term recommendations of the FSAP. However, the
longer term agenda for financial sector development is broad. Thus, a follow-on financial sector
DPL operation would further improve, inter alia: risk-based supervision, consolidated
supervision, the macro-prudential framework, monetary operations, crises preparedness, the
capacity of the non-bank regulatory authority, public debt management, private pension reform,
and enterprise financial reporting.


               IV.      THE PROPOSED ALBANIA FINANCIAL SECTOR
                               MODERNIZATION LOAN

        A. LINK TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND OPERATION DESCRIPTION

44.     The proposed Financial Sector Modernization DPL program supports the
Government’s pillar 1 of growth through fiscal stability and increased competitiveness, as
outlined in the draft NSDI for 2014 – 2020. The draft NSDI emphasizes harnessing the
potential of the financial sector as a key objective in pillar 1 to help businesses gain access to
capital needed to support medium and long-term investment. Objectives outlined in this pillar are
directly supported by the proposed operation and include: (i) creating an enabling environment
for private banks to expand credit to the private sector and to substantially reduce non-
performing loans; (ii) enhancing the supervisory capacity of the Albanian Financial Supervisory
Authority (AFSA); and (iii) further developing the non-bank financial sector.

45.    The proposed DPL measures of strengthening and further developing the financial
sector contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Higher levels of financial
sector development result in a faster decline and lower incidence of poverty. In addition,
measures supporting financial stability reduce the impact of financial crises that take a huge toll
on economic growth and poverty alleviation.

46.     The proposed operation has incorporated lessons from the World Bank’s
experiences in the 2008-2009 crises, as well as in previous economic and financial crises. A
relatively recent comprehensive review of the World Bank’s responses to financial crises 8
underscored the following lessons:

    •      Need for focus. In responding to an uneven and uncertain external environment, it is
           crucial that the operation focuses on selected key areas for good outcomes. The proposed
           operation incorporates this lesson by focusing on a main challenge recognized by the
           Government and the BoA, namely, addressing key regulatory and supervisory gaps for
           the bank and non-bank sectors, reducing the stock and flow of NPLs and strengthening
           the deposit insurance regime, so the entire financial sector can be more resilient to cope
           with possible future shocks, and preparing the authorities in the event of spillover.

 •     Government ownership. The proposed reforms need to support the authorities’ priorities
       and require an extensive dialogue to ensure ownership of the technically complex and
       politically sensitive reforms in the financial sector. This operation was prepared in direct
       collaboration with the top leadership of the MoF, BoA, AFSA, ADIA and other key
       stakeholders.

 •     Timing matters. The current government was elected in mid-2013 and the next elections
       will only take place in 2017. This time will give the government the ability to tackle
       some key financial sector reforms, especially as it regards adopting measures to mitigate
       the level of NPLs and enhance the independence and capacities of the AFSA, or non-
       bank regulatory authority.

 •     Communication strategy. The operation should promote the understanding of, and the
       appropriate popular support for the financial sector related reforms through a carefully
       planned and implemented communication strategy by the Government and the World
       Bank. Staff at the World Bank Tirana office has ensured consistent and timely
       communication with key stakeholders. The Bank also keeps civil society and the general
       public informed of its position on critical issues through interviews with national media
       and press releases.

 •     Coordination among development partners. Coordination is critical since a coordinated
       approach brings better results. This operation incorporates this lesson by working closely
       with the IMF, EC, and IFC.

     B. PRIOR ACTIONS, RESULTS AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

Prior actions and results

Pillar I. Strengthening regulation and supervision of the banking sector and the financial
safety net

47.     The prior actions in Pillar 1 aim to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework of the banking sector and financial safety net. The operation will support reforms
that would progress the transition from compliance-based to risk-based supervision, improve
crisis preparedness by supporting the preparation of recovery plans by systemic banks, and
enhance the deposit insurance framework.

Prior Action #1: BoA Supervisory Council adopts a new comprehensive Risk Based
Supervisory Manual and a new Supervisory Operational Policy to increase effectiveness of
banking supervision.

48.     The adoption of a risk-based supervisory framework will result in more efficient
utilization of supervisory resources, and hence will increase the quality of banking
supervision and contribute to the stability of the financial system. The present bank risk
assessment methodology for banks is mostly compliance based, as it does not take sufficiently
into account the risk profile of banks. In a banking system with systemic banks and other banks
with a moderate risk profile, supervisory resources could be better allocated during the annual

                                               18
planning process to improve efficiency and effectiveness of supervisory actions by the BoA.

49.     Although BoA has begun the process of moving towards a risk-based supervisory
approach, the elements are not utilized in the most efficient and comprehensive manner. A
transformation to a risk based supervisory framework would improve the quality of supervision
and would eliminate inefficiencies. A comprehensive, new Risk Based Supervisory Manual will
be issued to address, inter alia, strategic risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate
risk, operational risk, as well as cross-cutting issues of governance and control systems,
profitability and capital adequacy. Based upon the introduction of this new risk-based
supervisory methodology, a new bank rating system will be introduced in 2014.

50.     To build upon the forthcoming introduction of a new risk-based supervisory
framework, BoA will revise its Supervisory Operational Policy (SOP) 9 to align its bank
examination cycle with a new risk rating system of banks. As the current examination cycle
does not consider the risk profile and systemic relevance of individual banks, changes to the SOP
are needed to address this issue, by differentiating the inspection cycle of banks by risk profile
and/or systemic nature. The revisions to the SOP will also provide linkages to the new bank
rating system, as the old rating methodology does not reflect the true risk profile of a bank on an
on-going basis. The revision of the SOP will better align supervisory processes with enhanced
supervisory and enforcement tools.

51.    Results. By end-March 2015, inspections of five of 16 banks are conducted in accordance
with the new Risk Based Supervisory Manual and the new Supervisory Operational Policy,
including at least two systemic banks.

Prior Action #2: BoA Supervisory Council issues new Instruction for designated systemic
banks to adopt Recovery Plans to demonstrate their ability to operate during periods of stress.
52.     The 2008-2009 financial crises highlighted the need for authorities to have more
effective tools and information to enable the orderly recovery and resolution of financial
institutions. One of the essential instruments for effective crisis preparedness and management
is the availability of bank-specific Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRPs) for systemically
important banks or banking groups in the event of severe stress. The topic is quite relevant in
Albania, wherein deleveraging pressures from Eurozone parent banks continue. BoA and banks
have to be better prepared to appropriately mitigate potential idiosyncratic and/or systemic
shocks if such should occur. Using its methodologies, the BoA has identified 5 to 7 banks to be
considered as systemic for RRP purposes.

53.     The formal adoption of a new mandatory Instruction for the preparation of bank
specific recovery plans would increase the resiliency of the banking system and allow BoA
to better utilize its supervisory resources and resolution powers. Recovery plans for
designated systemically important banks are contingency plans that banks prepare ex ante to
demonstrate their ability to maintain operations during stressful times. This instrument will
significantly enhance banks’ risk management practices and will provide sufficient information

9
  Supervisory Operational Policy is the BoA’s internal guideline on how to plan and conduct on-site inspections at
the banks.


                                                        19
to the authorities to better understand potential barriers for bank resolution. Based on banks’
recovery plans and other relevant information collected from banks’ parent groups, the BoA will
thereafter begin preparation of bank- specific resolution plans.

54.    Results. By end-March 2015, all banks determined as systemically important submit
enhanced Recovery Plans to BoA, in line with the new BoA Instruction that formalizes the
content that must be included in banks’ Recovery Plans.

Prior Action # 3: Amendments to the Law on Deposit Insurance are accepted by Cabinet of
Ministers and submitted to Parliament, to better align the legislation and operations of ADIA
with the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems.
55.      Albania’s deposit insurance system is largely based on modern principles, and
recent reforms have strengthened the legal framework in compliance with EU guidance.
The ADIA law was amended in 2012 to address a key set of reforms: (i) to extend coverage to
Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs) with an initial Government contribution of Lek 50
million for a separately administered deposit insurance fund 10; (ii) to eliminate the practice of
setting off any insured deposit payment against any liabilities owed to the bank, thereby
facilitating a prompt payout after intervention by BoA; (iii) to exempt ADIA from public
procurement policies when exercising its compensation function; (iv) to provide ADIA with the
authority to levy a special contribution on banks if needed to replenish its fund; and (v) to
expand ADIA’s powers to include the ability to contribute to a purchase and assumption or
bridge bank resolution. Subsequently, ADIA issued a regulation setting forth the process by
which SCAs would apply to become members of the deposit insurance scheme, and has begun an
assessment of the SCAs to determine which ones would become insured members of the scheme
by end-2015.

56.     However, ADIA’s compliance with the Core Principles for Deposit Insurance 11
needs to be further improved by amending the Law on Deposit Insurance. To fulfil
international best practice, ADIA should be provided greater autonomy in its operations in
accordance with Core Principle 5 (Governance). ADIA should be able to diversify its reserve
management to include foreign debt holdings and enter into information sharing arrangements
with relevant regional deposit insurance agencies. In addition, the ADIA should have full legal
protection, including a provision for defense costs on an ex ante rather than ex post basis to
ADIA staff, as well as for those acting at its direction. Better cooperation and information
sharing between the ADIA and BoA is necessary to ensure the ADIA can efficiently fulfill its
legal mandate. Therefore, the proposed operation supports amendments to the Law on Deposit
Insurance to, inter alia, enhance: (i) ADIA’s budgetary independence and enforcement powers;
(ii) its efficiency in deposit payout; (iii) its reserve management requirements; (iv) legal
protection for ADIA staff; and (v) to define the level of coverage and premiums for Savings and
Credit Associations (SCAs).


10
   The inclusion of SCAs was a significant step to bring ADIA in line with the Core Principles for Effective Deposit
Insurance Systems. The government has included in the 2014 budget an allocation of the initial capital of 50 million
lek as seed funding for the deposit insurance fund for SCAs.

   As assessed as part of the November 2013 FSAP in accordance with the core principles established by the
International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI).

                                                        20
57.    Results. By end-March 2015, ADIA completes assessment of compliance of eligible
SCAs with the legal and technical requirements of ADIA in order to ensure that eligible SCAs
enter the deposit insurance scheme by end-2015. In addition, by end-March 2015, ADIA
approves its own budget without BoA ratification.

Pillar II. Expediting resolution of NPLs
58.     Reducing the large stock of existing NPLs is of utmost priority for the authorities.
Although the legal framework for creditor/debtor relationships is modern and rather
comprehensive, debt resolution mechanisms, businesses reorganization and bankruptcy
proceedings are not working effectively. In this respect the BoA coordinated with other
stakeholders to put forward key reforms in the collateral execution regime, wherein key Civil
Procedure Code changes were adopted in early 2013. Moreover, further efforts are necessary to
improve the regulatory framework to strengthen credit standards, resolve tax ambiguities to
enable banks to write-off NPLs in protracted litigation, establish adequate incentives for private
bailiffs to execute collateral with speed and efficiency, and further reform the insolvency and
collateral execution regime. Arrears clearance would also help the reduction of NPLs. Reforms
in BoA’s regulatory framework would need to be supplemented by more effective risk-based
supervision, focusing on the quality of banks’ credit policies and underwriting standards to
ensure that newer loans are of better quality. There is additional scope for BoA to provide more
detailed supervisory expectations for NPL management, forward guidance, and enforcement
actions to better shape banks’ incentives for proper actions and to encourage more forward-
looking NPL-related policy discussions and macro-prudential considerations at the FSAG.

59.     Results. All the five prior actions in Pillar 2 (#4, #5, #6, #7 and #8) are to cumulatively
contribute to the reduction of the 23.5 percent NPL ratio as of end-2013 (stock of Lek 132
billion). The expected result is that by end-March 2015, the ratio of NPLs/total loans declines to
20 percent or less, with the write-off of at least Lek 20 billion of NPLs.

Prior Action # 4: Cabinet of Ministers submits draft amendments of tax law No. 8438 to
Parliament to resolve key NPL tax ambiguities to enable banks to write-off NPLs in protracted
litigation.
60.     Banks’ efforts to resolve problem loans are hindered, inter alia, by ambiguities in
the tax regime. By BoA estimations, owing to longstanding uncertainties in the taxation regime,
banks continue to keep a significant portion of older, unrecoverable NPLs on their balance
sheets. In an earlier bid to resolve the tax deductibility issues surrounding the write-off of NPLs,
the Minister of Finance issued a Directive to clarify Guideline No. 5 on Income Tax in May
2013, but it did not have the desired effect, as tax enforcement remains uneven. The main
uncertainty regards the tax deductible treatment for older NPLs, wherein legal actions were
initiated several years ago, and are still not completed. As a result of the uneven treatment of the
tax deductibility, banks’ generally did not write-off older NPLs as envisaged. Doing so would
help lower NPL rates and could foster the sale of some banks’ NPL loan books.

61.    In order to resolve the tax ambiguities, necessary amendments to the tax code were
submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in early February 2014. A Working Group consisting
of the MoF (on behalf of the Tax Authority), the BoA and key stakeholders was formed in
November 2013 to determine key changes required in the tax code to remove tax ambiguities

                                                21
that would enable banks to write off NPLs in protracted litigation. Parliamentary consideration is
forthcoming.

Prior Action # 5: BoA Supervisory Council adopts amended regulation on “Credit Risk
Administration” for the obligatory write-off of stale-dated NPLs following a fixed period of
time classified in the “loss category.”

62.     To facilitate the write-off of stale-dated NPLs, BoA will introduce changes to the
regulation “On Credit Risk Administration” to define a maximum period of holding loss
loans in the balance sheet on the bank. Because of the tax ambiguities towards inconsistent
application of tax legislation referenced above, banks have been unwilling to write off the stock
of old NPLs. With the BoA’s amendments to its regulation, banks will be obliged to write-off
those loans which have been in the “loss” category after three years’ time, regardless of the
status of pending legal actions. This prudential measure, in combination with tax legislative
changes to remove tax ambiguities, will enable banks to write-off stale dated NPLs. This would
contribute to significantly reduce the present stock of NPLs over time.

Prior Action # 6: BOA issues three sets of guidelines on: (i) loan restructuring for businesses;
(ii) loan restructuring for individuals; and (iii) real estate appraisal, based on international
good practice.

63.     BoA has published debt restructuring guidelines, based on international best
practice, in order to encourage a more active approach to loan restructuring that would
enable borrowers to fulfill their contractual obligations. BoA has published important
guidelines on loan restructuring for businesses and for individuals. The objectives were to
establish principles that allow cooperative borrowers (individuals and businesses) who are in
financial difficulty to fulfill their contractual obligations, and to prevent as much as possible the
enforcement of collateral, which involves a long and costly procedure for the lender. The
guidelines aim to encourage a common standard around debt restructurings in Albania, which
has many benefits, including providing companies with the option to continue operating and to
successfully overcome the difficult times, providing individuals with an opportunity to keep their
homes, enabling creditors to reduce losses, reducing the strain on courts, and avoiding negative
social and economic effects that can be caused by foreclosing on collateral.

64.     In addition to the restructuring guidelines, BoA published guidelines on real estate
appraisals to encourage real estate valuations using a common set of standards within
financial institutions and across the financial system. Such standards provide useful guidance
to all parties (lenders, borrowers, and appraisers) as to the required scope of a real estate
valuation. A better understanding of and adherence to these standards should help all appraisers
reach convincing conclusions, increasing confidence in the marketplace, and improving the
climate for NPL resolution by reducing challenges to valuations in the credit restructuring or
foreclosure processes.

Prior Action #7: BoA Supervisory Council adopts a new regulation on “Risk Administration
for Banks’ Large Exposures” to strengthen credit underwriting practices and NPL recovery
and resolution for large borrowers.
65.    In recent years BoA has adopted numerous supervisory and regulatory decisions to

                                                 22
strengthen the NPL resolution framework, yet took relatively fewer actions focused on
improving banks’ management of NPLs. Given the high NPL ratio and a large pool of “watch
loans, 12” the authorities will adopt additional measures to encourage the resolution of the stock
and flow of NPLs, by improving banks’ credit risk management and underwriting going forward.

66.     In order to reduce the NPL stock, BoA will amend its regulations to strengthen
banks’ NPL management and reporting requirements for large borrowers. Large borrowers
constitute a significant portion banks’ total loan portfolios. The BoA has introduced new
regulatory requirements to increase banks’ Steering Council members’ responsibilities towards
NPLs and keep them more directly involved in the ‘decision chain’ regarding large loan
exposures, including loan approvals, restructurings and NPL management 13.

67.     To address the flow of new NPLs, the BoA has revised its credit underwriting
regulation, focusing initially on large borrowers. Banks will gradually be required to consider
audited financial statements for large credit decision purposes, in contrast to the current practice
of credit underwriting staff frequently relying on unaudited management accounts. Going
forward, it is expected that banks will significantly improve their underwriting standards, and
hence will gradually encourage better underwriting standards towards smaller loans.

Prior Action #8: MoJ and MoF issues new instructions to provide market based incentives for
private bailiffs’ compensation.

68.     The resolution of NPLs is also hindered by weaknesses in the private bailiff regime
supporting the collateral execution framework. Currently private bailiffs are de facto paid in
full by creditors at the beginning of the collateral execution process, irrespective of their success.
As such, the incentive for private bailiffs to promptly fulfill their collateral execution mandate
may not be well aligned with a speedy collateral execution process. The current Instruction No.
1240 of 2009 by MoF and MoJ on “Determining tariffs for the services of private bailiffs” and
the Sample Contract between bailiffs and creditors (issued by instruction No. 8543/2 in 2010)
have unclear and contradictory provisions with regard to the compensation of private bailiffs.

69.    New MoJ and MoF instructions issued to provide more transparency and
consistency. It is necessary to permit negotiations between private bailiffs and creditors,
especially on larger obligations, to provide private bailiffs a 'success fee' or similar incentive
upon completion of the collateral execution process. This will result in increased competition and
improved incentives to promptly execute on collateral, a necessary prerequisite to the reduction
of NPLs.

Pillar III. Strengthening regulation and supervision of the NBFI sector


12
     Watch or Category ‘II’ loans are not included in the published NPL figures.
13
   To further enhance banks’ NPL management process, with FinSAC implementation support TA, the BoA will
also require banks to prepare NPL recovery and resolution plans for their largest borrowers, which should be revised
on a periodic basis. Banks will then be asked to commit to work-out targets supported by quantitative objectives,
with a view to resolve the NPL legacy stock over an agreed time period, as practiced in EU crisis countries. This
will result in a requirement for banks to prepare recovery and resolution plans for at least the 20 largest NPLs (and
related borrowers) in each bank.

                                                           23
70.     The effectiveness of the AFSA as the non-bank regulatory authority is impeded by a
weak regulatory framework that does not comply with international best practices. With
new insurance and investment funds complexities arising, it is essential to improve the
operational and financial capacity of the AFSA. There are weaknesses in the regulation and
supervision of NBFIs, owing largely to the AFSA’s lack of independence, restrictions in
effective use of its financial resources, and acute shortage of qualified personnel. As a result,
insurance supervision and regulation is only partially compliant with the IAIS core principals.

71.     Significant legal reforms are necessary to achieve AFSA’s financial and operational
independence and turn it into an effective insurance regulator. Insurance supervision has
been constrained by the rigid rule-based Insurance Law, which prevents the AFSA from issuing
risk based insurance by-laws to address the evolving needs of insurance supervision. The current
supervisory regime does not provide the AFSA with the ability to undertake timely interventions
and makes it difficult for the agency to adopt enforcement measures. Adoption of a new
Insurance Bill and amendments to the FSA Law, the Law on Salaries of Independent Institutions,
and the Civil Servant Law are necessary.

Prior Action # 9: To ensure the financial and operational independence of the AFSA, the
Cabinet of Ministers accepts and submits to Parliament: a new Insurance bill, and
amendments to AFSA Law, Law on Salaries of Independent Institutions, and the Civil Servant
Law.

72.     Due to the absence of a proper risk-based insurance regulatory framework, the
AFSA does not have the authority to require contingency plans and/or assess the
operational risk management framework of insurers. The AFSA’s ability to carry out
effective risk-based insurance supervision, reflecting the nature, scale and complexity of
individual insurers, is severely compromised. 14 Furthermore, the AFSA under the current law
cannot properly undertake risk based supervision. Adoption of the new Insurance bill will allow
the AFSA to introduce a new risk based supervision approach, provide for risk ratings, early
warnings and a suitably flexible on-site inspection mandate.

73.     Thus, the AFSA Law needs to be amended. Amendments would inter alia: (i) abolish
the requirements for the AFSA to have its organizational structure approved by the Parliament;
and (ii) remove the AFSA from the civil servants’ compensation and benefits structure, so it has
the ability to attract and retain sufficient experienced technical staff. The legal protection of
AFSA’s Board and staff must also be strengthened by giving them legal protection for the bona
fide discharge of their governmental, regulatory and administrative functions and powers. The
Law on Salaries of Independent Institutions should exclude the AFSA from the list of institutions
subject to this Law and should specify that compensation for AFSA employees is set pursuant to
the Law on the AFSA. In addition, the Law on Civil Servants should be amended to explicitly
exclude the AFSA from the scope of this law.

14
  The current law does not require, inter alia, insurers to have proper risk management policies in place to either
outline the management of material risk categories, the insurer’s business strategy or to describe the relationship
between the insurer’s tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements, and the processes and methods for
monitoring risk. Moreover, the FSA is unable to enforce an explicit asset-liability management (ALM) policy
requirement or link its relationship with insurance product development, pricing functions and investment
management decisions.

                                                        24
74.    Results. By end- March 2015, AFSA’s Board adopts its own organizational structure and
market-based salary scale independently from Parliament, allowing it to regulate and supervise
NBFIs more effectively.

Prior Action # 10: The AFSA adopts market stabilization measures to issue: (i) a regulation
on minimum MTPL reserving standards; and (ii) a time-bound plan to replenish funding of
the Compensation Fund.

75.     There are serious challenges in the MTPL insurance market. In the absence of
rigorous MTPL reserving standards or their robust enforcement, the on-going price competition
will only further undermine the already weak financial fundamentals of the nascent insurance
industry. In turn, this will act as a major impediment to the growth and development of the
Albanian insurance market. The AFSA has agreed to undertake immediate MTPL market
stabilization measures by establishing through regulation minimum reserving standards to ensure
a level playing field, adequate claims paying capacity, and the overall solvency of the market.
The funding of the MTPL Compensation Fund should be replenished by adopting: (i) a detailed
time-bound plan that requires insurance companies to fully finance the (unpaid) claims incurred
before 2014, as currently about Lek 1.3 billion is outstanding; and (ii) a financially sound
mechanism that will guarantee proper and timely settlement of new claims caused by uninsured
vehicles after 2013. Going forward, the aforementioned MTPL insurance market stabilization
measures will have to be closely monitored by the AFSA to ensure market compliance.
Furthermore, the AFSA should closely cooperate with the Ministry of Interior to reduce the high
level of uninsured vehicles, which is currently estimated at 25 percent of total number of
registered vehicles in the country.

76.    Results. By end March-2015, funding of the MTPL Compensation Fund is replenished in
the amount of Lek 430 million to enable payment of pending insurance claims.

Analytical underpinnings

77.     The Bank has undertaken extensive analytical work and policy dialogue in the
policy areas and on each of the prior actions supported by the proposed operation, largely
through the late 2013 FSAP and supporting assessments or technical notes. Table 4 lays out
the analytical activities and their linkages to prior actions supported by this operation. In
addition, the operation has benefited from the recently concluded FIRST TA on Deposit
Insurance, and on-going support provided to BoA for the mitigation of NPLs by the World
Bank’s FinSAC as of 2012. BoA subsequently requested FinSAC to expand its support in 2013
to provide TA in the following three areas of NPL mitigation: (i) preparation by banks of whole-
portfolio NPL reduction strategies; (ii) design of enabling supervisory action by BoA; and (iii)
establishment of a cooperation framework among banks and borrowers for voluntary debt
resolution. These related exercises, which are intended to further facilitate the reduction of NPLs,
are slated to be concluded by the second quarter of 2014.

   C. LINK TO CAS AND OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

78.     The proposed operation supports the objectives of the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY10-FY13. The CPS focuses on three strategic Government priorities: (i)
supporting a recovery in Albania's growth rates through improved competitiveness, by
strengthening macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improving the business
climate, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and deepening access to credit; (ii) broadening
and sustaining social gains by improving education and health services and establishing an
adequate safety net; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to climate change by improving water
conservation and management and increasing disaster preparedness.

79.     This operation contributes directly to Pillar 1 of the CPS, by supporting reforms
that aim to strengthen the banking sector and resolve NPLs, which are an impediment to
banks’ resumption of lending, necessary for economic recovery. The CPS progress report
highlighted that objectives and pillars of the CPS remain unchanged since its preparation in
FY11, but the prolonged volatility in Eurozone economies since 2008 has resulted in increased
emphasis on reducing economic vulnerabilities and supporting economic growth. Thus, the CPS
program has been adjusted to better help Albania manage the risks arising from internal and
external vulnerabilities. In this context, the CPS Progress report envisaged the delivery of the
current financial sector DPL to strengthen the resiliency of the financial sector, as soon as the
government demonstrated a clear commitment for tackling key fiscal and structural issues.

80.     The proposed Financial Sector Modernization operation is being prepared in
parallel to the Public Finance and Growth DPL of US$100 million, the first in a series of
two programmatic DPLs that aim to improve Albania’s public finances and sustain
poverty-reducing growth. The series focuses on addressing weaknesses in public finance
management that have resulted in the accumulation of general government arrears, improving
Albania’s fiscal outlook through revenue-enhancing measures, as well as pension and energy
sector reforms. The government recognizes that steps to strengthen public financial institutions
and reduce fiscal vulnerabilities are critical for Albania to protect the fiscal space for growth-
enabling investment and poverty-alleviating social services.

81.      Additionally, the proposed operation is being prepared in parallel with a US$160
million Power Recovery project. Coinciding with the recent sharp slowdown in economic
growth, the power sector experienced recurrent energy shortages due to weather related events.
A persistent high level of power losses has necessitated government support to its generation and
distribution companies to import power and cover operational deficits. The pressure on the sector
has mounted over time, with the country’s limited hydro-reliant power supply, exacerbated by its
inherent vulnerability to weather volatility, weak sectoral governance, a flawed market model,
and utility mismanagement. Given these conditions, it is essential that the power sector extricate
itself from a modus operandi of crisis management towards sustainable operations, which will
positively affect businesses and consumers alike.

   D. CONSULTATIONS, COLLABORATION WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

82.    The World Bank has collaborated closely with the IMF on this program. The World
Bank team is coordinating closely with the IMF on financial sector reforms and building on the

                                               27
Bank-Fund collaboration during the recent 2013 FSAP and subsequently on the delivery of TA
regarding investment funds. The IMF’s newly approved EFF program in the amount of EUR
330.1 million (around US$457.1 million) will help Albania to meet its external financing needs
while providing the necessary support to strengthen fiscal and debt sustainability, lower public
financing risks, and put the economy on a sustained growth path.

83.     The World Bank has also consulted other donors on financial sector related
reforms, including the European Commission (EC) and USAID. It has consulted the EC on
financial sector related reforms, so that the proposed measures are in line with Albania’s
commitments towards the EU. The EC is considering providing budget support to Albania,
whilst the ECB envisages providing TA to the BoA through EC funding to strengthen banking
sector supervision. In addition, the World Bank has consulted with USAID, which is
implementing a Country Financial Sector Development Program, which aims to provide
technical assistance to BoA, ADIA, and the AFSA. Preliminary recommendations of the 2013
FSAP have been extensively taken into consideration while planning these future interventions.

84.     The financial sector authorities are consulting with a range of stakeholders on the
specific measures supported by this DPL. In particular, the authorities are consulting with the
banking industry on issues related to NPL resolution, including on taxation issues and NPL sales.
With regards to the NBFI sector, reforms in insurance regulation, supervision and strengthened
powers and tools of the AFSA, have been widely discussed with the insurance industry.


                V.      OTHER DESIGN AND APPRAISAL ISSUES

   A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

85.     The reforms supported by this operation contribute to poverty reduction and
shared prosperity, through mitigating financial sector vulnerabilities which, if realized
would undermine broad-based growth. As evidenced by the recent Eurozone financial crisis, a
malfunctioning financial sector can be detrimental to economic growth and can undermine
achievements in shared prosperity. A sound and stable financial sector intermediating funds to
the economy is essential for sustained economic growth, which in the long term contributes to
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Moreover, effective financial sector reforms increase
the availability of credit and extend the reach of savings, payment and insurance services to the
poor, rural dwellers and micro-enterprises alike.

86.     Financial sector reforms supported by this operation would reduce the likelihood of
a financial sector crisis, which can be costly to depositors and affect the poor
disproportionately, leading to an increase in poverty. Reforms that support NPL resolution
promote financial sector stability and encourage new credit flows to the economy, which would
help finance both consumption needs and productive investments, necessary for economic
growth. Moreover, a well-functioning insurance sector, which honors its obligations on a timely
basis, is in the interest of every policy holder. In addition, reforms that include bringing eligible
SCAs into the deposit insurance scheme provide an important new measure of protection for
small depositors and the poor in rural areas, who constitute the bottom 40 percent.


                                                 28
87.     The DPL is expected to have neutral or positive gender-differentiated impacts. No
direct gender inequalities in the areas of relevance to this DPL exist. Limited available data,
however, suggests that women are less included in the financial system than men in Albania with
a lower share having an account, savings or a loan in a financial institution (2011) 15. Therefore,
reforms to strengthen and further develop the financial system may contribute to including
underrepresented groups, such as women, in the financial sector through, for instance, an
increased availability of credit and a higher coverage of deposit insurance schemes.

     B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

88.    The proposed DPL measures are not likely to have any significant effects on
environment, natural resources and forestry. The policy measures focus on legal, regulatory,
and supervisory reforms to strengthen and further develop the financial sector, with no impact on
the environment.

     C. PFM, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING ASPECTS

89.      Albania has participated in a number of detailed reviews of its public financial
management (PFM), among them two PEFA assessments (2006 and 2011), a Public
Expenditure Review (2006), a Public Finance Review (2013), annual EU-SIGMA reviews, and
more specific analysis by the World Bank, the IMF, the EC, and other organizations. The various
reviews have plotted the progress Albania has made in improving its PFM systems and
institutions. The 2011 PEFA assessment concluded that Albania has an adequately functioning
fiscal and budget management system, in the sense that the system has enabled the government
to finance and execute a budget that delivers public services to the general population. Albania
scores relatively well on comprehensiveness and classification of the budget, basic treasury
operations (including budget, and payroll controls), financial reporting/transparency and public
access to government budget and financial information. Lagging areas identified in the 2011
PEFA assessment include: (i) multi-year perspective in fiscal planning and policy formulation;
(ii) internal audit; (iii) implementation of the integrated planning system (FMIS); and (iv) the
scope and nature of the external audit function.

90.     The Medium Term Budget Plan (MTBP) and the Annual Budget Law are the two
main documents presented for Parliamentary review and approval. These documents are
part of Albania’s Integrated Planning System 16 which tries to ensure that the core policy and
financial processes of government function in an integrated manner. Still, the process allocating
expenditure commitments is fragmented which renders it difficult to ensure that each set of
decision makers take all relevant considerations into account. Each has a specific perspective
derived from its mandate and mode of operations but operates separately from the other decision
making and management agencies. This can lead to such disconnects as approval of more
activities and expenditures than the funds available can accommodate, altering the balance
15
  For example, while 34 percent of men held an account in a formal financial institution in 2011, 23 percent of
women did. Similarly, 6 percent of women, compared to 9 percent of men, took a loan from a financial institution in
the year before the survey (World Bank Findex database, data for men and women 15 years and older, 2011).
16
  The IPS also includes the National Strategy for Development and Integration, the Government Program for
European Integration, the Public Investment Program and the planning of external assistance.


                                                        29
between new construction and service delivery or operations, or diverting funds from other
priorities without full awareness of the consequences. Though there are processes to screen and
approve proposals for investment projects, these functions are not yet fully integrated into the
overall budget process and the linkages remain somewhat weak.

91.      Albania has made progress in developing the national treasury system, yet
challenges still remain. A Treasury Single Account (TSA) has been introduced and all central
government expenditures are recorded through it, though the recording of expenditure
transactions is dependent on the timely submission of accurate information from primary budget
institutions. Records and information are produced, maintained and are widely disseminated.
The State Treasury is a direct participant in the automated inter-banking system of the Bank of
Albania (Albania’s Central Bank) and reconciliations between the Central Bank and Treasury are
performed on a daily basis. The central Treasury prepares monthly and quarterly budget
execution reports for all levels of government, with generally accurate data, broken down by
economic and functional classifications and the reports are available one week after the end of
the period. The MOF monitors the execution of local government budgets as these accounts are
managed by regional (district) treasury offices. Monthly and annual budget execution reports are
available to the public – these reports can be found on the Ministry of Finance website. While
all contracts are required to be registered with the treasury within 3 days of signing, this has not
always occurred in a timely manner, and is one of the factors that have given rise to the
accumulation of significant expenditure arrears. In an attempt to strengthen cash management
and planning, the treasury system can register multi-year contracts, however the outer year
commitments are not currently disaggregated, thereby distorting the actual level of commitments
and obligations and impacting effective medium-term budget and financial planning. Revenue
receipts (tax and customs collections) are collected outside the TSA and are reported to the
treasury on a net basis (taxes levied less refunds). This issue is slated to be resolved in 2014 with
the introduction of the multi-annual commitments in Treasury for the outer years.

92.    Although there is no current IMF safeguards assessment of the Bank of Albania 17,
the foreign exchange control environment of the central bank is satisfactory. The Bank of
Albania has received unqualified (clean) audit opinions from external auditors (KPMG) for the
past three years (2010-2012). In view of this, there are no additional fiduciary safeguards
considered necessary as far as management of the foreign exchange is concerned.

93.    While the fiduciary risk for this development policy operation is assessed as
substantial, no additional mitigation measures are required. Although the fiduciary risk is
primarily driven by the current PFM environment in Albania, the clean audit opinions of the
Bank of Albania (Central Bank) and the combination of the prior actions of the First Public
Finance and Growth development policy operation (P147226) and medium-term PFM reform
program negate the need for additional measures to be introduced to safeguard the loan proceeds.

94.    Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one single tranche to the existing treasury
account in the Bank of Albania and will form part of Albania’s official foreign exchange
reserves. The proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s procedures for development policy

17
     An updated IMF safeguards assessment will carried out in 2014.


                                                         30
lending. Disbursement will be made upon declaration of loan effectiveness and submission of a
withdrawal application to IBRD. It will not be linked to a specific purchase, thus no procurement
requirements are necessary. The government shall ensure that upon deposit of an amount of the
credit into the foreign exchange account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the
government's budget management system (single treasury account) and reflected in the budget. If
loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, IBRD will
require the Government to refund the amount directly to IBRD. No additional fiduciary
arrangements are required. The World Bank will not require an audit of the deposit account but
will the Government to provide confirmation to the Bank in the form of an official letter from the
MOF on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account within 30 days of receiving the
funds.

   D. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

95.     The Bank will continue to work closely with the MoF, BoA and other key
stakeholders to monitor and assess reform progress and impacts during the course of this
financial sector operation. Monitoring and evaluation will be supported by the BoA, MoF, the
MoJ, the ADIA and AFSA, as well as the Prime Minister’s office through legislative and
economic data provided by the authorities and verified in official disclosures, directives and
regulations. Baseline and updated data are provided by the respective agencies and tracked
according to the indicators and outcome measures shown in the monitoring and results
framework of the policy matrix (Annex 1).


                VI.     SUMMARY OF RISKS AND MITIGATION
96.     The overall risk assessment for this operation is substantial. Whilst risks related to
fiduciary, environmental and social, stakeholders and other categories are lower, the operation
may be affected by substantial risks arising domestically and/or from the external environment.

97.     An exit from unconventional monetary policy in the United States could trigger a
pullback in global risk appetite. This could reduce foreign funding and increase the rollover
risk for the outstanding Eurobond. Given the large external current account deficit, funding
pressures could lead to a depreciation of the lek, threatening the solvency of banks due to the
presence of un-hedged borrowers. This risk is mitigated by the planned FIRST Initiative TA in
support of public debt management and the BoA’s strengthening of its systemic liquidity and
market operation mechanisms, as recommended by the recent FSAP.

98.     A weak economy, rising interest rates or further deterioration in the domestic fiscal
outlook would adversely impact the banking sector. Given their substantial holdings of
government bonds, banks would incur substantial losses if interest rates rise. NPLs could
increase further as a result of a persistent weak economy or potentially due to rising Government
arrears, requiring additional provisioning and adversely affecting bank profitability. Rising NPLs
could threaten banks’ capitalization. This risk is partly mitigated by high solvency ratios and
stringent provisioning rules. This risk is also partially mitigated by the Government’s ambitious
reform agenda focusing on addressing domestic fiscal and energy related challenges, including
the payment of arrears to the private sector, which should result in an improved economic

                                               31
outlook. The Government’s reform agenda will be supported by an IMF program, in addition to
the parallel First Public Finance and Growth DPL and Power Recovery Project, both currently
under preparation. This proposed financial sector DPL will support measures strengthening the
banking sector and resolving NPLs, thus partially mitigating the risk of further adverse impacts
in the banking sector.

99.      Re-emergence of financial stress in the Eurozone could increase deleveraging
pressures, and/or result in the exit of a foreign bank from the market. Stress in European
parent banks resulting from the ongoing ECB Asset Quality Review exercise could reduce their
ability to re-capitalize Albanian subsidiaries. Such de-leveraging pressures could lead to
subsidiaries of affected banks to cut bank lending, or could lead to an exit of foreign banks,
undermining public confidence. Although Albania has been relatively successful in protecting
itself from the European financial crisis to date, a loss of depositor confidence or a large
withdrawal of parent funding could lead to a systemic crisis. If liquidity pressures emerge, the
capacity of the BoA to act as a lender of last resort in foreign currency is limited. This set of
largely exogenous risks can be mitigated through, inter alia, enhancing the operational
framework for monetary policy, developing a collateralized money market, establishing an
external back-stop facility for the deposit insurer and more broadly enhancing the market for
government securities.

100. Fiscal pressures arising from the energy sector will be substantially mitigated
through the proposed Power Recovery Project by supporting implementation of the GoA's
Power Sector Recovery Program. The new program is centered around four main pillars: i)
resolving existing legal disputes, particularly with CEZ a.s.; ii) enhancing the security of supply
through diversification of generation sources and additional generation acquired through
domestic investments; iii) improving system efficiency in the distribution sector to reduce power
and to improve cash collection rates and bad debt provisions; and iv) enhancing regional trade by
strengthening the interconnection system.

101. The reform program for the nonbank sector may also be undermined by the limited
capacity of the nonbank regulator. The AFSA is affected by an inability to attract and retain
qualified professional staff. Given the recent growth experienced in the non-bank sector, it is
essential the AFSA be provided sufficient resources, both human and financial, to better fulfill its
mandate. The proposed operation aims to address this longstanding deficiency through reforming
and modernizing the legal basis of the AFSA. Additionally, TA is envisaged to support the
AFSA regarding insurance, private pensions, and investment funds. The proposed operation and
supporting TA will enable the non-bank sector to better approximate relevant European Union
Directives or guidance towards the insurance, investment fund, and private pension sectors.

102. Finally, the viability of the Financial Sector Modernization DPL program may be
undermined if there is insufficient political consensus to pass in Parliament the underlying
five law amendments and the Insurance Bill featured in the Prior Actions, or more broadly
implement the financial sector related reforms, which depend upon the continued
collaboration amongst the authorities (MoF, BoA, FSA, ADIA, and MoJ). The authorities
have embarked on a challenging reform agenda of fiscal consolidation and financial sector
reforms, some of which may prove politically difficult to implement. This risk is partially
mitigated by broad and inclusive consultations with the relevant Ministries and regulators. A

                                                32
Ministerial Committee has been formed to coordinate the implementation of prior actions. There
is broad support for strengthening the banking sector, reducing NPLs, and improving the
regulation and supervision of the insurance sector and investment funds. The implementation of
the reform program supported under this operation will be closely monitored through ongoing
policy dialogue and planned financial sector focused technical assistance building on key FSAP
findings and recommendations.

Dear Dr. Kim:
The Government of Albania appreciates the long-standing partnership and cooperation with
!he World Sank on a range o f development issues; in patticular w e remain cognizant oftbe
crucial development financin& and implementatiOI'l support that the \Vortd Bank has provided
to AJbnnja•s reform program and transition over the last t\\'0 decades.


 Context: Albanian fin ancial sector· in the a ftermath of tbe global and Euro~one cris es
Albania had a high growth ofarou11d 6% in tM lost twotlecudes up to the onset ofthe 2008
global crises and it weathered the crisis relotirrely welL The growth shock was less severe
than e1 sewbere in Europe. Albania avoided an economic recession thanks in part to monetary
accommodation and a moderate fis.ca1 stimulus. h1fiatio1   1 remained low and stable. The
spillo\•er risk from the presence of -Greek and other peripheral euro country banks was
oonlained and relative smbilily in t~e financial system was maintained.
Although 11~ AlhanianfmMcial zy.sltm withstood Ihe shocks of 2008 global crisis relatively

Albania was excessive. but it has m oved into a downturn and repair stage~ as suggesl<.-d by
the slowdown in credit and moderation in house p ri~ the sharp increase in noo-perfonning
loans and tile reduction in banks pr<>fitability maJgins. While the Bank of Albania (BoA) has
been vigilant in mitigating the risks - through instituting capital adequacy and solvency ratios
that are above international norrn~ and putting in place stringent provisioning rules-- the
financial sector remains vulnerable to several risks. Stress tests show that some banks still
remain vulnerable lO shocks. The d.e cllne ill profitability, growing oon--pcrfom1ing loans
(NPt.s). subslantial level of euroization, C01 \tillued dele\'craging of foreign bank subsidiaries
from Austria, Greece, ltaly and Turtc:ey and significant investments in government bonds in
the absence of active secondary ma tket are 1  he main challenges that banking system faces.
Given strong trade and financiallioks with ewo area, the financial system and real sector in
general are inc.reasingly vulnerable to external shocks as well

sustairwbility. Albania's public debt has increased from about 55 percenc of GOP in 2008 to
about 70.5 percent in 20 13 emanating largely from poor tax revenue performance, slower
economic growth and continued infrnstn1
                                      cture Sl>ending, resulting in a large stock of unpaid

1m1king them vt1lnerable to changes in interest rntes and 1 he value of debt securities. At the s~une
time, the government depends 0 11 regular t'ollover of debt by banks. The risk is heightened by the
lack of n well-functioning secondary market and the emergence of investment funds~ which face
signiiicant liquid ity risk and challenges regarding asset valuation.

        Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems, and particularly to ensure full
        operational independence of AD IA through passage of the ADIA law amendments. We
        will improve the regulatory framework on insurance companies and investme.nt funds, to
        deal with rising l'isks on their activity through passage of the four laws supporting the
        AFSA relbrms, composed of amendments to the AFSA Law, the Civil Servants Law, the
        Law on lndependelll lnstitutions and the Insurance Bill. The Bank of Albania (BoA). as
        the t-egulator of the banki ng sector, will remain vigilam to identify material weaknesses in
        the sector nnd when necessory, require banks to provide sufliciem levels of capital and
        liquid assets a.i well as iiHI'oducc substantial improvements in go\'emance and credit risk
        management. BoA is also advancing toward risk-based supervision, by adopting the best

             Reforms Supported by the Financial Sector Oevelopmentl'olicy Loan
The Financial Sector Modentization Development Policy Loan (FSM-DPL) from the World
Bank supports our eiTorts to: (i) expedite the resolution of Non-Performing Loans (ii)
strengthening the fin~>>c ial sector supervisory framework and financial safety net; (iii)
strengthening the Nonbank Financial Institution (N llFI) sector.
(i)   Exnet/Wng the resolution ofNon-Pqrfonnitw Lqqns
The level ofNPLs in the bcmking system has incrCtlsed sign!flcanlly in t!?? ufiennath oft/U!
jlnancial crisis. A hhough the Cinancial sector remaim;d largely stable dmiug the gl ob.HI <.: ri ~,
the highly elevated level ofNPLs introduces significant risks to the stability of the sector as well
as to its effective and efticient operation. NPLs have inct-eased fl·om 3.4 pet·cent at end-2007 to
more than 24 percent in September 20 13. "llte rapid increase of NPLs lik• ly involves a
combination of thcwrs, including the economic slowdown, government payment arrears and
we-f1k credit underwriling slandards during the credi1 boom before the financial crisis. Also, loss
loans are not being cleared from banks' books due to prolonged major difficulties in the
execution of collateral for loans in default (e.g., loans in excecution at end-2013 represent
around 17 percent of all loans, or more than 2/3 of banks' total NPLs). Thus, accelerating
collateral execution process represents n very critical issue. exasccrbated by the lack of clarily in
the. tax treatment of loon write-offs.

Credit to the real economy has stalled. Companuiv.zly strict provisioning requiren1ents and a
comfortable cap ital adequacy ratio have helped to contain the NPLs' negative shocks to the
system tlms far. However. the large. increase in NPLs and deterioration in the economic outlook
have caused banks to take a much more conservative approach to lend ing and contributed to a
sharp slowdown in credit growth in the last four years. Annual credit grov.rth turned negative in
September 2013 for the first lime in the last decade, declining by 3 percent (year-on•year).
Although the accumulation of domestic deJXlsits in the banking system has: been steady during
the last years, the banks continue to pose tight credit supply condit ions toward the domestic rc.al
sector. f'ut1hermore, the banks have significantly in.creased investing of domestic savings in
foreign assets.
We recognize 1fwt tt,' i credil risk continue.'i to be a major risk in the jhumcial sector·. the rising
/rend ofNPI-s fil l he banking system should be rackled decisively. We have ah-eady taken some
actions in this regard and~ closely collaborating with tl1   e World Bank. we remain committed to
undertake other measures that will bring down the level of NPLs. reduce credit risk, and help to
unleash the cred iting potential of the linancial sector. In this regard, the BoA enhanced in
February 2014 its regulAtory framework to strengthen credit standards and provide more
guidance on NPL management. The BoA and the Mof, in conjunction with the MinistiYof
 Justice and other t"lated agencies and Albanian Bonking Association have submitted to
 Parliament the legal amendment of the Tax Law to remove legal and technical issues tl>    at impede
 the loan write-otTs from banks' balance sheets. In addition, we will prepare (with IFC assistance)
changes in the Civil Code and other relevant laws in order lO introduce improvements Jn
insolvency ,.equi,·ements. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice signed i:n early
 March 2014 a new Joint lnsu"ction for private bailiffs to set the payment1o bailiffs in line with a
success rate (rather than requiring full up-front payment a~ at present), and aim to further restrict
j udicinl discretion in postpon ing borrowei'S payme.nts or determining priority in collateral

claims. Of course, arrears clearance will also help NPL reduc1ion.
More specifically the Government and Bank of Ali>ania are implementing the followillg key
measures with the support of the FSM- OPL:
        Removing ambiguities on tax tre-atment ofNPL write-otis, by introducing lega] changes
        and ensuring a better understanding and appropriate execution by tax inspectors. The
        respective amendments of tax law No. 843& will be shortly submilled for approval to
        Parliament. Such legal c.hangcs, will allow BoA to swifily introduce changes itt the
        t-egulatory supervisory framework addressing the obligatory write-off of stale dated NPL
        following a fixed period of time classified i11 the "loss" category.
        BoA has issued new guidelines- related with loans restructuring fol' businesses and
        individuals, as well as for 1-eal estate appraisals. These will serve as best practice to banks
        in this regard.
        With continuing assistance of the World BaJ>k (FinS AC), the BoA is designing a
        c<Jmprehcnsive NPL resolution platform. The main tows of this illitiative is to develop
        the appropriate tools to facilitate, on one hand, the etl'ective enforcement of creditot'S'
        rights and on the other hand, to return the operationally viable borrowers to sustainable
        debt servicing capabi lities and enhanc.c new borrowing via appropriate linancial nnd
        corporate res(rucluring activities. Therefore, the addressing of impaired loans t11at could

             in line with the European Union's Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV).
             lllis regulation provides for some more qualitative requirements to banks related
             with the Steering Council responsibilities. In particular, it addresses the decision
             making process in cases of ct·eatior and l'estructlll'ing of exposmes to large
             borrowers as well as some ''- '<luirements dealing with i) fisk analysis

       These measures, along with a broader cooperation with the World Bank in this regard, arc
       expected to contribute to the lowering oft he NPL rntio below20%, by the end-of March

While a number o.f ma,•ro prudential policies wert· pu1in place s;nce 2007, BoA remains
commilled to slreng!lten jiJrther its IJUICJ'O~prudenNal toolkit. BoA has adopted tiglller approach
in the earlier stage by converting foreign bank branches into subsidiaries and by tightening
liquidity regulations. In 20 13, in order to stimulate a credit growth, BoA has eased the liquidity
requirelllents nnd 1-educed capital covemge tOr those banks that expand Annual credit growth
within a range of4 to 10 percent, as well as introduced disincentives for banks to hold funds
overseas. As the imp.nct of these measures is likely to be limited g.iven the persisting pet·c-eption
of high credit risk by banks, BoA remains vigilant to continually weigh the potential
effectiveness of such measures in the near term w,th lhe longer tenn potential costs.
Thr: BoA will continue to slrengthen its macro·pn;denlia/f ramework. ln this 1   ·egard, it will gather
additional infonnation on the interlinkages between Lhe banking sector and the non-bank
financial institutions, and develop its macro-pna dential toolkit to address syslemic risk issues by
etld 2014, including its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (£LA} framework. BoA, along with
other authorities, will ensure that the meetings of the Financial Stability Advisory Gt'Oup (FSAG)

       The BoA will advance toward risk-based supervision, by adopting a Risk-based
       Supervision Pramework which already includes a new Risk Based Supervisory Manual
       and a new Supervisory Operational Policy, to be both implememed in banks' on-site
       inspections during 2014. Tit e above two documents were approved by BoA Supervisory
       Council and by the First Deputy Govemor, respectively on 26.03.2014 decision No.9
       and date 27.03.2014, decision No. 590. By end-March 2015, inspections of 5 banks

More Si>ecilically the Govenunent, BoA and AFSA are implementing the following key
measures with the suppon of the FSM-DPL:
       The A FSA will improve the regulatory framework on insurance companies and
       investment funds, to deal with rising risks on their uclivity by end-June 20 14. In
       particular, the regulatory frame wo1·k for investment funds on asset valuation, liquidity
       requirement, and capital adequacy requirement will be enhanced.
       To ensure the financial and operational indepe11dence oftl1e AFSA, the Council or
       Ministers will submits to Parliament by end-March 2014: a new fllsurallce Lmv, and

IMF Executive Board Approves €330.9 Million Extended Arrangement for Albania
Press Release No. 14/81
February 28, 2014

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 36-month
SDR 295.42 million (about €330.9 million, or about US$457.1 million; 492.4 percent of
country’s quota in the Fund) arrangement under the Extended-Fund Facility (EFF) for Albania
in support of the authorities’ reform program. The approval allows for immediate disbursement
of SDR 23.55 million (about €26.4 million, or about US$36.4 million). The World Bank and the
EU are also likely to provide assistance to the authorities’ reform program.

Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Albania, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Albania’s economic outlook is expected to improve in 2014, spurred by the planned reduction
of underlying risks in the fiscal area, clearance of arrears, tackling of high nonperforming loans
(NPLs), and the launch of structural reforms. However, risks are significant and refinancing
needs are large. The EFF will help Albania meet its external financing needs while providing the
necessary support to strengthen fiscal and debt sustainability, lower public financing risks, and
put the economy on a sustained medium-term growth path.

“Albania’s high public indebtedness calls for fiscal consolidation that aims to lower the public
debt ratio to below 60 percent of GDP in the medium term. This will require significant tax and
expenditure policy measures, supported by extensive public financial management and tax
administration reforms. Lowering the outstanding stock of arrears and putting in place
mechanisms to prevent their recurrence will also be critical.

“Further moderate easing of monetary policy could help to support economic recovery, provided
inflation expectations and financial stability remain well anchored. However, this would need to
be carefully balanced against risks posed by high unhedged foreign currency exposure.

“Preserving financial stability while promoting access to credit is necessary to facilitate a
durable recovery. Reducing NPLs will safeguard financial stability and may help release credit
supply constraints by lowering bank risk aversion. Steadfast implementation of the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations, including those related to lowering
risks in the non-bank financial sector, will be important.

“The authorities’ plans to reform pensions, energy, local government finances, public
administration, and the business environment are welcome. If implemented properly, these
reforms should strengthen Albania’s ability to attract investment, improve prospects for
sustained medium-term growth, and reduce fiscal risks, Mr. Lipton stated.”

2.      Out of sixteen banks operating in Albania, two banks are dominating the market
with cumulative 46.4% market share. The subsidiary of Austrian Raiffeisen bank used to
historically be market leader with more than 30% market share, though recent deleveraging
pressures have significantly changed that trend, enabling local and non-European subsidiaries to
expend their market penetration. Nevertheless, of the five largest banks, which collectively hold
about three-quarters of total assets, four remain foreign banks with Austrian, Turkish, Italian and
Greek ownership. There are six mid-sized players in the market, while the five smallest totaled
less than 5 percent of total assets. In sum, subsidiaries of foreign banks represent about 93
percent of total banking sector assets.
3.      Banking services are fairly modern and skewed toward urban areas. There has been
a significant increase in bank branches in recent years and 14 banks offer electronic banking
transactions through a variety of instruments such as debit and credit cards, ATMs, point-of-
service terminals, internet banking, phone banking, mobile/SMS banking, and prepaid cards.
Most branches and ATMs, however, are located in urban areas.
4.      Bank credit is concentrated in the corporate sector. About 74 percent of the value of
loans in 2012 was to the corporate sector, although the vast majority of individual loans
(95 percent) were granted to individuals. As of 2012, real estate loans accounted for 40 percent
of the total, and overdrafts, equipment purchase, and working capital represented 24 percent, 16
percent, and 14 percent, respectively. Credit to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)
increased 29 percent during 2007-12, but its share in total loans decreased from 37 percent to 25
percent over the same period.
5.      Several features of the banking sector increase its vulnerability to shocks. Low bank
profitability and the rapidly rising rate of NPLs are the main risks that banking system faces. The
quality of the loan portfolio has deteriorated markedly since the onset of the crisis. At end-2013
gross non-performing loans (NPLs) represented 23.5 percent of total loans, the highest in the
region. Foreign currency loans have performed worse than local currency loans, with NPL ratios
of 25.7 percent and 19.7 percent, respectively, at end-2013 (Annex figure 2). Most lending is
secured by collateral, although the BoA does not allow this value to be subtracted from loan-loss
provisions for prudential purposes. Provisioning rules are conservative, and total provisions
represented 65 percent of NPLs at end-2013. The profitability has declined sharply and turned
negative in 2013, eroding buffers that had previously supported loan provisioning (Annex figure
3) .

 The Euro is the domestic currency in Montenegro and Slovenia.


6.      High financial euroization contributes to the vulnerabilities in the financial system.
The euro is used pervasively in the financial system. As of end-2013, 63 percent of loans and
53 percent of total liabilities of banks were denominated in foreign currency—mostly the euro.
The loan to deposit ratio is lower for the lek segment than for the foreign currency segments,
standing at 41 percent and 70 percent, respectively, at end-2013. Although net open positions in
the euro are small, risks include: (i) half of loans in foreign currency are unhedged; (ii) there are
large maturity mismatches; and (iii) credit risk for euro loans may be underpriced, as indirect
exchange rate risk may be difficult to measure. In addition, a sudden stop in FDI would directly
affect systemic liquidity in Euros and the BoA has a limited capacity to act as a lender of last
resort in foreign currency.

7.      Strong links between investment funds, banks, and the sovereign are another source
of systemic vulnerability. One-third of bank assets consist of government securities, and these
holdings represent two-thirds of total government debt. This financial interdependence represents
systemic risks for banks, which are vulnerable to changes in the value of longer-term debt
securities, and for the government, which depends on regular rollover of debt by banks. In
addition, investment funds, which hold mostly illiquid government bonds, present a systemic
liquidity risk that affects banks.

8. Vulnerabilities exist to external shock as well mainly due to strong ties with foreign
parents. Financial difficulties in parent countries can affect Albanian institutions through direct
contagion, defunding pressures, or higher NPLs (if domestic borrowers have special links with
the parent country). Although the conversion of bank branches to subsidiaries was a timely step
that served to limit contagion from foreign parent banks to the Albanian banking sector,
delivering pressures may nevertheless continue.

9. While in comparison with international norms the BoA has conservative capital
adequacy and provisioning requirements, stress tests conducted during 2013 FSAP showed

                                                                 48
that banks remain vulnerable to shocks. In severe macroeconomic scenarios, banks suffer
simultaneous losses from credit, market, and sovereign risks, and at least 6 banks (representing
21 percent of the assets of the banking system) become undercapitalized. Sensitivity tests also
indicate that a lek depreciation would deteriorate the quality of loan portfolios, and that credit
risk is exacerbated by the high concentration of loan portfolios. Liquidity stress tests confirm that
banks are amply liquid and are able to confront large deposit withdrawals. Direct contagion risk
through bilateral domestic interbank exposures is limited.

Macro and micro-prudential framework

10. The BoA was given a macro-prudential mandate by law and was successfully using its
new powers during the crisis. The modified Banking Law reinforces the general responsibility
for financial stability and mandates the BoA to take action to mitigate systemic risk. A set of
macro-prudential policies was put in place in late 2011 to limit contagion risks and international
spillovers: (i) foreign bank branches were converted into subsidiaries; (ii) liquidity regulations
were tightened; and (iii) the regulation on related party exposure was enhanced.

11. As credit growth dropped significantly in 2011-2012 the BoA has again eased banks’
prudential requirements in 2013 to stimulate credit growth. The BoA eased liquidity
requirements from 25 to 20 percent, reduced capital requirements for those banks that expand
credit growth within a range of 4 percent to 10 percent, and introduced disincentives for banks to
hold funds overseas. The impact of these measures was and is likely to be limited due to the
difficulty of effectively targeting measures to stimulate (the credit growth in 2013 turned
negative). The use of prudential tools to boost credit carries potential risks to financial stability
and going forward the authorities should continually weigh the potential effectiveness of such
measures in the near term with the longer term potential costs.

12. The macro-prudential role of the BoA is complemented by the inter-agency Financial
Stability Advisory Group (FSAG). The FSAG was established in 2006 as a consultative entity
to assist in the coordination of policies and to ensure the exchange of information among its
members (Article 30 of the FSA law). It is chaired by the Minister of Finance and currently
comprises the BoA Governor, and the AFSA Chairperson. Building on the statutory duties of
each authority, an MOU signed in 2012 elaborates on the role of each institution in crisis
management and enhances cooperation among its members towards three objectives: financial
development, crisis prevention and crisis management. The involvement of the ADIA in the
FSAG was also initiated through this MOU.

13. Albania’s deposit insurance system is largely based on modern principles. The mandate
of the deposit insurer as a paybox is appropriate for the development and size of the financial
sector. The use of a flat rate deposit insurance premium (as opposed to risk-based premia) is
prudent given ADIA’s relatively recent establishment. However, the absence of coverage for
enterprises contravenes EU guidance on coverage. The ADIA has developed procedures for
admitting qualified SCAs to the deposit insurance scheme, but it is essential that the initial
capital of 50 million lek be funded, which the government has planned to provide in 2014.

                                                 49
14. The micro-prudential framework and the quality of banking supervision in Albania has
improved significantly since 2005, as previous FSAP recommendations were implemented
and the regulatory and supervisory framework moved toward alignment with EU
standards. BoA has incorporated many guidelines from the Basel Accords into its legal and
regulatory framework, which has served to strengthen and expand the banking supervisory
regime. The framework for licensing activities, including evaluating the application for a de novo
bank, has been strengthened. BoA has established criteria for corporate governance and issued
standards for bank management, the internal audit function and several prudential standards.

15. In spite of these positive developments further improvements to address remaining
weaknesses to underpin the necessary improvement in the health of the banking sector is
needed. In particular, supervision continues to be predominantly compliance based and the
evaluation of risk management practices in banks can be superficial. Importantly, banks tend not
to be challenged thoroughly on the quality of their credit policies and underwriting standards, an
issue that underlay in part the deterioration of the portfolio of loans made prior to the crisis. In
addition, corrective measures imposed on banks are mostly based on prudential standards rather
than focused on addressing risk management issues. Consolidated supervision should be
enhanced in light of the establishment of the new investments funds, including by closer
information sharing and cooperation with AFSA.

16. To address these weaknesses, BoA has embarked on a program of risk-based
supervision, including full implementation of Basel II by end-2015. The BoA has developed a
detailed road map tailored to the local circumstances (with assistance from the IMF), and a new
capital adequacy regulation and guidelines for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements (with the
assistance of Bank of Italy). A new risk based supervisory process also will be introduced. The
Pillar 2 framework will serve to enhance the evaluation of risk management practices in banks,
but its implementation will be challenging as it requires the development of risk evaluation
processes, including the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process and the Internal Capital
Adequacy Assessment Process. In addition, the regulations on credit risk and problem loan
management should be revised. The Supervision Operations Policy needs to be reviewed as well
to adapt fully a risk-focused approach. The BoA is also considering implementation of the
liquidity component of Basel III, a move which the WB team supports.

Non-Bank financial sector

17.     The non-bank financial sector in Albania is relatively small, constituting 6 percent
of financial system assets. As of mid-2013, it included 11 insurance companies, two investment
funds, 126 savings and credit associations in two unions, two independent SCAs, 3 pension
funds, and 21 other non-bank (that is, non-deposit-taking) financial institutions:

       a. Insurance market. Albania has one of the smallest insurance markets in Europe, with
          gross written premiums of 8.95 billion lek (€64 million) of both life and non-life
          insurance in 2012. The development of the sector has been hindered by the lax
          insurance regulation, low disposable incomes, a poor industry record of claims
                                                50
             performance and the lack of trust in insurance among the public. Despite a very low
             market penetration rate of about 2,860 lek (€20) per capita, the real growth of
             insurance premiums from 2009 to 2012 was only 3 percent, falling even below the
             cumulative GDP growth (7.5 percent) over the same period. Local insurance
             companies have been engaged in a MTPL price war, which over time has led to
             reduced growth of premium written, considerably increased risk exposure, an
             inadequate level of reserves, and weak underwriting performance.

         b. Investment funds. Investment funds had no presence in Albania before 2012 when
            Raiffeisen Invest (a separate legal entity fully owned by the Albanian subsidiary of
            Raiffeisen bank) established an investment fund, the Raiffeisen Prestige Fund. The
            timing coincided with a withdrawal by the Albanian subsidiary of Raiffeisen from
            government debt markets as a result of pressures from its parent bank to limit its
            exposure to the Albanian sovereign. A second fund, the Raiffeisen Invest Euro fund,
            was subsequently added and these two funds have now grown to a total net-asset
            value of 316.7 million euro (as of late-October 2013). They have more than 22,000
            investors (largely individuals).

         c. Savings and Credit Cooperatives. The assets of SCAs accounted for about 0.8 percent
            of financial system assets in 2012. There are two unions (with 124 member SCAs)
            and two independent SCAs. A considerable share of the unions’ assets (30 percent) is
            invested in bank shares and treasury bills. About 83 percent of assets are directed
            toward loans to members, mostly in the agricultural sector. SCAs are supervised by
            BoA.

         d. Pension funds. The voluntary private pension market (‘third pillar’) holds less than
            0.1 percent of financial system assets and aims at supplementing pensions offered
            under the government’s obligatory scheme. 19 There were three pension funds
            operating at end-September, 2013, with a net asset value of about US$3.4 million and
            a total membership of 7,784.

         e. Other nonbank financial institutions. These hold 2.7 percent of financial system
            assets and comprise mainly non-deposit-taking lending institutions and leasing, with a
            share of 65 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Other institutions undertake money
            transfers services and factoring. Such NBFIs are funded primarily through borrowing
            (about 60 percent) and their capital (about 35 percent). They are supervised by BoA.



19
  The public pension scheme (‘first pillar’) is the backbone of Albania’s social security system. It is a mandatory
pay-as- you-go system with universal coverage. Its management is entrusted to the Social Insurance Institute (SII),
an independent public entity under the supervision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.


                                                         51
Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority

18.     Insurance market, investment funds as well as pension funds are regulated and
supervised by Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority. AFSA is an integrated supervisory
authority established in 2006 through merging three separate supervisory authorities. It is a
public institution which is funded by the industry and is accountable to the Parliament. AFSA did
not receive any state budget financing since 2010, however, the autonomy in setting its budget
and its internal organizational arrangements is considerably restricted. As a matter of practice,
AFSA is treated as part of executive government and civil servant law does apply. AFSA’s all
Board decisions can be appealed before a court.

19.     The effectiveness of the AFSA is severely impeded by a regulatory framework that
does not comply with the international best practice standards. The institutional setup of its
insurance and investment fund supervision and regulation has proven ineffective owing to its
lack of real independence, severely constrained financial resources, absence of representation in
the law-making process and the acute shortage of qualified personnel. As a result, insurance
supervision and regulation is only partially compliant with the IAIS requirements for a modern
and effective insurance supervisory authority and investment and pension funds supervision is
similarly constrained.
