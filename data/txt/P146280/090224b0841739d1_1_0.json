satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important to maintain sufficient\n            flexibility to adapt and respond to client needs and\n            economic realities in the country. As the risks in the\n            financial sector were high during the preparation phase,\n            adding a strong sense of urgency to the need to adopt\n            financial sector related reforms, the team worked hard to\n            build sufficient ownership of the many policy and regulatory\n            changes. In particular, previous engagement through\n            knowledge sharing activities (the 2013 FSAP, TAs with BoA)\n            also enabled the WBG to react quickly to the pressing needs\n            of counterparts. This approach proved the importance of\n            continuous engagement with client through capacity building/\n            technical assistance activities during the absence of a\n            lending project. The regular coordination with other\n            partners, combined with providing necessary technical\n            assistance on a timely basis, positively impacted the\n            outcomes achieved. Cooperation with other international\n            agencies (IMF, USAID, and EU) proved essential, given the\n            extensive technical assistance that needed to be coordinated\n            and aligned with the country\u2019s and sector\u2019s priorities. In\n            particular, this project benefited extensively from\n            coordination with IMF on knowledge sharing activities as\n            well as the Fund\u2019s three year EFF program. This program has\n            ensured the adequacy of macroeconomic framework by helping\n            Albania to meet its external financing needs, while\n            providing the necessary support to strengthen fiscal and\n            debt sustainability, lower public financing risks, and put\n            the economy on a sustained growth path."}, "docdt": "2015-12-16T22:19:03Z"}
