Although the overall results\n            of the project remain unsatisfactory, many lessons can be\n            learned form this project: 1) while the Bank's general\n            policy is not to extend the credit closing date, it seems\n            that in this project there were sufficient grounds to do so\n            for certain components. The Bank should have considered\n            restructuring the project earlier to complete at least some\n            of the components as originally planned. 2) Compromising on\n            the requirement for upfront agreements on critical\n            prerequisites for the success of the project leads to\n            incomplete and unsustainable outcomes. 3) It is important to\n            avoid in project design lumping together discrete\n            components, each of them complex in nature, to form a\n            project which involves various agencies. 4) Strong\n            government's and other stakeholders' commitment\n            and ownership of reforms is one key factor to successful\n            project implementation. 5) Frequent changes of task\n            leadership without adequate overlap and orientation have\n            contributed to delays in the decision-making process. 6)\n            Early identification of critical issues and proactive\n            modification of the project as needed could lead to a\n            greater likelihood of achieving the project objectives."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
