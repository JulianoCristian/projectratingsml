This Environmental Asscssment has been prepared by ERM as part of the
SWM component of the Colombo Environmental Improvemeni Project
(CEEP), proposed for funding by the World Bank. It has been prepared on
behalf of the Mini'try of Home Affairs and Provincial Councils (MHAWC),
and the Western Provincial Council (WPC) of the Government of Sri Lanka
(GOSL), the project proponents. Coordination of the CEIP is the
responsibility of the Metropolitan Environment Improvement Programme of
the Ministry of Policy Planning, and Implementation (MPPI). The SWM
mz.oniponent covers the following activities:
Activity 1:    development of a management and organisation structure
for municipal solid waste management, including model
ik                                          contracts for private sector participation, propuoals for
institutional strengthening and the identification of the
requirements for solid waste management infrastructure
(initially identified as a transfer station and a landfill site).
Four district councils will be identified for the introduction
of pilot schemes for private sector involvement in waste
collection, transfer, recycling and disposal "'.

together with the preparation of conceptual designs and
identification of sites for proposed transfer/disposal facilities.  (
In addition, as an extension to the above activities, ERM has carried out            (
research into the availability and technical/environmental attributes of six
potential landfill sites for the disposal of solid waste arising from the
Colombo Metropolitan Area, leading to the identification of the selected site       C
at Galudupita Road, Welisara in the Gampaha district of the Westem
Province.                                                                           (
An Inception Report covering all the original prescribed activities (Activity 1-6)
was submitted by ERM to the GOSL (MEIP/IMPI) and the World Bank in
August 1993 (1). Two other reports have also been submitted to date, in
October 1993 and March 1994, which provide evaluations of alternative
landfill sites for solid waste disposal () t3).
The present report is prepared on behalf of the project proponent (MHA&PC            C
and WPC of the GOSL) and provides the final EIA for the landfill site
proposed to serve the disposal needs of the Colombo Metropolitan Area over
the next 15 years. The ElA report forr1as the output of Activity 4.
*~~~~~~~~~
1.2           SCOPE OF TH  ES
The disposal site for solid waste is proposed to be a single landfill site at        C
Caludupita marsh, in the Welisara area, located approximately 10 km north-
*                         east of central Colombo. The landfill is planned to have sufficient capacity to      (
dispose of the solid waste arisings from the Colombo Metropolitan Area for
at least 15 years. This landfill site is the focus of this draft EIA, within the
broader context of solid waste management for the Colombo Metropolitan
Area.
The overall solid waste management system will also include one or more
transfer stations, through which a proportion of the colle-ned waste arisings
will be processed for cost-effective bulk delivery to the landfill site. A
transfer station site to serve the landfill has been selected at Baseline Road.
Its availability has recently been confirmed by the Colombo Municipal                (
Council (CMC). The potential environmental impact at the transfer station
site is addressed in this draft EIA, in the context of road transport of waste to
the landfill site, and an envirorunental review of the overall operation of the     c
site is presented in Annex A.
Over the operational life of the landfill, a variety of factors, including
changes to the pattern of waste generation, could indicate the need for
further transfer station sites to optimise the overall cost of delivery of wastes

1.3.1          Integration with the Conceptual Design
_                              The initial concept for the design of the landfill site, including the approach
proposed to engineer the site and address the key geotechnical, design and
operational aspects (see ERM  report, dated March 1994 (1), has been used
as the basis of the ETLA
1.3.2          Consideration of Environmental Impacts
The design and method of operatioki of the site are key factors in
establishing the effects which the proposed landfill may have on the local
and wider environment. The design and EIA of the landfill site are inter-
linked, where mnitigation of the potential environmental impacts forms, an
integral part of the design process.
_                              The environmental aspects considered in the draft EIA have been prepared
__                            in accordance with the World Bank Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 (October
1991) and the relevant GOSL legislation -). The description and evaluation
of the potential environmental impacts are addressed under the following

Public consultation is an essential part of the project planning process, and is    C
a formal requirement in Environmental Assessment, both of the World
Bank 01 and of the Sn Lankan Govemment .                                            c
The World Bank requires that public forum meetings are held early on in
the project planning cycle to ensure that the views of all affected parties
are adequately taken into consideration in the decision-making process.
The World Bank also requires that the EA report be placed in a public
place so that any interested party may refer to the document.                    (
* Part IVc of the National Environment Act requires that a 30 day
consultation period is provided foUowing submission of the draft final EA
report for any prescribed development project, and that the report itself is
placed in the office of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), the
Project Approving Agency (in this case, the Ministry of Housing,
Construction and Urban Development), and the relevant local authority
(in this case, the Divisional Secretariat Wattala) for ease of reference (this
has now taken place). The disclosure of the EA report is advertised in
The Gazette and the local newspapers, and the public are invited to
submit written comments to the Project Approving Agency within 30
days. This is a new procedure in Sri Lanka and so far the main
*                          respondents are NOOs who take an active interest in new development              (
proposals.
In response to these requirements, a programme of public consultation and
disclosure has been developed and implemented by the Ministry of Home
Affairs and Provincial Councils. During the course of the site selection           ;
exercise and the preliminary environmental review of the selected site, two
public meetings have been held by the Divisional Secretariat at Wattala, to         £
which local residents were invited. A record of these meetings ;s presented
in Anrnex D as part of the ongoing consultation and public awareness
campaign.
-u
The meetings were held under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the
Ministry of Home Affairs and Provincial Councils (MHA&PC) on the 12th
and 22nd of December 1993. The first meeting was attended by
approximately 25 people, predominantly residents and business                      0
representatives from the local area. After initial opposition to the landfill site,
the public realised, from the explanations given, that the landfill will be
based on sound scientific and engineering principles and not the usual open
dump, comrmonly in evidence in Colombo. Also, the fact that the site would
be available for agricultural and recreational use once the site was closed
helped to make the audience more amenable to accept the landfill than
before the meeting.

At the second meeting, where approxdmately 30 people were present, the
audience were predominantly from a wider area than just the immediate
vicinity of the landflll site. After considerable discussion, they agreed on the
safety of the engincering design, but voiced serious concerns that the site
would not be managed properly. They also questioned why the landfill site
could not be situated in part of the uninhabited land in the much larger
Muthurajawela marsh area, even though this is an ecologically significant
Du)                       and designated conservation area. The meeting concluded with the public
unanimously opposed to the development of the site. Several further
meetings will be scheduled as and when the need arises.
There are four particularly irnportant factors to bear in mind when
_                      considering public attitudes to the proposed development.
* This was the first time that direct public consultation of this type during
the project planning process has been undertaken in Sri Lanka, and the
public are not experienced in responding to this situation.
* There is a general lack of understanding about the distinction between a
dump and a sanitary landfill, and this is at the root of the majority of
objections to the development. Public consultation is also a part of the
_                           overall public awareness campaign (see Annex D) and, once this
misconception is removed, objections are generally greatly reduced.
* The Galudupita Road Marsh had already been officially designated as land
for development by the serving of a Section 2 Notice under the Land
Acquisition Act in July 1993, prior to the proposal of a sanitary landfill on
the site. Local residents have therefore been aware for sometime that the
site would not remain as open marshland.
* The people directly affected by the development of the Welisara site have
been designated as priority recipients of community development
assistance, and US$ I million has been allocated from CEIP funds for the
implementation of a Community Development Programme for the area.
For this reason public opposition to the landfill development at Wslisara
_                           has been minimal.
Since preparation of the EIA, a third meeting has been held (9 April, 1994)
with the families that are liable to be resettled. This meeting was generally
_                        reported to have gone well, with a considerable degree of acceptance
_                        achieved amongst residents.

This section presents a summary of the policy, legal and administrative
framework governing environmental management in Sri Lanka, and the EA
process in particular,
22          LAws GOJiNG EA OF DEvELOPMENT PRO             IN SRI LANAA
The key legislation goveming Environmental Assessment in Sri Lanka is
contained largely within the Acts listed below:
* Urban Developmenit Authority lw No. 4Z of 1978;
* Nation.l Environment Act No. 47 of 1980 as amended by Act No. 56 of 1988;  0
• National Environment (Procedure for Approval of Projects) Regulations,
No. I of 1993, Gazette Extraordinary No 772/*2;
• Planning and Building Regulations of the Urban Development Authority
(UDA) 1985; and
• Municipal Council By-laws.
22zi        Thr National Environment Act
The National Environment Act was passed in 1980. Part IVc (Gazette 772/22
came into force on 24 June 1993, and stipulates the requirement of (i) an EA
for prescibed development projects, (ii) the appointment of a Project
Approving Agency and (iii) a 30 day consultation period following
submission of the EA report. The Project Approving Agency, are responsible
for setting up a Technical Working Group to prepare Terms of Reference for
the EIA of the development project, and to review the reports.
2.2.2      Industrial Poltution 
All industries having pollution potential must presently be licensed by the
CEA, under the Environmental Protection Licensing (EPL) Scheme. This
license is issued to industries conforming to the required emission or
discharge standards specified in the CEA Regulations (CEAR). Emission
standards to control the discharge of air pollutants are being framed at
present.
2.23        Vehicular Pollution
There are a number or laws in Sri Lanka which relate to vehicle traffic, most
notably are the Motor Traffic (Special Provisions) Act No. 60 of 1979 and the
Transport Board Law No.19 of 1978. Both contain provisions to control             _
vehicular pollution. Also, the recently formulated 'Cean Air 2D00 - Action
Plan' has clearly demarcated institutional responsibilities for the management    I
of air pollution from both stationary and mobile sources.

2.4        Solid Waste Management
Solid waste management ia covered by National (CE.A), Provincial (Western
Provincial Council), and Local Authority Legal/Regulations as referred to the
13th Amendment to the Constitution (1987), decentralising power to the
provinces and the Provincial Councils Act No 42 of 1987. The Conservancy and
Scavenging powers set down for the municipal and urban councils in The
Municipal Councils Ordnance (Volume 18 Cap 576-579) of the Legal
Enactments of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 1980 is
concemed with solid waste management. In this, the municipal and urban
councils have powers to collect and dispose of waste, that such waste is the
property of the councils and that they have the power to sell or dispose of
all such matter and retain any income therefrom, (XVII/38, paragraphs
2)                      129,130 and 131).
2.3         INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE RELATING To ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The institutional framework for the protection and management of the
environment has four levels, as shown in Table 2.3a. These are summarised
in tur in the sections below.
23.1        National Government Level
Central Government Ministries are responsible for setting broad national
and sectoral policies for execution by line agencies. Some of the main
Ministries with a role in the inter-sectoral co-ordination of environmental
issues include:
|  Miniztry of Policy Planning and Implementation (IvPI'&D;
* Ministry of Environment and Parliamentary Affairs (M(E&PA);
_ft~                     a Ministry of Industnes, Science and Technology (M/IS&T);
* Ministry of Housing, Construction and Urban Development (M/HC&UD);
,                        * Ministry of Power and Energy (M/P&E)
.1..)                    * Ministry of Lands and Land Development
* Ministry of Forests, Irrigation and MahaweLi Development (M/LI&MD);
_~         2.3.2       Government Agencies and Departments, Level two
At the second level there are a large number of Government Agencies
entrusted with specific responsibilities with respect to a wide variety of
sectors. Important agencies with a role in urban environmental planning,
monitoring and implementation include the following:
* National Planning Department (NPD);
* Central Environment Authority (CEA);
* Urban Development Authority (UDA);

Th? National Planning Department
The NPD is responsible for evaluation of Government development projects.
It has wide powers within the Government decision making structure to seek
darification, call for accounting and guide the project cycle.
Urban Development Authority
The UDA, under the Colombo Master Plan (CM]), has identified the
Colombo Urban Area (CUA) and the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA) as a
primary focus of its activities and is the main agency involved in the
execution of development projects. The Authority is responsible for providing
standards on buildings, zoning, controlling pollution and maintaining
environmental quality.
The Board of Investment
The Environmental Unit of the BOl is responsible for ensuring that
environmental management functions are properly integrated within BOI
planning activities. The BOI has the authority to license industries and
monitor waste prior to disposal.
Tne National Building Research Organisation (NBRO)
NBRO is a semi-Government organisation, also operates under the
M/HC&UD. The Environmental Division of the NBRO has facilities to carry
out industrial pollution surveys, monitoring of surface and drinking water
quality and air quality monitoring.
The Central Environrnenta.1 Authority
The CEA which falls within the purview of the WE&PA is the executing
agency for the protection and management of the environment, and now
acts in the role of an enforcement agency. The CEA has the following
divisions concerned with this role:
* Environmental Protection Division is engaged in regulatory activities in
relation to the control of pollutants discharged into the environment This
division which deals with promotion of environmental awareness and
education and ensuring active public participation in environmental
programmes.
* The Natural Resources Management Division is engaged in the
formulation and implementation of strategies for the suitable utilisation,

conservation and management of the natural resource base of the
country. EIA's come under the responsibility of this division.           C
The following departments and institutions are responsible for
environmental management within the CUA:                                   C
* Forest Department
* Department of Wildlife Conservation
* Irrigation Department
* Water Resources Board                                                    C
The Irrigation Department must be informed of any change in drainage       C
patterns intended in its area of responsibility.
Semi-Gonernment Institutions                                                C
Under the M/HC&UB is the National Water Supply and Drainage Board           C
(NWS&DB). It is a semi-goverrunent institution responsible for the provision
of drinking water, sewerage facilities, and the planning and construction of
such facilities to residences, industries and commrercial establishments within
the CUA. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation
(SLLR&DC), also a semi-Government institution under the M/HC&UB, is
responsible for issues involving land redamation and the maintenance of the
canals and water bodies within its area of jurisdiction.
T7he National Environmental Steering Committee (NESC)
The NESC consists of principal policy-makers of key development and         C
resource conservation ministries and agencies. The functions of the
committee include; ensuring environmental implications are considered in
development projects; providing policy guidance and direction to
environmental initiatives, programmes and projects; co-ordinating of
different environmental initiatives, programmes and projects.
23.3        Provincial Council, Levcl 3                                                 C
The third level of government is the Provincial Council (PC) administration
which shares the responsibility for the environment with the Central
Government. The Colombo Urban Area (CUA) falls within the jurisdiction
of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) which is presently in the process of
establishing an Environmental Unit. The primary responsibility of this unit
is to co-ordinate and manage issues relating to solid waste. PCs have wide
legislative and executive power covering public lands, police powers,       C
environment, irrigation, agriculture, etc. Of principal concern to the
environment is the Provincial Housing and Construction department, the      C
Agriculture and Agrarian Services and the Health departments.
23.4         Local Government, Level 4                                                   C
The fourth level is the Local Government adniinistration, which include     C
Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas.

The Western Provincial Council (WPC) has been identified by GOsL as the
implementing agency for solid waste management in the CMA. It was
chosen because of its jurisdiction over the CMC and the other local
authorities within the Western Province. However, at the time of
identification WPC did not have the technical capabilities to exercise this
responsibility and, therefore, a Unit (The Environmental Unit of the WPC)
was created (for which details are included in Annex J). The primary
responsibility of the Environmental Unit is solid waste management. In the
future it is expected that the Unit would also have wider responsibilities for
other environmental matters.
2.3.5       Non-Government Organisations
There are well established NGOs involved in diverse environmental issues.
Prominent among them are the Sri Lanka Environmental Congress (SLEC),
Environmental Foundation Ltd (EFL), March for Conservation (MfC), Sri
Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science (SLAAS), Ruk Rekeganno
(Save the Trees) and Sevanatha. Most of the NGOs actively participate in
bringing about environmental awareness among the public, providing legal
assistance to the public, helping in community development projects and in
commenting on EIAs. Notably the EFL has been involved in advocating
environmental law reforms in different fora. For example, they assisted the
National Wetlands Steering Committee, to draft wetlands legislations and
advocated reforms in the new EIA regulations drafted by the CEA.
2.4         PRIvATE SECrOR iVVOLVEMENT IN SOUD WASTE MANAGEMENT
The GOSL is examirning the potential for privatisation in the waste
management sector, initially in solid waste collection, management of the
transfer station and the Welisara landfill, and subsequently, a composting
plant. Four areas in three local authorities have been identified for pilot
projects on privatised refuse collection services and, if these prove successful,
the approach will be extended to further local authorities.
The issues raised by involving the private sector in this currently public
sector service are being addressed in Activity 1 of this ERM study. The
following sections outline the considerations necessary regarding contractual
arrangements and related issues.
24.1        General Contract Formns
The TOR requires ERM, under Activity 7 to prepare model contracts for
various waste management services to be determined during the course of
the study. As a precursor to this, we have carried out a preliminary
assessment of contract types and procedures which are already in general
use in Sri Lanka, on which we aim to base our own model forms.
The Goverrunent of Sri Lanka has well established contract procedures, and
the Consultants and Contracts working in the country are already very
familiar with these procedures and the more common international model
ENVUOMI.WAL RlaouRm MAN4Aw.m                       coywr op Su IJu (Gc5L
13



forms of contract are in everyday use. These indude the forms issued by the
Institution of Civil Engineers in the UK and the International Federation   C
Intemationale Des lngenieurs Conseils (FIDIC). These typically relate to
works of civil engineering construction on lump sum and measurement          C
methods of payment.
In addition, the Government has issued guidelines for implementing Build,    C
Own and Operate (BOO) and Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) contracts
for infrastructure development and investment.                               C
Z4.2         Contractual and Institutional Issues
Options
Under Activity 1, ERM will address the various options that are available in
the execution of the landfill and transfer station contracts. In the case of the
landfill contract these will include design only, design and construct, design  C
construct and operate and design construct operation and restoration
variants.                                                                    (
It will also be necessary to address the question of the aftercare of the
landfill site and how this is to be managed. Some of these options also apply
to the transfer station. In this instance, it will be necessary to debate
whether the bulk transfer to landfill should be integrated with or separated
from the transfer station operation. The same would apply to other waste
management processes such as clinical waste incineration.
A choice will have to be made as to the form of the specification in each
case. This can be based on a detailed design or a performance specification
laying down a set of guidelines, physical and environmental standards and
criteria allowing the tenderer (under supervision) to exercise skdll and
judgement in complying with the conditions of the contract. Waste
collection and cleansing contracts are perhaps the best documented with
many hundreds of contracts already operating throughout the world, but
ERM will need to consider how these can be sensibly applied, say within a
ward or wards of Colombo Municipal Council on an experimental basis.
II]                      Institutional Issues Relating to Contracts
L  The preferred grouping of the design, construct, operate and other         C
elements of the contract.
• The identification of the Employer (the party to the contract) in each case.
|~~~~~~~ *The necessity for an agreement between the 31 authorities to cooperate in{
and utilize the contract facilities.
* Any additional prindples to be folowed in the contractual relationship
between the Employer and Contractor.,

*  Adherence tto World Bank guidelines and regulations. The identification
of the b,ody to take overall responsibility for all financial and contractual
relations with the World Bank
j  The detaUed natuwe of World Bank financial support for the project and
access to any Appraisal Rcports that have been produced.
)                         * The acquisition of land for the project The identification of the body to
initiate and manage the procedures set out in the Land Acquisition Act
1956 Revision (and later revisions).
T* he phasing of capital investments in the landfil site need to be
considered. Most ldLS(fills require investment for initial development, in
J                          set phases during the operation of the site, on completion and restoration
of the site and possibly in the aftercare period. Is the World Bank
)                           supporting all or part of these investments and in what forn?
* it is nornal for landfill operating contractors to receive a monthly fee,
J                           usually tornage related and with a fixed and variable element. If the
contract is to be for the life of the site, price fluctuation clauses will need
3                           to be considered. If the Contract is to fund some capital investments, the
costs of these will also need to be reflected in the fees charged. Are these
2I    <preferred World Bank policies in these matters?
_What systems are to be used and through which parties wil World Bank
funds be paid to the Contractor? These will need to be defined in the
General Conditions of Contract.
3                        Form of Contract
There is a considerable amount of comrnon ground in aD the contract forms
discussed in Section 3.2, relating to the basic laws of contract and the form of
the prncipal clauses and terms. There is nothing to be gained from
2)                       reinventing them for this particular project. The major effort needs
therefore, to be concentrated on the special conditions attached to waste
management operations, which makes them substantially different from the
construction type contracts that are well known in Sri Lanka. These range
from the materials movement, transport and labour dominated features of
waste collection contracts to be particular needs of a landfill development
and operation contract Landfill contracts require an appreciation of the
contractual implications of site design, development, operation, restoration
and aftercare of the site and its potential for long term liabilities to be
incurred. In every case, the general and special conditions of contract wil
require to be supported by carefully framed specifications describing how the
works are to be executed. An appropriate method of payment for the
contractors wiLl need to be devised.
The general form of the documents in each case will be:
* Irlstructions to Tenderers.

Liabilities
Although strictly not within the scope of this project, ERM considers it
prudent to raise the question of liabilities, particularly in respect of landfill
operations. Landfill sites can present some unique and long term risks to  6
adjoining landowners, the public at large, as well as surface and
groundwaters. These may arise principally through the migration from the
site of leachate and landfill gas, but may be compounded by public health
risks due to smell, vermin and other manifestations, if the sites are not well
managed.
The question arises as to what is an equitable balance and sharing of
liabilities between the Employer and the Contractor. These questions of
liability caused considerable debate in the recently awarded (1992-1993)
strategic landfill contracts in Hong Kong which was on a design, construct,
operate, restore and aftercare basis. This will need to be considered on this
project by the appropriate departrnents of Government.
Contractual and Institutional Issues
Under Activity 1, ERM will address the various options that are available in  6
the execution of the landfill site and transfer station contracts. In the case of
the landfill contract these will include design only, design and construct,
design construct and operate and design construct operate and restoration
variants. It will also be necessary to address the question of aftercare of the
landfill site and how it is to be managed. A choice will have to be made as to  6
the form of the specification in each case.
Identification of Interested Private Sector Companies
As required by the TOR, we have identified a number (approximately 15) of   e
local private companies who are or may be interested in providing waste
managernent services.                                                       0

are:
- materials recovery and recycling;

- landfill.
* A summary of the selection of the site for the recommended option.
-      =t                       Approximately 300 vacant sites within a 35 km radius from the centre of
, .                      Colombo were identified as potential landfill sites. The National Building
Research Organisation (NBRO) prepared a list of approximately 50 sites
from this original 300. These were subsequently shortlisted to 6 sites
-      l,                       which were further evaluated against a range of technical, logistical and
-      B                        environmental criteria. The sites considered were:
-  Pitumpa;
-  Kerawalapitiya;
- Hanwella;
_                               -  Hewagama;
- Morakelle;
-  Welisara;
The key conclusions of the evaluation of options are:
w
* the development and extension of materials recovery is not feasible;
* composting is not feasible in the short term but, over the medium-long

* landfllling is feasible, and is the most appropriate technique to be applied  £
in Sri Lanka.
Hence, the Consultants recommend that the disposal option for solid waste    £
is landfill. Through progressive screening of the six potential sites, the site
sclected for the landfill is Galudupita marsh, in the Wclisara area, which has  £
been approved by the Government of Sri Lanka.
Composting is higher in the preferred waste management hierarchy than        £
landfill, with benefits from the production of a useful product (compost/soil
conditioner) and, by the use of certain technologies, the generation of a    £
biogas fuel. Therefore, the Consultants reconunend that the strategy of
establishing economically viable composting in the longer term should
continue to be pursued as a complement to landfill.

A number of previous wastc management studies have been carried out in       5
recent years, relevant to the Metropolitan Colombo Area, including two by
ERM (formerly ERL) in 1985 and 1987. The most recent and relevant to the

3.2.2        Waste Arisings And Composition
This section gives a detailed description of the main sources of waste which  e
would eventually be handled at the Welisara landfill, namely:
* Municipal Solid Waste (MSW);
-                       * Industrial Waste from Export Processing Zones (EPZs);
* Hospital Waste.

The NBRO reports estimate that the per capita waste generation rate was
0.98 kg/day in 1990 for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area.
Conversations with CMC staff indicated that a figure of around 0.4 kg/day
was nearer the current figure (in 1993). The NBRO figure does include the
lb                         contribution from daily comrnmuters to Colombo, which would inflate the
residents' figure. Even so, the figure of 0.98 seems high to the consultants.
However, in the absence of more accurate figures, we are basing our
estimates of landfill life on this starting figure, together with the NBRO
estimated growth rate of 1% per capita per until 2010. Outside the city, we
have used a growth rate of 2% per capita per year. A number of waste
lW                 ~~~~~density figures are quoted in the NBRO reports, ranging from 250kg/cu m
d       for wastes as collected to 800kg/cu m for the final density after deposit in the
landfill. These figures are reasrnable. However, the NBRO figure of
250kg/cu m for waste during bulk transport from the transfer station is
considered too low and a figure of 450kg/cu m has been adopted in this
study for bulk haulage calculations.
Solid Waste from Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
In order to promote exports, the GOSL, through the Board of Investment
(BOI), established two Export Processing Zones (EPZs) at Katunayake
(KEPZ), which is 22A km north of Colombo adjacent to the Katunayake
International Airport, and at Biyagama (BEPZ), which is 11.2 km east of
Colombo in the Malwana area of the Kelani River. Cc.npanies within each
EPZ enjoy favourable conditions with regard to Inland Revenue, Exchange
Control Acts and the Customs Ordinance.

Hospital Waste
A survey of the arisings of hospital waste in the CMA was carried out by
ERM in August 1993 and the results arc shown on Table 3.2d. The Colombo
General Hospital is by far the largest hospital in the CMA covering an area
of 24 ha, with 2,300 beds, and generates almnost 1 torne of hospital waste per
day. Waste management practices at the hospital currently fall far below
acceptable Western and World Health Organisation standards for the
aon~                        storage, handling, trarsportation and disposal of clinical wastes. At ward
level the segregation of sharps has recently been introduced, although
storage is generally unacceptable. Storage is in unlidded standard cardboard
containers in which other materials have been delivered, and which can be
filled to overcapacity. It is now generally accepted that sharps should be
stored in containers made purposely for hospital use which allow used itcms
to be placed into them, but not subsequently withdrawn, and then securely
lidded when full. Under the General Hospital Colombo Rehabilitation
Project of GOSL, IDA and others, it is understood that a waste separation
pilot scheme will shortly be implemented. The objective of the proposal is to
separate clinical waste from non-clinical waste at ward/unit level in different
coloured polythene bags and then maintain their separation by different
handling and storage procedures. Unfortunately, to date, the Ministry of
Health and Women's Affairs have been unable to engage suitably qualified
drivers to bring this new transport system into operation.
The bulk of the overall waste stream arising at the hospitals in Colombo
consists of non-clinical waste, particularly packaging and food wastes
generated by relatives bringing rations to patients. The waste arisings of a
clinical nature which therefore require special precautions during disposal,
are currently estimated to total approximately 3 tonnes per day (') (2. An
evaluation of the composition of the hospital waste is currently in
preparation, with respect to the key matenials which require special
precautions during disposal, namely:
* human tissue, including blood, surgical debris and amputations, used
dressings, etc;
* slwrps, for example, used hypodermic needles, broken glass, etc;
* disposable medical equipment, such as contaminated aprons, gloves, etc;
* disposable urine containers, etc from infected patients;
* pharmaceutical wastes, including spent and out-of-date medicines, etc;
* special treatment wastes, such as cytotoxic waste from treatment of cancer;
* low level radioactive wastes, from special medical treatments.
At present, much hospital waste is flushed into the sewerage system and
does not therefore enter the solid waste stream. The provision of a better
collection system may therefore give rise to an increase in the total volumes
of hospital waste to be disposed of at the landfill.

3.2.3        Waste Collection
The present system of MSW coUlection in Colombo has two stages:
* primary collection; and
* secondary collection.
Primary Collection
In the primary collection system, waste is taken from the households by
handcarts, operated by local authorities, and deposited at waste collection
points. Each neighbourhood is served by its own collection point. Colombo
has some 1,004 collection points distributed about the city.
Secondary Collection
The aim of the secondary collection system is to remove the waste from the
disposal points and transport it to the disposal site. This is undertaken using
a variety of vehicles ranging from 7 or 10 cu m rear-cnd loading refuse
compaction vehicles to sideloaders and tractors fitted with trailers. Where
containers are used, these are lifted automatically and discharged into the
W.                         collection vehicle. Normally, some manual clearing is necessary to remove
any overspill and garden wastes which could not fit into the containers.
Where the waste is in bunkers or on open ground, it is manuaUly handled
into the colection vehicle or trailer.
3.2.4        Wastc Disposal
A detailed description of current arrangements for the disposal of MSW,
similar commercial wastes, solid waste from the EPZs and hospital waste is
provided in Annex F.
MSW and Commercial Waste
W                          Currently, MSW and similar waste arising in the Colombo Metropolitan Area
is disposed at Wellampitiya landfill site and a number of small, uncontrolled
dump sites in the vicinity of Colombo. Around 60 sites in total are
operational of which around half are official operations. The vast majority of
MSW, including all that arising from the CMC area, is disposed at
_                          Wellampitiya. The Wellampitiya site was proposed as a short term (3-5
years) site to demonstrate sanitary landfill practices in Colom'bo. However,
___                       the site preparation and working practices recommended have not been
adhered to. As such the Wellampitiya site (as well as around 30 other small
dump sites) has not been engineered or operated to modem, internatioral
environmental standards, and lacks pollution control and environmental
protection measures, such as leachate collectiorVtreatment and landfill gas
control. The Wellampitiya site is equipped with a drainage system which
collects contaminated rainwater run-off, but the system is open, uncontained
and appears to be in continuity with local groundwater. The collected run-
off is discharged untreated into a local watercourse.

Wcllampitiya is subject to uncontrolled scavenging by the local population,
who earn a living from recovering recyclable matcrials from the waste, Birds  {
and animals (domestic and wild) forage on the site. Urban development is
present up to the perimeter of the site, including housing, a school
inunediately adjacent to the site boundary, and a scavengers' settlement    {
which has become established within the site limits. Operational problems
recently encountered at the Wellampitiya include impassable site roads, due
to waterlogging in periods of heavy rain, and odour from uncovered waste,
due to the lack of suitable materials for use as cover. Wellampitiya and the
other dump sites are all associated with significant environmental problems,  (
including pollution of water resources and detriment to local amcnity, for
example odour, vermin (insects, rats, dogs, cats, etc) and unsightliness.
Solid Waste from the Export Processitng Zones (EPZs)
The wastes arising in Katunayake and Biyagama EPZs are disposed at open
dumps. One dump is located within each EPZ. The dumps are uncontroUed
and are not engineered with any environmental protection measures.
Scavenging takes place on both sites, but greater numbers of scavengers
work the Katunayake site. The Katunayake site is also commonly on fire,      (
which presents a serious health and safety risk. Katunayake EPZ also has
two small, primitive batch-type incinerators ('destructors') located at the
dump site. The destructors have insufficient capacity to handle the waste
arisings and are not equipped with emissions control equipment. The
destructors are unreliable and are frequently not in operation, with the result
that most of the waste is dumped.
At Katunayake, women are allowed onto the site on payment of a 15 rupee      C
charge which allows them to scavenge for four hours. They generally
scavenge for small pieces of cloth which they make into patchwork for        C
garments and other items. It would appear that there are regularly upwards
of 100 scavengers on the site at any one time.
At Biyagama the waste appears to be strewn over a much larger area than at
Katunayake, but scavengers are less in evidence and there are no fires at the
site. However, the site is extremely unsightly and is currently sterilising (i.e.
rendering unusable for other purposes) a large area of land within the EPZ.
Hospital Waste
There is one hospital waste incineratot in Colombo, at Sri Jayawardenapura
General Hospital. The incinerator was designed to handle the majority of
the waste generated at the hospital. Evidence from ERMs' hospital waste      C
study indicates that the incinerator is not adequately designed and/or
operated, such that poor and incomplete combustion of waste generates a      C
continuous plume of black smoke from the incinerator stack
The remaining waste arisings from other hospitals in the Colombo
Metropolitan Area are disposed at Wellampitiya or the other dump sites in
the area. Disposal is undertaken with normal MSW, and no special              t
precautions or methods are employed; for example there are no specially

3.3         'NO ACION' ALTERNAMTrE
The 'no action' altemative is that the existing waste disposal sites
_                         (Wellampitya and approximately 30 other small dump sites) continue to be
used for the next 15 years.
The 'no action' alternative requires sufficient capacity at the existing waste
disposal sites for the next 15 years. However, the Wellampitiya site is
_                         expected to have reached its planned design capacity in 1995 and hence, for
the 'no action' alternative to be a feasible option, the development of
_                         additional disposal capacity is required at either Wellampitiya or one of the
smaller dump sites. However, the potential for the availability of additional
capacity is restricted by:
a
_  the presence of urban development in the immediate vicinity of the
Wellampitiya site: hence, there is no land available for an extension to the
ground area of the site;
* the lack of adequate site preparation works and uncertain operational
_.                          engineering of the existing areas of waste disposal at the Wellampitiya
site: land-raising will be difficult and costly to engineer safely, and
possibly impracticable due to site instability;
|  the 30 (approx.) small dump sites provide only a small proportion of the
waste disposal needs for the Colombo Metropolitan Area: the remaining
capacity of these sites is no: known, due to the uncontrolled nature of the
a                           disposal activities undertaken to date, but they are understood to have
insufficient capacity, or scope for extension/land-raising, to compensate for
i:he completion of the Wellampitiya site for any significant length of time.
Furthermore, all the existing sites used for disposal of MSW, plus waste from
a                        the EPZs and hospital waste, are known to have caused environmental
-    a               pollution. Any extensions to the sites, particularly Wellampitiya, carry the
_   I                    risk of adding to, and exacerbating, the pollution resulting from the waste
cdisposal activities carried out in the past. The engineering of any extensions
to the sites would, hence, require the employment of extensive, and costly,
site remediation measures to address the existing environmental problems.
-                        For all of the above reasons, it would be very difficult to adapt the existing
sites to provide adequate waste disposal facilities for the next 15 years.
Therefore, the 'no action' alternative is not considered to present either a
-                        feasible long term solution, or the best practicable environmental option, for
-   |                    the future solid waste disposal in the Colombo Metropolitan Area, for the
following reasons:

* lack of scope for extension to these sites, particularly Wellampitiya, to
provide adequate capacity for future disposal operations;
* existing environmental pollution and concerns related to the sites, which  C
would require extensive, and, hence, costly remediation for the sites to be

3.4.1        Choice of Options
There are four primary technical options available for the management of
MSW, EPZ and hospital waste. These are as follows:                          4
* Materials recovery and recycling: reusable materials, for example metal and
glass, are retrieved from the waste stream for reuse, hence producing a
corresponding reduction in the volume of waste requiring disposal.
* Composting: the organic fraction of the waste, for example food waste and  C
paper, is biologically decomposed (either aerobically or anaerobically) to
produce a saleable soil conditioning product and, for anaerobic digestion,  4
a biogas fuel. Hence, a reduction is made in the volume of waste
requiring disposal.                                                       4
* Incineration, with or without energy recovery: waste is burned in a dedicated
combustion plant to reduce the volume (by up to 90%) and moisture         4
content (to a virtually dry condition). With the addition of the
appropriate technology, heat can be recovered from the incineration
process to provide a heating and/or electricity supply.
* Landfill: waste is placed in an engineered site and covered, whereupon
internal biochernical processes act to stabilise and break down the waste
over a period of several decades.                                         c
The widely accepted hierarchy of preferred waste management options,
based on the principle of valorising waste and avoiding direct landfllling as  4
far as practicable, is:
* materials recovery and composting;
* incineration with energy recovery;
* incineration without energy recovery;
* landfill.
However, it should be noted that three of the four options, materials
recovery, composting and incineration are only suitable for dealing with
certain components of the overall waste stream. The degree to which they     C
can reduce the total waste stream depends upon the waste composition, and

the high level of organics in the Sri Lankan waste stream makes composting
__I                          an attractive option. Nonetheless, none of these options provides a complete
solutiorL In all cases, their application leaves other fractions of the waste
stream remaining to be disposed by landfill. Incineration also produces an
ash residue, some of which is the result of cleaning the combustion gases (fly
ash) and has high concentrations of heavy metals. This ash requires the
DI                           application of special precautions during disposaL  Table 3.4a summarises the
types of waste materials which typically remain after materials recovery,
composting and incineration have been applied to solid waste.
Modem, integrated MSW  nanar,ement strategies often incorporate several of
the above technical options into an overall scheme. For example, materials
recovery and composting are undertaken where economnic; the reject material
is incinerated to recover energy and reduce its volume/moisture content; and,
_                            finally, the non-incinerable wastes and incinerator ash are landfilled.
In all cases, a universal requirement is the provision of landfill, to provide
final disposal of somc fractions of the waste stream and unavoidable residues
from the materials recovery, composting and/or incineration processes.
_l                         lThe alternatives for solid management in the Colombo Metropolitan Area
over the next 15 years are, hence, the development of any combination of
the above waste management technologies, at one or more sites. Whatever
combination may be chosen, the single common requirement is the provision
of new landfill capacity.

The report on the Metropolitan Colombo Solid Waste Management Study
prepared by the Secretariat for Infrastructure Development and Investment
(SIDI) of the Government of Sri Lanka (February 1993), conduded that
material recycling in the Greater Colombo Municipal Area is currently
responsible for a reduction of 28% in the municipal waste streanL This                  C
recycling rate is a result of the well-established recyclable market in e,dstence
in Sri Lanka, monies gained from which are a major source of supplemental               C
income to the local population. The report stated:

TThe cisting recycling system is rcsponsibLe for a onsiderable reduction in the
Gratetr Colombo Municipal Area's waste stream ...... Only small percentages of
recyclable materials were found to be going to Landfill for disposal. The recyclable
that were in the waste stream consisted primarily of paper that was heavily
soiled and has no recycling value.
Only plastic was identified in the report as outstanding as a potential
fraction of the waste stream for which material recycling opportunities merit
special attention because of its apparently ubiquitous presence at the landfill
and its contribution to unsightly littering. However, plastic comprises only
5-77% of the waste stream (see Section 3.22), the majority of which is plastic
bags and film. The SIDI report indicated that recycling of only 2-3% of this
plastic is commercially viable, which constitutes less than 0.1-02%  of the total
waste stream. This situation is similar throughout the Colombo Metropolitan
Area.
Therefore, materials recovery in Colombo is well-advanced, and there is very
little potential for economically expanding the present system to remove
more materials from the waste stream. The development and extension of
materials recovery is, hence, not a feasible option for meeting the solid waste
disposal needs in the Colombo Metropolitan Area.
3.5.2         Composting
Currently, there is no composting of MSW in the Colombo Metropolitan
Area.
The majority of the waste stream sent for disposal is organic and potentially
suitable for composting - an average of 83% of household waste and 86% of
commercial waste (see Section 3.2.2). This high volume of compostable
material establishes composting as a potential option for MSW  management
The report by SIDI on the Metropolitan Colombo Solid Waste Management Study
(February 1993) recommended that:
A composting facility should be established in or near the Greater Colomb,
Municipal Area.
The report suggested a phased approach, with the ultimate objective of the
development of a full-scale composting plant, as follows:
* development of a pilot-scale composting facility (20-30 tonnes per day of
waste input, which constitutes 2-3% of the total MSW  waste arisings) as
soon as practicable (1);
* concurrent with the development of the pilot facility, the undertaking of
an evaluation of the markets for compost products (2);
K                          nm A pilotale demonstration composting plant (10-15 toniday) at Wellauupitlyu is currently undet consbuction.
At the time of writing this msret study had just been cmpeted.

* on the basis of the technical and econornic results of the above,
preparation of a full economic analysis of the feasibility of composting,
induding consideration of different composting technologies and
approaches;
o assunming that a composting facility is shown to be economically viable, a
site investigation and EIA for a full-scale composting facility (250 tonnes  {
per day of waste input, that is 25% of the total MSW waste arisings),
together with the preparation of a financing proposal.
The Consultant endorses the conclusions and recommendations presented in
the report, and agrees that the apparent suitability and high percentage of
organic materials in the waste stream makes composting a potentially viable
and favourable option for MSW management for the Colombo Metropolitan
Area. However, three comments are relevant:                                   4
* For composting to be commercially viable, stable and long-term markets
for the compost product must be established in conjunction with the
actual composting facilities. The strategy proposed by the Secretariat for
Infrastructure Development and Investment addresses this aspect through
the adoption of a phased approach to the development of a composting
scheme. However, by necessity, the implementation of the strategy is
likelv to cover several years and, if considered economically feasible, full-
scale composting operations are unlikely to start until the medium to long
term, well after the completion of the current landfill site at Wellampitiya.  4
* The current full-scale composting scheme is proposed to handle 2.50
tonnes of waste per day. This constitutes approximatcly 25% of the total4
MSW arising in the Colombo Metropolitan Area. The remaining
proportion of the waste arisings will require an alternative disposal outlet.  4
Furthermore, even if the entire MSW stream was subject to composting,
alternative disposal would still be required for the 14-17% of the waste
which consists of inorganic wastes not suitable for composting, together
with the residues/rejects from the compost process.
Due to the nature and composition of the waste arisings (the low organic
content and potential for hazardous materials to be present), composting
would not be suitable for application to either the wastes from the EPZs    (
or hospital waste.
c
Therefore, although composting is potentially a viable component of the
MSW management system in the medium term, it is not considered a feasible
option either for meeting the major portion of MSW disposal needs of          C
Colombo Metropolitan Area in the shorter term, or, even when fully
developed, on its own without supporting facilities to cater for materials     C
unsuitable for or rejected from the composting process.
3.5.3       Incineration

destructors at Katunayaka EPZ and a small ininerator at the Sri
a                    Jayawardenapura Gcneral Hospital. As a result of their design and mode of
working, the destructors and the incinerator are not operated to acceptable
a                          environmental standards.
The MSW waste stream has a low proportion (14-15%) of readily combustible
material, primarily paper and plastic, and a high percentage (83-86%) of
organic material with a high moisture content, as described in Section 3.22.
Incineration of the bulk of the waste stream will be difficult, if not
impossible, to carry out unless co-burnt wilh support fuels. Overall, the
composition of MSW is not appropriate for the application of incineration
technology.
w
The wastes from the EPZs and hospitaLc are more suitable for incineration,
since they contain a significantly higher percentage of combustible material
(see Section 322). From an initial assessment of the various altematives
within Activity 5 three options are under active consideration:
* The construction and operation of a new landfill at each zone to modem
acceptable standards
* The construction and operation of a number (minimum two) of small
incinerator units at each zone
* The construction and operation of a simple open air, two level
compaction transfer station to transport wastes to the Welisara landfill.
Ideally, the preferred disposal route for hospital waste is incineration.
Activity 6 is currently considering two key issues:
* the siting of one or more modem clinical waste incineration plants with
provision for gas cleaning; and
* the segregation of potentially contaminated clinical wastes from other
wastes at ward level.
However, it is not currently proposed to recommend incineration for
appLication as a cost-effective solution for hospital waste in Sri Lanka.
Incineration is a relatively advanced waste management technique, and the
record of operation in Sri Lanka, albeit on a small scale, is poor. Hence, its
development as a major waste management facility would require the import
of plant, equipment and expertise from overseas. Evidence also suggests that
the maintenance of an incineration plant in reliable, long-term operation
under Sri Lankan conditions is difficult and it would be likely to prove
expensive.
Hence, incineration is not considered a viable option for solid waste
management in the Colombo Metropolitan Area.
3.5.4         Landfill
Landfilling, albeit below modem international standards, is currently
practised at the Wellampitiya site in Colombo. In addition, uncontrolled

dumping occur at a number of smaller sites elsewhere in the area and
within the EPZs.                                                            4
Worldwide, landfill has traditionally provided the final disposal of
components of the waste stream not removed by matcrial recovery,            IL
composting and/or incineration, as well as being used as a direct waste
disposal route where the above technologies are not practicable or applicable. 
The development of landfill capacity requires the engineering of a site to
provide containment for the waste. After placement, the waste is covered     4
with an inert material, for example soil; ultimately the site can be restored to
a natural outlook or some forms of economnic use. In many places, landfills
have historically been sited in abandoned quarries and mineral workings,
where the deposit of waste has been used to infill the void space and, hence,
restore the workings. However, where such void spaces are in limited
supply, landfilling directly onto the ground surface to produce an artificial
hill (land-raising) has becomc an established practice. Whereas landf.ing
results in the infill of an cxisting void in the ground to its original ground  v
level, a land-raising scheme results in the development of a new permanent
topographical feature.                                                       C
The development of a landfill site has only one requirement - the availability
of an appropriate area of land for development of the site. Its technical    c
feasibility is also not restricted by waste composition, and it can be applied to
MSW, solid waste from the EPZs and hospital waste (although the nature of    4
the wastes disposed at any site affect the engineering measures,
environmental protection and operational practices which need to be
employed). In particular, any disposal of hazardous solid waste from the     c
EPZs or hospitals will require special precautions to minirmise the potential
adverse risks associated with contact with these waste materials.            4
Hence, landfilling is a viable option for solid waste management in the
Colombo Metropolitan Area.                                                   c
3.6          THE PROPOSE  OPTION                                                          C
Based on the evaluation described in Section 3.5 above, the only feasible    C
option for solid waste management in the Colombo Metropolitan Area is
new landfill capacity, and the development of a new landfill site is          C
recommended by the Consultant. This EIA considers the proposal for a new
landfill site.
However, it should be noted that composting is identified as a potentially   C
feasible option for longer term development. Composting is higher in the      C
preferred waste management hierarchy than landfill (see Section 3.4) and,
therefore, the strategy of establishing economically viable composting should
continue to be pursued as a complementary form of waste disposal to help     c
reduce the volume going to the landfill site and prolong its life. The
proposed development of new landfill capacity should not adversely affect    4
the future practicability of composting, nor vice versa, ani the removal ofm

organic materials from the waste stream for composting will, in fact, benefit
the landfill operation (by reducing leachate generation and extcnding the life
of the landfill site). Nevertheless, it should be noted that, even with a fully-
developed composting scheme, the need for landfill remains for disposal of
non-compostable materials.

3.7.1        Background
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) was commissioned by
the Urban Programnme Unit (UJPU) to undertake a comprehensive study ("
on solid waste management in the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA), in
1990. The main focus of the study was to identify suitable land for use as
landfill sites for the Colombo Municipal Council and the surrounding local
authorities. After screening several hundred potential sites, the NBRO study
identified 16 sites that were considered suitable for use as landfills. Of the 16
sites selected, the sites at Hanwella and Welisara were considered to be the
sites having the largest void space, thereby placing them high on the list of
sites that had the potential of serving the CMA as long-term landfill sites.
The findings of the NBRO study were presented to the Govemment of Sri
Lanka (GOSL), in 1992 (), at which time the site at Hanwella was selected
to serve as a long term landfill for the. CMA.
However, the site at Hanwella ran into significant public and political
opposition virtually from the time of selection. The main causes for
opposition to the site, in addition to the 'Not in my backyard' (NIMBY)
syndrome, was the fact that this site was a few kilometers upstream of the
potable water intake at Ambatale, which served as a source of water to part
of the City of Colombo. Although a properly engineered sanitary landfill
would take adequate precautions to prevent polluting the water source,
public perception in Sri Lanka of solid waste disposal is an 'open dump'. Sri
Lanka is yet to have an engineered sanitary landfill. The term 'sanitary
Landfill' is commnordy used for any open dump that uses soil cover on a
periodic basis, often once every year. Therefore, when the public of
Hanwella were informed that a long term sanitary landfill will be located in
the area, they perceived an open dump with occasional soil cover.
Significant surface and ground water pollution as well as odour potential are
commonly associated with landfill sites in Sri Lanka leading to public
reluctance to accept such sites in the vicinity of their residences. In addition,
the site at Hanwella serves as a flood retention basin for the Kelani River
during heavy rainfall. The public and political leaders of the area had
visions of an open garbage dump inundated with water during the floods,
upstream of the potable water intake at Ambatale. Thus, significant public
and political opposition was experienced at this site. Although attempts, over

a period of several months, were made to allay the concerns of the public, it
proved futile. The political to the site was such that It was virtually
impossible to continue exploring the feasibility of thls site.
At this stage, the GOSL identified several other sites which were then        4
subjected to an environmental scoping study (conducted by ERM) to assess
thcir potential for use as a long term sanitary landfill site. The six sites that
were scoped were Kerawalapitiya, Hanwella, Pitumpe, Hewagama, MorakeUe
and Wclisara.
3.7.2        Review Criteria                                                                 A
The review of the sites considered the folowing key aspects:
* potential capacity;
* ownership;                                                                   _
* access;
* proximity of habitation and avoidance of involuntary resettlement;
* hydrology;
* geology and hydrogeology;
* biological factors (flora and fauna).                                        a
The criteria based on these aspects were as follows:
* Potential capacity: the required capacity must be sufficient to cater for solid
waste arisings in the Colombo Metropolitan Area from 1995-2010, a fifteen
year period. Based on the NBRO estinmate of waste arisings, the total
capacity of the landfill site is required to be approximately 14 million cubic
metres (14 x 106 M3).
* Owners)7ip: due to the urgent need for the development of a landfill site,
the ownership was considered with respect to the availability of the site
for acquisition. Public ownership was preferred relative to private, and
multiple private ownership was considered least favourable.
* Access: the quality of the access to each site was considered by both road   _
and rail. The preferred attributes were close proximity to the local road    _
and/or rail networks and good condition of the access.
* Proximity of habitation: the potential impact on human habitation was
considered with respect to the number of households within the proposed       _
site boundaries (who would need to be resettled) and the number of            _
households within 200 m (who may suffer adverse impacts, such as
nuisance from traffic, noise, etc). The preference is to minimise the
number of local households affected and, in particular, to avoid
involuntary resettlement.                                                     _
* Hydrology: the presence of surface water courses, both rivers/streams and
marshlands, was considered, together with the potential for seasonal
flooding. Although a landfill can technically be engineered in virtually

any hydrological conditions, the preference is gencrally dry conditions
and the least sensitive hydrological resources, for example with limited
use for potable water supplies.
* Geology and hydrogeology: the geological and hydrogeological conditions of
the site were considered with respect to the presence of natural matcrials
of benefit to the landfill engineering, for cxample natural clay which can
be used for lining the site, and sensitivity of groundwater, for cxample its
depth and use.
* Biologicalfactors: the consideration of biological factors covered the
diversity and importance of the habitats and species of flora and fauna
present on, and in the vicinity of, the sites.
3.7.3         Short-listed Sites
The six short-listed sites considcred by the Consultants in the comparativc
review are as follows:
a) Pitumpe: the Pitumpe site is situated approximately 30 km cast of central
_olombo and is a natural vallcy, which would be landfilled.
b) Kerawalapitiya: this site is situated within the Muthurajawela,
approximately 10 km north of central Colombo. Thc Muthurajawela
marsh is a coastal wetland which opens to the sea at its northern end.
-                             Again, the landfill site engineering would involve a land-raising scheme.
c) Hanwella, near Padukka: the site is an area of flat land, generally
abandoned paddy, located approximately 30 km east of central Colombo.
Due to the absence of an existing excavated void, the landfill at the site
would consist of a land-raising scheme.
d) Hewagama: the site is located approximately 30 km east of central
'p                            Colombo. The site is a natural valley, which would be landfilled.
_                          e) Morakelle: this site is situated approximately 30 km east of central
Colombo. The site is a natural valley, which would be landfilled
I                          I) Welisara: the site is situated within marshland approximately 10 km north-
east of central Colombo. The landfill site would generally be a land-
raising scheme, although indtial waste placement would take place in
excavations made into the marsh as part of the site engineering.

reached by the review exercise are sumnmarised in tabular form in Table 3.7a.  C

assigned to each site against each criterion.
3,75        GOSL Review of Scoping Report and Final Site Selection
Due to the political and socially sensitive nature of siting a landfill, a
Committee was appointed by the Hon Minister for Public Administration,
Home Affairs and Provincial Councils to select an acceptable site which could  U
be developed as a long-term sanitary landfill based on the environmental
scoping report of the sites The Committee forwarded the environmental       C
scoping report on the six potential landfill sites to the Secretary of the
Ministry of Home Affairs and Provincial Councils (MHA&PC) and the Chief
Secretary of the Westein Provincial Coundl (WPC).
The Hon Minister for Home Affairs and Provincial Councils requested the    C
findings of the environmental scoping study to be presented to the Cabinet
Sub-Committee on Investment chaired by thc Hon Prime Minister. The
environmental scoping report revealed that none of the sites could be
considered ideal for development as a sanitary landfill. Each site had its
advantaLes and disadvantages. In sunmmary, only threc of the sites had
sufficient capacity to serve as a long-term sanitary landfill for the CMA. The
sites being Hanwella, Welisara and Kerawalapitiya. Welisara and
Kerawalapitiya were mainly under public ownership, therefore, subject to    C
satisfactory public consultations, could be used for development without
undue delay. Hanwella and Welisara were the sites with the best access.
None of the sites appeared to require more than approximately 30
households needing resettlement. When considering tht effects of floocling
and associated polluting potential, the sites at Hewagama and Morakelle     C
appear capable of development at a reasonable cost. The sites at
Kerawalapitiya, Welisara and Hanwella appear capable of being developed at
higher cost. Consideration of impacts to local ecology revealed that the sites
at Welisara, Hewagama, Morakelle and Hanwella could be developed with
little detrimental effect on local ecology.                                 c
Deliberations at the Cabinet Sub-Committee focused on scientific criteria as
well as political and social acceptability, which resulted in the site at Welisara  C
being perceived as probably the most acceptable site. However, the Hon
Prime M4inister appointed a Committee chaired by the Secretary, MHA&PC
to consult the local community in the Welisara areas and obtain their views
on the proposed siting . a sanitary landfill. Two meetings were held with
the local comrmunity and the findings reported to the Cabinet Sub-
Committee. A synopsis of the two meetings are contained in Annex D.
Although, the local community objected to the siting of the landfill, their  e
main concerns were mote of a technical nature than of social nature.
Finally, the Cabinet Sub commnittee reached an agreement to approve the
Welisara site for use as a long-term sanitary landfill, after guarantees were  C
provided that the desigi. and operation of the landfill site would conform to
standards commonly acceptable for sanitary landfills. A decision was also   C
made to hold a public awareness campaign on the difference between open

_w     esanitary landfill whose surface would be progressively restored for limited
community use. In addition, a guarantee was given that a community

_W                         be in the vicinity of the landfill. The provision of the commuunity
ANIL                       development package would enhance public acceptability of thf' landfill site

_mb~                       Subsequent to these guarantees, the Cabinet Sub-Committee approved the
selection of the site at Galudupita Road, Welisara as a long-term sanitary
_                          landfilU site, at a meeting on January 11, i994. A meeting held on April 9,
1994 with the households to be resettled a large degree of local acceptability
was observed after the possible benefits of the project such as the
community development program were described to the community. This
level of acceptability would never be possible at the site at Hanwella, since
_                         the issue is not localized, but would involve larger public involvement due to
the site being upstream of the potable water intake point at Ambatale.
Additionally, during the period the site scoping study was in progress, the
GOSL has passed a Cabinet decision designating the Kelani River basin an
environmentally sensitive area, prohibiting the location of any industry that
could c -se pollution to the Kelani River upstream of the potable water
intake point. The site at Hanwella is designated as a most sensitive area
under this scheme, eliminating the possibility of using this site as a sanitary
landfill regardless to public or political acceptability.

4           DESCRIPTION OF LANDFILL DESIGN AND OPERA 770N
IN7RODUCT70N
This section describes the concept for the design of the landfill site. The
following aspects are discussed:
* the overall design philosophy;
* the key constraints affecting the development of the landfill due to the
characteristics of the site;
* the concept for the site engineering, taking account of the existing site
conditions ..  e environmental requirements;
* the operational issues related to the landfilling of waste, including the
method of waste placement, special procedures for the disposal of waste
from the EPZs and hospitals, control of scavenging, environmental
controls and progressive development of the site;
* phasing of the development of the site infilling and progressive
restoration of completed areas.
The design concept described in this section provides the basis for the EIA.
The assessment of the environmental impacts resulting from the
F                        development of the landfill is described in Section 6.
a-        4.2          OVERALL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
The propdsed site at Welisara occupies an area of permanently inundatedf
low-lying marshland that is characterised by low topographic relief, a bigl
-                        groundwater table and periodic flooding in the rainy season5 Hence, the
development of the site, although technically feasible, is likely to be difficult
The nature and location of the site will necessitate the provision of a suite of
-                        engineering measures in order to:
* operate the laitiuill facility continuously and successfuly;
* incorporate the necessary environmental protection measures to inikmlw
the risk of pollution and flooding during site engineering, operation and-,
upon completion.
w
As a sanitary landfill, a philosophy of 'attenuate and disperse', whereby
contaminated liquid generated within the landfill (leachate) is allowed to
escape from the site to be diluted and reduced in strength during percolation
through the surrounding geology, is not considered appropriate in this
location because of the significant risk of pollution of water resources
adjacent to, and downstream of, the site. Accordingly, the landfill design
39



makes proviion for secmue containment and effectkve segregation of the 4    £
waste and auodated lcachate from the surrounding environment, in the
light of local geological, hydrological and hydrogeological conditions.
In order to generate sufficient capacity, the developmcnt of the site will  £
involve the excvation of the supefical deposit preent on the ulW (mainly
peat). The resulting void space will be infilled with waste, which will be
supplemcnted by additional waste placement to develop an artificial hill    £
(land-raising).
In total, it is estimated that the site will be engneered to provide        £
approximately 11.6 x 0I m3 if void space for waste disposal, sufficient to
cater for the MSW disposa needs of Colonibo MetropolitanAreaafor 1 
years, and a total capacity of approdimately 14.0 x 10D nm, to allow fo4
assodated on-site engineering works.1 Any restrictions on the available land
area will have the effect of reducing the available capacity for waste disposal.
The design and capacity calculations are based on the full 124 ha being
available for tipping and leachate treatment lagoons. If this is not the case,  4
at the detailed design stage, amendments would be required in the briefing
for site development provided to the landfill contractor.                   4
Any inputs of industrial wastes from the EPZs and hospital-waste will be in
addition to those of the MSW: if these inputs are significant, either additional  4
void space elsewhere will need to be developed or the operating life of the
landfill site will be reduced. However, they are currently estimated to
represent less than 2% of the MSW quantity.
4.3          KEY CONSTrRAWrrs
4.3.1       Introduction                                                                 6
The physical setting of the site imposes a number of key technical constraints  4
that have a fundamental influence on the overall design and development of
the landfill site. These are considered to be:
the apparent paucity of materials available on-site for landfill engineering
works, for example there are limited supplies of clay available for      4
engineering site containment (lining of the bottom and sides of the void
'space);                                                                    I
* the presence of soft, highly compressible soil (peat) at the existing ground
surface level, which needs to be removed prior to constructing the landfill  4
site or pre-compressed in situ;
,! high groundwater levels throughout the site area, typically at the ground  6
: surface or within 0.3m of the ground surface even during the dry season,
. necessitating extensive drainage works; and                              4

periodic flooding of the site and the presence of a tributary of the Kalu
Oya river traversing the sitc, such that flood protcction is required and
the Kalu Oya tributary will need to be diverted.
Each of these key constraints are considered in further detail below, with
_                          respect to the critical aspects of site engineering associated with development
of the sitc.
4.32         Site Containment
In order to provide a high degree of protection to the surrounding
_                          environment it is necessary to segregate and isolate potentially polluting
_                          waste from the surrounding strata, surface water,and groundwaterf The
_                          principal means of achieving this are by the provision of low permeabilivy
sealing layers (base, sidewalls and top of the landfill); and appropriate
_                          operational management of the site in order to minimise:
w
_                          * the ingress of water into the landfill;
w
* the production of landfill leachate and its subsequent dispersion into the
as.                          aquatic enviromnent surrounding the site.
lw
~                          TIdeally, Jon ,,m ability strata, for example clays, %yould be used to inhibit
the inflow of water into the landfill and the outflow of leachate. The results
of the geotechnical survey undertaken at the site (see Section 5.4.1) indicate
aw~                       that no suitable low permeability strata occur in situ that naturally could
form adequate levels of containment for the landfill. The apparent deficiency
of natural low permeability soils in situ dictate that one of the following will
be required:
* the importation of low permeability natural clay to line the site to
supplement available resources, primarily those found on Mllukgoda Island;
RI the use of an engineered artificial lining system, for example a synthetic
flexible membrane; or
the improvement of in situ materials to achieve the required permeability
characteristics, for example by bentonite enrichment (where the existing
materials are treated with bentonite - a type of clay - to reduce the
2 percolation of water through it).
4.3.3        Landfill foundations
The presence of a relatively thick layer of peat across the majority of the site
poses significant problems in the construction and engineering of the base of
the landfill. The peat is very soft and highly compressible and essentially has
no significant bearing capacity - in its current state, it cannot support the
weight of loads placed upon it, for example deposited waste, landfill
machinery and traffic. This dictates that site engineering must either:

* remove the compressible peat; or
-  adopt specialised methods of construction, for example progressivc,           £
j phased overtipping of peat with bulk fill.
Even if such specialised methods of consctruction are adopted the following
problem's may still exist:
I.4
*y load bearirn capacity failure of the foundation soils, hence any sealing
layer placed above the peat to provide site containment could be disrupted  C
by failure and dislocation of the foundation soils;
M * large vertical and lateral settlements (up to 80% of the in situ thickness of  C
A the peat) of the basc of the landfill, due to compression of the peat upon
placement of the waste - hence any basal sealing layer and internal         C
landfill engineering works could be disrupted.
4.3.4        tchate and Landfill Gas Control                                                  C
The development of a sanitary landfill places considerable emphasis upon the
control of the potentially poUluting products released throughout the life of
the landfill by the decomposition of biodegradable/putrescible organic wastes
(leachate and landfill gas). Control measures routinely adopted make
provision for the minimisation, collection, abstraction and, where
appropriate, treatment of both these products.                                  (
The installation and construction of landfill leachate and landfill gas control
measures requires large quantities of natural materials with specific
engineering properties, such as free-draining granular material to promote
drainage. The available geological and geotechnical results indicate a          C
shortage of such materials on-site.
4.3.5        Site Drainage and Flood Protection                                               (
Site Drainage                                                                   C
The northern tributary of the Kalu Oya flows south-west across the eastern-
central part of the site area. This watercourse cannot be retained within the
landfill footprint and will need to be re-routed prior to undertaking initial
preparatory works for the landfill.
The high levels of incident rainfall are likely to generate large volumes of q
surface water run-off within and adjacent to the site, particularly during the1 
monsoon periods. Operational difficulties may ensue from surface water
run-off, particularly with respect to:
* the segregation of leachate-contaminated waters from clean surface
waters;
* the maintenance of the landfilling area dry during the wet season; and

the maintenance of haul road quality within the site.
,              lhEc site, therefore, will rcquirc a network of surface water control measures,
igned to accomunodate thc anticipated volumes of run-off generated
uring the hcavicst rairtfalls of the monsoon periods.
O?n-site Flood Protection
The marshland is prone 'o flooding periodically during the wet season. The
J                          degree, frequency and depth of flooding will present severe operational
difficulties unless adequate measures are taken to deal with the flood risk.
The measures required to overcome the on-site flood risk comprise either:
construction of flood protection barriers/bunds around the limits of the
|landfill; or
&  construction of the base of the landfill and the landfill foundations at an
elevation above the maxinum flood level.
Off-site Flood Protection
-  The development of the site will result in the removaVcover of peat
7 marshland which currently absorbs rainwater falling on the site and run-off
from adjacent areas. Instead, thi rainwater will be shed from the site into a
local drainage system which wil' link to local watercourses. The loss of the
-  capacity of the site to absorb raiLwater will lead to slightly increased flows in
the watercourses downstream cf the site, but as described in section 6.3, the
loss of this land is not expected to significantly alter the upstream or
downstream flooding pattern.

urn)                      To accommodate the key technical constraints to landfill development
_                         present at the site, the conceptual design for the proposed landfill addresses
the following principal design elenments, within an overall concept of phased
development:
a the provision of a stable foundation upon which to form the base of the
a                       landfill;
* the sourcing of supplies of natural materials for site engineering works, as
far as practicable to be met from on-site resources;
* the 'total' containrient of the landfill site, including the provision of
groundwater control measures, a basal lining system and a surface
-   fi                 .    capping layer;

* the provision of flood protection bunds around the perimeter of the
landfill site, to isolate the site from periodic flooding; and
* thc re-routing of surface watercourses and the provision of surface water
control measures to accommodate surface run-off.                             4
The measures proposed as part of the initial conceptual design of the landfill
are described below, with particular emphasis on the measures required to
achieve appropriate levels of environmental protection. The measures will be
developed in more detail in the conceptual design of the site.                  4
4.4.2        Phasing of Site Engineering
At the outset of the site development, it is envisaged that the uite WM be
divided into a n' -uber of areas (perhaps three or four) for phased             4
development. The aiea designated for the fist phase of development will be
prepared with the basic site engineering; that is groundwater control           _
measures, flood protection bunds and environmental sreening measures.
The intemal development oi the areas would then be conducted by a
progressive cellular approach, which would include the in-situ site             4
engineering, for example cell engineering, leachate collection, etc (see Section
4.5.2).
At the outset of the development of the site, a waste reception area,
incorporating the provision of a weighbridge, site offices, a compound and a    4
workshop will need to be constructed. These facilities will serve the landfill
site throughout its lifespan.
4.4.3        Landfill Foundation Levcl
The base of the landfill will be developed on stable foundation strata in order  4
to eliminate the risk of disruption to site containment. Accordingly it is
proposed that the highly compressible peat will be removed from the site        4
area and the base of the landfill founded on lateritic sands and clays. This
will involve the excavation of an estimated 2.6 x 106 m3 of peat. The           4
excavated peat will be naturally air-dried on-site, through stock-piling into a
series of simall heaps. When dried, the peat will be used as cover material
sand for site restoration. It is known that peat may impart acidic conditions    4
to water percolating through it thereby resulting in increased potential for
leaching of metals present in the waste mass. However, due to the extensive
scavenging and informal recycling currently practised in the CMA, the
quantity of metals in the waste is extremely low. Indirect sources of metal
addition such as leaching from printing inks in paper and packaging should      4
not be significant as there is less than 7% paper and packaging in the waste
stream. Therefore, although the potential for metal leaching exists, under
actual landfill conditions it is expected that the amount of metals will be
minimal. Nevertheless, if this were to be considered of serious concern, trace
metal analysis could be included in regular water quality monitoring.            4
Although alternative methods of site development (other than peat
excavation) are feasible, all of these are considered to be too expensive and/or

technologically too demanding. For example, building a platform on the in
sith peat would require the importation to the site of very large quantities of
a suitable bulk fill to raise the base of the landfill above flood leveLs, since no
material are available on-site.
Extraction of the peat has the benefit of exposing laterite on the floor of the
excavation. Further excavation of the lateritic material will:
release lateritic sands and days on-site for subsequent use in other landfill
carthworks, thereby minimising the requirement to import bulk fill;
* facilitate grading of the base of the landfill to accommodate leachate
drainage and collection measures; and
* release further void space, thereby reducing the ovcrall height of the final
restored landfill surface.
Excavation of in situ laterite, to a depth of approximately 2 m ovcr the floor
of the landfill (approximately 63 ha), is anticipated to be sufficient to supply
most site needs. The proposed floor level of the landfill, therefore, will be,
on average, approximately 5.0 m below existing ground surface level. All
areas of higher ground within the landfilling area will be excavated
progressively to form a continuous floor at this level.
4.4.4        Sitc Containmcnt
Basal Lining System
There is no low permeability layer present continuously across the site that
could be used to provide containment for the base and the sidewalls of the
landfill.
To import sufficient quantities of natural clay to the site to provide all site
containment needs (base, sidewalls and capping layer) is currently considered
infeasible because:
* the volumes of clay required are very large;
* no suitable source of clay has been identificd; and
* importation of clay to the site would be expensive.
The use of artificial lining systems, for example flexible synthetic membranes,
is not considered appropriate for Sri Lanka for the following reasons:
* the installation of artificial lining systems requires specalist expertise and
specialist contractors which are not available in Sri Lanka; and
* the systems are very expensive.
In the light of these considerations and the need to remove the peat (see
above), it is proposed that containment for the base of the landfill could be
provided by lateritic sands and days in situ appropriately improved by the
introduction and application of an appropriate grade of bentonite in order to

reduce the permeability to a maximwn acceptable level. The prime source of
suitable material available withln the site Ls found on the island of Illukgoda.
The proposed minimum containment standard to be adopted is a maximum
X  permepblity of I lr 1O4 m sec'I tor an situ thickness of Im.                  4
CFounduater Control Measures
~~~~~~~~~C
It will be necessary to install groundwater control measures to:
miniimise groundwater inflow into the site;
permit landfilling into a dry void to minimise leachatc production;
* isolate deposited waste within the site from groundwater; and
to permit excavation of peat and laterite.
It is proposed that groundwater control is provided by a barrier of lateritic  C
clays and sands constructed around the site. If necessary, a core of
bentonite-enriched laterite or low permeability clay may be constructed
within the central part of the barrier to provide the degree of groundwater
control required. This core would key into the underlying foundation strata.
The groundwater barrier will be formed progressively either from excavation
and backfilling of a wide trench in the peat or from overtipping and            (
displacement of the peat with laterite. It is envisaged that the platform
would be approximately 20-25 m wide at the existing ground surface in order
to permit subsequent construction of flood protection measures (see below)     C
on the groundwater barrier.
Dewatering would be undertaken progressively in all areas of the site
isolated by the ground-water control measures. A practical dewatering
scheme might, for example comprise a system of well points to reduce
groundwater levels within the site areas. This system could be combined
with sumps in the floor of the areas actively being worked to maintain C
groundwater levels temporarily below floor level.
Surface Capping
To mininmise the ingress of water into the site when the site is completed and C
restored, it is proposed to form a low permeability capping layer from
reworked lateritic sands and clays released by the overdigging of the base of
the landfill, treated as necessary with bentonite to reduce its permeability.  C
The final surface profile adopted upon restoration of the site will be designed
to shed incident rainfall quickly to minimise the penetration of water
through the capping layer.
4.4.5        Surface Water Control Measures
OGnsite Flood Protection Measures
Flood protection bunds will be constructed to protect the working areas of
the landfill from ingress of flood waters during periods of high rainfall. In
c'addition, these bunds will permit screening, including by planting, of site
_   _    _     _    _     _ _     _    _     _    _  _    _     _    _          C

activities during the initial stages of filling within each phase of site
1 development. The bunds will bc constructed on the groundwater control
Sibarrier constructed around the margins of the site. It is anticipated that
Mflood protecfion bunds will be formed from compacted reworked lateritic
asands and clays keyed into the basc platform constructed for groundwater
_I control.
Off-site Flood Alkrlation Measures
The northern tributary of the Kalu Oya is proposed to be re-routed to flow
to the east of the landfill. Two options are then feasible:
* To minimise the potential build-up of flood waters upstream of the landfill
when the flood protection bunds are constructed, it is proposed that the
strcam is culverted beneath the railway and channelled, as necessary, to
flow on the eastern sidc of the railway embanknent. Tlis will involve
significant engineering measures.
_          g               * Alternatively, the stream could be channelled between the eastem edge of
low,                          the landfill and the railway embankment. In this latter case, the potential
exists for the build-up of flood water and the possible overtopping of the
Awk:               railway trackus during high flood flows. Hrnce, additional flood alleviation
I  W                          measures may be required, such as a sluicc and/or overflow relief system.
_.4      |In either case, channel modification will need to be carried out with great
care to avoid undesirable impacts on the hydrological regime upstream or
..AML                      downstream. Acceptable methods are available from other countries and Sri

A|t~                      the country, the Mahaweli river. Local expertise is therefore readily available
to deal wifth possible problems. Regular stream maintenance could overcome
potential sediment deposition problems.
-q w                       The first approach, diverting the stream under the railway to the east, has

Alongside the engineering requirements oi the site to provide an effective,
long-term landfill with appropriate levels of environmental protection, there
area number of operational issues which will be specifically addressed in the
landfill design, namely:                                                      6
* cellular mode of operation;
* disposal of industrial and hospital waste;
* scavenging and material recovery;
* leachate control;                                                           5
* landfill gas control; and
* progressive restoration of the site and rethrn to economic use.             5
These issues are discussed below, and will be developed further in the
conceptual design.                                                            5
4.5.2        Cellular Mode of Operation
The landfill site will be operated on a cellular approach, with the site divided
into a series of large operatonal cells developed within the engineered
area(s) described in Section 4.4.2; for example, one cell may be developed
corresponding to the void space reaiuirements for disposal of one year's
MSW arisings. Each cell will then be sub-divided into a series of smaller     0
working cells, sized to optimise the operational working methods and
environmental protection measures, such as leachate and landfill gas control.
At any one time, three large cells will be under development: one being
excavated, one under floor preparation and containment engineering amd
one being infilled with waste. A fourth cell would be under restoration.
This philosophy is described further in Section 4.6, and would be refined
during the detailed design of the landfill site.

project (Activities 5 and 6 - see Section 1.1). The options under consideration
(see ERM Inception Report, August 1993 (') are:
For industrial waste:
landfill site(s) within the Biy,mgama and Katunaya.;ke EPZs;
* small incineration plant(s) within the Biyagama and Katunayake EPZs;
_                              * transter station(s) and disposal of waste at the Welisara landfill site.
For hospital waste:
* a central incineration plant (see Section 3);
* several small incineration plants.
* disposal of waste at the WelLcara landfill site.
Hence, one of the options for industrial waste under consideration is the use
of Lhc proposed landfil site for disposal of the waste with MSW. The
-                          majority of the industrial waste is garment and cloth off-cuts (554i0%) and
rubber (1415%), as discussed in Section 5.22. Within a properly managed
disposal system, these materials are not normally a major environmental
hazard, and they are recognised as having a high value to scavengers.
Therefore, if not salvaged, these types of industrial waste could be co-
disposed with MSW at the landfill site, with no special precautions.
Other types of induscrial wastes, such as chemical wastes, inks, etc, some of
which are generated, albeit in small quantities at Biyagama EPZ, are of
higher concern to the environment and pose risks to scavengers, and these
types of waste, together with hospital wastes, will require special
management practices if disposed of at the landfill.
_                     It should be noted that, although incineration is the focus of the disposal of
hospital waste, provisions for hospital waste disposal should also be made
within the Welisara site, as cover in the event of failure or impracticality of
the options for incineration plants.
A preliminary concept to allow for the disposal of these categories of
industrial and/or hospital wastes at the landfill site is as follows:
w
* Waste deliveries would be arranged and notified in advance, and
scheduled for a set time.
AN,                        a* A trench would be dug within the municipal solid waste deposited at the
landfill site in advance, to accommodate the inconiing waste.
* Upon arrival, the waste would be placed immediately into the prepared
trenches and covered.

Scavengers would be excluded from access to the prepared trench at all
times, especsilly during and after placement of the waste,
It is recognised that this approach will require close supervision. The      C
disposal of industrial and hospital waste in the conceptual design for the
landfill site will be consideret' in co-ordination with the other strategies for  C
the management of these wastes currently being developed within Activities
5 and 6.
4,5.4        Scavenging and Materials Recovey
The site will be operated to allow controtled scavenging to take place. The
preliminary concept for this is the operation of two working faces within the
landfill at any one time, based on the following principics:
A working face would be operated as follows:
- reccive incoming waste;
- aftcr waste placement, allow a set period for picking by scavengers,    C
during which time incoming waste would be deposited at the second
working face;
- after the allocated scavenging period, comnpact and cover of the waste.
* The operation of the two working faces would be synchronised so that       C
one facc is always open to picking by scavengers.
* During waste placement and compaction/covcr, scavengers would be
excluded from the working face, to minimise the risk ut contact with
heavy machinery.
* During any deposit of special or hazardous wastes (which pose a high
health risk to scavengers), for example hospital waste, scavengers would
be excluded from the working area and the deposited wastc will be
covered immediately.
This method of operation will require high leveLs of supervision of sitA
operations, but will enable scavengers to maintain a living from the landfill
site, whilst minimising the higher risks associated with accidents involving
heavy machinery and/or contact with hazardous wastes. Scavengers will be
educated in the operational practices and support facilities such as First Aid
will be available.
Within the operation of the landfill site, and the overall waste collection and
transfer system, there is also the potential for organised separation of specific
waste streams for materials recycling, for example plastic bags, as part of the
waste management plan. This separation may be carried out at the landfill
site, or more efficiently/cost-effectively during collection and/or at the   C
transfer station(s). The conceptual design proposed by the Consultants for
Baseline Road Transfer Station can accommodate manual sorting at that
location if preferred by GOSL.

U
The scope for sucrh activities and an investigation of the available options
will be provided as part of Activities I and 3 of the ovcrall study, and
_Incorporated illto thi. conccptual design of the landfil, as appropriate.
Lcactat Control
The site will be operatcd on the water balance principle in order to minimise
the production of leachate during site operation. Temporary daily and
intermediate cover, making use as far as possible of air-dried peat and inert
construction waste, will be placed over all parts of the landfilling area not
activcly receiving wastc.
4!t7 Leachate collection will be achieved through gravity drainage by grading the
_                       *. ^f1floor of the landfill. Leachate drains will be laid over the floor of the landfill
_1  and will connect with leachate sumps and leachate collection chambers.
'  Leachate abstracted from the landfill will be treated on-site in a series of
leachate treatment lagoons and/or reed beds comprising local vegetation
prior to disposal off-site.
5 6         Landfill Ga. Control
A nctwork of vertical gas chimneys and horizontal gas drains will be formed
_ W                        within each working cell. The gas chimneys will most lIkely be drilled from
the surface after completioni of the surface capping layer. Gas vents will pass
\ through the capping layer and permit passive venting to the atmosphere. A
'permeable gas drain formed of granular material will be laid on the inside of
_ftI                       the groundwater control barrier and will inhibit lateral migration of landfill
-w          !gas.
4.6          PHASED AND PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND RESTORATION
As discussed earlier, the landfill will be developed on a progressive basis,
with the site subdivided into a series of areas for site engineering works,
_~        B(annual) phases for waste deposit and individual, smaller, landfilling cells
within each phase.
It is anticipated that no more than 15-20 ha of the landfilling area will be
under development at any one time (out of an overall site area of up to 124
_        u               ; ha and a waste placement area of 9095 ha); the whole of the site, therefore,
_       [                  will not be subject to continuous operations throughout the 15-year life of
the landfilling operafion. This applies to both the site engineering,
I development of environmental protection measures and waste placement It
also has operational benefits, spreads the site development costs over the
Am-                       lifetime of the site and allows ongoing environmental monitoring of the
_      j                   impacts of the operations (with the scope to amend/change operations in
response to the results of the monitoring). Site restoration will also follow
on a progressive basis, allowing the first phases of the landfill completed to
be restored and made available for useful purposes whilst the landfill
_    0                     operations continue elsewhere on the site.

5,          DESCRIPTONV OF THE WELSARA STIE
D            5.1          INTRODUCT7ON
J                         The location of the Welisara sitc is shown on Figure 5.1a in the context of the
Colombo Metropolitan Area. The Welisara site was officialy designated by
the GOSL as a development area by the serving of a Section 2 Notice under
the Land Acquisitions Act in July 1993.
__                        This section describes the results of the surveys and research on the Welisara
sitc. The description cover. the key environmcntal conditions prevailing at
the sitc, namely:
* climate;
a topography and landscape;
* geology;
* hydrology;
* hydrogeology;
* socio-cultural factors and land use;
a biological factors (flora and fauna);
* air quality;
* traffic; and
* noise.
This description illustrates the baseline conditions prevailing at the site, and
permits the identification of key characteristics which affect the potential for
positive and negative environmental mpacts to occur due to the
development of the landfilU site.
5.2          CLIMATE
The meteorological conditions at the proposed site are generally typical of
those encountered in Colombo, although local variations are expected due to
its marginally inland and sheltered location. The weather conditions in
-                        Colombo are:
* Rainfall: 2,000-2,500 mnm per year, with a recent annual mean rainfall of
2,400 mrn. Heavy monsoon rainfalls occur twice yearly - in April/May and
-                           October/November, during which time approximately 65% of the annual
incident precipitation falls. Maximum daily rainfall is up to 340 mm, and
znaximum four-day rainfall is up to 590 mm (estimated 200 year return
period). Rainfall during the dry season Canuary to March) averages
approximately 100 mm per month.
a
* Humidity and Evaporation: relative humidity of 80-85%, with monthly
average evaporation rates of approximately 110 nun (ranging from 90 mm
to 125 mm). Rainfall exceeds evaporation throughout the year, except in

5.3         TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDSCE
The proposed site for the landill covers 1Z4 hectares at Weilsara, the
majority of which comprises essentially flat, marshy land approximately at
mean sea leveL Topographic variations are slight with ground surface
elevations over most of the site within 0.5 mW') of mean sea level.
The surface of the marsh is punctured by three small islands of slghtly
elevated ground rising approximately 2-4 m above the level of the
marshlands. These latter areas host shrub and tree vegetation in contrast to
the semi-aquatic vegetation, for example reed and sedge, of the low-lying
narsh area. Photographs of the site showing these features are presented as
Figures 5.3a and 5.3b.
T'he site is delineated to the east and south-east by the railway line linldng
Colombo to Kandy to the north-east The railway is constructed on an
embankcment of laterite, approxinately 2 m above the level of the
mnarshlandb. Similar marshlands to those within the site extend to the east of
the railway.
T'he northern, western and southern boundaries of the site are marked by
drier, higher ground which rises up to approximately 15 m to 20 m above the
level of the marshland. Maximum gradients rising out of the marshland are
approximately 1 (vertical) in 7 (horizontal).
The marshland has previously been used for paddy, and currently undergoes
attempts at cultivation on about 10% of the land area although we
understand that these attempts are largely unsuccessfuL An electricity
transmission line runs approximately north-south across the site.
The higher ground around the site is generally moderately settled in a semi-
rurl context with mature and semi-mature trees scening much of the
housing from the site. However, the edges of the settlement are visible on
the margins of the marshland and intermittently on the higher ground
Some large industrial premises are present to the north of the site, including:
* a Milk Powder Factory, consisting of a large building with a highly visile
yellow roof;
* Aztec pipe manufacturers;

type buildi;
a Mlitay Barrack, consisting of a variety of buldin  and security
measures. the perimeter wall and fencdng are particularly visible from the
dite.   .
The general chracter of the site and surrounding area is a rural-suburban
enclave, on the margins of major urban development with several large
industrial enterpries in the proximity. There are no major landscape
features, such as industral stacks or high-rise buildings in the vicinity.
5,4          GEOLOGY
5.41_
A preliminary geotechnical survey of the site comprising the following
principal elements has been undertaken:
* drilling of 20 No. Auger holes and 19 No. Shell and Auger boreholes;
* installation of groundwater monitoring pipes (piezometers);
* in situ testing of soil and rock materials; and
* sampling and subsequent laboratory testing of soil and rock materials.
e field investigations, which are now complete, have permitted the nature,
distribution, thickness and continuity of geological materials present beneath
the site to be established. The groundwater flow pattern has also been
determined and field tests have provided information on the in situ density
and permeability of matenal considered likely to form the foundation of the
landfill and to be used in site engineering works.
Laboratory testing, which will provide additional information on the
engineering characteristics of site materials, is still in progress. The following
range of laboratory tests has been scheduled:                   v
* plasticity tests;
* particle size distribution tests;
* permeability tests (undisturbed and remoulded samples);
* shear strength (undisturbed and remoulded samples); and
* compaction tests;
* California Bearing Ratio tests
The laboratory testing programme is expected to be substantially complete by
the end of April 1994.
Data from the geotechnical survey contributes to the definition of the
principal technical constraints to site development and permits the
assessment and identification of the most appropriate engineering solutions
for the proposed landfill at Welisara.

.4.2         Geological Setting
The site geology comprmes a variable sequence of superfidl deposits
overlying bedroc at depth. Bedrock is inferred to comprise bbiotte and
homblende grnite and granite-gnriss of the VlIayan Series, a low grade
metamorphic zone of Pre-Cambrian age. This formation subcrops beneath
superficial materials to the north, south and east of the site; bedrock is not
exposed within the si                                                       C
5U43         Supecl Deposits
On the basis of the information currently available from the geotechnical
survey, the superficial deposits comprise the following sequence:           C
*peat, 
clayey sands and sandy clays; and                                          C
lateritic gravelly sands and lenses of lateritic clay passing down
conformably into highly weathered, decomposed roc                        C
Peat appears to be present across the whole of the site area, with the
exception of:                                                              C
the elevated margins of the site; and                                    C
* the higher ground of the islands within the site.
In these latter locations lateritic sands and clays outcrop at the surface. All U
of the higher ground surrounding the site is believed to be underlain by
laterite.                                                                  (
The peat is extremely soft to stiff, blackish grey to black, highly organic and
variably fibrous, occasionally sandy and ic saturated throughout The peat is  C
generally immature and comprises a mrixtre of debris of reed, sedge and
marsh vegetation, with zones of more compact and stiffer tree and shrub
peat and highly decomposed, humified peat. In situ moisture contents are
high, and likely to range between 300% and 1,000% in the extreme.
Alluvial deposits beneath the peat comprise grey to dark grey, loose to very
loose, slightly clayey to clayey, fine to coarse sands and soft, occasionally
stiff, grey, slightly sandy to sandy days of low to intermediate plasticity.
Locally there is a transitional sequence (transitional deposits) between the
alluvial deposits and the overlying peat, represented by                    (
interbedded/imtermixed peat and sand/clay.
Lateritic materials recorded to date principally comprise loose becoming    (
dense, yellowish brown to grey brown, fine to coarse, sub-angular to sub-
rounded sands, with between 20% to 50% moderately plastic fines and a       (
variable gravel content The lateritic days are subordinate in occurrence to
the sands and appear to be discontinuous.
The peat ranges in tl-ickness from 0.0 m to a maximum proven thickness of
7.0 m, with an average thickness of approximately 3.0 in The peat is        (

gencrally thickest in the south-eastern and southern parts of the site,
between the railway line and the Kalu Oya, where it appears to Infill a slight
topographic hollow in the underlying laterite. Over the majority of the site
area the peat is underlain by alluvial deposits and/or transitional deposits,
which are up to 9.0 m thick, although typically less than 2.0 m thick Pcat
directly overlies lateritc only very locally across the site.
e base of the lateritic materials has not been proven in all boreholes.
Where proven, the laterite is typically 6.0 m to 10.0 m thick and passes into
completely weathered bedrock
A comparable sequence and range of sediments has been recorded in the
Muthurajawela to the west of the site, across the A3 Colombo-Negombo
road.
5.5          SOCIO-CUL7URAL ENVIRONMENT AND LAND USE
5.5.1        Population and Habitation
The site is located to the north-east of central Colombo. The settlements of
Enderamulla, Mabole, Galudupita, Elapitiwela, Halanduruwa and Horape are
located on the higher ground surrounding the proposed site (see Figure 5.5a).
The fringes of these settlements extend down to the edge of the marshland,
and are immediately adjacent to the site. The settlements to the north of the
site are moderately populated with approximately 80 houses. To the west
the population density is greater. A socioeconomic survey was planned,
which would have provided data on the number of houses immediately
adjacent to the western border of the site. However, due to strong local
feelings against the project it proved impossible to carry oult the survey. In
addition, there are three small islands (Navamahara; Mlukgoda; Duva) of
marginally higher ground within the site area. These islands contain
settlements, with a total of 25 houses. The site was officially designated as a
development area in July 1993 by the serving of a Section 2 Notice under the
Land Acquisition Act.
5.5.2        Socio-economics and Culture
Welisara is situated in one of the most densely populated parts of Sri Lanka.
Population density in Gampaha District as a whole averages 1,000 persons
per square km, whilst in the immediate vicinity the density is reportedly over
5,000 persons per square km. The population of this area is growing rapidly
and is expected to double in the decade 1991-2001. Much of this population
growth is the result of the rapid rise in land prices in metropolitan Colombo
over the last fifteen years. This has led to the development of both
residential and industrial areas along the main road linking Colombo with
the airport and Free Trade Zone at Katunayake. It appears that the majority
of the population in Welisara are relatively recent imnmigrants from other
areas of Sri Lanka. Whereas 20 to 25 years ago there was still major

agricultural sector in Welisara, today agriculture is of minor importance.
Land previously under coconut palms is today the site of housing
developments, factories and container yards.
The area affected by the project forms a microcosm of the area as a whole.
What was two or three decades ago an area of long-established small
communities engaged in agriculture has now become an area of dense
population in which most people are dependent on wages and salaries for
their income. Whilst therc are some local industries, for instance the milk
factory and the plastic factory, the majority of the working population
commute to jobs in Colombo, Katunayake and other centres of employment
in the vicinity. Although the Galudupita marsh was used for paddy in the
past, problems with drainagc have led to paddy cultivation being abandoned.
However, there is evidence that interniittent attempts to cultivate paddy are
still made on about 10% of the total land area, although these attempts are
largely unsuccessful. On drier areas around the islands or at the edges of
the site some garden crops currently occur and the marshland is used by
some of the local population for water buffalo and cattle grazing, fishing and
the harvesting of the wild vegetable kankun and reeds/grasses for basket
making. On the higher land coconut palms and tree crops such as mangos
are still grown, but these are generally margmal to household incomes. It is
believed that none of the families living on or around the site are dependent
on marsh resources for their livelihood.
A number of residential zones can be identified in the inunediate vicinity of
the site.
Zone 1: To the west of the marsh and running as far as the main Colornbo-
Negombo road is a dense area of mainly rniddle class housing. Here
what were once coconut estates have been sold and split into smal
blocs for residential use. The majority of the population in this area
are relative newcomers to the district. It is difficult to estimate
population figures but there are probably over 1,000 households in
this area.
Zone 2. To the north of the marsh occupying a narrow strip of land
between the marsh and the naval base is a row of around 80
houses. These are generally of lower quality than those in zone 1
and most appear to have been constructed over the last ten years.
Most of the occupants are inunigrants from outside the inunediate
vicinity of the site. This area includes an island known as Duva
which is occupied by one household.
Zone 3: Immediately to the west of the marsh and occupying one of the
islands in the marsh (Mlukgoda) is one of the older communities in
the area. Once dependent on paddy cultivation, most people now
depend on wages and salaries.
Zone 4: By the railway line which fonns the eastem boundary of the site are
recent inniigrants to the area occupying an island known as
Navamahara. This is the poorest residential zone. Houses are built

of timber and cadjan anid thcir occupants depend in the main on
casual labour supplemented by fishing and other minor activities in
the marsh.                                                          w
Zone 5: To the south of the site is a miixed residential area, mainly consisting  (
of middle and lower-middle dass housing.
Except for zones 2 and 4, electricity is widely available, the local authority  I
having installed it over the last few years. Throughout the area households
presently depend on well water and most houses have their own wells.        (
Although important as a source of income in the past, the marsh is now
economically relatively unimportant There is some small-scale fishing.      {
mainly for domestic consumption. Some vegetables are collected, particularly
kankun. Cattle and buffalo are grazed within the marsh. For most            (
households these activities are marginal sources of incomc, but for the
poorest, particularly those in zone 4, such sources of food are important
during periods of unemployment.                                             {
One of the results of the changing demographic structure of the area around  (
the marsh has been a shift in its religious composition. Traditionally, this
has been a predominantly Catholic area. However, many of the recent
immigrants are Buddhist. Zone 2 is predominantly Buddhist, whilst in zones  I
1 and 5 Buddhists probably outnumber Catholics. There arc at least three
small Buddhist temples in the vicinity of the marsh.                         I
As stated in Section 5.5.1 it has proved impossible to carry out a demographic
and socioeconomnic survey of the area. Preliminary investigations did show   (
the demographic profile of the settlements in the area and can be
summnarised as follows:                                                      £
I Income level:   moderate;
Q Quality of life:  moderate;                                               I
* Tenure:        mixed: private ownership and illegal encroachment;
* Infrastructure and
services:      moderate on hillsides, low on marsh islands;               t
Labour profile:  generalUy manual, some sldled manual and higher.
Overall, the settlements support a mixed standard of living and population:
the quality of housing ranges from moderate, middle-class, block-built houses
to squatter-type shacks. Often, the different levels of housing are inter-  I
mixed and there is evidence of ongoing construction of houses in the area
(legal and illegal), indicating that the settlements are continuing to develop  (
and grow. Electricity is available to most of the houses on the hillsides.
In July 1993 the marsh was issued a Section 2 Notice under the Land          I
Acquisition Act which earmnarks the site for development by the Sri Lankan
Land Reclamation and Development Corporation. The site was therefore         (
scheduled for inSlling and the loss of wedand. The development of the site
as a landfill may necessitate invocation of a Section 38a proviso order of the
Land Acquisition Act to acquire and take over the site.

5.5*3        Public Health
Water and Sanitation
The settlemcnts nearest the site, and on the islands within the site, utilise
dug wells 3-4 m deep as a source of potable water; sanitation is generally
provided by pit-latrines. Commonly, there is one well and pit-latrine per
house. It is understood that a mains water supply is available approximately
500 m to the north of the site, laid next to the A3 Colombo-Negombo-Chilaw
highway. Due to the liinted amount of sociological data it was possible to
collect, the extent of the connection of the settlements to this mains supply
and the number of houscholds with septic tanks is not known.
Vector Borne Diswxse
The biological survey at the site has found no mosquito larvae (which could
carry malaria, filariasis, or dengue fever) in the marsh plankton samples that
have been colected and analysed to date. There is also no evidence that the
local population experience a problem with mosquitos. The most likely
explanation for this is that although the water appears to be still, it is in fact
moving sufficiently to prevent the breeding of mosquito.
Other vectors such as rats, ferral cats and dogs are not currently thought to
pose a threat to public health in excess of that typically found in other semi-
rural areas of Sri Lanka.
5.6          H)YROLoGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
5.6.1        Hydrology
The site area lies wholly within the valley and catchment of the Kalu Oya,
which joins the Kelani Ganga approximately 5 km south-west of the site, via
the Old Negombo Canal. The Kalu Oya runs approximately north-east to
south-west along the southern and south-western boundaries of the site,
with feeder strearns running through tlie site from the north and east. The
overall catchment of the Kalu Oya extends to approximately 61 km2, of
which approximately 50 km2 (80%) lies upstream of the site (see Figure 5.6a).
The entire site is permanently inundated, with the exception of the three
small islands and some small areas around the site periphery. The feeder
stream of the Kalu Oya entering the northern part of the site would appear
to have substantial seasonal variations in its flow regime. In the dry season,
the stream is characterised by an indistinct channel, low flows and is subject
to choking with aquatic growth: water from this watercourse appears to
disperse into the main body of the marsh. Photographs of the major surface
water features of the site are presented as Figures 5.6b and 5.6c.

The main channel of the Kalu Oya, which borders the southern margins of
the site, is more substantial and is approximately 6 m wide where It flows
bencath the railway and approximately 8 m wide at the cxtreme southem
limit of the site. Flow rates are generally low, due to the low clevadon of
the site area. Water levels in the streams are at approximately 0.3 to 0.4m
above sca level.
Much of the marshland is abandoned paddy. The marsh area is known to
flood on a regular basis during the wet season, typically during periods of
continuous rainfall. Flood levels are understood generally to be 1 m above
the existing (dry season) ground surface level, but also rise occasionally to
2 m above the existing ground level.
Downstream of the Welisara site the Kalk Oya maintains a width of
approximately 10m, until widening to 12ns -14m just before the confluence
with the Old Negombo Canal. Along its length the Kalu Oya is normally
characterised by slow flows and very flat land on both sides of the river.
The floodplain either side of the river varies from 10m to 500m in width
before the land rises. Some of this area is marshland, although to the south
it is increasingly being cultivated for a varicty of different crops such as: rice,
herbs and spices and vegetables. These areas are flooded periodically
throughout the rainy seasons to a depth of approximately 0.5m.
The farmers appear to welcome these floods as they provide wa:er for the
paddy and the deposited silt is rich in nutrients. The normal level of
flooding does not affect the houses on the margins of the flood plain.
Although a detailed hydrological survey of the area has not been
undertaken, the marshland is believed to influence the hydrological regime
of the Kalu Oya by:
reguating the water flow of the catchment upstream of the site; Z
* providing flood storage capacity during pe;iods of high rainfalL 1
The drainage system of the area north of the Kelani Ganga (river), broadly
south of the site area mainly consists of rivers, low lying lands and swamps.
Two canals drain from the Muthurajawela swamp into the Kelani Ganga, the
Hamilton canal and the old Negombo canal (now partially blocked with
vegetation and silt) (t). The Kalu Oya (river) drains into the old Negombo
canal, downstream from the blockages. During the rainy season flooding
occurs quite frequently in the Local Authorities north of the Kelani Ganga,
since most of the area is low-lying.
The flow regime of the Kalu Oya appears to have been influenced
downstream of the site by a variety of engineering works which have been
gradually introduced since 1956, at its junction with the Old (Dutch)
Negombo Canal and the Kelani Ganga. These works comprise a series of
flood alleviation measures including:

* widening of the southernl part of the Old Negombo Canal and the
construction of marginal bunds.                                      C
These cngineering works, many of which are now in a state of disrepair, aim
to control flows independently in the Old Negombo Canal and prevent the  c
flooding of the Kelani Ganga.

Groundwater flows from the west and north-west of the site towards the
Ki;.alu Oya. Within the marshland the groundwater surface is essentialy
horizontal and as a consequence, the movement of groundwater in the area
of the site is likely to be very slow. It is likely that the movement of  C
groundwater within the site is to the south west consistent with the flow
direction of the surface water course.                                  C
The fact that residents are using groundwater wells as a source of potable
water indicates that salt water intrusion is not generally a widespread
problem, only occurring penodically during the dry season when the water
table is very low.                                                      (

Several strearns flow through the site area, draining into a tributary of the  _
Kelani Ganga, the Kalu Oya, adjacent to the site. The main streams are the
Ja-Oya and the Heen-Oya, and due to partial stagnaion of the water in the  C
Ja-Oya certain floral species have flourished there which are of ecological
interest as they play an important role in water purification.

The natural aspect of the land ii disrupted by the residual evidence of paddy
and garden crop cultivation, water buffalo and cattle grazing, fishing and the
collection of reed./grasses and some naturally growing fruit, for example
kankun, by the local population. According to the local people the paddy
ficlds were very fertile lands yielding a substantial harvest. However, as the
channels lecamc dogged with aquatic vegetation, the paddy cultivation
could no longer be maintained. The paddy lands have bcen taken over by
various plant species which arc better suited to prevailing conditions.
The
commonly found species of the marsh arc listed in Table 5,7a.
The plant specics growing in the marsh arc of value to the local community.
Pan is used for mat weaving. The young leaves of Wel Gowa, as well as
Mukunuwanne and Kankun are cdible crops which are harvested daily by
the locals for selling. The marsh is also used for grazing of cattle belonging
to the local community. The marsh plants are not only of service to the
humans but thesc plants provide food and sheltcr for many animals
especially the herbivorous birds, as well as the fish.
S.                        There are patches of various Pan typcs scattered throughout the area. In
some places these are singlc plant* of Con Kaduru, or in other places patches
Ash,                      of Wetakeiya, Ludwigia, We-wal, and Meemana can be seen dispersed
among the Pan types. Wel Cowa, Japan Jabara and Lewwa are found
scattcred among the grasses, the Diya Thana Kola (Brachiaria mutica),
Batadelta (Isac/ne globosa), and Uru-Wee (Oryza sativa). At the margin of the
streams are Wel-bata, Wel-Atta, Thunhiriya Pan and Wetakeiya.
Interspersed among the vegetative cover of the marsh are pools of water and
these are inhabited by Nelum (Nclubiuwn speciosum), Olu
(Nymphaea lotus), Manel (Nymplhaca stellata) (Figure 5.7a and 5.7b). The stream
which transverses the site area, is very slow flowing due to an abundance of
vegetation (see Figure 5.7c). Predominant amongst this vegetation are the
Water Hyacinth (Eicdhlornia crassipes), Wel Gowa, Kankun (Ipomoca aquatica),
Mukunuwanne (Altrnatithera sessilis) and certain grasses such as the Diya
thana kola. The point at which this stream joins the Kalu Oya at the
southern boundary of the site is shown in Figure 5.7d.
The waters are rich in phytoplanktons. They are the basic link in the food
webs of higher organisms. The dominant phytoplanktons of the study area
are Spirogyra, Closterium, Pandoria, Cosnarium, Chroccocus turgidus, Anabaena,
OscilLatoria, Nostoc, Chlamydomonas, Phacus, Euglena, Skeletcnevma costtum,
Spirulina major.

The home gardens around the northern boundary of the site as far as
Sherman's factory, and including the smzaU island within the site, support a
large number of edible crops and plants of medicinal valuc, as well as those
grown for scenic value. These are listed in Table 5.7a.                                C
The higher, and drier, ground surrounding the marshland, or on the islands
within the marshland, is under settlement, interspersed with trees and
shrubs, for example coconut palm. The trees are largely mature or semi-
mature, and exceed the height of the houses to provide a low canopy. The                c
trees aLco provide visual screening of the marshland from the bulk of the
settlement (other than those houses on the marshland margins).

5.7.2          Fauna
The marshland provides a habitat which supports a variety of marsh fauna,
particularly water birds and waders. The principal species of fauna that
occur at the site are shown in Table 5.7b. The disturbance caused by the               C
relatively close proximity of the local population has restricted or prevented
the presence of rarer and/or larger aniimals and birds, particularly those of
high sensitivity or vulnerability, for example estuarne crocodile. Although
local people claim to have seen crocodiles in the Kalu Oya.

where the two streams join, at the southem boundary of the site as well as
further downrstream beyond this area.
Amphibians
This area is well occupied by Rana (frog) species, since it provides water
related microhabitats preferred by these animals. Some species prefer open
waters, some occupy heavily vegetated pools and others are found among
the reeds of thc marsh. These wetlands also host a number of tree frop
(Radcophoridae) as well as toads (Bufonidace).
Fish
There is a variety of fish species inhabiting the streams flowing through the
marsh. The fish species found in the stream which traverses the site and the
I                      main river flowing south of the site are found in Table 5.7b. The local
community catch fish from these water bodies for their consumption.
Insects
Among the insects found within the area are the dragon flies, may flies,
water beetles, mosquitoes and butterflies.
ZoopLanktons
Copepods, cladocerans, juvenile fish and larval prawns were the major
zooplanktons found in ponds and streams within the project site. Among
them the cycloid copepods were the most common and abundant. The
zooplanktons are a source of food for fish, crustaceans and birds.

The site is located off the A3 Colombo-Negombo-Chilaw highway, and is
accessed via Galudupita Road. A new road will be constructed off
Galudupita Road to provide access to the site.
The A3 Colombo-Negombo-Chilaw highway is a heavily-trafficked major
road, which provides a radial route from central Colombo northwards to
Negombo, Katunayake International Airport and Chilaw. The road is lined
with a variety of small to medium-sized JLdustry, shops and general
settlement. Lorry traffic is high, and pedestrians, cyclists and similar traffic
are common. Traffic data for the A3 highway are available for a section of
ANIL                     the road approximately 4 km south of the Welisara site. The data are
1 f                    recorded for the two-way, two-hour midday peak in 1991, and are presented
in Table 5.8a.
On the basis of the data given in Table 5.8a, during peak hours the traffic
flow capacitv of the A3 highway near central Colombo has been reached.
The traffic flows on the A3 highway tend to decrease away from central
Colombo, as traffic disperses onto the local road network The traffic flows

Colombo, as traffic disperses onto the local road network The traffic flows
near to the Welisara site will therefore be somewhat lower than those shown
on Table 5,8a, al.hough still heavy. However, the World Bank Colombo Urban
Transport Projcct, Sri Lanka - Staff Appraisal Report (April 1993) reported that
average traffic growth on radial routes from Colombo, such as the A3
highway, varied betwecn 6-9% per year betwecn 1985-1991, with the growth
in the vehicle fleet averaging nearly 14% between 1981-91. Continuation of       £
this growth in traffic in the future will increase overall traffic flows on the
A3 highway, potentially causing congestion on this important route. ,
Galudupita Road meets the A3 highway at a T-junction; there are no traffic
controls or signals at the junction. Galudupita Road is initially straight and
on a shallow gradient, which runs down from the junction with the A3
highway towards the site. The upper part of the road (nearest the A3
highway) is macadamised, but further down the road deteriorates in quality,      £
becomes unsurfaced, develops potholes, narrows and ultimately becomes a
track. A number of large industrial premises are located on Galudupita
Road, including a Milk Powder Factory and Aztec pipe manufacturers near
the junction with the A3 highway and, further down, Shermans Welisara
Complex and the Government Food Depot. Settlements and shops are also            £
present adjacent to the road on its lower parts.

After Shermans Welisara Complex, the road makes a sharp 90° turn towards
the Government Food Depot. Beyond the Depot, the road becomes a                   a
narrow track servicing approximately 80 houses on the margins between
Halanduruwa and the site. Galudupita Road also serves as an access road to
the settlement of Galudupita.
The results of daytime traffic counts on Galudupita Road, carried out on
Tuesday I and Monday 7 March 1994 near to the junction with the A3
highway, are summarised in Table 5.8b and 5.8c respectively. The night-time
traffic movements on Galudupita Road on the night of Tuesday 8 March are (

summarised in Table 5.8d. More detailed breakdowns of the traffic flows are
provided in Annex H.
Overall, the traffic counts show that Galudupita Road experiences moderate
daytime traffic flows, with a regular flow of trucks (servicing the industrial
premises) and high numbers of motorcycles/trishaws, pedestrians and cyclists
(associated with the settlements in the area), At the bottom of the road, after
Shermans Welisara Complex, all types of traffic reduce significantly and
trucks are restricted to those related to the Government Food Depot
During ev,ening and night-time, the traffic numbers on Galudupita Road
decrease significantly. However, trucks are currently present on the road up
to after midnight, with motorcycles/trishaws, pedestrians and cyclists
common up to 23:00 hours. The night-time traffic count also indicates that
06:00 hours is the beginning ol notable traffic movements on Caludupita
Road.
Although the samc depth of data is not available for the A3 highway as for
Galudupita Road, it Ls anticipated that a similar trend in traffic flows is
experienced.
In summary, the data available for traffic movements on the A3 highway and
Galudupita Road indicate that the traffic conditions arc typically as follows:
* Week-days (Monday-Friday) have similar traffic flows.
* The peak periods on the road for non-commercial traffic
(motorcycles/trishaws, pedestrians and cyclists) are 07:00-09:00, 13:00-14:00
and 17:0019:00.
Comrnmercial traffic (trucks) use Galudupita Road on a regular basis
throughout the hours of 10:00-17:00. Trucks are evident on Galudupita
Road between 05:00 and 01:00.
In addition, it is understood that Saturday, Sundays and official holidays
(Poya, etc) have lower traffic than other days.
5.9          AIR QuALrrY
There are no data available cn. the existing air quality in the area. Although
some data are understood to be available for central Colombo, it is unlikely
to be representative of the site, which is more characteristic of a rural-
suburban area than a dense urban area: the site is expected to have bette
air quality than a city centre location due to lesser impacts of vehiclde 
emissions. However, indoor air quality may be poor as a result of buring
of- wood fuel and kerosene for cooldng and lightrig. a
There are no significant sources of industrial emnissions to air visible in the
vicinity of the site, although small-scale ermissions are expected to regularly
occur at a low level, and the overall background air quality is good. The

5.10         NOISE
A series of sample noise measurements made on the boundarics of the
proposed site have been used to determine the typical background noise
climate of the arca. The results of the monitoring are given in Table 5.1Oa,
and are considered represcntative of the existing situation.
The measurements of LA^ and LA,0 are generally used to indicate the
background noise leveLs at a location. The measurements at locations 1-6
around the site indicate that the existing daytime noise climate is typical of a
rural or suburban area. The main sources of noise arc natural (birds, insects,
etc), noise related to the settlements (voices, dogs, etc) and noise fronm L'affic
and transport operations (road traffic, trains, etc).
Sudden, relatively loud, noises occasionally occur from trains, sirens and
hooters, all of which are associated with the railway line and stations in the
-                       vicinity of the site. Night-time noise levels are expected to be approximately
10 dB(A) lower than the daytime measurements, when many of the traffic
and industrial sources of noise wlll have not be present or in operation.
The noise levels experienced at locations 7-8, both located on Galudupita
Road, are dominated by traffic noise. The peak noise levels are at location 8,
adjacent to the Milk Powder Factory, due to the higher flows of traffic on
this stretch of road.

Scction 5, and the design concept discussed in Section 4, thc EIA focusBs upon  c
the following:
* the identification of the characteristics of the site with respect to the key
environmental issues, namely:
- socio-cultural factors and land use;
- hydrogeology and hydrology;                                               {

and, hence, the scope for environmental impacts;                            t
* an assessment of the magnitude of potential environii.ental impacts which    (
may occur due to the development of the landfill site;
* the features and nitigation measures which will be incorporated into the     (
t                          site design to minirmise potential environmental impacts and ensure that
the overall impact of the landfill is not significant.                      (
* the provision of adequate occupational health and safety measuires within
the context of mitigation of the above categories of environmental l;npact.
Hence, the EIA provides an appraisal of the environmental acceptability of
the Welisara site for the development of the landfill.

Chonges to the xiom*noic status Qf the are, due to the positive effect of
potential employment for local people generated by the development of
the landfill site and following Its restoration, and the impact of negative
perceptions of the landfill site in the area. Solid waste disposal in Sri
Lanka has a poor reputation, due to the pollution caused by the existing
landfill site in Colombo. It is also perceived by some as associated with
the influx of scavengers and low income populations, who derive income
from sorting through the waste for recyclables or hope for resettlement
opportunities as the site develops.
* Alterations in the public health status of the arm as a result of the elimination
of water-borne vectorM in the marshland area vcrsus the potential increase
in other vectors (such as rats, flies, scavenging birds, wild dogs and cats)
that may be attracted by the landfill if not properly managed.
6.2.2        Assessment of Impacts
The development of the landfill will have both positive and negative impacts
on the socio-economic conditions of the local community. These impacts are
summarised in Tablc 6.2a with respect to the key issues highlighted above,
and discussed in greatcr detail below.
L.andtake ard Resettilemenit
The Welisara site had already been officially designated as a development
area, long before the site was proposed for the sanitary landfill. Landtake
requirements of the landfill site will include three populated islands within
the marshland (Navamahara, fllukgoda and Duva) and will necessitate the
phased resettlement of 25 households, most of whom own the land that they
occupy. Although altemative relocation sites have not yet been identified by
the Government, it is intended that the 25 families to be resettled will be
provided with upgraded housing on the hillside surrounding the marsh, as
close as possible to their existing residences. The Section 2 Notice, served
under the Land Acquisition Act in July 1993, has been served on much more
land area than required for the site. Therefore, there is land in the
Immediate area that will be available for resettlement.
Of the 25 families that will need to be resettled, most are engaged in
employment activities 'off-site' although some rely on marsh resources to
provide part of their income. For example, some families keep water buffalo
and graze cattle along the edges of the marsh and are also involved in
fishing and the harvesting of the wild vegetable kankun as well as reeds and
grasses for basket making. In order to ensure that these fanilies are able to
retain their source of income (should they wish to), special consideration will
be given to identifying sites on neighbouring marshland where they can
continue these activities.
Within the funds available for the development of the landfill site, a
significant allocation (US$1 million) has been set aside for the
implementation of a community development plan. This fund is in addition

the landfill site as it develops, and to provide a physical barrier to prevent
children playing on the site;                                                           4

* training and awareness campaigns in public health and safety;
* support for income generating or other activities on the restored landfill
site.
This fund will be administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs & Provincial                4
Councils (MHLA&PC). The MHA&PC intend to employ consultants to assist
them in the development of an appropriate communrity development
programme.

D                        Formal Emrloyment Oportunities
The landfill operation will require drainage, site preparation, construction, fill
and restoration activities as well as related services over the lifetime of the
site. Thc labour requirements of the landfill development programme closely
match the employment profile of the area, in that manual and skilled manual
7                         labourers will be in most demand. This will provide significant employment
opportunities to local people, but may also attract new immigrants to the
area in search of employmcnt. The possibility (and desirability) of providing
suitablc housing for these immigranos will need to be carefully considered
wa'hin the context of thc community development plan.
Opportunities for Scavengers
It is the policy of the GOSL to allow scavenging for reusable and recyclable
_materials on landfill sites. This provides a source of earnings to low income
families and maximises rucycling aictivities. Howevcr, it is unlikely that local
low-income families will benefit from scavenging opportunities, as
scavenging is an organised, professional activity in Sri Lanka and it is
understood that scavengers must be registered. It is therefore likely that the
majority of scavengers will migrate towards the new site from further afield,
mainly from areas where existing landfill or dump sites have recently closed,
III                     primarily Wellampitiya.
Poorly managed scavenging activities could give rise to two main categories
it                       of impact:
1* cn-site impacts in the fcrin of occupational health and safety risks to the
scavenger population; and
31                       * off-site impacts resulting from the growth of squatter communities around
the peripheries of the landfill site would degrade the socio-economic
status of the area and could pose a public health risk to both existLig and
squatter communities, due to the lack of water and sanitation facilities
typical of informal squatter communities.
Scavenging activities during daylight hours will be carefully controlled.
Scavengers will be registered at the gate, and allowed to work whichever of
e                        the two active tip faces is not in use by vehicles delivering waste to the site
that day. At dusk all scavengers will be required to leave the site, and their
i_                       exit registered. Screening at the point of exit to ensure that no on-site
injuries have occurred could be carried out as an occupational health and
safety check Scavenged material would be removed from the site in
acceptable containers, usually 'gunny (jute) bags', and transport to and from
the main A3 Colombo - Negombo road could be provided as a means of
mirihnising disruption and pedestrian traffic along the access road.
It will be the policy of the GOSL (Ministry of Housing, Construction and
Urban Development) to ensure that illegal squatter settlements do not occur.
This will be achieved by making regular patrols of the site peripheries. Local
residents will be encouraged to report illegal squatters to designated

Community Based Organisations (CBOs) who will take the matter up with
the site management. It is possible that an area of land will bc identified
upon which a squatter community would be perrnltted. However, thLs will         C
require careful consideration by the GOSL as the potential negative impacts
of this policy are significant. The provision of formal housing and
infrastructure to an immigrant scavenger community could have the
disbenefit to the local population of creating a 'magnet' for low-income
families.                                                                       C
Restoration and Income Gencration                                               (
Once restored, the site will be available for certain types of economic
development, which has the potential to generate employment, income and         (
improved facilities for the local population. These opportunities will arise
progressively as the site is filled, completed and restored, and can be directed
through consultation with the local inhabitants and administered through
the proposed Community Development Programme (to be prepared by
GOSL consultants during April 1994) (see also Sectiotn 7 and Annex C            (
resettlement plan).
Acceptable uses for the restored site will be agricultural, iorticultural,      I
amenity and certain types of commercial and industrial enterprise, although
it should be noted that there will be restrictions on the development of        (
buildings and major structures to prevent subsidence, damage to the landfill
cap or risks from the accumulation of methane gas in confined spaces.
The integrity of the cap must be monitored in order to restrict percolation of  (
rainfall through the cap and into the waste mass to generate leachate. This
means that only shallow rooting plants, for example grasses, will be            (
acceptable. Larger trees and shrubs have the potential for root systems
perforating the cap as well as causing local drying out of the capping soils
and inhibiting surface water run-off. Planting anything which requires          C
worldng the surface soils (e.g. root vegetables) must also be avoided.
Prevalence of Pests and Disease Vectors
The biological survey has investigated samples of the marsh plankton from        C
around the site and has found no evidence of mosquito larvae. However, it
appears that aquatic disease vectors are not prevalent at the site and,         (
therefore, no significant benefit wi;' be derived from draining the marsh
land.
Conversely, the potential exists for an increase in pests and other disease
vectors (such as rodents, insects, birds, wild dogs and cats) as a result of     (
poor management of the landfill development. To ensure that this negative
impact is prevented, care will be taken to minimise the area of active tipping
at any one time and ensuring that all newly-tipped waste has temporary           {
cover applied at the end of the working day. The waste will also be
compacted to reduce voids in the waste mass. Further measures, for example
the use of insecticides, may be necessary on an ad hoc basis in some seasons.

6,3           IYDROGEOLOCY AND HYDROLOGY
6.3.1         Key Issues
The key hydrogeological and hydrological issues rclated to the proposed
landfill site are:
-  |                       * the potential for contamination of xater resour=cs (surface water and
_                             g 5rogundwater), by dischargcs, for example fuel spillages and waste
_  g                          construction materials, during construction of the landfill site or escape of
Icachate during operation;
-                             c|w ctanges to the flood storage capacity of thc catchment of the Kalu Oya (rivcr) and
its tributaries, which may Icad to increased flooding either upstrcam or
downstrcam of the site;
a changes to the drainagc characteristics of thtc arca, and hence the availability
of groundwater for extraction from wells by the local population and
industry.
The important aspects of the site with respect to these issues are as follows:
* The local population make use of near-surface groundwater through
I                            shallow wells, as well as abstracting water and fishing in the Kalu Oya
and its tributaries. It is understood that industrial enterprises in the area
may also abstract water via wells for industrial purposcs.
* The marsh land present on the site acts, as does most of the land adjacent
to the rivers in this particular catchment, as a flow regulating mechanism,
bv providing flood storage capacity and a buffer during periods of high
rainfall. However, the total site area is 124 hectares, which represents only
2% of the total catchment area.
6.3.2         Assessment of Potential Impacts
The protection of groundwater resources in this low lying area, and/or the
provision of alternative piped water supplies suitable for potable and
industrial uses, is essential. The design of the landfill will incorporate a range
of enviromnental protection measures which will address these issues and
mininmLise the potential impacts.
Potential for Contamination of Water Resources
The engineering design of the landfill site contains a number of measures to
minimise rainfall infiltration into the site, to prevent underground seepage of
leachates and to contain the lateral movement of leachates into the marsh.
These measures are described in detail in Section 4.4.3. A system has also
been designed to coUect, control and treat the construction and operational
effluent and leachate prior to discharge into the Kalu Oya. The system is
currently planned to utilise natural biological treatment using local semi-
aquatic vegetation (see Section 6.4).

C
Geotechnical investigations carried out show that any underground seepage
of contaminants are also likely to be contained in the immediate area as a D
result of thc extremcly low hydraulic gradient of the Aite area (land drops
approxdinately 0.4 m over the 2 km length of the total marsh arca). Scepage
of leachate into surrounding shallow wells would be very unlikely not only      c
for thc reason given above but also because the local shallow wells arc only
on areas of higher land where the watcr table is at a higher level than in the  C
sitc area. It Ls improbable that leachate would tnigrate against the prevailing
hydrauLic gradient into these watcr sources, unless abstractions were
sufficiently large to reverse the groundwater flow regime . 
Flood Storage Capacity                                                          C
The hydrological setting is shown in Figure 6.3a. The potential changes to
the flooding regime of the Kalu Oya catchment downstream of the site is an      4
important aspect, especially due to the high density of population in these
areas. The result of the bund engineering and redirection of the tributary of   C
the Kalu Oya on the site, together with the loss of the site area which was
previously available for flooding, will very slightly increase (3-5%o) the flows
of water passing downstream after heavy rainfall events. This has the           C
potential to cause higher flood levels downstream, including at the Kclani
Ganga, the Old Negombo Canal and also, by back-up of water, upstTeam of         (
the site itself.
Preliminary studies show that due to the low gradient of the entire             (
catchment area, the areas upstream of the Welisara site provide a substantial
amount of flood water storage capacity. The Welisara site itself represents
only 2% (130 ha) of the total catchment area (of around 50 sq.kn.). During a
peak rainfall event, the majority of the flood water will be retained in areas
of low lying land and marshes before it reaches the site area. Due to the       (
low gradient of the entire catchment area the total upstream area capable of
acting as flood water retention has been calculated from topographical maps.
A flood water level has been assumed for each area, becoming progressively      C
higher towards the site where it is taken as 2 m above normal water level.
(based on field observations and discussions with long-term residents af the
area and comparable monitoring data available from the nearby
Muthurajawela wetland area across the A3 highway). From these figures
the site was found to represent only 8% of the total upstream flood capacity.
This fact considerablv lessens the impact of removing this area of flood water
storage.                                                                        (
Given the existing channel dimensions of the Kalu Oya and its tributaries,
removal of the storage capacity of the Welisara site would only result in a
rise in water levels during periods of peak flow. Even at these times, the
water level would be expected to rise by a maximum of only 10cm above           £
normal flood levels in the Welisara site area, and progressively less

dowrutrvam, becoming (relatively) zero at thc junction with the Kelani
Ganga. This conrervative estimate of 10cm was derived from
calculations based on the slightly increased flow levels due to the loss of
flood storage backing up from the Old Negombo canal in the existing
channel dimensions. It is estimated that the maximum flood increase
downstream where thc Kalu Oya meets the Old Negombo Canal would be
approximately 1 - 2cm.
The figures stated above take into account the loss of the entire site as flood
storage space. However, it is planned to develop the site in phases, over a 15
year period, starting in the north (see section 4.6). The site will still be acting
as flood water storagc for 1-15 years and it will take that long for the
estimated total 10cm increase in flood water level to be realised. During this
time period monitoring of the actual increase in flood water level should take
place. Given that there are densely populated areas downstream of the site,
and flooding is a very sensitive issue in the north Colombo area, it is
recornmended that a full hydrological survey is carried out at the detailed
design stage, to confirm these prcliminary estimates.
A preliminary study of the river Kalu downstream of the site area shows that
there are no specific points where the channel is constricted; where there is
insufficient clearance under bridges or where a rise in water level of a few
centimetres will cause any significant changes to the existing flooding
patterns. The development of the Welisara site, due to the existence of a
flood plain and cultivation which is largely dependent upon flooding will
have minimal impact in the Kalu Oya south of the site. As the loss of the
site flood plain is estimated to lead to a maximum increase of only lcm-2crm
water level where the Kalu Oya meets the Old Negombo Canal, the effect on
the existing flooding patterns will also be minimal. The upstream flood plain
characteristics are sinilar to downstream. A rise in flood level water, due to
backing up of water of approximately 10 cm will not cause any significant
changes to the existing flood patterns. Based on the above evaluation no
specific offsite flood protection measures are considered to be required as a
result of the landfill development. Further details on the calculations
undertaken are given in Annex 1.
Any rehabilitation and enhancement of the flood protection measures
already installed throughout the area in the Old Negombo Canal and the
Kelani Ganga would be a valuable contribution to the residents of areas
north of Colombo city, who do suffer flood damage to their properties.
However, the measures that need to be taken cannot be related solely to the
development of the Welisara site.
Drainage Characteristics
The stream which traverses the site will need to be redirected. The most
appropriate route for the new channel is under the railway (in a new
culvert) to the North East of the site and then discharging into the marsh
beyond the railway. This route will allow the marsh to the east and south of
the railway to provide flood water retention during times of peak flows.
This wiL help to alleviate flooding downstream and will reduce the risk of

TRAVERSING LANDFILL SITE



groundwater seepage into the site. Providing additional flood protection to
the railway embankment could, potentially, be required by the S.L. Railways,
in the form of an abutting bund. However, this is not anticipated to be
necessary at this stage. The option of redirecting the stream down the West
side of the railway incurs the risk of an extreme flood overtopping and
possibly damaging the railway and or the embankment. The land
requirement in this option would also reduce the available capacity of the
landfill site.
Due to the high watcr table (typically at the ground surface or within 0.3m
of the ground surface even during tlhe dry season) and very low gradient of
the site area the movement of both groundwater and surface watcr across
the site will be very slow (with the exception of rnonsoon periods). The flow
path follows the natural slopc in a southerly direction, and water flows in
other directions will be mninimal. The water in local wells is therefore drawn
from their immediate vicinity and is not percolating water from the wider
marsh area. The abstraction rates from local inhabitants or from local
industrics are not expected to cause any significant movement of
groundwater from below the site area. However, exact abstraction rates and
water quality data should be obtained from local industries prior to the
commencement of the detailed design work at the site.
It is not expected at this stage that the development of the landfill site will
affect water abstraction by local industries or households. However,
although risks are minimal, as an added precaution against contamination
due to failure of measures to contain the leachate, households in close
proximity to the site should be provided with piped water supplies. A mains
water supply is located approximately 500m to the north of the site as a
possible alternative water supply.
6.4           BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
6.4.1         Key Issucs
The key biological issues related to the proposed landfill site are as follows.
* Thte landtake requirements for the site, which will result in a maximum of 124
hectares of marshland being lost to the landfilling operations, with the
result that (progressively) drier, more elevated land will be generated as
waste is placed, covered and restored in phases.
* Disturbance to tlzefauna (thought not of significant ecological importance) of
surrounding areas near to the 1andjill site, due to noise, traffic, etc. associated
with the landfifling operations.
* Disruption to the habitats present on low-lying areas in the vicinity of the site,
due to changes in their drainage characteristics caused by the landfill site
altering the hydr-.logy of the area.

*The scope for improving/generating nev habitats of conservation interest, as part
of the landscaping and restoration of the landfill site, during construction,
operation and after the site is completed.
Thc potential impacts of drainage, traffic and noise are discussed in Sections  c
6.3, 6.6 and 6.8 respectively. The important aspects of the site with respect to
the flora and fauna present arc as folows.
* Although the marshland is a wetland habitat, it is not 'virgin', and has
becn cultivated to a greater or lesser degree for many years. Although        c
large-scale use for paddy discontinued in the 1960s, the biological survey
of the site indicated that attempts at cultivation are continuing.            c
e The marshland area is largely isolated within higher ground which is
under settlement, particularly on the upper slopcs. It is not contiguous
with the ecologically-important Muthurajawela wetlands (sce Figure 6.3a),
which are located approximately 5 km to the north-west. The habitats
oresent are, hence, already likely to be disturbed by the presence of the
iocal population, including by the gra7ing of water buffalo and some
cattle and the cutting of grass and reeds.
6.4.2        Assessmcnt of Potential Impacts                                                  4
Due to the facets of the site described in Section 6.4.1 abovc, it is unlikely that
the existing marshland habitats on and in the vicinity of the site are either    5
particularly sensitive to disturbance or contain significant quantities of rare
species, for example the larger mammals and reptiles, such as estuarine
crocodile. Therefore, the landfill site should not result in a major loss of
existing nature conservation value.
However, rerouting of the stream which traverses the site would mean the
loss of habitat for animals who have found food, shelter and breeding
grounds in this waterway. Construction of the waterway will give rise to
temporarily raised sediment loads as well as changes in water quality
parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen, which will cause a temporary
loss of fauna in the waterway itself as well as a decrease in the fish fauna
downstream. It will take many years before the biological diversity of the
stream returns to pre-construction levels.                                       I
I.
The diversion of the stream will enable the wetland ecosystem upstream of
the site to be preserved as well as potentially enhance the wetlands to the
east of the railway. To prevent erosion in the diverted waterway the banks
should be stabilised with vegetation or some type of biological cladding          _
which will encourage plant growth over time.
The development of the landfill site will also include measures to compensate
the loss of the marshland by the following:

indigenous species in a landscaping and planting programme for the site,
including initial visual screening and subsequent progressive restoration

key component.
use of biological systems for ldchate treatment: current rescarch by the
University of Colombo in Sri Lanka into the use of wetland plants for
trcatmcnt of liquid cffluent indicates that somc of the vegetation identified
on the site is suitable for trealing the leachate drained from the landfill,
and has been applied elsewhere. Hcnce, this existing vegetation, or a
similar type, will be considered for extension onto ccrtain areas of the site
for the dual purpose of leachatc treatment and nature conservation (see
Scction 4.3.4).
Hence, the development of the site is not predicted to caUSC a significant loss
of nature conservation value,
6.5          AIR QUALITM
6.5.1        Key Issues
The key air quality issues related to the proposed landfill site are:
generation of odour, due to the production of gases by the decomposition of
waste during landfill operations and after it has been deposited. The high
organic (putrescible) content of the municipal waste (86%) means that the
installation of appropriate measures to minimnise odour will be particularly
important;
* suspension of dust, due to the landfilling activities, especially vehicle
movements and operations associated with site preparation, excavation
and drying of peat, waste delivery and deposit and cover/restoration;
* effects of vchlicle emissions, due to the traffic associated with the landfill
operations.
The key aspect of the site with respect to these issues is the proximity of
settlements near to the site boundaries, which will be sensitive to any loss of
amenity due to the above air quality impacts.
6.5.2        Assessment of Potential Impacts
The potential impacts indicated in Section 6.5.1 are controllable to avoid
causing nuisance by appropriate design of the landfill, good site and
operational management and implementation of mitigation measures during
the landfill operations. The measures which will be included in the site
design and operation to minimise air quality impacts will be as follows:
* layout of the site to ensure that spoil heaps, for example of peat, are sited at least
100 m from settlements. The typical wind speeds in the area are
understood to be less than 4.5 ms-1. At these speeds, dust particles of
greater than 30 gm are likely to settle out within 100 m from the source

£
(with larger particles deposlting much closcr, for example particles over
100 EIm will settle within approximately 10 ni). With the bunding and         (
screening of the site also acting as a wind brcak and, to some extent, as a
dust trap, the layout of the site should minimise the potential for nuisance   c
from dust;
* sheeting and/or caering of uwstc delitery whicies, wherever practicable, to    £
minimise the inadvcrtent escape of dust and odour from waste being
delivered to the site (as well as litter);
* provision of a bund and buffer zone betwcvn settlements and the landfill site,
which will separate the nearest settlements from the operational site by at   £
least 50 m. This separation provides the capacity for any on-site emissions
to be dispersed and diluted in the atmospherc, thereby reducing the
potential for the emissions to be detectable or cause nuisance at the
settlements;
* regular covering of uaste materials after deposit, to prevent decomposition of
waste in the open air causing odour (as well as reducing the potential for
windblown littcr);
* development of a gas recovery system, to coUect and dispose of the gas         £
generated by the decomposition of waste within the landfill after
placement and covering (for example, by flaring off using pipes inserted
into the deposited waste mass).
* high standard of site supervision, particularly good housekeeping, to ensure that  £
the mitigation measures are continually employed and the overall site is
run efficiently according to good waste management and environmental
protection practices. This should include the regular wetting of on-site      £
roads within IOOm of settlements.
The incorporation of these mitigation measures into the landfill design and      £
operation, together with the stringent site supervision recommended, is good
landfill management practice and considered appropriate to minimise Lhe          £
I                        potential impacts on air quality. These measures should ensure that there is
no significant loss of amenity to the nearby settlements.                        £

'rhe issues related to noise are discusted in Section 6.8. The Important
aspects of the site with respect to other potential inpacts (disruption to roakd
users and air pollution) are as follows:
* Galudupita Road providcs access to the largc settlement of Galudupita
adjacent to the site and, hence, It is frequently used by the local
population. Pedestrians and cyclists are relatively common road users.
* There is some settlement and small shops adjacent to the lower stretch of
Galudupita Road.
* The industrial premises alcng Galudupita Road (the Milk Powder Factory,
Aztec pipe manufacturers, Shermans Welisara Complex and the
Govemment Food Depot) mcans that the road is currently in regular use
by trucks.
6.6.2        Assessmcnt of Potential Impacts
The presence of settlements near to the road indicates that increascs in
congestion and the incrcased risk of accidents, disturbance by noise and the
irmpacts of air pollution are the important traffic issues. These issues will be
cspeciaUy important in relation to the overall delivery of waste, the option of
delivcring some of the bulk containers of waste from thc transfer station in
iate evening and/or if traffic movements are required ovcr week-ends.
An estimate of the traffic which will be associated with the development and
operation of the landfill site is given in Table 6.6a. The key aspects of the
scheduling of this traffic are as follows:
* The bulk of the site workers are Ukelv to travel to the site at the start of
the daily working period (12 hours between 07:00 and 19:00) and depart at
the end.
* Delivery of waste during the daily working period is likely to be
approximately evenly spread, although it is conservatively estimnatea that,
in practice, a maximum of 20%7 of the waste mnay be delivered in any one
hour. Hence, the average number of trucks visiting the site in any one
hour, assuming that all the trucks operate during the 12-hour daily
working period, will be 12. The maximum nmimber is estimated to be 24.
jj                        * It is proposed to schedule bulk haulage deliveries from the transfer station
to avoid the morning and evening peak traffic periods. The exact number
of vehicles and delivery schedule will depend on the operational system
employed, and the number of bulk transfer vehicles available, at the
transfer station.
0 The tractors and trailers will deliver waste during the daytime following
the completion of their collection rounds. On the basis of a 12-hour daily
worklng period at the landfill site, the number of cractors and trailers
delivering waste will average 12 per hour with a maximum of 25.

These potential traffic flows should be considered in light of the existing
number of truck movements on Galudupita Road, which the traffic counts
indicate vary between approximately 10-40 per hour from 06:00 to 23:00.
Trucks are also present on the road in the night-time hours immediately
preceding and following this period.
1he traffic count on Galudupita Road indicates that additional daily vehicle       (
movements during operation of 'he site, assuming that all vehicles deliver
waste during the daytime, will constitute an increase of approximately 75%
in medium and heavy truck movements (12-hour daily traffic flows). The            C
average hourly change to truck traffic would also be comparable with this
increase. An increase of between 50-100% in flows of heavy vehicles is
normally considered to have marginal impacts, although it should be noted
that any increase in traffic may lead to additional congestion, particularly at
the junction with the A3 highway. In addition, waste may be delivered to
the landfill site in up to 150 tractors and trailers per day, which may cause
disruption due to their relatively low road speeds. Overall, all the vehicular
traffic (trucks, vans and pick-ups, cars and tractors and trailers) associated
with the landfill site during operation will generate an increase in total daily
(12-hour) traffic flows on Galudupita Road of 113%. The current overall
traffic flows are moderate, hence Galudupita Road should be capable of
carrying this increased traffic, although it requires iinprovements to its state  £
of repair.
The traffic data for the A3 highway is more limited than for Galudupita Road      (
(see Section 5.8). Generally, the flows on the A3 highway are high and
congestion is apparent, particularly during peak periods and near central
Colombo: truck movements recorded over the peak mid-day hours near
central Colombo averaged 175. The truck movements and overall traffic
conditions ease away from central Colombo (towards the site) with lower           £
traffic flows, but significant overall vehicle and truck movements still occur
throughout the day. The increase caused by the landfilU site (even assuming
that all the trucks deliver waste during the daytime) are estimated to be        £
minor by comparison with the existing flows (a maximum of 10-20% in truck
movements and less than 5% in overall traffic) and will not significantl,         £
change the existing road conditions. However, due to the existing traffic
flows being at, or approaching, the capacity of the highway, the junction of
the A3 highway and Galudupita Road is a concern which will require special       I
attention if the disruption to other road users is to be mininised.
Daytime traffic flows on the A3 highway and Galudupita Road due to the
landfill site and, hence, the potential for congestion will be reduced with the
implementation of the foUlowing:
* the avoidance of the peak morning and evening periods and extending
delivery of bulk wastes from the transfer station to the landfill reception
area either side of the start and finish of the landfil operating hours.
* development of the collection and transfer system for waste, especially the
increased use of new or larger vehicles to collect and deliver heavier
waste payloads (for example, via bulk transfer operations): these

developrnents will reduce the use of vehicles with small payloads, slow
road speeds and/or in poor condition, for example tractors and trailers,
and hence reduce the traffic delivering waste as well as its potential to
cause congestion.
The potential impacts of traffic will also be minimised by the following key
measures within the development of the landfill site:
* sdteduling of traffic to avoid the peak periods on the local roads (07:00-
09:00, 13:00-14:00 and 17:00-19:00);
* improvements to Galudupita Road, such as widening, resurfacing, kerbing,
construction of pedestrian walkways, etc, which will increase the carrying
capacity of the road and improve road safety, especially with respect to
_~                           pedestrians and cyclists;
* bunding, screening and landscaping between the new site access roads off
Galudupita Road and the adjacent settlements, to reduce noise. A
minimum separation of 50 m between the site access road and the nearest
settlement is proposed.
* improvements to thc junction of Galudupita Road and the A3 highuwy, for
example widening the turn, new traffic control measures/signals, signs in
three languages etc, to ease traffic flows and congestion and improve road
safety.

& 7          AESTHETIC APPEAL
6.7.1        Key Issues
The key aesthetic issues associated with the proposed landfill site are:
* the visual impact on local settlements, due to the loss of up to 124 hectares of
open marshland and replacement by the operational, and later the
restored, landfill site. These impacts may include the loss of landscape
features, changes to the overall character of the area and development of
new features as a result of the development of the site;
* the visual impact on travellers on the rail2wy on the eastern boundary of the site,
due to similar reasons to those indicated above;
• litter nuisance, due to waste/debris being blown by the wind off the landfill
site and from uncovered vehicles delivering waste, for example tractor
trailers. The potential effects include direct impacts arising from items of
waste being dispersed onto adjacent land-owners properties as well as
more general loss of visual amenity from unsightly accumulations of litter.
The key aspects of the site with respect to these issues are as follows:
The site is currently undeveloped, therefore the landfill site will be a
significant alteration to the existing landscape. The landfill will involve
land-raising by up to 25-3U m in certain places, and by an average of 15 m
over the whole of the site. Therefore, the topography of the site wil be
changed. It should be noted that the high ground around the site is
currently 15-20 m above the height of the site.
* There art: large settlements on the higher ground to the south, west and
north of the site. These settlements extend to the edge of the site and are
elevated compared to it, hence, where screening by trees is restricted, they
have broad views over the site. However, it should be noted that the
trees which have developed on the higher ground screen the bulk of the
settlements.
The railway on the eastern boundary of the site is the main line from
Colombo to the north-east It is commonly used by tourists visiting the
cultural centre of Kandy and to whom visual appearance is an important
issue.

* There are settlements located adjacent to the site boundary. Their
relatively close proximity increases the risk of loss of amenity due to litter
nuisance.
6.7.2        Assessment of Potential Environmental Impacts                                    a
The aspects of the site and surrounding area described in Sectio 6.7.1 above
mean that aesthetic issues are likely to be important in the development and
operation of the landfill site.
In particular, views which will need consideration will be those from the
settlements on the margins of the marshland to the north, from the railway
to the east, and generally from more distant, elevated locations on the higher
ground to the south, west and north. The irnpact on the aesthetic quality of
the area will depend on the ultimate visibility and appearance of the           0
working areas of the landfill site from these key viewpoints.
To minimise the visual impacts of the development of the site, the following
design and operational features will be employed:
* provision of a landscaped bund and buffer zone as screening betueen the
settlements, the railway line and the landfill site, which will separate the
nearest settlemnents from the operational site by at least 50 m. The bund
will be designed to provide screening of the site through its own height
and by the planting of appropriate vegetation, for example fast-growing      S
and dense species of flora. The intervening area will be landscaped to
preserve the visual amenity of the local settlements as far as possible.      *
It should be noted that, due to the size of the site, waste placement will be
undertaken well in excess of 50 m from the nearest settlements during the
majority of the life of the landfill.
a regular covering of waste materials after deposit which, as well as preventing
decomposition of waste in the open air causing odour and miniumising
windblown litter, will improve the overall appearance of the site.
* development of the site in discrete stages (with progressive filling in each
stage) which will allow the parts where waste deposit is completed to be
covered and restored. This means that the working area, and hence
visual intrusion, will be miniimised and restricted to only a proportion of

In addition, due to the proximity of the settlements, the prevention of littek
nuisance causing a loss of amenity is a significant concem  The high
proportion of organics (86%) and, hence, high moisture content of the
municipal waste arisings indicates that litter generation should not normally
be significant However, to minimise the potential for any litter nuisance to
occur, the development and operation of the landfill site will include the
following measures:
* sheettng and/or covering of waste delivery vehicles, wherever practicable, to
minimise the inadvertent escape of litter from waste being delivered to the
site (as well as reducing odour and dust);
* development of the landscaped bund and buffer zone to act as a wind-break and
provide screening, which will minimise the risk of winds entraining litter
and also intercept any litter arising from the site operations. The potential
nuisance of litter will be reduced by the separation distance of at least
50 m between operational areas of the landfill site and the nearest
settlements.
* regular covering of waste materials after deposit, to prevent prolonged
exposure of the waste after placement causing litter.
* use of litter screens, nets or equivalent to intercept windblown litter. These
measures may include litter screens placed around part, or all, of the site
perimeter, working cells or local areas of active waste placement within
the site. Local, readily movable litter screens may be temporarily
employed during periods of potentially high litter generation, for example
in dry spells with high winds.

collect litter from access roads and other off-site areas;

the litter control measures are utilised to their full potential.
Hence, the development of the landfill site will incorporate a range of
measures to screen the settlements and railway line from the operational
areas, preserve the overall appearance of the area and to minimise litter
generation and any associated impacts. The scheme will include a range of
landscaping proposals which will minimise the visual impact during
operation and return the land to a beneficial use upon completion of the
landfilling operations. Therefore, although the development will involve a
major change to the outlook of the site and immediately surrounding area,
the overall proposals are not considered likely to cause a significant impact
on the aesthetics of area.

6.8.1        Key ISsues
The key noise issues related to the proposed landfill site are:
* disturbance to  ople living in the settlements near to the site, due to noise
To                         from on-site activities, for example earth--moving plant, large volume
trucks delivering construction materials, plant depositing and covering
waste, pumps dewatering the site, etc, as well as traffic entering and
leaving the site. This issue is particularly important if evening, night-time  (
or week-end working is undertaken;
* disturbance to local fauna in the surrounding areas, due to the on-site       C
activities and traffic.
WI                      The important aspects of the site with respect to these issues are as follows:
* The existing noise climate at the site is reasonably low, typical of a        C
rural/suburban area. Hence, changes in noise levels will be more
noticeable than in other, more noisy, environments. Along Galudupita         (
Road, the background noise level is higher, due to the movement of
traffic, particularly trucks, associated with the Milk Powder Factory, Aztec
pipe manufacturers, Shermans Welisara Complex, the Governmeit Food           C
ir                        Depot and other industry in the area.
The site has large settlements along its northern, western and southem
16                        boundaries. These settlements will be sensitive to noise impacts.             _
* The site is not likely to support fauna which has a high sensitivity to
disturbance, since noise and disruption by the local population already       (
occurs on its margins and, to a lesser extent, throughout the site area.
However, the landfill operations may be expected to discourage some
species, for example birds, from using the area, particularly for brecding.
6.8.2        Assessment of Potential Impacts                                                  (
Due to the aspects of the site described in Section 6.8.1 above, the disturbance
of the local settlements by noise is likely to be the main issue. The noise     (
generation at the site will be dependent on a variety of factors, the most
important of which will be as follows:
* number, type and design of the plant used on-site;
* use of noise prevention and minirmisation measures;                           C
* mode of operation;
* site layout;
* screening and distance from noise-sensitive receptors;
working hours (daytime, evening, night-time, etc).

The potential impact of the operations will depend upon the noise levels
3 g                       generated in comparison with the existing noise climate experienced at the
nearest s3reitive receptors (the settlemcnts on the margins of the site).
3                         There are a range of standards which may be applied for the purpose of
limiting noise at the site to ensure that no significant noise impacts occur. It
is recommended that the following guideline is applicable to candidates at
the landfill site, and can generally be considered good standards of noise
environment
55 dB LA daytime and 45 dB LA night-time at the nearest off-site house
(as an external facade level) due to the site operations.
Noise from the site will be minimised as far as practicable by the
incorporation of mitigation measures into the site design and operational
procedures, including:
* provision of a bund and buffer zone between the settlements and the landfill site,
which will separate the working areas of the landfill from the nearest
settlement by at least 50 m, serve to screen the site and act as a noise
barrier;
• location of plant as far as practicable from settlements, for example dewatering
pumps, to minimise the effects of noise generation;
X careful selection and operation of plant, to avoid the use of unnecessarily
noisy plant and ensure that the selection of plant includes consLderation
of its noise emissions. Where necessary, noise enclosuresiscreening may
be appropriate around unavoidable relatively noisy plant;
r  use of on-site mnaterials as noise screens, for example the location of spoil
heaps of peat between the operational areas and settlements;
* restriction of operating hours, to minimise the traffic and site operations
during quiet periods (evenings, night-time, week-ends, official holilays,
etc with the possible exception of delivery of bulk containers).
* high standard of site supervision, training and maintenance of plant, since the
ii                          site management, appropriate training of workers in plant operation and
adequate long term maintenance of plant are all means by which noise
J                           emissions from on-site operations can be reduced).
Although it will be difficult to meet the standard of 55 dB L A  daytime at all
receptors and the proposed landfill, the impacts will be temporary and will
J                        follow the progressive development and infilling of the site.
With the application of the above mitigation measures, the noise generated
at the landfill site should be minrised. On the basis of the achievement of
the noise standards identified as applicable to the site operations (or the
J                        meeting of appropriate criteria which may be developed from them), no
significant noise impacts are considered likely to arise.

In the event of night-time delivery of bulk container vehicles, a mandmum of
3 trucks per hour are anticipated along Galudupita Road, and no landfill to
operations activities will take place at night. The noise impact will th:refore
be restricted to these households along Galudupita Road itself. Given the
limited number of receptors, and the significant advantages of night-time
delivery in termis of reduced traffic congestion and numbers of haulage
vehicles required, these noise impacts are not considered significant

7            MiMGATO0N MEASURES AND  iONiTORING PLAN
7.1          1NTRODUC7ION
This section provides details of the mitigation measures which will be
incorporated into the design and operation of the landfll site. The following
details of the mitigation measures are provided:
type of measure (engineering, management, etc);
* budget costs (capital and operating);
* requirements for institutional arrangements;
p                      * ongoing monitoring.
P7       7.2           MITIGATION MEASURE*
The proposed rnitigation measures to be employed to mirnmise the
environrmental impacts of the development of the landfill are briefly
summarised in the following sections. These mitigation measures, together
with broad cost estimates, institutional responsibilities and monitoring
requirements are presented in Table 7.2a.
--7     7.2.1         Socio-cultural factors
* A Resettlement Plan is to be prepared to provide housing and access to
livelihood within the Welisara area of at least equal standard to the
-- ^                     existing housing qual ty of life of the population to be resettled (see
ANNEX C).
t A Community Developmer't Plan is to be prepared by the MHA&PC to
provide compensation to affected families within the designated
development area at Welisara. These measures may include:
- the provision of bunding and tree planting to reduce the visual impact
of the landfill site as it develops, and to provide a physical barrier to
prevent children playing on the site;
- upgrading of existing housing;
- improved infrastructure and services (e.g. water supplies and
sanitation, access, electricity);
- training and awareness campaigns in public health and safety;
- support for income generating or other activities on the restored
landfill site.
* Employment Opportunities will be offered to local people with appropriate
skills, as a priority.
a Scavenging Activities will be strictly managed to prevent on-site risks to
health and safety, and negative socio-cultural impacts on the existing
community. Specifically, the uncontrolled growth of squatter communities

around the periphery of the site will be prevented, dnd access to and from
the site will be managcd to prevent congestion and littering of the roads
and surrounding area.
|  Provisian of new Potable Water and Sanitation for those households whose
ecisting facilities are at risk from contamination from the landfill site in
the unlikely event of a failure of the site containment measures,
* Prevention of Pests and Disseas Vectors will be achieved by minimising the
area of active tipping and ensuring that newly-tipped waste has
temporary cover applied at the end of the worldng day. The waste will
also be compacted to reduce voids in the waste mass. Insecticides may be
used on an ad hoc basis if necessary.
* Restoration and Income Generation opportunities will be administered
through the Community Development Plan (see above) and may include
horticultural, amenity and certain types of conmnercial enterprise.
7.2.2        Hydrology and Hydrogeology
* Impermeable lining and cover will be provided to minimise rainfall
infiltration, underground seepage and lateral movement of leachates by
achieving a maximum permeability of 109m secl.
* The proposed improvements to the existing flood protection bund along the Kalu
Oya river, as well as the existing railway embankment to the east of the
site (if required), would also serve to prevent pollution of the water
course by leachate in the unlikely event of a failure in the leachate
containment facilities.
* Flood control would be achieved by:
* .          - redirection of the stream traversing the site to the east of the existing
railway line, thereby allowing the marsh to the east and south of the
site to provide flood retention capacity during times of peak flows;
- care will be taken to ensure that this stream is kept free of dogging
vegetation;
- it may be necessary, if required by Sri Lanka Railways, to strengthen
the existing embankment by the creation of a bund abutting the
embankment.
* A full hydrological survey will be a requirement of the detailed design of the
landfill site, in order to confirm preliminary evaluations of upstream and
downstream flood risk and associated flood control precautions.
* Provision of newv potable water supplies to households whose existing wells
could be contaminated in the unlikely event of a failure of the site
containment or failure of the supply as a result of the lowering of the
water table from site dewatering activities.

7.2.3        Biological factors
* Creative conservation in the development proposals consisting of the Use of
indigenous species in a landscaping and planting programne for the site,
including initial visual screening and subsequent progressive restoration
of the site. The landscaping scheme will include nature conservation as a
key component
* Use of biological systems for leachate treatment: current research by the
University of Colombo in Sri Lanka into the use of wetland plants for
treatment of liquid effluent indicates that some of the vegetation identified
on the site is suitable for treating the leachate drained from the landfill,
and has been applied elsewhere. Hence, this existing vegetation, or a
similar type, will be considered for extension onto certain areas of the site
for the dual purpose of leachate treatment and nature conservation.
7.2.4        Air Quality
* Layout of the site to ensure thtat spoil heaps, for example of peat, are sited at least
100 m from settlements. The typical wind speeds in the area are
understood to be less than 4.5 mst. At these speeds, dust particles of
greater than 30 gm are likely to settle out within 100 m from the source
(with larger particles depositing much closer, for example particles over
p                       100 gm will settle within approximately 10 m). With the bunding and
screening of the site also acting as a wind break and, to some extent, as a
dust trap, the layout of the site should minimise the potential for nuisance
from dust.
* Sheeting and/or covering of waste delivery vehicles, wherever practicable, to
minimise the inadvertent escape of dust and odour from waste being
delivered to the site (as well as litter).
a Provision of a bund and buffer zone between settlements and the landfill site,
*                        vwhich will separate the nearest settlements from the operational site 1- at
-                         least 50 m. This separation provides the capacity for any on-site emist ns
to be dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere, thereby reducing the
I                       potential for the emissions to be detectable or cause nuisance at the
settlements.
-                      * Regular cuvering of waste materials after deposit, to prevent decomposition of
waste in the open air causing odour (as well as reducing the potential for
windblown litter).
* Development of a gas recovery system, to collect and dispose of the gas
generated by the decomposition of waste within the landfill after
placement and covering (for example, by flaring off using pipes inserted
into the deposited waste mass).
* High standard of site supervision, particularly good housekeeping, to ensure
that the mitigation measures are continually employed and the overall site
is run efficiently according to good waste management and environmental

protection practices. This should include the regular wetting of on-site
roads within lOOm of settlements.
7.2.5        Traffic
• Scheduling of traffic to avoid the peak periods on the local roads (07:00-
09:00, 13:00-14:00 and 17:00-19:00), as well as evenings, night-time and
week-ends wherever possible.
i* Improvements to Galudupita Road, such as widening, resurfacing, kerbing,
construction of pedestrian walkways, etc, which will increase the carrying
capacity of the road and improve road safety, especially with respect to
pedestrians and cyclists.
* Bunding, screening and landscaping between the new site access roads off
Galudupita Road and the adjacent settlements, to reduce noise. A
minimum separation of 50 m between the site access road and the nearest
settlement is proposed.
* Improvements to the junction of Galudupita Road and the A3 highway, for
example widening the turn, new traffic control measures/signals, signs in
three languages etc, to case traffic flows and congestion and improve road
safety. 
7.26         Aesthetics
• Provision of a landscaped bund and buffer zone as screening between the
settlements, the railway line and tIze landfill site, which will separate the
nearest settlements from the operational site by at least 50 m. The bund
will be designed to provide screening of the site through its own height
and by the planting of appropriate vegetation, for example fast-growing
and dense species of flora. The intervening area will be landscaped to
preserve the visual amenity of the local settlements as far as possible.
It should be noted that, due to the size of the site, waste placement will be
undertaken well in excess of 50 m from the nearest settlements during the
majority of the life of the landfill.
* Regular covering of waste materials after deposit which, as well as preventing
decomposition of waste in the open air causing odour and minimnising
windblown litter, will improve the overall appearance of the site.
* Development of the site in discrete stages (with progressive filling in each
stage) which will allow the parts where waste deposit is completed to be
covered and restored. This means that the working area, and hence
visual intrusion, will be minimised and restricted to only a proportion of
the overall site at ai y one time.
* Restoration and landsc ping scheme for the site, which will ensure that, in the  5
longer term after landfilling operations are complete, the site will be fully
||                          restored to a natural outlook and be available for certain types of
agricultural, horticultural or commercial development The landscaping

nuisance of litter will bc reduced by the separation distance of at least

- Litter picking, whereby at periodic intervals, or after events which have led

detailed to coUect litter from off-site areas and nearby roads. This exercise
may also be achieved by the provision of incentives to scavengers to
collect litter from access roads and other off-site areas.
* High standard of site supervision, particularly good housekeeping, to ensure
that the litter control measures are utilised to their full potential.

of its noisc emnissions. Where necessary, noise enclosures/screening may
be appropriate around unavoidablc relatively noisy plant.                   C
* Use of on-site nwterials as noise screens, for example the location of spoil
hcaps of peat between the operational areas and settlements. 
* Restriction of operating hours, to minimise the traffic and site operations
during quiet periods (evenings, night-time, week-ends, official holidays,
etc) with the possible exception of delivery of bulk containers.
* High standard of site supervision, training and maintenance of plant, since the
site management, appropriate training of workers in plant operation and    (
adequate long term maintenance of plant are all means by which noise
emissions from on-site operations can be reduced).
7.3          MONI7oRING PLAN                                                               (
Monitoring reports should be sent to the Environmental Unit of the WPC
and the CEA. The WPC would oversee the day-to-day operation of the site,      (
but the CEA has overall regulatory responsibility for enforcement. The CEA
is also responsible for authorisation of the operation based on an
Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) that will only be issued, and
subsequently renewed, if the required standards are met. (The WPC is in
the process of preparing their own environmental statutes, but CEA remain     (
legally responsible). Due to the nature of the mitigation measures, much of
the recommended ongoing monitoring of the site requires regular inspection
by the WPC under the supervision of the CEA for waste management,
supported by independent annual audits. This enmphasises the importance
which must be attached to institutional strengthening of the WPC and CEA,     (
in terms of staffing, training and availability of equipment and resources, to
enable then to provide the required degree of monitoring and control
respectively. Recomunended monitoring activities are also shown in table
7.2a.
In the event that action needs to be taken against a private sector site
operator there are two possible courses of action. The WPC may be able to
take action initially on the basis of contractual obligation (ie non-compliance
with performance conditions). Alternatively (or additionally) the CEA can
take regulatory action against the operator.                                  £

ANNEXA:
ENVIRONMENTAL MPACT ASSESSMENT - BASELIE ROAD TRASFER
STATION
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As part of the upgraded waste management system for the CMA, a refuse
transfer station is to be established at Baseline Road at which municipal soud
wastes will be transferred into 15 tonne payload bulk haulage vehicles for
onward road transport and disposal at the Welisara landfill site.
The facility will be designed to handle a maximum throughput of 1,000
tonnes per day (tpd) and sufficient landtake and infrastructure will be
incorporated at the outset. Any expansion of hauling capacity will be
achieved by adding berths to the fenced area. No extension of the initial
landtake requirement is anticipated for expansion and will not impinge on
any existing settlements. However, initial throughput following
commissioning is anticipated to be around 550 tpd.
Refuse collection vehicles (compactors, sideloaders and tractor/trailers) will
bring collected wastes and, after passing over a weighbridge at the site
entrance, discharge their loads into waiting ISO-type (International Standards
Organisation ) containers located beneath a raised ramp. When full, the
(enclosed) ISO containers will be transported by road to Welisara.
2           BASELINE DESCRP7ION OF THE SI
21          Smr LOCATIOIV AND AREA
The site is located on Baseline Road in central Colombo, adjacent to Baseline
Road rail station. The site was chosen by GOSL to provide flexibility for
road or rail transfer to a site outside the city, initially to a proposed landfill
40 km east of the city. The total existing site area, including a slaughter
house, is 7.5 acres and is owned by the GOSL. The area required for the
transfer station will be confirmed during the ongoing conceptual engineering
design but is currently expected to occupy around 50% of the whole site.
The Terms of Reference for the Site Studies are included in Attachment 1 to
this Annex. The site is bounded to the north by a canal which meets Baseline
Road Culvert at one end and Baseline Lane Culvert at the other end. To the
east is Baseline Lane. On the southem boundary is the railway track
including Baseline Road station and level crossing. To the west is Baseline
Road itself.

2,3          ToPoGRAPHY AND LANDSCAPE                                                       C
The site is located in a gently sloping area. The railway line boundary is two
to three metres higher than the canal. Opposite the station therc is an area
of raised ground, some six metres higher than the canal. This represents the
highiest point on the site and currently is occupied by a bungalow housing a
local veterinary surgery and the quarters of the Chief Veterinary Surgeon
serving the slaughterhouse.
A detailed topographic survey of the site was completed in May 1993 for the
Urb3n Programme Unit (of the Ministry of Policy Planning and                   (
Implementation of the GOSL) and includes a contour plan (at 1 metre
intervals) for the site area at 1:1,000 scale. In addition, a 1:2,S00 scale plan
was prepared to identify major land use within 250 metres of the site         (
boundary.
2.4          GEOLOGY
A geotechnical survey is planned to confirm ground conditions and establish
structural design parameters. This survey will confirm the site geology.
However, preliminary site observations suggest the existence of limited soil
cover over lateritic bedrock. The raised area referred to above enables the
strata to be observed, and this mound can be seen to be laterite. At this     i
stage, therefore, no problems are expected concerning the loadbearing
properties of the site. The presence and stability of the adjacent railway line,
which is carrying loads in excess of those for the transfer station on the
same strata, supports this confidence.

Po                     The groundwater level can be observed in a (dilapidated) dug well in the
vegetable garden area in the north of the site. Groundwater level is at       (
around 05 metres below ground level. The water is used for irrigation of the
gardens.                                                                      (

As mentioned in Section I the site is bordered to the north by a canal from
culverts in Baseline Road and Baseline Lane. The canal is prinarily a         0
drainage channel and is not used for water abstraction in this area.

2.7          SOCIO.CULtAL EVRONMFN AND LANDUSE
Within the 7.5 acre site area the present land use comprises the following:
* Colombo Municipal Slaughter House
* Cattle transfer shed
* Chief Veterinary Surgeon's quarters
* Vegetable gardens on the open land along the canal
* Approximately ten shanties built along the canal in the south eastem part
of the site
Outside the site boundary, within 250 metres are:
* the GOSL Railway quarters;
* four schools;
* one temple;
* a muslim cemetery;
* two playgrounds;
* two petrol stations;
* a cinema; and
* a hume pipe factory.
In addition, an estimated 317 shanties (with 563 dwellers) occupy this zone
outside of the site boundary.
Z8          BIOLOCICAL ENVIRONMENT
The site contains a number of rnature trees and small shrubs. However, they
are all species which are common throughout the neighbouring area and in
other parts of the country. Similarly, whilst possibly providing an urban
habitat for small faunal species within a surrounding built-up area none of
interest are known to have colonised the site.
There are also birds, notably crows, which are attracted to scavenge on the
waste generated by the present slaughterhouse activities. As mentiontd
above parts of the site area are currently under small-scale cultivation of
vegetables - karikum, mukunuwanne and Phampala. The canal bordering
the site to the north and east (primarily a drainage channel) is, it is reported,
inhabited by a number of comrnon fish species. Nevertheless the canal also
conveys sewage from nearby residential property and the slaughterhouse
effluent. The canal ultimately flows into the Kelani Grange.
2.9          TRAFFIC
Baseline Road is a major thoroughfare carrying a wide range of commercial
and other traffic throughout the day. The road is lined with a variety of
small to medium-sized industry, shops and general settlement The results of
the traffic counts on Baseline Road, carried out on the 3 March during the
day and 11/12 March during the right are summarised in Tables 2.9a and 29b
respectively. More detailed breakdowns of the traffic flows are provided in
Annex H.
A.3



Table 2.9a shows that day-time traffic levels on Baseline Road are very high,
for all types of motorised vehicles, especially trucks, vans and cars. The
presence of the level crossing at the corner of the site, is a potential cause of
congestion at the planned transfer station access point and this issue will
need to be considered very carefuly in the detailed design of the transfer
station site. Table 29b shows that during evening and night-time, the traffic.
flows on Baseline Road decreasc significantly, particularly for motorised
vehides.
In summary, the data available for traffic movements on the Baseline Road
indicate that the traffic conditions are typically as follows:
|  Week-day traffic flows are heavy, and problems of traffic congestion
already cxist.
* Flows of all types of traffic flows arc nmore or less continuous throughout
the day tirne period.                                                          S
* Night-time traffic flows are much lower than day time flows, and flows of
heavy and medium trucks decline to almost nothing between the hours of
23.00 and 04.00.
210           AIR QUALflY
The present air quality is largely influenced by three sources; exhaust
emissions from heavy Baseline Road traffic and from the railway, and odours        0
from the slaughter house.
211           NOISE
The present noise environment is influenced by rail and road traffic, the
slaughter house activities and disparate other commercial and domestic
sources. As such, the daytime ambient noise levels are characteristic of an
1U                       active urban comnmercial district.

3            ASSESSMENT OF ENVZRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The Baseline Road site is located in a busy urban commercial environment,
with heavy road traffic, a railway and existing shanty settlements along the
boundaries of the site, as well as a slaughterhouse located within the site
boundary. In general, the development of the site for a sanitary transfer
station is unlikely to cause any significant environrental impacts except
those related to increased traffic congestion. The various categories of
potential impact, and the proposed design features that will be adopted to
mitigate these impacts, are discussed below.
3.1          SOCIO-CULLLRAL E*WRONMENT AND LANDUSE
The development of the transfer station will not involve removing the Chief
Veterinary Surgeon's quarters or the three GOSL residues at the site. The
|                       slaughter house will also require relocation either because of landtake or the
problems of access once the transfer station buildings and associated facilities
are constructed to the front of the site. However, provision has been made
in the transfer station design to retain on undeveloped area for animal
inspection pens in the South East part of the present site. The
slaughterhouse is owned and operated by GOSL and an alternative location
has been found by them nearby, on the westem side of Baseline Road.
Therefore, none of the existing buildings will require reconstruction
elsewhere on the Baseline Road site as a result of the Transfer Station
development. Their reconstruction at the new location will be the
responsibility of GOSL and will be undertaken according to its own
procedures. It will, thus, not form part of this Project Component.
Any demolished buildings on the site will involve the disposal of the
associated waste materials in a safe manner. We recommend that a detailed
investigation be undertaken to identify the presence of any contamination on
the site , particularly in the active operational areas of the slaughterhcuse.
The latter should include testing for the presence of anthrax spores unless
there is epidemiological evidence available to confirm that this is not
required. On the basis of the results of this investigation, a specification for
any specific required remediation/clean-up works should be prepared,
p                     together with any health and safety procedures to be followed during the
redevelopment of the site. All materials taken off-site for disposal from the
_                      slaughterhouse area should be disinfected prior to transport. All materials
_I                      should be disposed of to a landfill, adopting necessary sanitary landfill
practices.
There has been some encroachment onto the site by squatters in the south
eastern corner. This area is not required for transfer station development and
therefore they could remain. No relocation is envisaged to be necessary
beyund the eventual developed transfer station area. The perimeter will be
fenced to inhibit subsequent encroachment onto the transfer station site.

Adjacent landuses which could be affected by the transfer station
development include two schools across the canal. However, given their
current immediate proxirruty to the slaughterhouse this change of use will  4
have, arguably, less irnpact than development of otherwise vacant land.
The greenleaf vegetables grown on the site near the canal may represent a   a
source of livelihood for the gardeners. These gardens would have to be
removed to allow development of the transfer station and the provision of
suitable land elsewhere should be considered by COSTL. There are many       {
similarly cultivated plots in the surrounding area.
A positive impact will be that employment will be created for labourers,
drivers, maintenance and supervisory staff, who could, wherever possible, be
recruited from the local area. It is not currently planned to permit scavenging
activities at the Transfer Station. However, the conceptual design proposed
would enable these activities to be incorporated if required within the layout  a
developed.
3.2         HYDROLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
The main hydrological Icature of relevance to the site is the canal bordering  C
the site to the north and east. The canal is primarily a drainage channel and
the water quality (although not analysed) appears to be poor. However,
there are plans to upgrade the urban Colombo canal network Nonetheless,
the transfer station design provides for the interception of surface drainage
for disposal to sewer. This will require careful attention to developed ground
surface contours, since as noted earlier, the natural gradient is towards the
canal. The transfer station operation should not, therefore, in any case affect
current canal water quality. During the construction works stage
arrangements will be made to intercept surface run-off and prevent
contaminated residues entering the canal.
There are GOSL plans to widen the canal system in many areas of Colombo.    4
If the stretch of canal adjacent to the site is to be widened there would be
advantage in undertaking these works prior to transfer station develcpment
in order to facilitate easy access to canalside work areas and minimise     4
disturbance to transfer station operations and installed services, particularly
drainage. We recommend that the GOSL consider this.                         4
The geotechnical survey will establish whether or not groundwater is
present within 5 m of the surface. In the event that groundwater is
encountered the detailed design will include measures to ensure that no
contamination takes place. In particular, operational areas where waste will  4
be loaded/unloaded will be on paved, drained surfaces. This, together with
adequate operational management and attention to regular maintenance of
the paving and drainage system, should result in minimal opportunity for    C
discharge of contaminated waters to the groundmass and, thence, to
groundwater.

3.3          BIOLOGICAL ENWRONMENT
No species of flora or fauna of importance are known to exist within the site.
However, the transfer station footprint has been designed to retain as many
of the existing mature trees as possible, primarily in the area adjacent to the
railway line. The existing vegetable gardens will need to be removed, but
there are many plots where these varieties of vegetables are cultivated in the
surrounding area. The operation of the site , if not adequately managed,
offers the potential for attracting increased numbers of scavenging birds, rats
and other vermin. This issue is addressed later under Public Health impacts.
3.4          TRAFFIC
The increased traffic along Baseline Road associated with the operation of
the transfer station will contribute to local congestion. Given the congested
nature of Baseline Road, and the difficulties that this may cause for site
access, good operational reasons exist to design the transfer station in such a
way that these impacts are minimised.
Around 50 bulk haulage and a further 150 of a range of collection vehicle
trips will occur iritially, growing to perhaps 70 and 300 respectively over the
life of the transfer station, the latter being dependent upon the existence, or
otherwise of additional transfer stations elsewhere. In order to minimise the
contribution to further congestion on Baseline Road it is planned to extend
the working day for the bulk haulage vehicles, with each vehicle carrying
out one journey to the landfill from 06.00 to 07.00 in the morning and also
delivering to the landfill reception area between 1900 and 2200 hrs in the
evening. The morning and afternoon peaks can thus be avoided. As a result,
the additional daytime (12 hour) traffic would comprise 150 to 300
miscellaneous collection vehicles plus around 30 bulk haulage vehide trips.
This constitutes increases of 3-6% heavy truck movements . The additional
congestion would thus be marginal and mainly associated with the need to
turn into the site from (and across) the already busy Baseline Road. Thlere
are plans by CMC to construct a flyover to replace the existing railway level
crossing adjacent to the site. If this proceeds then the needs of transfer
station access should be addressed at the same time and smooth entry/exit
facilitated.A one-way (ir/out) system will be adopted at the site entrance to
mininmise conflict between collection and bulk haulage vehicles
entering/exiting the site and the design brief includes careful consideration of
the layout of the junction with the highway together with appropriate
warning signage utilising readily recognisable international symbols.
In the early morning and late evening periods the additional heavy goods
vehicle traffic on Baseline Road from transfer bulk haul vehicles would
represent around 25% increase. These percentage increases are not generally
considered to be significant.
The potential for disturbance to nearby settlements due to increased engine
noise and air pollution from vehicle exhausts will be insignificant, as there

are no residential propcrties close to the access point of thc transfer station
site, and the additional contribution made by vehide travelling to and from
the transfer station will not be significant.
The additional traffic also has the potential to result in increased accidents,
especially around the site entrance. The design of the entrance will need to
achieve adequate site lines to maxinise visibility for both drivers and
cyclists/pedestrians using the area.
3.5          AIR QuL4mT
The transfer station has the potential to adversely affect present air quality
with the emiussions of dust and odours from on-site activities, in addition to
exhaust emissions from both collection and bulk haul vehicles.
Control of dust can be achieved, at a cost, by totally enclosing the
discharge/loading operation in a negative pressure building. Given the high
moisture content of CMA municipal solid waste, this is not considered
necessary. However, it is proposed that the discharge operation takes place
under at, least, a roofed structure in order to minimise contaminated run-off
during adverse weather conditions. This, together with side panelling, should
prove sufficient The conceptual design will review this and the need, if any,
for use of sprays or other devices to limit dust generation at source,which, if
required, will be incorporated into the design.                                   6
The generation of odours on-site will depend on a variety of factors but
primarily on the nature of the waste delivered and the storage/handling
system on-site. In particular, if wastes are not collected promptly from the
point of production and are older (more "mature") on receipt at the transfer     6
1U                      station, they will typically be more malodorous. Equally, if wastes are
temporarily stored at the transfer station for extended periods prior to
despatch to Welisara odour levels will increase. Therefore, the primary
nLitigation measure is a smooth collectiont/ transfer operatior. Physical
measures which can be adopted in addition include enclosing the wastt
handling operation and siting this activity away from sensitive off-site
receptors, for example the two schools across the canal. It is planned that the
main operational areas will be in the south west of the site at the furthest
distance, some 100m, from the nearer school.                                      £
3.6          NOISE                                                                               £
As noted in section 2.11, the ambient noise environment is typical of an
active commercial urban area. The noise sources associated with the transfer       £
site, primarily traffic-related, are not expected to change the noise
environment for receptors on Baseline Road. Sensitive receptors include the        (
two schools across the canal to the north-east and a temple located just
beyond the south-east extremity of the site. The increase in background
noise levels at these locations are not anticipated to be unduly intrusive. This
will be confirmed following the results of more detailed assessment.

3.7          PUBUC HE4L7TH
The establishment of the transfer station offers the potential for public health
hazards if not properly managed. These relate to the potential for vermin
(rats, mice, stray dogs, flies and other disease vectors) to be attracted to the
site and a food source. These risks will be mninimised by containment of
wastes awaiting despatch, avoiding storage of wastes on-site uncontained for
extended periods and washing down/disinfecting operational areas at regular
intervals, together with attention to good housekeeping practice (for example
sweeping areas where refuse can collect-in corners, between containers
following spillage etc.). The potential residual public health impacts
associated witlh redevelopment of the slaughterhouse area were addressed in
Section 3.1. As with the suppression of odours the key mitigation measure to
safeguard public health is the timely transfer of wastes, supported by general
hygiene/housekeeping.
3.8          AESTHEC ASPECTS
The nature of the transfer station buildings , no more than two storeys in
height, will blend naturally into the immediate, primarily commercial
surroundings. There are no raised areas which overlook the site, with the
exception of one house located beyond the railway station to the south west
(which currently overlooks the veterinary surgery). Passengers waiting to
board trains will be able to observe the loading operations. However, it is
r-                       considered preferable to have this transitory visual impact than locate the
operations further across the site where permanent daytime receptors (e.g.
the schools) would be more greatly affected.

The purpose of the conceptual engineering vork required is to                    C
prepare waste management facility layout contalnn-g sufficient information to
dgmonstrate the validity of the concept proposed and to permit more reliable
cost estimates to be prepared for financing purposes.                                      C
3.2       INTRODUCTION
It is intention of the COSL and the World Bank to engage                         C
Consultants to conduct a program of vork to establish conceptual layout for
solid wastes transfer station facilities at Baseline Road and proposed
engineered landfill at Paduikka.  The layout vill utilize the topographical
mapping and results of ground and hydrogeological investigations.
Subsequently, the layout will be used as a central feature of the
environmental impact assessments to be performed.
The scope of the work required for each site includes the tasks
listed as follows:
-    conceptual site layout and storage areas                                   4
-    traffic flow patterns
-    identification, including quantities, of general site                       C
preparatory works and derivation of a preliminary schedule of
the main works, and outline specifications to assist in the
future detailed engineering and construction of the proposed
transfer and landfill facilities.
-    compilation of specific unit costs and derivation of more                   C
representative engineering-related capital cost esatimates.
No vaste management activities currently take place at the sites C
under investigation.
3.3       CERERAL SCOPE OF THE CONCEPTUAL SITE STUDIES                                      C
The Consultant shall provide experts with knowledge in engineering,
waste management and costs to develop preliminary facility layout at Baseline
Road and Padukka to demonstrate the credibility of the proposed waste
management system.  The Consultant shall support their written flndings with
sketches, detailed dravings, calculations and data listings for each of the                C
tasks comprising this project.

It 'Asi emphasized that the conceptual aite studies would mab
proviSiOni for both road and rail transfer of wastes from Baseline Road to
padukka. The final choice of the transfer mode of tranport will not be
selected until after this sub-activity is completed.
(i)  Conceptual Design.Lay6ut
Preliminary block diagras layout and enginsering dravings
shall be prepared to illustrate the access, buildings, services and
storage areas at the Baseline Road transfer station. In addition,
the sources of on-site cover material, vasto emplacement, phasing,
drainage, gas and leachate management and restoration profiles
should be provided in outline for Padukka.
The facilities depicted for the Baseline Road site ahould be
conaistent with the development of a 2 story waste transfor
operation vith top loading of demountable 20' ISO containers
receiving waste from a variety of refuse collection vehicles.  The
Containers, once full, would be transferred by fork lift to a
storage area for night time transfer by road/rail to the Padukka
landfill. No mechanical compaction into containers is envisaged at
the present time.
The facilities to be depicted at the Padukka site should be
all of the principal features consistent with the development of a
modern sanitary (controlled) landfill, whose general design is
1               sustainable using the resources available in Sri Lanka at the
present time. The preparation of detailed engineering drawings and
the identification equipment suppliers, etc., are NOT sought in
this project study.
The operations at Baseline Road are expected to receive
initially around 550 tonnes per day wvaste input, rising to perhaps
1000 tonnes per day in 10 years time. Sufficient capacity to
handle the initial waste input, and sufficient space for possible
future expansion should be included in the layout.
The Consultant should liaise with the NERO and review their
recent reports on waste management for Colombo.
p               (ii) Traffic Flow Pattorns
At Baseline Road a wide variety of collection vehicles will
bring solid waste for transfer. A smooth one vay traffic flow
pattern, including the possible provision of veighbridge and wheel
washing facilities, should be suggested and depicted on site plans.
In addition, the on-eite movement. of fork lift trucks and build
haulage by road or rail transport must be conveniently
acco=odated. Details of m±nimum turning circles and similar

necsesary information will be Indicated by the Consultant in                      C
conjunction vith the 3BRO.
At Padukka the sug8gested traffic flow patterns should
accormodate the smooth operations of container off-loading from
road vehicles or railvway V;gona';i fork fitted lift truck. In
turn, containers would-be transferred to all terrain hslavem 
vehicles fitted with tipping equipment for carriage to the tipping
face and discharge. It is pwssible that in the future some direct
haul of vaste in collection vehicles may commence from nearby                    t
municipalities. However, for the purposes of this project task
this eventually does not need to be specifically addressed, but
sufficient flexibility in the conceptual layout should be included               E
to handle small quantities of directly-hauled vaste.
(iii)     Site Preparatory Works                                                  (
Preliminary estimates are required for each site to indicate
the locations and approximate volumes of earthworks, i.e. re-                    C
grading, stockpiling, drainage and similar operations.
In addition, the Consultant should provide a preliminary                    C
schedule of works for the development of the principal facilities
at Baseline Road and Padukka, as vell as indicating those
developments likely to be on the "critical path". 
The Consultant should also list the general design assumptions
and specificationa used, as vell as those that must be defined                   C
before future detailed site engineering can begin.
(iv) Derivation of Specific Costs 
Once the Consultant has completed the preliminary vorka set
out in Taska (i) to (iii), more reliable set of unit costs and                   C
quantities for the major engineering-related site developments can
be compilQd. In turn, the Consultant should uso thooe derived
values to prepare revised, representative estimates of the major                 C
engineering-related capital costs for the proposed transfer station
and landfill developments. 
(v) Operating Arrangements
The Consultant shall develop and propose alternative institutional                C
arrangements for regional management of vaste collection, transfer
and disposal (landfill), including possible private sector
participation.  The Consultant shall develop staffing and training               C
requirements.

SELECT70N AND ENVRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF SOLID WASTE
TRANSFER SUES IIV METROPOUTAN COLOMBO
BACKGROUND TO SCUD WASTE MANAGEMENT IN COLOMLO
Municipal solid waste in Colombo and collected by the Colombo Municipal
Council for final disposal at the Wecisara landfill site. Currently wastes are
delivcries to the sitc, where haulage distances are sufficiently short, by the
collection vehicle (tractor trailers, side loading trucks and compaction
vehicles). In addition, 550 Tonnes per day of waste arc transported in bulk
haulage by road to Welisara via the Baseline Road Transfer Station.
As part of the development of the solid waste management system in
metropolitan Colombo, the need has been identified to establish one (or
more) additional transfer stations to serve the southern part of the area
(exact catchment to be determined in this study).
2           SCOPE OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE
These terms of reference relate to the identification of potential locations for
transfer stations, their evaluation (in economic, socio-economic and
environmental terms) the selection of proposed site(s) and the execution of
site-specific investigation, preparation of conceptual designs, costs and
environmental impact assessment(s).
The required study comprises six main activities .
Activity 1: Initial site selection.
Activity 2: Review of socio-econornic setting and surrounding land use.
Activity 3: Comparative evaluation of road and rail transport
Activity 4: Geotechnical investigations at the selected site(s).
Activity 5: Conceptual site studies.
Activity 6: Environmental assessment of the transfer station site(s) and any
additional associated landfill site facilities, combining the results
of Activities 1 - 5.
The content of each activity is summarised below.

GEOTECH[NICAL SURVEYS
4.1          Purpose
The purpose of the required geological survey(s) is to determine the details
of the physical integrity of the proposed transfer station(s) site to establish
sufficient data to tacilitate conceptual engineerirng and foundation
characteristics.
4.2          Cencral Scope
Ground Soils Surve,
The consultant shall undertake a ground soils survey using shallow trial pits
(to a depth of up to 3m) to determine the general nature of the underlying
ground conditions across the site. This information will be used
subsequently, by Civil Engineers, to prepare waste management concept site
layout. The ground soils survey should include,but not be limited to, the
provision of data on :
* detailed logging of soils, geological layers and water strikes in each trial
pit;
* two partide size analyses in each trial pit,one at the ground surface and
one at approximately 2m depth;
* if liquids are present, basic chemnical analyses should be conducted on two
samples from each trial pit to determine pH, sulphate concentration,
conductivity and total organic carbon concentration. The analyses on each
sample should be completed within 24 hours of sampling;
_                        * at least 10 static load bearing tests at agreed locations across the site.
The consultant should liaise with GOSL, Geological Survey Department

ACTIVIT 5
CONCEPTUAL SITE STUDI1S
5.1          Purpose
The purpose of the conceptual engineering work is to prepare facility layouts
containing sufficient information to demonstrate the validity of the concept
proposal, and to permit more reliable cost estimates to be prepared for
financing
purposes.
5.2          Ccncral Scope of the Conceptual Site Studies
eD                    (i) Conceptual design layout:
As a first stage, the consultant should review the design of the Baseline Road
transport station and (for road transport) determine whether the concept is
appropriate for the site in question albeit for a different throughput. If so,
any amendments necessary should be incorporated to complete this sub task
Preliminary block diagram layout and engineering drawings shall be
prepared to illustrate the access, buildings, services and storage areas at the
Baseline Road transfer station. In addition, the sources of on-site cover
material, waste emplacement, phasing, drainage, gas and leachate
management and profiles should be provided in outline for Padukka.
The facilities depicted for the site should be consistent with the development
of a 2 storey waste transfer operation with top loading of demountable 20'
ISO containers receiving waste from a variety of refuse collecting vehicles.
The containers, once full, would be transferred by fork lift to a storage area
for transfer by road/rail to the Welisara landfill. No mechanical compaction
into containers is envisaged at the present time.
The consultant should liaise with the NBRO and review their recent reports
on waste management for Colombo.
(ii) Traffic Flow Patterns.
A wide variety of collection vehicles will bring solid waste for transfer. A
smooth one way traffic flow pattern, including the possible provision of
weighbridge and wheel washing facilities, should be suggested and depicted
on site plans. In addition, the on-site movements of fork-lift trucks and build
haulage by road or rail transport must be conveniently accommodated.
Details of minimum turning circles and similar necessary information will be
indicated by the Consultant in conjunction with the NBRO.
(iii) Site Preparatory Works:
Preliminary estimates are required for each site to indicate the locations and
approximate volumes of earthworks ie. regrading, stockpiling, drainage and
similar operations.



In addition, the Consultant should provide a prcliminary schedule of works      £
for the development of the principal facilities at the site(s), as well as
indicating those developments likely to be on the 'critical path".              £
The consultant should also list the general design assumptions and
specifications used, as well as those that must be defined before future        £
detailed site engineering can begin.
(iv)    Derivation of Specific Costs:                                           £
Once the Consultant has completed the preliminary works set out in Tasks 
(i) to (iii), more reliable set of unit costs and quandties for the major
engineering-related site developments can be compiled. In tum, the
Consultant should use these derived values to prepare revised, representative  C
estimates of the major engineering-related capital costs for the proposed
transfer station and landfill developments.                                     4
(v)    Operating Arrangements :                                                 4
The Consultant shall develop and propose alternative institutional
arrangements for regional management of waste collection, transfer and          4
disposal (landfill), including possible private sector participation. The
Consultant shall develop staffing and training requirements.                    4
5.3          PROJECT SCOPE:
The Consultant will:
* assess quantity, composition, nature and sources of the solid waste           4
generated. He will make the necessary visits to the industrial areas.
* outline options to handle the waste. He will be fully aware of laws to        6
protect the environment and existing Government laws regarding private
sector ownership and participation.                                           z
* ascertain the diversity of the waste and recommend a strategy for the
physical handling of it (eg. segregation, incineration, treatment, etc.).    6
* evaluate the options; recommend a strategy and the institutional              4
framework under which this strategy is to be implemented. He will
consider private sector participation and the incentives needed; he will
consider as well the methodology of disposal (eg. fully integrated
treatment centres) and methodology of contracting.
* prepare the TORs needed as a result of the implementation of the
strategy.                                                                    4

ACTIVITY 6
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
6.1         Purpose
The purpose of the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) is to ensure
that the proposed waste management developments under consideration at
Baseline Road and Padukka are the most satisfactory for the management of
waste and likely to cause the least potential effect upon the local
environment. In addition, the ElAs will identify the various environmental
and community consequences of the proposed development, in order to:
* ensure the resolution of potential environmental issues early in the
implementation of the proposed waste transfer and landfill disposal
facilities;
* avoid delays and extra costs which may subsequently arise due to
unanticipated environmental problems;
* demonstrate by providing a formal methodology that environmental
issues are being treated as a high priority in the development of a
comprehensive solid waste management system for the Colombo
Metropolitan Area; and
* ensure that the concerns of residents and communities are addressed and
plans are made for the resettlement of those residing in and around the
selected sites for development. The EIA must be prepared in accordance
with the World Bank guidelines and GOSL requirements.
The latter includes
(i)   National Environment Act No: 47 of 7980 as amended by Act No: 56 of !988;
and
(ii)  National Environment (Procedure for Approval of Projects) Regulations
No: I of 1993 as gazetted in the Gazette Extraordinary No: 7721= of
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka dated Thursday, June 24,
1993.
6.2         General Scope of the EIA
The EIA should be in strict compliance with GOSL: World Bank on EA's
(OD4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement and Community Consultation
(OD4.30) or revised directives. The EIA is required to cover the transfer
station site together with any associated changes in the reception
arrangements at the landfill. For example, if road transport is selected, there
will be fewer but larger vehicle movements at Welisara. If rail transport is
selected, the rail head reception facility will represent an additional source of
impacts.
The EIA Report shall follow the general structure specified below.



* Executive Surveyor
* Policy, Legal and Administrative framework
* Project Designer
* Baseline Data
* Environmental Impacts
* Project Altematives
* Mitigation & Monitory Plan
* Public & Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) Participation
* Environmental Management & Trauning.
The EIA prepared in 1994 by ERM for the Baseline Road transfer station may
be used as a model' for structure and content.
6.3          Specific Data Requir-ments
In order to produce the EIA report the following data requirements should
be included as part of the baseline environmental survey. Data maybe
collected from currendy available sources, or collected by the consultant in
the field, or derived by extrapolation from experience else vhere providing it
is based on the professional judgement and justification of the consultant.
The data requirements specified here should be regarded as the minimum to
be considered by the consultant for each site, i.e.:

The Resettlement Plan is prepared in accordance with the World Bank
Guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement as set out in Operational Directive
4.30: Involuntary Resettlement, 1990.
This report outlines a resettlement plan for up to 25 households displaced by
the Welisara Landfill Development. The process of resettlement will be
handled by a Resettlement Assistant who works to the District Secretary,
Wattala, who is responsible for all aspects of the resettlement process. A
package of benefits for households displaced by the project is outlined
including not just compensation for lost assets but also significant
resettlement allowances. It aLso outlines the role of the resettlement assistant
in facilitating the resettlement process and encouraging the active
participation of households who have to be relocated. An estimate of costs is
presented in Scction 10 and an outline schedule for resettlement is given in
Section 15.
2           BACKGROUTND
Welisara is situated in one of the most densely populated parts of Sri Lanka.
Population density in Gampaha District as a whole averages 1,000 persons
per square km whilst in the immediate vicinity the density is reportedly over
5,000 persons per square km. The population of this area is growing rapidly
and is expected to double in the decade 1991-2001. Much of this population
growth is the result of the rapid rise in land prices in metropolitan Colombo
over the last fifteen years. This has led to the development of both
.-                     residential and industrial areas along the main road linking Colombo with
the airport and Free Trade Zone at Katunayake. It appears that the majority
of the population in Welisara are relatively recent immigrants from other
areas of Sri Lanka. Whereas 20 to 25 years ago there was still a major
agricultural sector in Welisara, today agriculture is of minor importance.
Land previously under coconut palms is today the site of housing
developments, factories and container yards.
The area affected by the project forms a microcosm of the area as a whole.
What was two or three decades ago an area of long established small
communities engaged in agriculture has now become an area of dense
population in which most people are dependent on wages and saLaries for
their income. Whilst there are some local industries, for instance the miLlk
factory and the plastic factory, the majority of the working population
I                        conmrnute to jobs in Colombo, Katunayake and other centres of employment
in the vicinity. Agriculture is now of minor importance. Although the
Galudupita marsh was used for paddy in the past, problems with drainage
have led to paddy cultivation being abandoned. On the higher land coconut

palms and tree crops such as mangos are still grown, but these are gencrally
marginal to household incomes.
A number of residential zones can be identifed in the immediate vicinity of    (
the site.
,Zone 1: To the west of the marsh and running as far as the main Colombo-      I
Negombo road is a dense area of mainly middle class housing. Here what
were once coconut estates have been sold and split into small blocs for        (
residential use. The majority of the population in this area are relative
newcomers to the district. It is difficult to estimate population figures but
there are probably over 1,000 households in this area.
Zonc 2: To the north of the marsh occupying a narrow strip of land between      (
the marsh and the naval base is a row of around 80 houses. These arc
generally of lower quality than those in zone 1 and most appear to have
been constructed over the last ten years. Most of the occupants are             I
immigrants from outside the immediate vicinity of the site. This area
includes an island known as Duva which is occupied by one household.            (
Zotne 3: Immediately to the west of the marsh and occupying one of the
islands in the marsh (Illukgoda) is one of the older communities in the area.   (
Once dependent on paddy cultivation, most pcople now depend on wages
and salaries.                                                                   (
Zotte 4: By the railway line which forms the eastem boundary of the site are
recent immigrants to the area occupying an island known as Navamahara.          {
This is the poorest residential zone. Houses are built of timber and cadjan
and their occupants depend in the main on casual labour supplemented by
fishing and other minor activities in the marsh.
Zone 5: To the south of the site is a mixed residential area, mainly consisting
of middle and lower-middle class housing.
These zones are shown in Figure Cl, in the context of the proposed phased       i
development of the landfill sites. Except for zone 2 and 4, electricity is
widely available, the local authority having instaled it over the last few      (
years. Throughout the area households presently depend on weLI water and
most houses have their own wells.
Although important as a source of income in the past, the marsh is now
economicaUy relatively unimportant. There is some small-scale fishing           (
mainly for domestic consumption, and some vegetables are collected,
particularly kankun. Cattle and buffalo are grazed within the marsh. For
most households these activities are marginal sources of income, but for the    (
poorest, particularly those in zone 4, such sources of food are important
during periods of unemployment.                                                 (

Onc of the results of the changing demographic structure of the area around
the marsh has been a shift in its religioLs composition. Traditionally, this
has been a predominantly Catholic area. However, many of the recent
immigrants are Buddhist. Zone 2 is predominantly Buddhist, while in zones
I and 5 Buddhists probably outnumber Catholics. There are at least three
small Buddhist temples in the vicinity of the marsh.
*          3            ATTI77 DES TOWARDS THE PROJECT
In the vicinity of the site there is general antipathy towards the project
amongst those who will need to be relocated and those who will rcmain in
the arca. This antipathy centres around a number of themes.
]  The general environmental impact on the arca, These include the
possibility of bad odour from the site, unsightliness of the wastc to be
_I                        landfilled there, noise from increased transport, loss of well water and
dangers of flooding.
1                       * A potential drop in land values. It is felt that the proximity of an area of
solid waste will depress land and property values in the adjacent area and
3                         thus lead to a general depreciation in asset values.
• Negativc social impacts. There is a fear that the establishment of the
landfill site will attract groups of scavengers to the area and the possible
establishment of shanty settlements. Also Lherc is some fear that a group
of noisy and potentially undesirable boutiques will grow up around the
entrance to the landfill site and function throughout the night.
]                      The initial public reaction was based on a misconception of the nature of a
properly managed sanitary landfill and a lack of appreciation of the plans for
other forms of community upgrading. Following meetings at which the
proposals have been explained, some of the existing residents of the ar-a
now understand the nature of the planned operatiorns. However, there is
little faith in the ability of the authorities to control potential negative
impacts. An outline of how these problems may be addressed is givcrn in the
]                      main report. In so far as resettlement may take place within the environs of
the project, these worries are shared by those households which will have to
be resettled, but these fanilies are generally preoccupied by strong feelings
about resettlement.
]                      Amongst all those households liable for resettlement there is a general
feeling that they are having to bear the costs for benefits which will accrue
to others, most notably the rubbish producers of Colombo. Put crudely,
I                      their argument is that Colombo should deal with its own rubbish. Many
have invested heavily in their property over the last few years and are
unwilling to give up what they see as a salubrious and relatively quiet mode
of life in what is otherwise an extremely crowded part of Sri Lanka. There is
also a sense of powerlessness in that they see no way in which they can
1



effectively opposc the decLsion to go ahead with the project Finally, few       C
believe that they will bc adequately compensated for their loss of assets, loss
of what they see as a congenial place to livc, and the disruption to their lives  C
which the project will involvc.
Amongst those who havc lived in the area all their lives, suci as many of
the inhabitants of Mllukgoda, there is a furLlier sense of loss in that this is
their ancestral land.                                                           C
In order to address such concerns, it is necessary that the resettlement
package finally ncgotiated with those households which have to be moved is
more than that prescribed as the legal minimum (see Section 10 below). The
proposals which follow outline a proposed resettlement package. An              C
estimate of potential costs is given in Section 10 and the outline schedule for
the resettlement process is given in Sectio 15.
4            GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA
The guiding principles and criteria which should be adhered to are set out
below.
* None of the families to be resettled will be rendered economically worse
off by their relocation (cash compensation alone is not usually sufficient
to create a well integrated resettled comrnmunity).
* Alternative resettlemcnt sites will be identified on the hillsides
surrounding the Caludupita Marsh site at Welisara, with the aim of            C
minimising physical and social disruption to the resettled families.
* Resettled families will be provided with housing of at least equal quality    (
to that from which they have been resettled. Infrastructure andl services
(electr.city, improved water supply and sanitation, improved accesa to
schools, transport and medical facilities) should be of at least equal quality  v
to those available in their original location.
Those households which currently derive a significant proportion of their     £
income from exploitation of marsh resources, should be offered the option
of relocation to other nearby marsh land (for example, to the east of the    C
railway tracks).
|  The farnilies to be resettled, together with families within the host
communities, will benefit from the provisions of the Community
Development Plan, as well as plans for landscaping and restoration of the    C
zlandfill site.
* The details of the resettlement plan, and the Commurity Development           C
]                           Plan, will be developed over time in full consultation with the local         C

j                          population, through the strengthening of Community Based
Organisations (CBOs).
I                       * The resettlement of the 25 families will not bring about any degradation
to the social or environmental well-being of the host communities.
I          5            ORGANISA77ONAL RESPONSIBIUITES
JI                      The project as a whole will be implemented by the Western Provincial
Council (WPC) acting under the Ministry of Home Affairs and Provincial
I                      Councils (MHA&PC). Responsibility for the acquisition of lands and the
resettlement of the households involved les with the Divisional Secretary
(DS) based at Wattala. He acts as the Acquiring Officer (AO) on behalf of
the Minister of Lands in the acquisition of lands within the site and is also
responsible for obtaining alternative lands for those displaced by the project.
3                      In this he is assisted by the Land Officer stationed at the Divisional
Secretariat. All matters concemed with valuation and the payment of
]                      compensation pertain to the DS.
Given the small number o' households involved it is unnecessary to create a
i                     special unit to deal with resettlement. However, given the many other roles
of the DS, it will be necessary to appoint a resettlement assistant (RA) to
the DS immediately. The role of the RA will be to expedite all matters
concerned with resettlement. An outline workprogramme for the RA is
shown in Figure C2.
6           COMMUNATY PAR7TCIPATION AND IVTEGRATION WITH HOST
COMMUN1TIES
One of the roles of the RA will be to ensure that those who will be resettled
are fully informed and consulted during the resettlement process. There
have already been two public meetings aimed at the wider community which
were intended to introduce the overall project concept and to answer
I                      questions and allay fears about the envirorunental impact of the landfill
design. Since preparation of the draft EIA (March 1994), a third meeting has
I:                     been held, (9 April 1994) aimed specifically at the families to be resettled.
This meeting was generally reported to have gone well, with a considerable
degree of acceptance being achieved amongst residents of the two smaller
islands, following full explanation of the potential resettlement and
community development packages. The residents of the largest island,
lllukgoda apparently still prefer to remain in situ during the early stages of
landfill construction, and wish to defer a discussion about relocation until
the impacts associated with their proximity to the landfill site become fully

apparent. This approach has several operational and logistical disadvantages,
and is discusscd further in Section 15 below, There remains a need for
further consultation and negotiation with the people of Mllukgoda on this
subject, and with all the families to be resettled who will all need to be
informed and advised on a separate and regular basis.
At present, the process of identifying sites for relocation is in its early stages
(see section 9). The RA will be involved in identifying these sites and
discussing with the resettlers where they wish to be resettled.
Whether or not people wish to be resettled in groups is unclear. It is likely
that some households will prefer to relocate on sites of their own choice, for
instance on land they own elsewhere or on land bought privately. The RA
will discuss such issues with displaced households on an individual and
group basis and facilitate their decisions through these discussions.
7            SOCIOECONOMIC SURVEY
At the time of writing, it had not been possible to carry out a detailed
socioeconomnic survey of the island communities due to strong localised
feelings against the project, especially on the large island of Illukgoda. In
large measure this is a result of a lack of understanding of how generous the
relocation package will be and the difference between an open dump and a
sanitary landfill, which is virtually unknown in Colombo. Before any future
attempt is made to carry out such a survey the RA will have to ensure that
there is an effective information campaign to explain the nature of the
resettlement package. Whilst relocation may never be popular with those
who are being resettled, particularly those living in lMlukgoda, relocation will
be attainable if a sufficiently generous level of compensation is offered.
In summary, the 25 households to be resettled live on three smaHl islands
located within the Caludupita marsh (Welisara site) on land which ic
I                      privately owned. Most of these families derive their income from
employment outside the marsh area. Only a few families derive significant
proportion of their income from exploitation of the marsh resources in the
form of cattle grazing, fishing and a variety of cottage industries including
basket making from reeds and grasses and the collection of wild vegetables
(kankun).
8            LEGAL FRAMEWORK
E                      The legal framework for land acquisition and compensation for loss of assets
is laid down in the Land Acquisition Act of 1950 and the amendments of
1983 and 1986.
ENVUO..AQMA Rzsoucu M"wm                            covu,sir or Su LAA (GoSL)

Although the WPC wiU be the project implementing agency, land is a        C
reserved function of central government. Thus the WPC will have to
formally approach the MHA&PC which will then request the Ministry of      C
Lands to issue a notice that the land is required for a public purpose. This
will be done by the DS acting as the MOL's acquiring officer (AO). In July
1993 a Section 2 notice was served on an area which included the project site  C
on behalf of the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.
(However, with a change in land use it may be necessary to issue a new    C
Section 2 notice).
Once the notice has been issued and publisi9ed through public notices, the  C
Government Gazette and newspapers, objections can be raised to the
acquisition during a period of not less than 14 days. This period has now  4
passed with respect of the Welisara site. These objections have to be made
to the relevant ministry, in this case the MHAPC. The decision whether or  _
not to accept the objections is taken by the relevant minister.           4
The next stage (which has not yet taken place at Welisara) is for the
acquiring officer to request the Survey Department to carry out a detailed
survey of the land. This includes such matters as the boundaries between
crown and private land, the borders of individual plots of land and the    C
names of claimants when known. The result is an acquisition plan which is
sent to the AC. The AO then publishes a notice of acquisition which is also  4
exhibited by the village headman (Grama Niladharis), and sent to known
individual claimants. All claimants have at least 14 days in which to register
their claim and to make their own assessment of the value of the land.
These claims are then sent to the Valuation Department.
During this period, the Valuation Department is also determining its own
valuation of land to be acquired. The details of this process are gi, en in
section 45 of the act and in general are determined by present market values  i
*in the area in question. Various sorts of information are used in this
process, not just the prices which appear in transfer deeds but also those  4
paid by commercial companies and those set in auctions.
Once this process is complete, the AO holds an inquiry into claims for    I
compensation. This is concerned with both title to land and levels of
compensation. Where there are disagreements over title the AO's decision
can be appealed to the District Court and the Court of Appeal. Where there
are disagreements over the valuation and compensation payable, the plaintiff
can appeal to the Board of Review from which there can be no appeal except  4
over points of law. The same general process is followed for other assets, for
instance houses and trees.                                                 4
The procedure can take an extremely long time, depending on the number of
appeals that are made and the complications of the cases involved, for
instance large numbers of shareholders in undivided plots of land. Twelve
to eighteen months is not unusual. However, there is a shortened process of
land and property acquisition possible under section 38A of the Act. This in  _
effect allows the Government to acquire land before title and value have
been ascertained. There is, however, a general feeling that such a process  4
-.9



contravenes the rights of landholders and thus can only be used in very
particular circumstances.
Within the legal framework, all that is required in cases of land acquisition
by Govermment is that compensation be paid. There is no necessity that part
of this compcnsation should take the form of land. However, it is widely
accepted by GOSL that where it is possible, land should be offered as part of
a compensation package.
The process described above is also required where the state is obtaining
land from private owners on which to resettle displaced persons, unless of
course the land is being purchased from a voluntary seller. Where state land
is used for resettlement, for instance land held by various ministries, the
Land Commission is responsible for the alienation of the land to the
allottees. Where the land is controlled by the Land Rcform Commission then
the Land Commission does not need to be involved.
These procedures for land acquisition refer to freehold land or more
generally to land where there is title. In terms of the Land Acquisition Act
squatters are not entitled to compensation, although squatters who have
improved land are entitled to compensation for the improvements, and they
are also entitled to compensation for property such as houses etc. Similarly
monthly tenants are excluded from the compensation process as outlined in
the Act although lessees are entitled to compensation.
In practice, however, GOSL policy over relocation of squatters and tenants is
to treat them broadly in the same way as freeholders. Such compensation is,
however, ex gratia and not legally required. Although the Valuation
Department may informally advise on the scale of compensation it cannot
make official recommendations.
L                      -lTo sum up, there is a clear legal framework covering the acquisition of land
by the state. There is a firm set of processes in place to arrive at estimates of
levels of compensation, and there are appeals procedures in cases which
cannot be ag-reed. However, the process can be slow and procedures which
speed up thr process of acquisition do so at the cost of limiting the rights of
those who are involuntarily moved. Although legally only those with clear
X                       title are entitled to compensation, in practice others do receive compensation.
The RA will ensure that all households subject to relocation are fully aware
of their legal rights. The RA will also explain in detail the process of
valuation as there are a number of misconceptions current as to how values
are arrived at. Where necessary the RA will assist in negotiations between
the relocated households and the AO and ensure that the acquisition and
1                      compensation process is expedited in a timely fashion. Given that no more
than 25 families are to be resettled, it is not anticipated that longer than the
typical 1218 months will be required.

g           AL:TRNATIVE SITES AND SELEC7iON
Precise sites which will be offered to the displaced household have yet to be
identified. This area of Sri Lanka is very densely populated and land is
scarce. But the households involved in relocation are not dependent on
farming and thus the primary need is for residential space, which is available
in the area.
So far, three potential sites have been identified by the DS. The first of these
consists of coconut land held by the Land Reform Commission. The second
is a Government farm. Both of thesc sites are within two km of the project
site and there will be no problems with acquisition. However, in both sites
infrastructure, notably roads, water supply and electricity, will have to be  4
installed prior to resettlement. The third option is to purchase private lands
which are available within three km of the project site. If bought through
the market rather than through compulsory purchase the transfer of private
lands can be completed quickly.
The institutions involved in resettlement aim to give the displaced families a
choice as to which lands (if any) they wish to receive in compensation for
land lost to the project. A role of the RA will be to facilitate this consultation
process and to ensure that resettled households are aware of their options.
10          VALUATION OF AND COMPENSATION FOR LOST ASSETS                               C
The legal framework for valuation and compensation for lost assets is
discussed above in Section 8. Those households which are eligible for
resettlement and compensation have already been identified and there are no
cases where households will become economically non-viable but will not
receive compensation. An influx of non-residents attempting to take        (
advantage of the compensation arrangements will not be accepted since all
eligible households (see Figure C1) have already been identified.
During the acquisition process, one of the tasks of the RA will be to ensure
that the interests of both men and women in the resettled households are
recognised and represented in the resettlement process. Thus at all points in
the consultation process the RA will enure that women are aware of the
various options and that they concur with the decisions which are made.     t
The RA will also ensure that the poorest and most marginal households
involved in resettlement are also fully involved in the process. The RA will
ensure that in the case of households which do not have title to land their
usufruct rights are fully recognised and that they receive full compensation  (
for their losses.

Bcsides the legal minimum compensatory arrangements outlined in Section 8,
further compcnsation should bc made available to ensure the speedy
cxpedition of the process of resettlement, to compensate for the disruption
._                         caused by resettlement and to minimise the sense of loss which will be
experienced by those resettled. These measures may include the following,
* A new residential site in addition to compensation for land lost to the
project. Where households do not wish to be awarded a new piece of
land they should be offered cash equivalent in value to that of the offered
land.
* A disruption allowance paid to all households to compernsate for the time
and negative experiences of being resettled.
* Low interest housing loans through the National Housing Development
Authority to assist in the construction of new houses.
* The supply of seedlings etc for the establishment of home gardens in the
new residential sites.
* The offer of training facilities to those who require it (see Section 72).
* Free transport to the site of relocation for the transfer of property
including any building materials from the acquired house which
households wish to take with them.
Estimates of the costs involved in all of thesc measures are given in Table Cl.
A major task of the RA will be to facilitate negotiations, on behalf of COSL,
over these benefits and to ensure that these are acceptable to the resettled
households. In this context the RA must take full cognisance of the interests
of women. It is understood that resettled households are eligible for twelve
months food aid from the World Food Programme. If so, the RA should
I                       ensure that this aid is obtained.
The three largest variables, and the three greatest uncertainties, in the cost
rF'                       estimates at this stage are:
* the value of the land currently occupied by the families to be resettled.
* the value of the properties currently occupied by the families to be
I?                           resettled.
* the location and therefore the value/purchase cost of the land to be
provided to the resettled families.
The first and second of these variables have been estimated based on
discussions with the Divisional Secretary, Wattala. These land and property
prices are thought to be higher than might be otherwise expected, due to the
popularity of the land in this area, which is convenient for Colombo yet in a
relatively peaceful, nudxed rural/residential setting.
For the same reasons, the provision of alternative land in the area around
the marsh is also likely to be relatively expensive, particularly land within
easy reach of the main road. At the time of writing no decision had been
reached as to which land would be allocated to the resettled families, and it

* :
has not therefore been possible to put cxact costs on land to be provided for
this purpose.
Once GOSL endorsement of the outline resettlement plan is obtained, and
land has been allocated for thc families to be resettled, it will be possible to
begin to attach exact costs to these and other items through a process of
negotiation with the families concemed and the current owners of land to be
purchased for resettlement purposes.
LAND TEZ  ACQUISl7ON AND TRANSFER
These topics have been covered in Section 8. It should be stressed that even
though some houscholds do not have legal rights to land they will be
compensated as if they did have legal ownership. This will imply a major
improvement in the control of assets to the poorest households involved in
the resettlement.
12          ACCESS TO TRAViNIG, EMPLOYMEIT AND CREDIT
Given the small number of households involved, their dependence on waged
and salaried employment, and the short distances which are envisaged in the
relocation process, there should be relatively little disruption to the economic
life of most households. However, amongst the poorest households for
whom informal activities such as fishing and vegetable collecting in the
marsh are important, there may be a greater negative impact. Thus members
of relocated households should be offered the opportunity of vocational
training. This will be organised by the RA.
13          SHELTEP, iNFRASTRUCTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Once sites for resettlement have been agreed with the relocated households,
it will be ensured that basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity and piped
water supply are in place. As it is planned to offer households alternative
sites within the immediate vicinity, social services such as hospitals, other
health care facilities, schools, churches and temples are already available.
Resettled households should be allowed to decide for themselves the types of
houses they wish to construct once resettled and if they so wish engage
their own contractors. A reasonable period of time should be allowed
between the completion of negotiations over the scale of compensation,
choice of relocation sites and payment of compensation on the one hand,

-            14           ENVRONMEIAL PROTEC77ON AND MANAGEMENT
Given the nature of the relocation process, no environmental pollution or
management problems resulting from resettlement are envisaged. The
number of households is small and resettlement will only have a marginal
impact on the environment of the area. As has already been mentioned,
trees will be offered to relocated households which can be used to create
home gardens. Here, the RA will approach the Participatory Forestry Project
-w                       of the Forest Department for assistance. This project is already involved in
encouraging tree planting in home gardens.
_'      : t15            IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONTRING AND EVALLUTION
_ i                      Given that there is no agreed start date for the project, an indicative
schedule only can be provided at present. The overall timetable for
resettlement is shown in Figure CS and assurnes an expedited schedule of 12
months. 'Day zero" is defined as the effective date of the proposed Project,
and all subsequent timings then relate to this reference start date. As
explained in Section 8 there are two main points at which a delay to
implementation could occur. The first is in the acquisition of land and
agreement of compensation for land. The second is the process of
_                        negotiation with households to be relocated over the total package of
_                        compensation being offered. The RA will be responsible for ensuring that
once the project is approved by the World Bank and the GOSL, and a target
start date for construction has been set, that this schedule is presented to the
families to be resettled so that negotiations can be completed on this basis.
At that stage the detailed timing for preparation of relocation sites, services
_I                       and housing construction can be planned to dovetail with the design,
construct operate schedule set by the landfill contractors and the GOSL.
As already mentioned in Section 6 above the families of the island of
Illukgoda are reluctant to discuss relocation until construction of the third
X                      phase of the landfill becomes necessary. Although it is not essential that all
households living in the project area should leave before construction of
Phase I comnmences, it is preferable that all resettlement takes place at the
beginning of the project for the following three reasons.
EN1RO"AWTAL Rumam Mm"cuaw        C.15



* This approach will ensure the presence of the RA to facilitate matters.
* Early rclocation will ensure that all negotiations are completed and do not  C
delay the projcct at a later date.
* The island of Mlukgoda represents the major source of clay for site
dcvelopment, and if this cannot bc utilised until the final phase of the
landfill development, an alternative source of clay will need to be       C
identified and broug'tt into the site by truck There are potentially
significant environmental impacts associated with sourcing and             C
transporting clay under this scenario.
Monitoring of the process of resettlement should be handled by the general   C
project administration. Given the numbers of households involved any
complex monitoring system is unnecessary. However, if early resettlement of  4
all 25 families takes place, it will be necessary to ensure that the land that
has not yet been taken up for landfill development, remains unoccupied.
Plased Resettlement
If opposition to early resettlement by the residents of the island of Illukgoda
is sufficiently strong it would technically bc possiblc to delay the
resettlement of these families until such time as a start date for Phase 3 of  C
the landfill development becomes clear. This is estimated to be 10 to 15 years
from the commencement of construction work at the site. However, the         (
compensation package would be fixed during the first phase of landfill
development(years I to 5) and firm commitment to resettle would also need
to be given at this time, even if actual relocation was to occur later in the
development programme. An indefinite period of "Wait and see" is not
feasible.                                                                    4
Figure Cl shows the location of the three small marsh island communities to
be resettled in relation to the proposed phasing of the landfill development. 
It follows that the exact dates for the resettlement of each community would
depend upon the rate of landfill development, which in turn depends upon (
the actual rate of waste generation. However, in general terms, it can be
seen front Figure Cl that the northernmost island comrnunity (Navamahara),
comprising 8 households will need to be resettled as planned by Year 1 when 4
site preparation and drainage works begin on Phase I of landfill
development. The second marsh island to be affected (Duva) comprises only
1 household, which if not resettled along with Navamahara, will need to be
resettled in Year 4 or at the beginning of Phase II of landfill development
(whichever is the later). The third, and largest, of the island communities  4
(Ilukgoda) comprises 16 households, but will not need to be relocated until

1IUBLZC C)NSULTATION
Z.l          RECORD OF PULIUC FORUM MEETINGS HELD TO DAMT
Author. Sumith Pilapitiya - National Progranune Coordinator (MELP)
The public wete consulted during the process to identify a suitable site for a
long ternm sanitary landfill for the Colombo Urban Area (CUA). This was the
first attempt in Sri Lankn at consultations with the public prior to selection
of a landfill site. Two public meetings were held under the chairmanship of
the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Home Affairs
(MWPC&HA) on December 12, 1993 and December 22, 1993 at the Office of
the Divisional Secretary in Wattala, to discuss the use of the Galudupita
Road Marsh in Welisara as a potential site for a sanitary landfill. Letters of
invitation for the two meetings were hand delivered to the residents in the
immediate vicinity of the potential site in Welisara, by the Divisional
Secretariat in Wattala. In addition, public notices were put up in the
Welisara area announcing the two meetings.
1.1.1       First Public Meeting: 12 December 1993
The first meeting was attended by residents of the immediate surroundings
of the site as weU as representatives from the conmmercial establishments and
warehouses situated along the approach road to the site. The GOSL was
represented by officials from the M/PC&HA, the Ministry of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resousrces, the Sri Lanka Land Redamation and Development
Corporation, the Divisional Secretariat of Wattala and the MEIP. Prior to the
commencement of the meeting, the public was very concerned with the
possibility that the site at Welisara would be used for the disposal of garbage.
Sri Lanka does not yet have a properly engineered sanitary landfill for waste
disposal, so the public are unable to distinguish between a sanitary landfill
and an open dump as is the common practice in the country.
The Secretary to the MWPC&HA commenced the meeting with a detailed
explanation of the proposed project. He outlined the serious problems
experienced by the GOSL in the area of solid waste management, the lack of
disposal space and the necessity for identifying suitable land for a long term
sanitary landfill. The site selection process was explained to the participants.
The benefits to society at large of a sanitary landfill was explained with due
consideration given to the adverse environmental conditions that could be
experienced by the community in the immediate vicinity of the site.
Sensitive issues such as possible re-settlement were discussed in depth. In
thediscussion that ensued, it was apparent that the participants could not
distinguish the difference between a sanitary landfill and an open dump.
The National Program Co-ordinator of MEIP was called upon to explain the
principles behind the design of a sanitary landfill and the precautions that
would be taken to minimize adverse environmental effects due to the project.

There was a prolonged discussion, where the participants were able to       C
express their concerns with regard to the project. Some of the major
concerns expressed were:                                                    C
the possibility of re-location;
* adequate compensation for land currently under private ownership;         c
* the adverse effects of having a landfill in the vicinity; and
* possible end use of this after the landfill has reached capacity.         c
It was explained to the people that site would be suitable for agricultural
purposes or for recreational use once the landfill was closed. The people    C
were made aware of the fact that this particular site had been served a
Section 2 Notice under the Land Acquisitions Act in July 1993 and the site
was no longer available for private development. The representatives of the
GOSL addressed the concerns raised by the public during the discussions
with no issue left unanswered. The meeting was concluded with a date set
for another public meeting on December 22, 1993 in the hope of reaching a
larger audience than present at this meeting. The consensus emerging from
this meeting was the public was concemed about the possibility of a solid
waste disposal site in their neighbourhood, however, they realised the
urgency of the GOSL to develop an environmentally acceptable solution the
problem. Once they realised that the landfill will be based on sound
scientific and engineering principles and not the usual open dump commonly
visible, they were more ammenable to accept the landfill tlhan before the
meeting.
1.1.2       Second Public Meeting: 22 Deccmber 1993
The second public meeting was also held at the Office of the Divisional
Secretary in Wattala. The location of the meeting was only a few kilometers
away from the potential site. This meeting was also chaired bv the Secretary
to the M/PC&HA. The GOSL representatives were the same as Meeting No 1
with the addition of the Chairman of the Central Environmental Authority.
The public were predominanatly people in the Welisara area but largely not     w
from the immediate vicinity of the site. There were very few representaives
from the commercial establishments and warehouses in the area present The
Secretary M/PC&lHA made a presentation similar to the previous meeting
covering all issues relating to the proposed project. A lengthy discussion     _
ensued with the participants expressing basically the same concerns with the  l
addition of concerns with regard to the potential for ground water
contamination and site management. It was explained that the precautions
for ground water contamination would be taken during the design of the
landfill and such issues will be addressed in the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). The public seemed to be convinced that the landfill would
be designed in such a manner that would minimize potential adverse
environmental impacts, however, they had serious concerns on the
management of the site. They wanted some assurance that the site would
be managed properly and strict enforcement of the environmental standards
would be ensured.

_                       An issue thdt was ralsed several times at both mectings was the necessity to
use this site when there were several thousands of acres of uninhabited land
_                       in Muthurajawela, a few kilometers west of this site, The participants did not
appear to understand the significance of preserving Muthurajawela due to it
being an ecologicaly diverse wetland, currently designated as conservation
area. A major factor that led to their opposition to tht use of the Galudupita
Road site in Welisara as a landfill site was the availability of uninhabited
land in Muthurajawela. Many unsuccessful attempts were madc to explain
the significance of preservation of ecologically sensitive areas such as
Muthurajawela. After much discussion the meeting was concluded with the
public unanimously opposing the development of the site in Welisara as a
sanitary landfill site when sufficient land was available in the Muthurajawela
_  ]                    Marsh for disposal of garbage in the Colombo Urban Area.
1.2         ONGOING PUBUC CONSULTATION PLANS
Further public consultations will be held as and when necessary as the
project progresses.

Author Ravi Pereira - Senior Environmental Specialist (MEEP)
2.1         INTRODUCTION
The general public, despite their enviably high literacy rate, is woefully
under-informed of even the basic issues and consequences of enviroranental
degradation and as a result of this ignorance is a significant contributor to
the existing problem. In addition, there is a tendency towards negatively
prejudging and intractably opposing technologies such as sanitary landfilUing,
out of hand, without having actually understood what it is, much less
weighing its pros and cons impartially.
A public awareness programnme, aimed at both raising collective
environmental conciousness and creating a sensitivity towards the specific
issues that need to be addressed, is therefore of crucial importance to the
overall success of potentially unpopular public works such as a solid waste
disposaVlandfill site despite the proposed use of mitigatory measures for
_                      anticipated environmental damage.
_                      The important issues must be skillfully put across in the most palatable
manner through a variety of ways so that the basic concepts become
virtually ingrained. The high literacy of the public would definitely be an
_                      advantage here provided the will also exists. With children the problem is
_                      somewhat simpler as they have fewer preconceived and set ideas unlike
_                      adults who often must overcome hanging onto lifelong misconceptions and

3            TrZAL ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SITUATION
3.1         INTRODUC7ION
This Section describes the assessment made by the Project Management
Team in relation to the various Activities covered by the Project following
their initial visit. The various sections refer to the study Activities as
follows:
* Sections 3.2 and 3.3 -    Activity I
* Section 3.4      -    Activitics 2 & 3
* Section 3.5      -    Activity 5
* Section 3.6      -    Activity 6
3.2         CONTRACTS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR
3.2.1       General Contract Forms
The TOR requires ERM, under Activity I to prepare model contracts for
various waste management services to be determined during the course of
the study. As a precursor to this, we have carried out a preliminary
assessment of contract types and procedures which are already in general
use in Sri Lanka, on which we aim to base our own model forms.
The Government of Sri Lanka has well established contract procedures, and
the Consultants and Contractors working in the country are already very
familiar with these procedures and the more common international model
forms of contract are in everyday use. These include the forms issued by the
Institution of Civil Engineers in the UK and the International Federation
Internationale Des lngenieurs Conseils (FIDIC). These typically relate to
works of civil engineering construction on lump sum and measurement
methods of payment.
There is also some local experience in the use of the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers (I Mech E) Model Forms for mechanical and electrical
engineering projects. The newly introduced New Engineering Contract
(NEC) of the Institution of Civil Engineers which can be used on
management, cost reimbursable and target cost contracts is being discussed
and debated at seminars in the country.
Some of the international model forms have been adapted to suit local
conditions and an example of this is the Institute of Construction Training
and Development (ICTAD). This model form is required to be used on all
central government financed projects andi contains features of the FIDIC and
ICE model forms. In addition the Government has issued guidelines for
implementing Build, Own and Operate (BOO) and Build Operate and
Transfer (BOT) contracts for infrastructure development and investment

Specific Model Forms                                                          C
It is against this background of knowledge and the procedures of the World    c
Bank that ERM will develop the model forms of contract on this project.
Almost all the model forms currently in use in Sri Lanka relate to
construction contracts. Where more specialized forms have been required
such as design and construct, design construct and operate, design construct,
operate and finance and franchise arrangements these have usually been
adaptations of the more common construct only model forms. However            l
some specalist forms of contract for the private competitive tender of
municipal services such as waste collection, disposal, vehicle maintenance,
ground maintenance and catering have been developed as these services          4
have been exposed to competition throughout the developed world.
In the United Kingdom, as an example, where the Local Government Act           C
1988 set in place a comprehensive programme of compulsory competitive
tendering for a range of services, particular model forms of contract were     4
developed by the Municipality and local government associations such as the
Association of County Councils, Association of District Councils and the       4
Association of Metropolitan Authorities. The UK Government issued
regulations under the Act on how competitive tendering was to be managed
and tenders analysed and assessed. The Audit Commission in the UK issued       4
Codes of Practice and guidelines on tender analyses and reported on the
general progress in the country. Several thousand tenders have been issued
and contracts awarded under these arrangements and the private sector has
secured about 25-30% of the market. ERM will bring the best of this
contractual experience to bear in its work.
3.3          CURRENT MUNICIPAL WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
During our initial visit we held a number of meetings with Colombo
Municipal Council officials and undertook a tour of the municipal area to
view various aspects of the existing waste management operation. This
included viewing waste collection points in different income areas, cleansing
depots and the existing landfill at Wellampitiya.
The system presently adopted by Colombo Municipal Council and, as far as
can be determined at this early stage, the other local authorities in the
Colombo Metropolitan Area, comprises a two stage collection system
followed by direct disposal to landfill or open dump.
3.3.1        Collection
The collection system generally has two stages:
* Primary collection; and
* Secondary collection.

At some of the larger collection points, 5 cu. m skips have been supplied.
These require an altemative type of vehickc to allow transport to the landfill,  (
The containers generally provide adequate and tidy storage of the waste
prior to collection for disposal, although they are unlidded and the contents  El
are therefore open to insects, birds and other vermin. Also, it was seen that
frequently other types of waste, generally building rubble, is illegally dumped  4
close to the containers, which, together with overspill from the containers
themselves, can give many of the collection points an unsightly appearance.
However, tile containers do appear to offer adequate storage and their        t
contents can be efficiently loaded by automatic means into the secondary
collection vehicles.                                                          (
In most low and some middle income areas in the CMC area, the other main
type of collection point provided consists of a three sided concrete bunker.  (
From thesc, wastes have to be hand-loaded into the secondary collection
vehicle. These collection points can be fairly unsightly, are open to foraging  I
animals and again attract the illegal dumping of other wastes. Such a
colection point is shown in Figure 3.3b.                                      C
Outside of the CMC area, waste collection points generally appear to be Little
more than open patches of ground on which the waste is dumped. Some of        (
these areas were observed to be on fire and cows, chickens and small herds
of pigs and goats seen feeding on the wastes is commonplace. Again, the
wastes require to be hand-loaded onto secondary transport. Figurc 3.3c        (
indicates such a collection point.

It apitars that the tnibmer of waste collcclion points made available In an
area is dc:crmined  hy a comibination  of demand  for thc facility, in terms of
waste generved, coupled with thc availability of suitable sites. In Colombo,            I
many collecion points, particularly  in higher Incomc arcas, consist of just
onc container.  Elscwhcrc, as many as six containcrs arc locatcd together to             4
serve a much large' arca. signifying that otlicr suitablc sitcs in thc local arc
not availabic.
Secondary Collection
The aim of the secondary  collection system  is to removc the wasic from the
disposal poins and transport it to thc disposal sitc. This is undertaken  using
a variety of vehicles ranging  from 7 or 10 cu nm rear cnd loading refusc                I
compaction  vehiclcs to side loaders and tractors and trailers. Where
containcrs arc used, thcsc arc liftcd automatically  and discharged  into thlc
collcction vehicle. Normiially, somc manual clearing is nccessary  to remove
any ovcrspill and garden wastes which could not lit imto thc containers.
Wlicrc the wastc is in hunkers or on opcn ground, it is manually  handlcd                I
into the collection vehiclc or trailer. One of thc new  10 cu.m  capacity
vehicics is indicatcd  in rigure 3.3d.                                                    (

J3.3'       Disposal
In the CMC area, waste from the secondary collection service is taken to a
site at Wellampitiya. Although some of the other local authorities in the
study area also use this site for disposal, the remainder tend to use local
uncontrolled dumps.
Wellampitiya
The Wellampitiya site was identified as a potential landfill in a previous     4
study carried out by ERM (as ERL). At that time, ERM made a number of
recommendations on how the site should be developed. Whilst an attempt         1
has been made to put some of these recommendations into practice, the
current operation falls some way short of the standards envisaged.             4
There appears to have been little preparation work to the site base in terms
of containment and surface water maiinagement. There are aIlso no signs of
either leachate or gas control or monitoring systems, although ditches have
been constructed to collect contaminated surface water at certain points
within the site. However, it could not be said that the surface water          4
drainage system is either comprehensive or adequate. Water levels in one of
the ditches near the site entrance appears to be maintained at local water     4
table level and there appears to be no method of preventing contaminated
liquid seeping into the local aquifer.
A spine road has been constructed on waste down the centre of the site for
about two thirds of its length and waste bunds have been formed in a            4
herring bone pattern leading off from the road. The bunds have been
formed to near final level height for the finished landfill and provide the
equivalent of a series of tipping cells. A number of residential dwellings and  4
a school are close to the site perimeter.
Considerable cifficultv was encountered in the operation of the site during     4-
the recent rainy season, when the central spine road deteriorated to a state
where it could no longer be used by vehicles delivering waste. Waste then       4
had to be tipped in a fairly uncontrolled fashion much nearer to the site
entrance. The problems were exacerbated by the breakdown of the tracked
bulldozer, used for spreading the wastes in the tipping area and maintaining    -
the surface of the haul road. An attempt was made to use the landfill
compactor for these purposes which, in the conditions prevailing, worsened      (
matters considerably. Up to this time the haul road had been maintained
using a clay bound material. This has now been substituted with one which
is of a free draining sandy nature, in the hope that, during the next wet
season in November, the same problems will not be encountered.
No cover material is available at the site and the waste generally remains
uncovered. Flocks of crows are seen permanently at the site and it is certain
that other vermin are equally present. The site also exudes considerable        4
odour, which has resulted in many complaints from nearby residents,

partitcularly so during the rccent problcm period when wastc had to bc
lippcd muchi closer to thic housing than nornnal.
A considerabic number of scavcflgcrs are present on the site, continuously
moving around  the wastc delivery trucks as they unload  and the spreading
and compacting machinery. Whilst the current practises in relation lo these
scavcngers is far from dcsirable, both on public health and safcty grounds, at
the prescnt levels of enforcement and rcgulation  in Sri Lanka, it is
unressonabie  to cxpect that their activities could or should be banncd.
Whilst the above sunmnary details an operation  far below  that which could
be described. certainly in Westcrn terms, as modcrn  sanitary  landfilling, it is
felt that an attempt has been made to move forward from  wtiat can be
tcrmcd "uncontrolled dumping".  Tipping is gcnerally confincd to a single
area and therc appears to bc a general plan for phased  developmcint.
Rccords of vehiclcs delivcring the wastes and the amounts carried are kept at
the site office and an elcctronic wcighbridgc  is prcscntly  undcr construction,
whiicih will furtlher enhancc the value of these records. The operation is
therefore seen as far from idcal but aspects indicate that the desire for
improvement arc present and, with further training, a considcrable
improvement in understanding and improvement could be achieved.

LOCAT ON OF PROPOSED TRANSFCR STATION AND LANDFILU SirTs
as hJire Road
The location identified for a road or rail transfer station, on the assumption
that final disposal will occur at the Padukka clay pit site in Hanwella, is on
the site currently partly occupied by the City's abattoir, opposite Baseline
Road Railway Station. Vehicular acCess to the site is directly from Baseline
Road. Exduding the main abattoir buildings, the size of the site indicated in
the NBRO report 'Feasibility Study of Rail Transfer to Padukka Site' dated
September 1991, is 1.66 hectares. If the abattoir buildings were included, the
land available would incrase to around 3.0 hectares.
The sitc was chosen because of its central location and direct access to the
Kelaru Valley railway line, which is presently being widened to broad gauge.
Figures 3.4a and 3.4b provide general views of the area as it is currently.
The NBRO report also suggests that a site at Madampitiya Road has been
identified for a northern transfer station to serve the north part of the area
and recommends that a road based transfer faclity be constructed at Model
Town Road in the north of Moratuwa UC, to serve Moratuwa UC and the
Dchiwela and Mount Lavinia MC in the south of the area. It is assumed
that both of these transfer stations will feed pre-containerised waste into
Baseline Road T'S if the rail option to Padukka is chosen.

From inspection, the geology at the Baseline Road site appears to be latterite
from close to the surface down to granitic bedrock at a lower depth. This is
likely to provide more than adequate bearing pressures for the low rise
structures and paved areas anticipated for the transfer station construction.
initial expectations in relation to the load bearing capacity of the ground are
further enhanced by the fact that the existing Kelani Valley railway line
passes along one edge of the site on simple ballast and sleeper foundations,
On this basis, the Consultant's are seeking agreement to amend their initial
proposals with regard to Activity 2 - Geotechnical Irvestigations and
redistribute the resources available to allow greater emphasise to be placed
on the geotechnical investigation at the proposed landfill site.
It is therefore proposed that the geotechnical investigation at Baseline Road
be restricted to confirming that latterite does indeed underlie the site close to
the surface across the whole site and to check that its load bearing capacity
is adequate and consistent. New proposals will be put forward on this basis
for approval as soon as Baseline Road is confirmed as the location for the
transfer station.
,  .2        LAndfill Sitcs
At the timne of writing, three potential locations have been identified for
consideration as landfills. These locations are as follows;
3 Hanwella, near Padukka
* Wellisara
a Kerawalapitiya
A proposal to identify a fourth site in an area of rubber plantations, again
close to Padukka, which was requested by MEIP, has been prepared by ERM
and is currently being considered by the World Bank, as described in
Section 1.22.
Hanwella, near Padukka
This site is located within Colombo district along High Level Road, east of
HanweLla bridge where High Level Road meets Low Level Road. The site is
generaly a low level area to the south of High Level Road, consisting mainly
of abandoned rice paddy, with areas excavated for brick making and for
domestic horticulture. According to local residents, the rice paddy was
abandoned some 10 years ago due to frequent flooding of the area during
the wet seasons and water scarcity during the dry season. This problem has
apparently arisen following the construction of a road along the westem
border of the site.
Power lines and cast iron water mains which bring water from the reservoirs
further east to the City of Colombo, traverse the site. A large stream which
feeds into the Kelani Ganga (river) also passes through the site on the
eastern side and is the main source of the frequent flooding of the area.
Views of part of the site area are indicated in Figures 3.4c, which is a view

from High Level Road, and Figure 3.4d, taken from the interior of the site
looking towards High Level Road in the distance.                                e
The geology of the site includes a natural clay layer at or near the surface
which has provided some attraction as a potential landfill as it is possible
that this could be engineered to provide a natural barrier at the bottorr. and
sides of the site to prevent seepage of pollutants into surface and
underground waters.
Residential dwellings are situated around some of the borders of the site,      4
especially along High Level Road and a side road which cuts through the
eastern border of the site and joins High Level Road.                           4

Wellisara
The Wellisara site is situated within about 3 km of the Govemment Food           (
Store Complex at the end of Galudupita Road, Wellisara. The site is in the
Gampaha District and can be described as a wetland marsh.                        (
The topography is gencrally low level and flat, with water at the surface
over much of the area. Little in the way of agricultural practices were noted
during visits to the site by the Team, apart from the grazing of water buffalo,
Due to continuous or periodic inundation of the area with water, no serious      C
agriculture is possible. It is of interest to note that the Central
Environmental Authority maintains that the area falls within the Wetlands
Conservation Project.
The precise geology of the site is unknown at this stage of the study, but in
line with similar wetland areas, the surface substrate is soft and rich in
decomposing organic matter which is mixed with mineral soils. It is likely
that engineering costs to establish the site as suitable for landfilling will be
high.
The site appears to be generally uninhabited although there are residences
close the boundaries on the western side of the site, which include a school.
The main railway line from Colombo to Negombo passes to the east of the           C
site.

The Kerawalapitiya site is situated in the Muthurajawela marsh in the             C
administrative district of Gampaha. The Muthruajawela marsh is a coastal
wetland which opens to the sea at the northern end and is fed by
Dandugam Oya.
The area was a rice paddy tract during the period of Kotte kingdom, but was
later abandoned due to salt intrusion. In the area identified for the landfill
there are four canals running east to west, draining into the main Hamilton       C
Channel which runs north/south to the west of the area. The Old Negombo
Channel runs north/south to the east of the area. A view of some of the
dwellings typically situated along the channels are shown in Figure 3.4e and      L
a general view of the area in Figure 3.4f.
Most areas of the Muthurajawela marsh are water logged for at least part of
the year and the substrate remains moist to saturated throughout The soils
of Muthurajawela have been classified as not suitable or marginally suitabl e
for conventional land use practices as rice and leafy vegetable cultivation.
Salinity and flooding are two of the main reasons for this unsuitability.         4
However, coconut appears to tolerate these conditions, as considerable
numbers can be seen in the area.

There appear to be a considerable number of illegal dwellings within the
area and there are plans to by the Ministry of Housing to build residential
estates witihin or diosc to the proposed landfill site.
Fourth Site tlcar Padukka
Until the ex"t location of the fourth site has been established, it is not
possible to give any detailed description. However, the area visited by the
L                team and members of MEIP on 6 August gencrally comprises of a serics of
hilWs and valleys in an area covered by rubber plantations. The areas are
picturesque but are not accessible to the general public. Habitation is
minimal, being generally confined to estate workers. The soils appeared to
be weathered latterite, which is cohesive and could probably be worked so
that, in combination with other engineering measures, it could provide a
degree of impermeability which may be acceptable for purpose of pollution          6
prevention from landfilling activities.

&5           EXPORT PROMOTION ZONES
Both the Export Promotion Zones (EPZs), at Katunayake and Biyagama,
were visited by the Project Manager during mobilisation and the current
disposal situation inspected.
3.51        "Kaunayake
A large proportion of the wastes generated at Katunayake emanate from
garment factories and consist of cloth off-cuts. A composition analysis
supplied by BOI is given in Table 3.5a. The wastes are collected daily from
each of the factories by contractors using hand or bullock carts and taken to 5
a disposal site within the curtilage of the estate. The contractors charge each
factory around Rs 12,500 per month for this service.

3.6.1          Infonnation Sources
In order to obtain an appreciation of current practices in hospital waste
management, a visit was made by the Project Manager during the initial
phase of the project to the Colombo General Hospital, which is Sri Lankdi;
largest and prernier teaching hospital. The hospital complex covers some 28
acres and provides 2,300 beds.
The visit included the following;
* an interview  with Mr Liyanage, Chief Administrative Officer at the
hospital;
* viewing existing waste management storage, handling and transportation
systems;
* a walk round several of the ward areas, which included short discussions
with some of the nursing staff;
* a visit to the radiological department, which included viewing storage
facilities for short Lived radio-active substances; and
* discussions with infection control nursing staff.

The internationaliv accepted method of disposal for sharps is by incineration,
with landfill disposal of the residues. As no suitable incineration facilities are
currently available to the Colombo General to allow such disposal, nursing
staff are disposing of the sharps by soaking them in kerosene and setting fire
to them. This occurs within the hospital grounds at weekends when there is
less chance of complaint from the general office and administrative statf.
Other WMstes
Segregation of other clinical wastes from non-clinical wastes is not
attempted. In most wards, wastes, other than sharps, are stored in
galvanised steel or plastic containers as indicated in Figuires 3.6b and 3.6c.
These wastes consist mainly of unwanted food brought by relatives for the
patients, which could generally be considered as non-clinical waste and
constitute about 85% of the waste generated. This is supplemented bv
dressings, swabs, and other clinical wastes, together with the associated
packaging from those items. Some of the containers are loosely lidded,
sL                ~~~~~others are not.

Storage. Traiisportation aid Dispoa.z
The containers are transported on <at bed, unsided trolleys through the
hospital cumplex to a central point in which is situated an open trailer
supplied bv CM1C. Containers are hand unloaded on to the trailer and, once         c
waste in the trailer has reached a certain level, this unloading process
involves a man climbing on to the waste to have the container Ufted up to
him for emptying. Figure 3.6d shows the trailer where waste is stored and
Figure 3.6e provides a close up picture of the types of waste placed in the
trailer. Blood soaked dressings can be clearly seen amongst the wastes, It is
understood that scavenging of wastes in the trailer often takes place, with
plastics and other recyclables being removed.
The trailer is supposed to be replaced twice each day by CMC, although
collection is somewhat irregular, which often leads to it being overfilled.
The contents are taken by CMC to the municipal landfill at Wetlampitiva for
disposal. As far as could be ascertained, no special measures or precautions
are taken be CMC in either ensuring that only dedicated trailers are used for
hospital waste transportation or in carrying out disposal of the hospital
waste at the landfill.

Radioactive Wastes
A small amount of low level radioactive waste is generated by the hospital's
Pathology and Radiography Departments. The liquid component of this
waste is disposed of in a well which has been constructed in accordance
with specifications set down by the Atomic Energy Authority. The well is
situated within the hospital grounds. Sampling from nearby tube wells,
which is carried out on a periodic basis, has given no indication of
radioactivity permeating from the disposal point through the movement of
ground water.
The solid component of this waste is retained at the hospital on the basis
that it has a fairly short half-life. The manufacturer's recommendations are
apparently that the waste should be stored for a period of about two years,
by which time it wifl be rendered virtually harmless. The storage conditions
for this waste are indicated in Figure 3.6f. Whilst it was difficult to ascertain
:              precise details, it is likeiy that all of the solid waste generated in the past four
years has been retained in the store room shown.

NAREPP                                                                              (
Information supplied by NAREPP i1) indicates that the total volume of
hazardous wastes generated by the Colombo group of hospitals is relatively
small. A report prepared by them in 1992 (2) suggests that this can be
estimated at around 3 tonnes per day. In 1992 a proposal was put forward            (
to build a central hospital waste incinerator to serve both public and private
hospitals in the Colombo area and funds of Rs 56 milUon were made
available to CMC for its construction. Tenders were prepared and bids
received. However, agreement could not be reached on, amongst other
things, a suitable location for the facility and the fund was eventually            C
withdrawn by the Treasury.
Only one hospital in the Colombo area has an incinerator and this is at the         (
Sri Jayawardunapura, which has some 700 plus beds. It was built with the
intent that it would handle the majority of the combustible waste generated        (
at the hospital. However, from evidence of a constant black plume, which
indicates inadequate and incomplete combustion, it would appear that the
facility is pooriv designed or poorly managed or a combination of both and
therefore does not offer a satisfactory solution to the safe and proper
disposal of potentially hazardous hospital waste.                                   £
General Hospital Colombo Relhabilitation Project
Under the General Hospital Colombo Rehabilitation Project, it is understood
that a waste separation pilot scheme will shortly be implemented. The              £
objective of the proposal is to separate clinical waste from non-clinical waste
at ward/unit level in different coloured polythene bags and then maintain
their separation by different handling and storage procedures. Bag holding         £
units and sufficient bags for two months have been ordered by the project
and the Department of Health has promised to make funds available for the
further supply of bags.
A tractor with two fully enclosed trailers have been supplied by the Project        £
for the transport of the clinical waste bags for disposal, together with a
secure garaging facility. Unfortunately, to date, the Ministry of Health and        £
Women's Affairs have been unable to engage suitably qualified drivers to
bring this new transport system into operation.

4           gKEY ISSUES
IINRODUCTION
There are a number of key issues which have been identified at this initial
stage of the project and the purpose of this Section is to b,ing them to the
attention of our client, The World Bank, and MEIP as the local
representatives of our client. Where possible, we have stated the future
course of action we intend to take, subject to client approval. Our purpose
in this is to establish an agreed basis on which work will proceed, enabling
us realistically to meet the requirements of the Terms of Reference for the
study, and avoid abortive work. Where we are unclear on the way to
proceed, we have asked for clarification.
We consider that we have already established a good working relationship
with officials of MEIP and the World Bank Mission, which was in Sri Lanka
during much of July, and the continuation of this productive relatonship
will greatly enhance the prospects of a successful conclusion to the study.
This Section firstly highlights our overriding concerns at this early stage of
the project and then discusses the key issues which we have identified,
Activity by Activity.
4.2         MAIN CONCERNS
ERM have identified three key issues which they find of particular concern
following this initial phase of the study. These are;
* identification of a suitable landfill location;
* the method of funding to be adopted by the World Band for development
of the landfill; and
* establishmeitt of the waste throughput tonnage for the proposed Baseline
Road Transfer Loading Station, on the basis of which the facility will be
designed.
4.21        Landfill Location
The original TOR for the study required us to undertake a detailed
geotechnical investigation, conceptual design and Environmental Impact
Assessment for a landfill site to be located to the south of High Level Road
near Hanwella Bridge, close to the settlement of Padukka. Closely following
the acceptance of our proposal by the World Bank in May 1993, it became
apparent that some local opposition was growing to the Padukka site.
During initial discussions with the National Prograrmne Coordinator of MEIP
in Sri Lanka, it was agreed that the TOR would be broadened and that two

other sites should be considered, as discussed in Section 3.4.2, and these sites,
together with the site at Padukka, subjected to an environmental scoping
exercise. On the basis of the results of this environmental scoping, a site
would be put forward for political consideration and agreement by the
|  g     GCovernment. 
Subsequently. after the scoping exercise had been started, one of the sites,
that at Mahara Quarry was dismissed as not providing suffident capacity
and a location at Weilisara was substituted. Some two weeks later, MEIP
requested the inclusion of a further site, which has yet to be precisely
identified, but will be located in the rubber plantation area adjacent to the
settlement of Padukka.
Whilst ERM fully understand the difficulties that have arsen in identifying a
suitable site for the landfill and are happy to respond to the additional
requirements of the World Bank, the location exercise has become protracted
and has necessitated considerable additional work to that originally planned
and agreed. The lack of a suitable site has also meant that a number of the
Activities incorporated into the project are or will be delayed, which may
mean that previously agreed deadlines may need to be further revised.
These delays are addressed in detail in Section 5 of this report.
32.2      Method of Funding for the Landfill                                             _
F.,
ERM have been informed that the World Bank will expect our financial
evaluation for implementation of the projec( recommendations to indicate
that around 75% - 80% of the total capital required would be spent within
the first three years of the implementation phase of the project and the
remainder within the following four years. (It is understood that the World
Bank funding agreement is for seven years.) The landfill design is to provide  £
capacity for the Metropolitan Colombo area for a fifteen year period.
The type of funding arrangement suggested above is perfectly acceptable for   £
much of the proposed project For example, the development of the transfer
station will entail capital expenditure for the design, construction and      £
equipping of the facility during the first year to eighteen months of the
implementation phase. The facility would be expected to be operational after
that sort of timescale, requiring revenue expenditure to maintain day to day  I
operations, but little further capitaL Expansion to meet future increases in
waste generation could be acconmuodated within the requirements for early     (
completion of the capital expenditure by building in the future capacity at
the start Planned replacement of mechanical equipment could, to some
extent be met, by ensuring that major spare parts are included in the orginal
capital requirements.
The same is true for the transport systenL Some additional equipment and
vehicles would be required to meet increased demand from time to time, but
the major capital investment would be at the beginning in providing the       E
-vehides and facilities to meet the initial operational requirements.

However, the same is unlikely to be true for development of the landfill.
From our initial assessment, the landfill is likely to cover up to 80 ha of land.
To enable the landfill to progress in a planned and satisfactory manner in
line with modern landfill techniques, it will need to be developed in phases.
Phasing provides for only part of the site to be prepared and operational at
any one time, thus reducing impact on local inhabitants and the
environmentL Phasing also reduces the technical problems in having to
protect prepared but non operational areas from the effects of weather,
flooding and accidental damage by operational machinery. It also allows
lessons leamt during the progress of one phase to be incorporated into the
next.
Therefore, whilst there will be the need for a considerable capital outlay at
the start of the landfill development, further substantial capital payments are
likely to be required at the start of each subsequent phase and these will
continue throughout much of the operational life of the site.
In addition to this, the closure of the landfill, the final restoration and
continued monitoring and aftercare is also likely to require substantial
funding. Liabilities in relation to the long term pollution potential of landfills
are now considered with such concern, that arrangements for funding this
final stage cannot be ignored and provision within the project must be made.
Having aired this concern at this early stage, ERM would welcome a
dialogue with World Bank officials on how staged capital payments over the
life of the landfill can best be accommodated within the remit of the Bank's
procedures.
42.3         Design Throughput for Baseline Road
In reading through the NBRO report entitled 'Feasibility Study of Rail
Transfer to Padukia Site' dated September 1991, on the evaluation of a solid
waste transfer option at Baseline Road, it is clear that a possible need for two
other transfer station sites has been identified. These are described in Section
3.4.7. When the NBRO study was commissioned, it would appear that it was
the intention that alternative landfills would be developed in the north and
south of the area, to which the waste received at these two transfer stations
would be sent. Now it appears to be the intention that all wastes generated
in the Metropolitan area are to disposed of at the new single landfill, once its
location has been agreed.
However, from ERM's experience elsewhere, it would seem that such an
arrangement utiUising more than one transfer station may still be justifiable
on economic grounds. Justification would be on the basis of the likely
considerable journey times for the collection vehicles from both the north
and south of the area through the congested urban streets to Baseline Road.
This would also have the effect of reducing the productivity of the vehicle
fleet.

Whilst consideration of such a strategy is beyond the terms of reference for
this study, the fact that such a strategy appears to make some sense and
may at some point in the future need to be implemented, means that its
implications need to be addressed and guidance sought. At present, it is not  (
possible for ERM to deterrnine, should additional transfer facilities become
operational, how much of the estimated (') 890 tonnes of waste generated
in the Metropolitar. area per day, will pass through the Baseline Road
facility, either for bulking into containers or simply for loading onto rail
transport, if that is seen to be the preferred option. Therefore, we do not   (
have a firm answer on one of the fundamental criteria on which the Baseline
Road facility will be designed, namely the estimated throughput.
At this stage two options appear to be possible:
* Ignore the prospect of other transfer stations coming into operation in the
area and design the BaseLine Road facility to accept the total waste which
will be generated daily during the operational period.                    (
* Undertake a short and approximate operational research study to            (
determine, on the basis of economics, how much waste should be handled
by each faciLity. Examples of the various options that are possible are
given and discussed in more detail in Section 4.6.
ERM therefore seek guidance on the most appropriate way forward on this       (
issue. Obviously the first option may lead to capital expenditure in excess of
what is strictly necessary, whilst the second option will lead to work which
is additional to that required by the TOR and may lead to further delays in
the progress of the study, although we would obviously seek to minimise
these if additional work was required.                                        (
43          LEGAL, INSTTIONAL AND CoNTRACTuAL ISSUEs                                      C
431         Legislation and Municipal Powers                                              (
Initial observation by ERM indicate that there is a need to clarify the duties
of the Provincial Councils and any potential overlap between these and the
present duties of municipal and urban councils and other bodies on waste
collection and disposal. ERM has had sight of the 13th Amendment to the       (
Constitution (1987), decentralising power to the provinces and the Provincial
Councils Act No 42 of 1987. It has also noted the Conservancy and
Scavenging powers set down for the municipal and urban councils in The       C
Municipal Councils Ordnance (Volume 18 Cap 576-579) of the Legal
Enactments of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 1980. In this,   (
the municipal and urban councils have the powers to collect and dispose of
waste, that such waste is the property of the councils and that they have the
power to sell or dispose of all such matter and retain any income therefrom,
(XVIV8, paragraphs 129,130 and 131).

The councils have complementary powers for sweeping cleansing,
prevention of nuisances and the provision of places convenient for the
proper disposal of all street refuse, house refuse, night soil and similar
matter. This could be taken to mean ownership and operation of transfer
stations. If it is the ultimate intention of this project that the Employer on
any contraCt or contracts may be entities other than the municipal and urban
councils, these legal powers may need to be darified for the avoidance of
doubt. A reference to the Attomey General has been suggested and ERM
request confirmation of whether this approach should be initiated by
themselves or by MEIP.
Once the role of Employer has been clarified, it is the intention of ERM, in
conjunction with MEIP, to organise meetings with representatives of the
relevant authorities, to discuss the most suitable arrangements for the future
provision of services, where appropriate, involving the private sector.
432          Liabilities
-                      Although strictly not within the scope of this project, ERM considers it
-                       prudent to raise the question of liabilities, particularly in respect of landfill
_=                     operations. Landfill sites can present some unique and long term risks to
adjoining landowners, the public at large, as weUl as surface and
groundwaters. These may arise principally through the migration from the
site of leachate and landfill gas, but may be compounded by public health
risks due to smell, vermin and other manifestations, if the sites are not well
managed. While good design, engineering and operations can substantially
alleviate these problems; and well run landfills can be good neighbours;
some residual risks and liabilities remain. The more serious of these risks is
to groundwater and adjoining land through leachate and landfill gas
nmigration. Surface water pollution can also contribute to the risks, but is
more amenable to an engineering solution.
The question arises as to what is an equitable balance and sharing of
liabilities between the Employer and the Contractor. The latter will argL;.
that the decision on site selection was not his and he may have had limited
control over the fundamental concepts of site design and the specifications
for dealing with the potential source of liabilities. The Contractor may more
readily accept liability for incidents caused by operational failures over which
he has had control. Some contractors may also seek to Ulmit liability for
harn caused by unauthorised wastes; for example, hazardous wastes being
illicitly deposited on a site designed for household wastes. While the
conditions of contract may be drafted to place all such responsibilities on the
contractor, they may be difficult to enforce.
These questions of liability caused considerable debate in the recently
awarded (1992-1993) strategic landfill contracts in Hong Kong which were on
a design, construct, operate, restore and aftercare basis. They will need to be
considered on this project by the appropriate departnients of Government.

Contractual and Institutional Issues
.\dISJ       Options
Under Activity 1, ERM will address the various options that are available in
the execution of the landfill and transfer station contracts. In the case of the
landfill contract these will include design only, design and constnrct, design
construct and operate and design construct operation and restoration
variants.
It will also be necessary to address the question of the aftercare of the
landfill site and how this is to be managed. Some of these options also apply
to the transfer station. In this instalciC it will be necessary to debate      £
whether the bulk transfer to landfill should be integrated with or separated
from the transfer ctation operation. The same would apply to other waste       £
management processes such as clinical waste incineration.
A choice will have to be made as to the form of the specification in each      {
case. This can be based on a detailed design or a performance specification
laying down a set of guidelines, physical and environmental standards and      a
criteria allowing the tenderer (under supervision) to exercise skiDl and
judgement in complying with the conditions of the contract. Waste
collection and cleansing contracts are perhaps the best documented with        £
many hundreds of contracts already operating throughout the world, but
ERM will need to consider how these can be sensibly applied say within a       (
ward or wards of Colombo Municipal Council on an experimental basis.
Institutional Issues Relating to Contracts                                     (
ERM also require guidance on several key institutional matters and these
have been mentioned at the meeting held at the office of the Metropolitan      £
Enviromnental Improvements Programrnme (MEIP) offices on1 Thursday,
5 August 1993. These include:                                                  (
L  The preferred grouping of the design, construct, operate and other
elements of the contract.
0 The identification of the Employer (the party to the contract) in each case.  (
* The necessity for an agreement between the 31 authorities to cooperate in
and utilize the contract facilities.
* Any additional principles to be followed in the contractual relationship     (
between the Employer and Contractor.
* Adherence to World Bank guidelines and regulations. The identifiration
of the body to take overall responsibility for all financial and contractual
relations with the World Bank.

* The detaiJed nature of World Bank financial support tor the project and
access to any Appraisal Reports that have been produced.
* The acquisition of land for the project. The identification of the body to
initiate and manage the procedures set out in the Land Acquisition Act
1956 Revision (and later revisions).
* The phasing of capital investments in the landfill site need to be
considered. Most landfills requir" investment for initial development, in
set phases during the operation of the site, on completion and restoration
of the site and possibly in the aftercare period. Is the World Bank
supporting all or part of these investments and in what form?
* It is normal for landfill operating contractors to receive a monthly fee,
usually tonnage related and with a fixed and variable element. If the
contract is to be for the life of the site, price fluctuation clauses will need
to be considered. If the Contractor is to fund some capital investments,
the costs of these will also need to be reflected in the fees charged. Are
there preferred World Bank policies in these matters?
* What systems are to be used and through which parties will World Bank
funds be paid to the Contractor? These will need to be defined in the
General Conditions of Contract.
Although work can proceed on the production of model contract documents
for the landfill, transfer station and waste collection services, these cannot of
course, be completed until the location of the landfiLl and the type of transfer
operation required has been finalised.
It should also be noted that, as required by the Terms of Reference for the
project, we will be preparing Model Forms of Contract for the services
recommended, which will require additional working up into Definitive
Contract Documents against which the various services can be tendered.
Any additional work required by the World Bank beyond the preparation of
Model Forms of Contract will need to be negotiated with ERM.
Form of Contract
There is a considerable amount of common ground in all the contract forms
-discussed in Section 3.2, relating to the basic laws of contract and the form of
the principal clauses and terms. There is nothing to be gained from
_                     wreinventing them for this particular project. The major effort needs therefore
to be concentrated on the special conditions attached to waste management
operations, which makes them substantially different from the construction
type contracts that are weli known in Sri Lanka. These range from the
materials movement, transport and labour dominated features of waste
collection contracts to the particular needs of a landfill development and
operation contract Landfill contracts require an appreciation of the
contractual implications of site design, development, operation, restoration
and after care of the site and its potential for long term liabilities to be

incurred. In every case the general and special conditions of contract will
require to be supported by carefully framed specifications describing how the
works are to be executed. An appropriate method of payment for the
contractors will need to be devised.
In general, all the model contract documents will take the following generic
form which is commonly in use in Sri Lanka, although the order may vary
from case to case:
* ERM will provide a model for each element of the document but the
General Conditions of Contract will draw substantially on approved terms
and conditions already in use in public contracts in Sri Lanka. Where
appropriate standard forms of tender, bonds and guarantees will be used.
* The general form of the documents in each case will be:                  0
* Instructions to Tenderers
* General Conditions of Contract
* Special Conditions of Contract
* Specification of the Works & Services                                  S
* Schedules of Resources
* Bills of Quantities and/or
* Summary of Prices
* Form of Tender
* Appendix to the Form of Tender                                         S
* Forrn of Agreement
* Form of Bonds
* Form of Guarantees
*Appendices & Drawings
In relation to meeting the requirements of the TOR, ERM's interpretation of
a 'Model Contract' is a document in which all the key elements of the
required contract are defined and from which the definitive contract
documents can be developed and completed by the Govemnment or its
consultants.                                                                {

We have assumed that the intention will be to involve only local companies
in the tendering exercises and our model contract documentation will be      6
developed with this in mind. However, if it is the intention to open the
tenders to international competition, then the form that the model contract
documents take may need to be quite different. This is because intemational
waste management companies will be attracted by much longer contract
periods and a different, more encompassing form of contract to local          £
companies, who will probably be unhappy to put themselves at risk over a
long period in a type of contract with which they are unfamiliar.             C
ERM require confirmation that their assumptions are correct.
4.5          WASTE GENEMTION STATISTICS AND DENSITIES                                      (
4.5.1        Waste Generation
The NBRO reports listed in Section 2.3, provide a considerable wealth of
information on waste generation statistics until the year 2010. These are
generaUy based on estimates of current or previous generation rates, grossed
M                     up on population predictions. As no waste is currently weighed in Colombo
and it is outside the scope of this study to carry out a waste survey, it is   (
difficult to judge how accurate these statistics are. Certainly the per capita
ufi                  generation rate of 0.98 kg/day in 1990 for the CMC area (1), on first sight
appears high. However, this figure is derived on the basis of the resident
'97                   population. The figure includes for the waste generated by Colombo's
commuting population which swells the number of people in the city daily
by about 40%. It also includes for commercial, industrial and institutional
g              ~~~~~waste generation.C
In conversation with members of CMC staff, the actual waste generation per
person in Colombo is estimated at around 0.4 kg/day.
In the same NBRO report, the equivalent generation rate for the local
authority areas outside the CMC area is taken as 0.6 kg/day. The report also
states that actual waste generation per person outside the main city area is
around 0.3 kg/day.
The growth rate for per capita waste generation within the city area is taken
as 1% per year until 2010. Outside the city area the growth rate is taken as   C
2%.

Using population predictions based on the 1980 population census survey
and these annually growing generation rates, total waste generation figures
have been calculated from 1990 to 2010. Based on these figures, which are

landfill void for the fifteen year period can be estimated. The figure is
10,863,226 cubic meters. The assumptions are that;
* 10% of the waste generated will be recovered for recycling prior to
disposal throughout the period.
* The finally achieved density of the waste in the landfill will be
0.8 tonnes/cu. m.
Based on experience in the UK and elsewhere in relation to waste tonnage
calculations based on volume estimates which have subsequently bcen found
to be high, it is likely that this figure will also be found to be high.
However, in the light of no better information, we intend to formulate our
designs on the basis of the various predictions given in the report.
It is of interest to note that CMC are currently in the process of installing a
weighbridge at the existing Wellampitiya landfill and it is possible that more
accurate weight statistics will be available in the future. Whilst this is
unlikely to be of benefit directly to this project, bearing in mnind the relatively
short time scale allowed, the Bank should bear in mind that appropriate
adjustments may be possible at the detailed design stage of the transfer and
disposal faciLities in the tight of more accurate information.
4.5.2        Waste Densities
A number of waste densities are quoted in the NBRO reports:
From "Identification of Land for Solid Waste Disposal"
* Density at collection                    250 kg/cu m
* Final landfill density                   800 kg/cu m
From 'Feasibility Study of Rail Transfer to Padukka Site"
|  Containerised density for transfer      250 kg/cu m
Whilst ERM consider the densities for collection and in the landfill to be
consistent with what they would expect from their experience elsewhere,
they consider that the density assumed for containerised waste at the
transfer station is considerably less than could be expected. For a standard
20'x 8'x 8', which equates to a container capacity of some 36 cu m, at a
density of 250 kg/cu m the net payload of the container would be 9 tonnes.
The purpose of containerisation and transfer is to provide a more efficient
and economic system for transporting the waste to landfill. In order to
achieve this, the waste will need to be bulked up to provide a payload in this
size of container of between 15 and 16 tonnes. We will therefore be looldng
to implement systems at the transfer station to achieve a containerised

density of around 450 kg/cu m to produce a 15 to 16 tonne payload per
container.                                                                   c
Bearing in mind that, for the size of container quoted, payloads of this order
are regularly achieved in the UK and elsewhere, with wastes which on         (
collection are only half the density of collected wastes in Sri Lanka, it is
considered that achieving the level of payload indicated should not be
difficult. For calculation of transport requirements from the transfer facility  c
we therefore intend to assume a containerised density of 450 kg/cu m.
4.6         POTENTIAL TRANSFER STATION AND LANDFILL SITES                                 C
4.6.1       Additional Transfer Stations
In Section 4.2, ERM has indicated its concern over the uncertainty in the
waste management strategy being proposed for the Metropolitan Colombo
area, in relation to the introduction of transfer facilities in other parts of the
city. If it is the intention to introduce other transfer facilities, this could have
a marked effect on the waste throughput figures on which the design of the    (
Baseline Road facility should be based.
If no other transfer stations are to be built and local cleansing services to the  C
north and south of the area continue to accept that their coUection vehicles
will not be available for waste collection for a significant proportion of each  C
working day, due to travelling between their collection area and the Baseline
Road facility, the transfer operation will need to be based on the total
tonnage of waste generated in the Metropolitan area. If one or both of the
other proposed transfer stations comes into operation, then it is possible that
the design concept of the Baseline Road facility would need to change or the
design capacity be reduced, with a potential saving in capital cost.
There are a number of scenarios that could be possible if transfer stationr in  C
addition to Baseline Road were brought into operation. The potential
consequences to the Baseline Road facility are illustrated by the following   C
two examples.
If the rail option from Baseline Road was recommended and accepted as the     4
best option, then it is possible that waste could be transported in bulk by
road from the outlying transfer stations to Baseline Road for transfer by rail  C
to landfill. It would seem sensible that the containerised system compatible
with a rail transfer operation adopted at Baseline Road would also be
adopted at the outlying stations. This would mean that whilst the container   t
handling system to load the train would need to be able to cope with the full
amount of waste generated in the Metropolitan area, the collection vehicle
reception and container packing systems would only need to be of sufficient
capacity to deal with the tonnage delivered directly to Baseline Road by the
collection vehicles from the centre of the area.

If the road option was chosen, then it is unlikely that it would be economnic
or desirable to transport the waste from the outlying stations to be reloaded
and transported from Baseline Road. Rather, the waste would be
transported to the landfill directly from each of the transfer stations.
4.6.2        Choice of Location of Baseline Road
Both of the above examples are put forward on the basis that the landfill
finally chosen will be to the east of the city, based on current options, near
to Padukka. However, ERM would like to bring to the attention of the
World Bank another of its concems. If one of the sites to the north of the
city, at Welkiar or Kerawalapitiya were chosen as the preferred site hr the
landfill, then, in ERM's opinion, the location of Baseline Road for the
establishment of a transfer station is called into question.
The Baseline Road location is fairly central to the total area, which makes
ideal if the landfill is to be to the east. However, if the landfill was to be to
the north and a lot less distant than the sites proposed for the east, then a
preferred strategy would probably be to have a transfer facility located in the
southern side of the area, to which aU waste colected in the south would be
delivered. Waste coUected in the northern half of the area would be
delivered direct to landfill.
Obviously, until the location of the preferred landfill has been finalised, the
situation with regard to whether Baseline Road is the best position for the
transfer station remains academnic. However, it is another point to be bome
in mind during assessment of the results of the scoping exercise.
4.6.3        ScavengWing
Whilst scavenging at landfill sites in developing countries has been seen as
an unacceptable practice in the past, it is now recognised that a considerable
number of farniles rely on these activities for their existence. Scavenging is
also recognised as a valuable means of ensuring the recovery of at least a
portion of the waste for recycling.
Scavenging is considered bad practice and has been banned in many
developed countries because it is seen to be dangerous and hazardous to
health. There have been many cases cited where scavengers have been
badly or fatally injured by moving landfill machinery and vehides. While
walking and picking over wastes, they will often suffer cuts and bruising.
Due to the contamriinated nature of the wastes, the cuts may easily become
infected, leading to more serious problems. Wastes are also associated with
the transmission of diseases, including Leptospirosis which is carried by rats.
However in Sri Lanka, realistically, there is unlikely to be either
Government commitment or the necessary enforcement to prevent
scavenging, certainly in the short to medium term. The recycling aspect of
scavenging is also looked upon locally in a positive light.

In a brief discussion on the subject between ERM's Project Manager and Lea
Donaldson, the World Bank Mission Leader, it was agrced that scavenging     £
was an important aspect of recycling in Sri Lanka and would need to be
adequately addressed by the project. ERM will therefore look towards
innovative approaches to accommodating scavenging at both the landfill and  £
at the two industrial zones, whilst aiming to provide more acceptable
conditions than at present. The objective will oe to allow scavenging in a  £
more controlled manner to promote recycling whilst improving the health
and safety aspects of the current situation.                                £
An example of such an approach would be to provide two tipping areas at
the landfill. The operating procedures would be laid down such that waste   £
could be discharged at one of the areas and controlled scavenging take place.
After say 3 hours, tipping and scavenging would be diverted to the other
area whilst landfilling machines spread and compacted the waste on the first  £
area. With some control over the scavenging, this type of approach is seen
as considerably reducing the risk of vehicle/scavenger accidents.           £
4.7         INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT                                                  £
Section 3.5.1 describes the existing waste disposal situation at the
Katunayake EPZ. It is beyond the scope of the study to put forward          {
methods for rehabilitating the existing waste management site, which is of
considerable environmental concern to both local inhabitants and the airport,
which has made frequent complaints about the hazard of smoke drifting       C
across the path of incoming planes. However, ERM would like to emphasise
the considerable hazard that underground fires at landfills constitute. They
recomnmend that action is taken immediately to assess the extent of the fires
and find the most appropriate method for putting them out. Steps should
also be taken to bring in interim arrangements for disposing of the wastes  (
until a more acceptable system can be put into operation.
The site at Biyagama does not appear, from initial inspection, to be a cause  C
for such concern, although the site is extremely unsightly and is steriLising a
considerable area of land which could be used for future industrial         (
development.
From our initial assessment of the various alternatives for more acceptable  C
and appropriate methods of solid waste disposal at both sites, we have
identified the following three options as worthy of further assessment under  (
Activity 5 of the study:
The construction and operation of a new landfill at each zone to modem    I
acceptable standards. The construction and operation to be undertaken
by the private sector under the management of BOI. Industries would      I1
have to pay BOI the full costs of the disposal of their wastes. BOI would
act as the 'Employer' as far as the contract was concerned and would be
responsible for the payment of the contractor. Allowance would need to   I
be included in the operational procedures to allow safe scavenging prior
to final disposal. The operation of two landfill faces; ie one where tipping  (

and scavenging is being undertaken and the other where compaction and
covering is taking place; may be a solution to this.
The site would need to be designed to accept both solid wastes and
sludges from water treatment works.
The construction and operation of a number (minimum two) of small
incineration units at each zone. (This is the option favoured by the
Executive Director of Zones). There would need to be a large concrete
apron in front of each incineration unit to allow scavengers to sort
through the waste prior to incineration. Again, the installation and
operation could be contracted to the private sector under the management
-                        of BO.
The construction and operation of a simple open air, two level compaction
transfer station. Compactors (minimum 2) would be fixed, the containers
at the lower level would move (by rope and tirfur operation). A large
_                        apron at the higher level would allow segregated tipping of the hand
carts and relatively safe scavenging. Allowance would need to made for
the accommodation of sludge disposal from in-house waste water
treatment plants. It is suggested that open top containers could be
utilised for this and it would be possible to draw up a conceptual design
for a facility to handle both compacted and non-compacted wastes. The
wastes would be transported to the new municipal landfill.
-                 ~~~~~~Containers would need to be sealable by customs officials as the waste, on
which no import duty has been paid, will be disposed of outside the EPZ.
The containers would be taken to the new municipal landfill where they
could be received by customs officials if necessary, prior to disposal.
Industry would meet the costs of the transfer and transport operation.
Landfill costs could either be met by the municipalities or be charged back
to BO!.
4.8          HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT
-?
From our initial evaluation there appear to be two main key issues in
relation to hospital waste management These relate to the following;
* the siting of one or more clinical waste incineration plants; and
* the segregation of potentialy contaminated clinical wastes from other
wastes at ward level.
4.8.1        Siting
In Section 3.6.3, we have already referred to the proposal by CMC to build a
centralised cdirical waste facility in 1992 which had to be cancelled due to,
amongst other things, the lack of an acceptable location. In initial
discussions at the Colombo General Hospital, it appears that finding an

acceptable location may still be a major stumbling block in the provision of
an adequate centralised facility for the disposal of, what are potentially
dangerous wastes in terms of public health, from the area's hospitals.
Whilst ERM are happy to go through a technical exercise to establish
potential locations for eit+er a centralised facility or several strategically
positioned smaller units as set out in the TOR, they realise that political
considerations are likely to play a major role in the reaching of any
ag1eement on a final location or locations. In the light of the protracted
processes which are currently underway regarding the location of the
municipal landfill site, ERM seek guidance on the most appropriate way
forward to avoid a similar situation occurring with the clinical waste facility.
4.8.2        Segregation
In relatively industralised societies, ERM have normally taken the view that
segregation at ward level in hospitals is unrealistic and have based         0
segregation on the types of waste produced in various areas of the hospital.
Hence ward waste, because of the risk of contaminated material being
disposed of in the wrong bin, would always be treated as clinical waste.
Whereas waste from a kitchen or administrative area, where no clinical
waste was produced, would be classified as non-clinical waste.
In Sri Lanka, based on what was observed and heard by the Project
Manager on his visit to the Colombo General Hospital, this approach would
not be appropriate. Food for patients tends to be brought to the hospital by
relatives and the majority of waste generated at ward level consists of the
uneaten portion of this food and the packaging it came in. In comparison to
this, clinical type waste is but a small proportion of the total waste
generated. Estimates undertaken by NAREPP/IRG staff ° estimate that
this may be as little as 2.5 tonnes/day from hospitals in the Colombo group.
In order that an appropriate fahility/facilities can be provided at an acceptable
cost, it is therefore important that other arrangements are made at ward
level for the disposal of food and other wastes not generated by the niedical
staff and which could not be considered to be clinical wastes. As stated in
Section 3.6.3, ERM are aware of the segregation trial proposed under the       (
Rehabilitation Project at the Colombo General Hospital, using yellow bags
for clinical waste, and will take into account any results that can be made
available during the time frame of this project However, they are also
aware that such bags may be viewed by some as a useful commodity (and as
such are prone to be removed for alternative purposes, within or outside the    C
hospital) and this type of system, whilst used extensively elsewhere, may not
be appropriate at present in Sri Lanka.

This Annex basically revisits the site selection exercise which was carried out
in August to October last vear and summarises the main aspects of the
report which was issued in October 1993. Where new material has becnme
available since then, this has been included in the text. Under
Section A2 Desciption of Sites, each site is described under a number of
headings as follows:
* general description;
* potential capacity;                                                            0
* ownership;
* access;                                                                        0
* habitation;
* hydrology;
* geology and hydrogeology;
* flora and fauna;
* other relevant aspects.
In Section A3. tables are produced under each of these headings to allow
comparison of the sites. Sectiooi A4 then draws conclusions.
Recommendations for the site at Welisara, which is considered in
substantially more detail in the main body of this report, are given in Sec,tt:   z

.-11.2      LANDFILL VOID SPACE REQUIREmE,TS
As discussed in the study Inception Report presented by ER-MECL in August         6
1993, a number of previous waste management studies have been
undertaken in recent years. The most relevant to this study were prepared
by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), which is attached
to the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation. These studies appear       £
to have been undertaken between July 1990 and February 1993. Based on
the information presented in these reports and accepting the assumptions
from the NBRO reports given below, it has been possible to estimate the           £
volume of landfill space required for the fifteen year period. The figure is
about 12.8 million cubic meters. The assumptions are that;                         £
* 10% of the waste generated wil be recovered for recycling prior to
disposal throughout the period.                                                I
* The finally achieved density of the waste in the landfill will be
0.8 tonnes/cu. m.
As discussed in ERM's Inception Report, based on experience in the UK and          (

volume estimates have subsequently typically been found to be high, it is
likely that this figure will also be found to be high. However, in the absence
I                    of other sources of information, we intend to formulate our designs on the
basis of the various predictions given in the NBRO reports.
The landfill area required to accept this volume depends on the average
depth of the area filled. Table Al.2a indicates the area requirements for
different average depths.

Whilst the sites at Hanwella, Welisara and Kerawalapitiya are extensive, the
three sites close to Padukka (sites d, e andJ) are discrete vaUleys. In order to
be able to determine the potential capacity of these valleys, an outline level
survey was carried out at each of the three sites, starting during the week
beginning 16 August 1993. The surveys were considered necessary due to
the lack of availability of appropriate scale contour maps of the area. The
aim of the surveys was to provide longitudinal and cross-section levels from
the head of each valley for a distance down the valley of around 600 to 1000
metres, from which approximate contours could be derived. The surveys
were of necessity limited due to time constraints, but it was hoped they
would provide a sufficient basis on which preliminary designs could be
based and potential capacities estimated.
Having obtained outline level data for the sites, computerised ground models
for each site were produced. Using computer aided-design (CAD)
techniques, two site development approaches involving different final surface
levels of the completed landfill were superimposed on the ground models.
For each of these approaches, the volume between the existing ground levels
and the proposed final levels were calculated to provide an assessment of the
available void space. The first approach took a fairly conservative view
regarding the available floor areas of the sites and the final level contours.
The second approach used a more extreme assumption of both available floor
area and final levels, aimed at maximising void space. These are referred to
as Approach I and Approach 2 in the following text.
Approach I takes a fairly conservative view of final land forns, blending
finished levels with those of the existing area. The final landform is raised
above exdsting surrounding levels only to the extent that sufficient fals are
provided to allow surface water to be shed so that it does not enter the

Approach 2 is based on the implementation of the latest practice in western
landfill technology and land restoration techniques. From an aesthetic
viewpoint, this approach may not leave visually pleasing final land forms.
As an indication, for the site at Morakelle, maximum wastc depth in the     S
centre of the site would be in the region of 70m and the maximum height of
the final landform would be around 40m above existing land levels.
The estimated void space calculated for each approach is given in the text
appropriate to each site.
Realistically, in Sri Lanka, where good engineering skills are available but
there is limited experience in modem landfiling techniques, a scenario
somewhere in between the two described, would probably be a realistic
premise on which to base volume estimates.                                   (

The climate is generally similar at all proposed sites. Rainfall ranges from  £
1400 to 3700mm per year and average temperatures from 25-27.5 degrees
Celsius. Wind speed is generally light (>16kn-Vhr) and higher during July to
September. Wind direction is variable, according to the season. Any

A.2          DESCRIPTION OF SITES
As described in Section 2.2, six potential locations were short-listed for     S
consideration. Their positions are indicated on the maps in Figures Z.2a and
2.b. 
AZI          SITE A) . HANWELL4, NEAR PADUKKW4
General description                                                            £
This site is located within the Hanwella Division of Colombo District directly
to the south of High Level Road, east of HanweUla bridge where High Level
Road meets Low Level Road. (Grid reference 126191). The site is generally a
low level area consisting mainly of abandoned rice paddy, with areas           (
excavated for brick making and for domestic horticulture. It is in the flood
plain of the Kelani Ganga and Wak Oya and covers an area of more than 80
ha.
Whilst the area under consideration for the landfill is flat, the topography to  C
the south and south-east of the site consists of undulating countryside with
small hills and shallow valleys. High Level Road has been constructed on a
3 m high embankment directly to the north of the site.
Potential Capacity                                                              C
Development of the site would need to take the form of a landraising
scheme rather than landfilling. To accommodate the volume of waste which
will be generated during the next 15 years (some 13 mnillion m3 in total), the
final levels will need to rise above the level of High Level Road. However,     C
ediscounting at this stage other engineering requirements, it would appear
reasonable to reflect the landforms to the south and south-east of the site;
that is, some discrete raised sections within the general area; to accommodate
]                      the necessary volume.
Oumership
It is understood that the site is in private ownership, possibly including a     4
number of smalLholders, although these might be tenants.
Access
There is direct access to the Hanwella site from High Level Road, which is
one of the main routes going east from Colombo. The route is heavily used
and becomes congested during rush hour as it nears Colombo. However, in
the vicinity of the site, traffic is relatively light for much of the time.
Access can also be gained to the site from the narrow gauge Kelani Valley
Railway Line, which passes to the south and to the east of the area and is

linked directly with the proposed transfer station site at Baseline Road. The
Line is currently being widened to standard gauge and this should be
completed between Colombo and the site before the site would becomc
operational. In order to gain rail access, a spur would need to be
constructed, possibly either at Padukka or Waga, and the line extended to a
suitable reception point where the containerised waste could be off-loaded
from the train onto rough terrain vehicles for transport to the landfill face.
Habitation
It is difficult to determine the number of people that witl have to be resettled
from the proposed landfill sites since in most cases, the site boundaries have
not been determined. It is estimated that the following numbers of people
I                      <wil be affected by the development of a landfill site at Hanwella.
10 households are present within the site and will be have to be relocated.
* 30 households are found within 200m of the site.
Most people living on or near the site appear to be employed either in the
agriculture sector or in brick making. The homesteads within the site tend
I                      to lie close to the site boundary and many have groundwater weUs which
supply potable water.
L                     Hydrology
L                     Within the boundary of the site there is an embanked stream, the Wak Oya,
of variable width (>3m) for which no flow or discharge data currently exist.
L                     It is used by local residents for washing and recreation and by some for
potable use. A pond and wetland area also exists in the middle of the site.
r                     The Wak Oya flows into the Kelani Ganga a short distance to the north of
the site. Several kilometres downstream at Ambatale there is a potable water
intake to supply part of the city of Colombo. The Hanwelia site is reported
to flood on a fairly frequent basis and is within the flood plain of the Kelani.
L                     In addition to these natural features, three cast iron water mains pass
through the site, partially underground, conveying water to Colombo. Two
irrigation canals of recent construction also pass through the site.
Geology and Hydrogeology
In the Hanwella area, the geology consists mainly of Vijayan Series granite
and granitic gneiss which has extensively weathered to clay in much of the
area. Conical hills and flat fluvial plains dominate the landscape. Fluvial
deposits occur in the lower valley areas. The base rock has very low
permeability.
Preliminary site investigations indicate that the water table lies close to the
surface. During the wet season, it probably reaches the surface leading to

localised flooding at the site. There do not appear to be any existing data on  C
groundwater quality or direction of flow in the area.                        c
Flora and Fauna
Agriculture (principally rice and coconut) and silviculture (rubber) dominate  C
the general area. The hills bordering the site to the south are under rubber
plantation whilst, in the site itseU, some clay excavation and brick makingC
activities are carried out. In the site there is past evidence of rice cultivation
although we understand that this practice has now been abandoned due to
drainage problems. The vegetation within the area is mainly secondary,
consisting of grasses, sedges, herbs and trees along the stream. A total of 54
species have been noted; many of which are of household or medicinal          c
value. None of these species is considered rare or endangered.
With regard to fauna, the site has low diversity and abundance. The area      C
has been highly degraded as a result of long human settlement and little
exists of the indigenous communities which one might expect to find in an
area unaffected by human habitation. The ponds and stream in the site
support several species of fish and amphibia and aquatic invertebrates,
several of which are endemic although not rare.
Other Aspects                                                                 C
* Climate The rainfall is slightly higher in the HanweUa/Padukka area
(2500-3000nmu) which is attributable to the higher altitude (about lOOm)    -
compared to the sites nearer the coast.
* Power Supplies Two high tension power lines currently pass through the
site. However, we understand these could be re-routed outside of the        4
landfill area if the site were to be developed for that purpose.
* Tourism  The A4 road is the main road connecting Colombo with the
central uplands area and as such is used by many tourists. Currently it is
on embankment as it passes the site and provides travellers with a view      _
over the whole area. If the site were to be developed, consideration         _
would need to be given to careful screening of the operations with a
nixture of vegetation and embankments.
A22         SIrE B) - WELISARA
General Description
The Welisara site is situated within the wet marsh land about 3 km from the
Government Food Store Complex at the end of Galudupita Road, Welisara, in
the Gampaha District (Grid reference 105203). The potential site area is
essentially flat marshy land of around 100 ha, which is subject to frequent
flooding. Surface water run-off from a large catchment area to the east
|                    drains through the site, which acts as a retention area during times of high
rainfalL A number of water courses pass through the site, two of which are      _

significant and form part of the Kalu Oya, which eventually drains into the
Negombo Canal, south-west of Mabole. This in turn flows into the Kelani
Ganga. The land around the site generally rises up and to the north, in the
area of the Naval Base, rises to about 15m above the general site level. The
main Colombo-Kandy railway line passes to the east of the site, dividing the
site from a similar but smaller area of land which currently appears to be
under agricultural use by small-holders.
Potential Capacity
The disposal of wastes at the site would again involve a land raising scheme
rather than landfiUling, as there is no void space as such. However, with the
land area now known to be available for the development, it is likely that
final restored levels of the site will raise the area above the levels of the
surrounding raised ground. However, final landforms could be designed
blend in the site as sympathetically as possible to the general surroundings.
Ownership
h                      It is understood that much of the proposed site area is in public ownership,
although some small areas may be in private hands.
Access
The Welisara site is located off the A3 Colombo-Negombo-Chilaw highway
--                     just before Mattumagala. Access is gained from Horape Road. Horape Road
is macadamised and is approximately 3.6 m wide. It will require considerable
upgrading to make it suitable for the amount of container traffic which
wotdd be generated in transferring bulk waste loads to the site.
IL
To the south of the site the main line rail connection to the east (Ragama)
passes from Colombo, being a major tourist route. However, this line is not
connected directly to the narrow gauge line which passes through Baseline
Road station and it is unlikely that the line could be used for transport of the
waste from the proposed Baseline Road transfer facility.
Habitation
Warehouses, a defence establishment and a miLk factory are located within
500m of the proposed site. Some 25 households are located on 'islands' of
higher ground within the site area and around 80 households are located on
the northern boundary of the site. Further residential areas are located
south and west of the site. As a minimum, the 25 households within the
zerimeter of the site area would require relocation prior to the site
development.
Hydrology
As previously discussed, the site acts as a water storage area during the
monsoon periods, probably preventing serious flooding nearer to Colombo
where there is a natural restriction in the flood plain. The site is thought to

be less than Sm above sea level. Much of the site remains waterlogged for
the greater part of the year and there are two water courses which carry
watcr through the site area, into which the land drains.
An unpaved access road has recently been constructed to the smaller of the       6
two islands within the site and this appears to have significantly altered the
hydrology of parts of the site, preventing some parts from draining. ,
Geology and Hydrogeology
The site is basically a laterite basin overlying granitic bedrock. The lateritc
certainly outcrops north of the site, forming the high area on which the
Naval Base stands, and probably outcrops elsewhere beyond the site
perimeter. In the site area, the laterite is overlain with peat, up to 6m deep
in places but generally in the order of 1-3m, with a thin layer (0.3m) of clay   4
found under the peat in the centre of the site. There is ground water in the
peat and in the laterite, although at this stage it is not clear whether they are
linked and how far the water in the laterite extends.
Flora and Fauna                                                                  4
The area is dominated by reed beds and areas of open water supporting
submerged aquatic plants. Fifty plant species were noted at the site, none of
which are considered rare or endangered. The dominant species are water
grasses, sedges and lilies. Maps from the 1960s indicate that at that time the    C
land was used for paddy production. Since that time, drainage
characteristics of the area have changed (see Section 3 of the main body of
the report) and the land is now used primarily for grazing water buffalo.
Many of these vegetation types found at the site are ideal habitats for
aquatic birds and waders, which abound in the area. However, based on
observations at the site, the disturbance caused by the relatively close
proximity of the local population is likely to have restricted or prevented the
presence of rarer and/or larger animals and birds.
Other Aspects
* Power Supplies A high tension power line crosses the site from east to         C
west and this will have to be diverted prior to any development at the
site.                                                                          C

General Description                                                               C
This site is situated in the Muthurajawela marsh in the administrative district
of Gampaha. The Muthurajawela marsh is a coastal wetland covering some            C
3,000 ha, which is considered to be of major environmental significance. The
marsh area drains into the sea at the northern end and is fed by Dandugam         4
Oya, (Grid reference 103203). The Old Negombo and Hamilton canals pass

directly to the cast and west of the area respectively. Kerawalapitiya is
situated towards the southern end of the marsh area and is crossed from
east to west by a number of small waterways which lirnk the two canals.
The surrounding topography is generally flat with little in the way of rijing
ground into which a landraising scheme could be blended. The land area
suggested for the site appears to be gencrally unsuitable for agricultural
development, although there is evidence of some occasional coconut.
Potential Capacity
As with both the HanweUa and Welisara sitcs, any waste disposal activities
would need to involve landraising rather than landfilling. Although the sitc
I                    boundaries have not been defined, it is likely that a scheme could be devised
on the site to accommodate the volume of waste being considered.
Ownership
It is understood that the site is in public ownership although it is inhabited
by a large number of squatters.
Access
Access can be gained to the site from the A3 Colombo-Negombo-Chilaw
Highway along Gunasekera Mawatha, which is a macadamised road about
3.6 m wide. The site is located about 1.25 km from the A3. There is a
container depot already located at the north-east corner of the proposed
landfill area, but it is considered that Gunasekera Mawatha is not wide
enough, according to normal standards, for container traffic. The
Consultants anticipate that some upgrading of this road will be necessary if
waste is to be transferred to the site by this route.
Habitation
The area has traditionally been dominated by agricultural and fishing
activities although some industrial development has taken place. Fisheries
production in the wetland is estimated at 100kg/ha/yr and is valued at
approximately Rs 100 million. About 3000 fisher-folk are supported by the
fishery. Land use maps of the total area indicate the area consists of marsh,
built-up land, homesteads, paddy and cropland. Principal crops are coconuts,
pineapple and cashew.
Population density and settlement patterns are variable, increasing in size to
the south.
A comprehensive land use plan for the Muthurajawela-Negombo lagoon
area has been prepared which delineates conservation and residential areas,
the latter zone coinciding with the site of the proposed landfill area.
The proposed general area for the landfill is inhabited by low income groups
principally involved in agricultural labouring and daily wage labour in

nearby urban centres. The unemployment rate in thc area is estimated at
30%, compared to a national average of 20%. The quality of life is generally   £
low with most of the inhabitants living below the poverty line, many
receiving food stamps. Most houses have dug weLls or use standing pipes as     £
a primary water source. Kerosene is use for Ughting and fuelwood for
cooking.                                                                       £
It is estimated that the following households would be affected by site
establishment.
* 10 households within the site (which would have to be relocated),
* 40 households within 200m.
* 10 households along the potential access road.
Hydrology
The area is a generally flat marsh area with channelled waterways (elas)        (
running in an east-west direction. The main surface water features in the
project area are the following.                                                 C
* Dandugam Oya.
* Negombo lagoon.
* Muthurajawela marshes.
* Old Negombo and Hamilton Canal (used for transport).
* Subsidiary canals (elas).
The elas generally tend to Link the Old Negombo and Hamnilton Canals.           (
Surface water quality in the marsh is acidic whilst in the lagoon it is alkaline.
It is estimated that the water retention time in the marsh is about 7 days.
Geology and Hydrogeology                                                        C
Geologicalty the area consists of recent sediments, mainly fluvial and marine
in origin. The wetland sediments are less than 6000 years old. coil profiles
examined in the vicinity of the site indicate that silt and a thick layer of peat
occur (>8m). The peat consists of tree, reed and humnus remains, below          c
which can be found silty sand and a black organic clay.
An indication of groundwater quality is provided by data collected from a
well in the vicinity. In general it appears satisfactory for domestic purposes,
with low concentrations of dissolved salts.                                     4

The 'Environmental Profile of Muthurajawela and Negombo Lagoon'
prepared by Euroconsult in 1991 provides mucn detailed information on the
natural habitats, flora and fauna of the Kerawalapitiya site. For comparative

The wetland/marsh and lagoon areas constitute a complex ecosystem which
is linked to the marine environment. The main habitat types include
seagrass beds in the lagoon, mangroves, freshwater marsh and open water
areas, In the marsh the vegetation is dominated by grasses, reeds, sedges
and cattails, whilst in the open-waters are found mainly liLies and submcrged
aquatics. On the water margins are found various tree and shrub specics.
in the lagoon area, the mangroves and seagrass communities predominate.
No rare endemic or threatened species are reported in the area, although the
plant comnmunities arc important ecologicaUly as fish breeding and nursery
grounds.
The diversity of plant communities is reflected in faunal diversity. Birds,
reptiles, amphibia and fish species are numerous and abundant. Amongst
the 96 mammal species are 31 which are reported to be threatened. These
include the painted bat, slender loris, wild cats and mouse-deer. There arc 94
species of reptile considered threatened (several of which are quite rare), 22
species of amphibia and 57 bird species which are considered vulnerablc or
under severe threat. A diverse invertebrate fauna has also been documented
in the area.
Other Aspects
* Planning - The Negombo-Muthurajawela marsh area has been extensively
studied in recent years and both an environmental profile and a land-use
master plan have been produced for the area. The master plan has been
approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and incorporates the folowing
zones.
* Low, moderate and high density residential zones.
* Tourism and fishing zone.
* Mixed urban zone.
* Conservation zone.
r  Recreational zone.
* Utility corridor.
* Water buffer zone.
It would appear that the area identified as having potential for
7                         development as a landfil is classified as a residential zone in the master
plan.

General Description
This site falls within the Hanwella Division of Colombo District and is
located by travelling 3 kam along Meepe-Ingiriya Road and turning left into
the Hewagama Estate Road. The site area is a natural valley, the head of
which is located about 1 km into the Hewagama Estate, (Grid reference
L                      128183). The estate is mainly concemed with the growing of rubber. The

rubber plantation extends down the sidcs of the valley but the base area is
used for paddy production, apparently by a number of small-holders. Small
watercourses down each side of the valley floor drain surface water run-off
from the valley slopes during the wet scasons, the water finally finding it   C
way into the Wak Oya and, thence, into the Kclani Canga.
potential Capacity
Based on an outline level survey undertaken by the Consultants and            (
consequent outline computer aided design as described in Sectiotn AJ.2, two
potential capacities have been estimated for the valley. These are as follows:

Ounersiiipc
The slopes of the valley arc known to be in the ownership of the Hewagama      U
estate. However, it is likely that the base of the site is owned by a number
of smallholders.                                                              c
Access
The main road between Meepe and lngiriya is capable of taking container
traffic, but the Hewagama Estate road would need extensive improvement to
bring it up to the required standard.
There is no access to the site at present by rail, but the narrow gauge        C
railway from Baseline Road, which is currently being upgraded to standard
gauge, is located some 2 kn south-east of the railway crossing on the
Meepe-lngiriya Road.
Rail access starting from a point close to Angampitiya rail halt and following
the boundary of paddy lands is feasible. This route would be some 2 km in
iength. The track would need to cross a ridge for about 0.5 Iam with a
cutting of about 2 m to 5 m in depth. The track would affect some housing       C
and it is estimated that some 10 famiili. would require relocation. The entire
track length would require the acquisition of land currently in private
ownership.
Habitation                                                                     c
There are about 100 houses in the vicirutu of the site, many of them in a      C
small village located towards the lower . id of the valley, some 7_5 1cm from
the valley head. In this village there are a temple, a school and a cooperative
store.
Up to 50 farmers are said to fann the land within the valley.                  C

Hydrology
Small streams run along thc length of the valley floor at this site, on either
side of the area worked for paddy. The survey indicated a drop of some
17 m in the level of the stream beds over a distance of about 800 m. The
catchment area for the streams is very local and nny storm flow will be
.                        discharged immediately. Flood afflux during storm conditions is likely to be
,                        of short duration and be dispersed within a few hours.
Assuming a design rainfall intensity of 50mm per hour and a run-off
coefficient of 0.40, it would be technically feasible to design an interceptor
drain to divert surface water from higher ground away from the proposed
-                        landfill area.
Geology and Hydrogcology
According to the Avissawella Geological Survey sheet applcable to this area,
the locations of all three sites within the Padukka area, namely Hewagama,
Pitumpe and Morakelle, faUl within the Migmatite Zone. This means that at
all three locations, the underlying rock strata is Biotite and/or Homblend
with grey white Feldspar. In general, this type of rock has low permeability.
The hydrogeology of all three sites is also somewhat similar. At this site the
depth of overburden (the topsoil and completely weathered rock layer) is
about 2 m. As the underlying rock is of low permeability, it is the
everburden which is the water-bearing strata. From observations made at
dugweLs located close to the site, it would appear that the water table is
almost at the ground surface.
The rapid fluctuation of water table with rains reveals that the rate of
infiltration through the overburden is very high, indicating high
permeability. There are a significant number of domestic dugwells drawing
water from this shallow aquifer for drinking and other domestic purposes
and, without adequate safeguards, the impact of a landfill operation on the
quality of these water sources would be of serious concem.
Flora and Fauna
This site is situated in a valley where paddy cultivation is actively practised.
The site is currently covered by uniform vegetation, dominated by grass with
some occasional hardwood. Abundancy is high, whereas diversity is low,
which is to be expected with land used for cultivation.
Birds and butterflies were observed at the site, but there were no fish in the
stream on the periphery of the valley floor, possibly as a result of the use of
pesticides and fertilizers.
The area surrounding the valley floor forms part of a rubber plantation. No
evidence was detected of imrportant habitats or threatened plant and animal
species.

General Description
This site, adjacent to Pitumpe, is another natural vallcy site which falls
within the Hanwella Division of the Colombo District. It is located about 0.4
kn along the road leading to Waga after turning left off thc Meepe-Ingiriya
Road, (Grid reference 126184). The sides of the valley do not appear to
extend to the same height as at the Hewagama site. Again, the valley floor
is used for paddy cultivation, but the slopes sustain a nixture of woodland
rather than just rubber. A considerable amount of residential development
appears to be located amongst these woodlands. Drainage waters again find      C
their way into the Wak Oya and, thence, into the Kelani Ganga.
Road access to the site is generally poor but the narrow gauge Kelani Valley
railway is located only some 0.4 km from the site. ,
Potential Capacity
This site is another natural valley which is located towards Waga off the
Meepe-Inginya Road. Again, the bottom of the valley is used for growing
paddy and the slopes are wooded. Based on the same methodology                  C
undertaken for the previous site, the two potential capacities have been
estimated for the valley as follows:
Approach I                         Approach 2

420,000120,0
Ownership
It is understood that ownership of the site area is in the hands of a large      -
number of smallholders.
AcCeSs
From the Meepe-Ingiriya Road the Waga Road would need considerable
improvement to accept container traffic. This improvement is likely to
involve the acquisition of a considerable amount of residential property and
the relocation of the families from those properties.
There is no access to the site at present by rail, but the narrow gauge
railway is located about 0.4 km north-west of the rail crossing on the Meepe-
Ingiriya Road.
Rail access would need to start at a point between Angampitiya and
Pinnawela rail halts and would be about 1 km in length. Along its length,
the track will need to cross a stream, which will need to be either culverted
or bridged over, and will need to cross a road and a paddy field.

Although the site is closer to the railway line than the other two sites,
providing rail access will involvL problems including a deep cutting and the
acquisition of private land and property. These problems are likely to be
more severe than those for either Hewagama or Morakelle.
Habitation
Comparatively, the area surrounding this site is more developed and
populated than the other two potential sites in the vicinity. There are a
significant number of houses, many with wells, located within and adjacent
to the site.
Hydrology
As with the previous valley, Nis valley also contains a small stream with a
bed level difference of some 6 m along its length. Again, the catchment area
for the stream is very local. However, storm flow will be discharged at a
slower rate than the site at Hewagama, but here too, the flood afflux will not
be sustained for long periods.
Assuming a design rainfaLI intensity of some 50 mm per hour and a run-off
coefficient of 0.40, interceptor drains would appear to be technically feasible
at this site to prevent surface run-off from the valley sides from entering the
landfill.
Geology and Hydrogeology
This site is located in sloping terrain. Dugwells located close to the site
reveal that the overburden comprises of about 1.5 m of soils and subsoils,
below which there is about 3 m of weathered rock. The water table
fluctuates between about 2 m and 4 m below ground level, depending on the
season. There are also seepage springs on the hill slopes surrounding the
valley bottom.
Flora and Fauna
This site is situated by the side of the Waga Road and the main vegetation in
the valley floor is again paddy. The surrounding area is inhabited and
contains various tree species including Jak, Coconut and Areconut.
Birds and butterflies were observed at the site. Again, no evidence was
detected of important habitats or threatened plant and animal species,

gravel road for about 1.5 km, (Crid reference 127187). The site is similar in
general appearance to the site at Pitumpe, having slopes sustaining mixed
woodland with paddy being grown in the valley floor. Drainage of the area
again flows into the Wak Oya.
Road access to the site is very poor and substantial highway improvemcnt
would be necessary if the site were to be developed. However, the narrow
gauge Kelani Valley railway line is within 0.5 km of the site.                     {
Potential Capacity
This site is a further natural vallcy which is located off the Pinnawela-
lodakanda gravel road. Again, the bottom of the valley is used for growing
paddy and the slopes are wooded. Based on the same methodology
undertaken for the previous two sites, the two potential capacities have been
estimated for the valley as follows:

Ownersh ip
It is understood that ownership of the site area is in the hands of a large
number of smallholders.                                                             (
Access
Both the Pitumpe-Waga and the Pinnawela-lodakanda roads would require
extensive imnprovement before they would be capable of accepting the level (
of container traffic anticipated for the landfill faclity.
The site is located very close to the main railway Line and rail access is          g
feasible starting from a point close to the road crossing at Pinnawela. The
length will be about 0.5 km, running mostly in flat terrain. This site appears
to be the easiest site for rail access of the three sites under consideration in
|this area.
Habitation
About 25 houses were observed on the high land immediately surrounding              6
the site during the Consultants' site visit.
Hydrology
At this site, the surveyed stream bed levels indicates little difference along its
length, but the valley is narrow and deep. Here too, the catchment for the
stream is local and interceptor drains are technically feasible. The flood          6
afflux may be sustained for longer periods than for the previous two sites

due to the proximity of the valley to the Wak Oya, which is a tributary of
the Kelani River and is the substantial stream which flows around the
eastem perimeter of the site at Hanwella.
A design rainfall intensity of 50 mm per hour and a run-off coefficient of 0.40
are recommended for this site, in line with the recommendations for the
other two sites.
Geoogy and Hydrogeology
This site is located in a fairly steep valley. The water table is almost at
surface level and, as already stated, there is a perennial stream which runs
along the valley floor. There is comparatively little overburden at the site,
comprising of top soil and wcathered rock to 2 m in depth.
Flora and Fauna
The dominant vegetation at this site was again paddy surrounded by a
rubber plantafion. On one side, Coconut, Jak and Breadfruit trees were also
observed. Birds and butterflies were seen at the site, but no evidence was
detected of important habitats or threatened plant and animal species.

A31          METHODOLOCY
This section compares the various technical, environmental and planning         I
characteristics of each of the sites and highlights the advantages and
disadvantages of each. The comparison is summarised in tabular form,
where possible on a quantitative basis, although, due to the nature of this     C
preliminary work, the lack of consistent data largely precludes this. The sites
are compared under the same series of headings as in the last section. ,
A3.2         POTEAWAL CAPACr y
The potential capacity of the sites is summarised in Table A3.2a below.          C
Table A3.2a  Potential Capacity of Sites                                                      (

Morakellc                                       4.7 - 5.3 x 10' m'
The sites at Hanwella, Welisara and Kerawalapitiya are all large, relatively      C
flat areas of land which, it is thought, could be engineered to provide
sufficient volume to meet the disposal requirements of the Colombo area for
the next 15 years. Each of the schemes would take the form of landraising
rather than landfilling, as there is no void as such to fill. At both Hanwella
ancL Welisara there is rising ground adjacent to the proposed site areas and c
landforms could be so designed to blend with the general topography of the
area. At Kerawalapitiya there is no rising ground and it will be difficult to
blend with local topography. For this reason, a landraising scheme at
Kerawalapitiya may be seen as unacceptable on the grounds of visual impact.
The remaining three sites at Hewagama, Pitumpe and Morakelle, near to
Padukka are located in valleys and as such their capacity is Umited. The aim
of the landfilling exercise will be to fill the valley, if necessary raising the
filled section sigrificantly above the existing valley ridges to maximise void
space and provide adequate run-off for surface water. The two approaches          4
adopted in our assessment of volume potential at these sites looked at two
extremes of this final contouring potential.                                      4

N7       She ut approach took a very conservative view of final levels, filling the
1valeys to not exceed e,xistirg high points. The second approach was based
0o1 what was possible using the latest western practices in landfilling
technology rather than maintaining a pleasing landforn. Realistically, in Sri
LankIca, where good enginecring skills are available but there is limited
experience in modem landfilling techniques, volume estimates somewhere
'I    i' ' +#'b4itbetween the two extremes quoted are likely to provide a reasonable premise
on which to proceed.
On this basis, it can clearly be seen that none of the three remaining sites on
their own is klielv to have sufficient capacity to provide the long term
di.sposal security required. However, as the sites are relatively close togcther,
it may be a reasonable strategy to develop more than one of the sites to
approach the capacity required. This may of course have implications as far
l,1.                     as World Bank funding of the development of the sites is concerned, as it
would be desirable to develop them consecutively, with the second (and
possibly third) coming on stream as the first (or second) nears completion.
A3.3         OWNERSHIP
Table A3.3a indicates the ownership situation at each of the sites as it is
understood by the Consultants. In order to avoid public concern, direct
information from owners has not been sought and the information shown is
based on local knowledge and conversations with some local residents.

The table shows that only two sites are in public ownership, Welisara and
Kerawalapitiya. The remaining sites are in private ownership and delays in
the development of the sites could be encountered in the negotiation of
agreements for purchase or letting of the sites for landfill purposes.

By Rail
Four of the six landfill sites under consideration, which are to the east of S
Colombo, are within about 3 km of the Kelani Valley railway line as it passes
from Padukka to Waga, some 40 km to the east of Colombo. The two
remaining sites, those at Welisara and Kerawalapitiya which are to the north
of Colombo, are not directly accessible from this line, although the Colombo-
Ragama line passes close to the site at Weisara.  It is thought that a link           C
could be built near to Colombo central to enable trains to move from one
line to another, but at this stage, such a possibility has not been pursued. It        (
is also considered that as both the Kerawalapitiya and Welisara sites are less
than 20 km from Colombo, transfer by rail would not be an economic
proposition.
ByRcd R
Road access is possible to all of the sites, although roads local to all but the
Hanwella site will probably require considerable upgrading to accommodate               £
the considerable amount of container and other traffic which will be
generated by the development and operation of the facility. There is a (
proposal to build a Colombo-Katunayake Expressway to the east of the
Welisara site, which could improve future access to that area.

Families living within the boundaries of the proposed site will need to be
relocated. Mitigation measures may be possible to protect those living close
to the boundaries and avoid the need for their relocation. Such mitigation
measures would typically take the form of earth screening bunds and dense
vegetation to protect against noise and visual impact. Ideally a protection
zone of some 200-300 m around the site would be desirable, but it is realised
that this may mean that a large number of residents may still need to be
relocated. This could delay the implementation of site development.
Alternatively, the area of the site could be reduced to accommodate the zone,
which in all cases would mean a loss in available void capacity to a point
where it is unlikely that any of the sites could be sensibly engineered to
meet the required capacity. Such a protection zone is therefore likely to be
unrealistic. However, it is considered that a zone of at least 50 m should be
retained to enable some form of realistic screening.
With recent delineation of the boundaries around Welisara, it has been
found that more households than initially anticipated will be affected by any
development at the site, especially around the northern boundary. The area
around Pitumpe was also seen to be fairly developed and may well have the
greatest number of households that would be affected of all the sites
considered. The village at the bottom of the valley at Hewagama is also of
significance. It is possible that the landfill could be engineered and adequate
measures taken to mitigate many of the effects, but it is likely that the
inhabitants will oppose the development.
Early consultations with local residents and NGOs are recommended prior to
development at any of the sites.

The hydrology at each of the sites varies considerably. Kerawalapitiya is part
of a coastal wetlands area. Welisara used to be used for agriculture but this             4
has now been abandoned due to frequent flooding of the area, possibly
following the construction of the railway embankment on the eastern                        a
boundary of the site. The Hanwetla site is in the flood plain of the KelaLid
Ganga and Wak Oya and is subject to flooding several times each year. The                  a
three sites around Padukka are valley sites, which, due to the heavy seasonal             l
rainfall in Sri Lanka, are subject to high run-off into the valley floors and
seasonal streams run through each of the sites.
Modem  landfill engineering and operating techniques can provide solutions
in relation to the control and management of surface waters. These are
aimed at minimising the potential of the landfill to poUute. Such measures
include the maintenance of separate drainage systems for surface waters and
leachate within the site, leachate control and treatment facilities and surface
water monitoring programmes. Such measures are normally combined with
those to protect ground waters.
It is therefore theoretically possible to provide a considerable measure of
protection to surface waters at any of the sites under consideration.
However, depending upon the level of measures that need to be taken, their
A1                        implementation can be expensive and require a high level of skill and

knowledge by the operating staff. The sites at Welis-ar,  Kerawalapitiya and
Hanwelld, which are subject to frequent flooding, arv likely to be difficult
sites to manage with regard to the prevention of water Polutiuon and
measures to safcguard against potential poDution are likely to be expensive,
-               Great emphasis will also need to be placed on the adequacy of the
manaagement of the landfill development and operations if future problems
are to be avoided.
Development of the Hanwella site has other associated problems in relation
to surface waters. The site is in the flood plain of the l;eljnij Any
developments in the flood plain which changes its ability to accommodate
flood waters are likely to have affects both up-strcam alnd down-stream of
-1                      the site and areas not presently subject to flooding mav well start to
experience it. Also, the Ambatale water supply intake from the Kelani is
some 10 kilometres downstream of the site and there are fears amongst the
local population and staff of the water supply authority that pollution from
the site, if the site is not properly managed, may enter the water supply to
Colombo. At this stage it is not possible to characterise t2r predict such an
impact.
The Welisara site currently acts as a retenbon basin for tlood waters brought
_  5                     down through the site by the Kalu Oya and its tributaries from a large
Jl g                    catchment area to the east. Some form of constriction in the vicinity of
where the Kalu Oya meets the Oid Negombo canal and subsequently the
2)                       Kelani Ganga means that water backs up into the site luring the monsoon
seasons. If a landfil is developed at Welisara, the final finished landform will
be well above flood levels and be impervious to water penetration. The area
wiU no longer therefore be able to retain flood waters .and additional
flooding is likely to occur both upstream and downstream of the site without
additional protective measures. If the site is developed for landfiliing, it is
recornmended that a study be commissioned to determiine what measures, if
any, can be implemented downstream of the site to imnprove: capacity during
the wet seasons.
The three sites near to Padukka are likely to cause less of a problem in their
development in relation to the protecton of surface waters. Cut-off drains
would almost certainly need to be constructed around the perimeters of the
)                       sites to intercept water flowing towards the sites from the surrounding areas
and to take uncontaminated surface waters from finally restored areas as the
sites develop. Phasing measures would also need to be designed to ensure
that contaminated waters are kept separated from surface waters in the
valley floors.

The geology and hydrogeology varies considerably at the various sites. The
Hanwella site was originally favoured by the Sri Lankan authorities because
the geology is natural day overlying granite and granitic gneiss bedrock-
Clay can form a good natural liner for a landfill site to contain leachate and
help prevent ground and surface water pollution. If it is present at the site, a
it enables the site to be developed cost effectively compared to sites where
day has to be imported or another form of synthetic lining material used. _
Cay is also found at the sites at Kerawalapitiya and Welisara, although at
Welisara it is known that the quantities available are insufficient to meet the
needs of a day liner. The suitability of the clay at both of these potential
sites has also not yet been determined.
The geology at the three valley sites at Padukka consists of top soil and
weathered rock overlying bedrock of Biotite and/or Hornblend. The bedrock

*             is Likely to be impervious anid almost certainly the overburden would need to
be removed if any of the sites were to be developed as landfills.
The reason for considerable emphasis being placed on finding sites where an
underlying strata is of low permeability is to prevent leachate, which is
formed within the landfill, mainly during the degradation of the organic
fracdon of the waste, and which is highly polluting, from entering ground
watcrs which are used as a potable supply. The significance of groundwater
pollution depends to a large extent upon the existing and proposed use of
the water resource. Key factors determining the probability of groundwater
pollution are as follows.
* The thickness and integrity of the impervious clay or other lining of the
_                         landfill site designed to prevent groundwater pollution.
a Hydrogeological and hydrological conditions in the area, such as the
degree of groundwater movement in relation to exi.Ung and potential
-                         wells.
It is difficult at any of the sites to predict and characterise the impact on
gEroundwaters without a full geotechnical investigation. This forms part of
-                      Activity 2 of the original study TOR and is currently being undertaken at the
-    g                 Welisara site only. However, the sensitivity of some of the receptors is
readily apparent. Should hydraulic continuity exist between groundwater
which has become polluted and the wetland system at Kerawalapitiya
(Muthurajawela system), sig-nificant damage to the local ecosystem could
arise. Polution of the groundwaters at Hanwella, assumning continuity with
sources feeding into the Kelani Ganga, could have a significant impact on
plant and wildlife both in and around the river. Such poUution could also
have a marked impact on local inhabitants, both in their use of the river and
in the wells they use for their potable supplies.
Similarly, pollution of ground water at Welisara could have a significant
- -                  impact on local potable water supplies and on plant and wildlife in the Kalu
Oya. It is known that piped water is available in the vicinity of the site, and
1i                     this will almost certainly have to be extended to households likely to be
__                     affected.
]                      The sensitivity at the three Padukka sites is more difficult to determine at
this stage. It is apparent that the local aquifer is contained in the shallow
overburden overlying the bedrock and any pollution escaping frorn the sites
could quickly affect local abstraction points. However, because of the
terrain, these aquifers are likely to be fairly localised and the extent of any
problems caused may be limited. If any of these sites were chosen this
aspect would require further investigation. Alternative water supplies may
need to be provided for those households affected.
It is thought likely that the aquifer from the Morakelle site may feed in to
the Wak Oya, which is reasonably closeby, and this in turn feeds in to the
Kelani. Again, if this site were chosen, this aspect would warrant further
investigation.

Some of the sites !,how considerable diversity in the flora and fauna they -
support. Kerawalapitiya is situated in a natural wetlands and, as has already
been stated, wetland habitats are diminishing in Sri Lanka due to land _
conversion. The remaining wetland sites are therefore of increasing
conservation value since they support many endernic species (many of which              a
are rare) and, in addition, they are important roosting sites for birds and
spawning grounds for fish. The Muthurajawela marsh and Negombo a
lagoon support a significant fishery which contributes substantially to local
livelihoods.
Welisara appears once to have been part of the Muthurajawela system, but                N
in more recent times has been used for cultivation. Works in the vicinity of a
the junction of the Kalu Oya with the Old Negombo canal appear to have
excluded salt water intrusion into the area and have isolated the Kalu Oya
from the Muthurajawela marsh system. The conservation value of the area
has therefore, in recent times, been greatly diminished.
The sites at Hanwella, Hewagama, Pitumpe and Morakelle, are located in an                _
area which has been .ubject to human habitation over a long period and has
been extensively degraded ecologically over time. The area now appears to a
offer little of conservation or habitat value. Generally these areas have been
subject to cultivation and both flora and fauna display resulting low diversity a
and abundancy.

,44        CHOICE OF SiTE FOR FURTHER STUDY
ASI        INTRODUcION                                                                    (
From the discussion in the preceding sections it is readily apparent that none
of the sites fall into the category of what would be considered an 'ideal' site.  C
They each exhibit a number of disadvantages relating to cipacity, access and
environmental or socio-economic factors. However, from previous similar       (
studies undertaken by the Consultants in Sri Lanka, it is considcred that a so
called 'ideal' site does not exist, certainly not within economic transport
distance from Colombo. It is therefore apparent that some compromise          C
solution will need to be found that will meet the disposal needs of the
Greater Colombo area whilst providing adequate protection to local            (
communities and the environment.
In theory, engineering solutions can be found for most problems relating to   C
landfill development. This may be an oversimplification but in many
respects it can be true. However, in practical terms, some such solutions are  (
accomplished at considerable cost, both in terms of resources and in the skills
and knowledge required to implement and maintain them. Even in
industrialised countries economic considerations often rule out such          C
solutions.
The aim of the solution must be to provide the security of disposal necessary
at reasonable cost, both in financial terms and in terms of any negative
impacts on the community. lThis must be accomplished at a level of            t
engineering and operation that can be sustained in line with the current
knowledge and expertise available.                                            (
This section therefore assesses the information discussed previously and
presents the conclusions reached and proposed recomrnendations. In            C
reaching the conclusions, we have considered the following criteria:
* capacity;                                                                   {
* availability;
* access, including transport factors;                                       C
* habitation;
* the potential for water pollution and flooding; 
* impacts on wildlife habitats and biodiversity.

CONCLUSIONS
. 421      CCapacity 
Section A3.2 sets out details of the anticipated capacities of the six sites. This  {
shows that only three of the sites appear to have sufficient capacity to meet
the required needs. These are the sites at Hanwella, Welisara and
Kerawalapitiya. Of the sites in the vicinity of Padukka, Pitumpe has a

)                 comparatively very small potential capacity and can be ruled out on this
basis. Neither of thc remaining two Padukka arca sites (Sites d and n have
sufficient capacity on their own to meet the stated rcquirements. The only
way they can remain in consideration is if they are regarded together as a
sijngle strategy. Even on this basis, the available void would only appcar to
be of the order 8.7 to 9.8 x 10h m3, as against a total requirement, including
)                       cover, bunds and earthworks, which could approach 14 x10* m3. However,
based on experiencc in the UK and clsewhere where waste arising
)                       calculations formulated on volume estimates have subsequently been found
to be high, it is possible that the capacity of the two sites combined might be
found to be closer to meeting the requirements than seems apparent.
On this basis, in considering the potential capacity of the sites, we can
surnmmarise our conclusions as follows.
* 77te following sites appear to be capable of beintg enginecred to provide
sufficient capacity;
* Hanwclla, near Padukka;
3  Welisara;
* Kerawalapitiya.
* The following sites together rnay be capable of being engincerd to provide a
3                   combined capacity approaching the required needs;
* Hewagama and Morakellc.
w77te following site appears to have insufficient capacity to justify the costs
of development and should be discounted;
* Pitumpe.
ASL2        Availability
Ownership of the land is a major factor in considering how quickly each of
the sites could be developed. If the sites are in public ownership,
development should be able to proceed reasonably smoothly, assuming that
adequate consultations take place with those who live close to the site or
have some other interest that may be affected by the development.
Negotiating for the purchase of land in private ownership, especially where
there are a large number of owners, could cause considerable delay to
_                       development, possibly to the point where the development of the site
becomes untenable.
On this basis, our conclusions are fairly straight forward and are as follows:
7 The following sites are in public ownership and, subjcct to satisfactoy
public consultations, development could proceed without undue delay.

Table A3.4a shows that rail transfer is not possible from Bascline Road to the
Kerawsrlvmpitiya site and is difficult, although not impossiblc, to Welisara.     C
Access by rail to Welisara would probably require a link being constructed
adjacent to the central railway depot in Colombo, so that trains could readily
transfer from one line to the other. Due to the short distance (less than 20
km) from central Colombo to the Welisara site, it is however, unlikely that
rail transfer would be an economic proposition for the site.                       c
Rail access to all the remaining sites, wl'i-h are close to the narrow gauge       4
Kelani Valley line, will require the construction of a branch line into the site
or to a suitable point where a reccption terminal can be built to allow the
waste to be off-loaded onto rough-terrain vehicles for delivery to the landfill
face. The cost of the branch line and reception terminal will need to be
taken into account in the financial analysis of the final proposed
development, which will form part of the overall study.
In relation to transport of containerised waste by road, access to the             4
Hanwella site, which uses High Level Road from Colombo, is likely to have
the least impact in relation to traffic generation. High Level Road is one of
the main arteries out of Colombo and is of a good standard. However,
journey times are likely to be more than one hour in each direction and
longer during peak traffic periods. Road access to the WeLisara and
Kerawalapitiya sites is gained via the main Colombo-Katunayake road, and,
if built, the proposed Colombo-Katunayake Expressway is planned to run
just east of the Welisara site, which could improve road access to that site.
All the remaining sites are currently accessible using local roads, which, in
some cases, will need considerable upgrading. This will add to the cost of
developing those sites and would also be included in the final financial            -
analysis, if appropriate.                                                           -
Because no decision has yet been made with regard to which method of
transport should be used, none of the sites at this stage can be discounted on
the basis of access. it is unlikely that transfer by rail would be an economic
option for either the sites at WeLisara or Kerawalapitiya due to their close
proximity to the Colombo area.
A4.2-4       Habitation
The need for the resettlement of those households affected by the landfill
development is a significant consideration of the World Bank and the Sri
Lankan authorities. The development of a resettlement plan is one of the
study requirements as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment
ENYUCHbEHTAL RncUuc,Mi MA$*AOU.t              P-rP  y E&    4AL Rs'w - WM*A
A31



As far as the sites still under consideration are concemed, it would appear
from our initial investigations that at none of the sites is the number of
households to be relocated likely to be greater than 30.
In addition to this, the alignment of access routes would inevitably aftcct
some households and some further resettlement may be required. However,
careful route alignment would minimise this.
In summary, the requirement to resettle households affected by the landfill
development and the access routes to it does not appear to be of great
relative significance when comparing one site with another and no particular
site appears to be particularly better or worse than the others in this regard.
,11.2-      Pollution Potential and Flooding
The potential pollution of ground and surfacc waters from the release of
leachatc is one of the greatest conccrns in relation to the development of a
landfill site. However, the pollution potential can bc mitigated by providing
the site with an impervious liner so that the leachate is contained.
At the Hanwella site there is a natural band of clay at the surface which, it is
thought, could be engineered to provide a natural containment Liner. Clay is
also present in the substrate of the Weisara and Kerawalapitiya sites, but it
is suspected that this may not be in large enough quantities and may be
fragmented with alluvial deposits which would be of a higher permeability.
Its use as a natural lining material is therefore precluded. Development of
these two sites would require considerable engineering, possibly involving
measures to decrease permeability over the base of the site and the
construction of waterproof bunds. These options are likely to be of
significant expense in terms of total development costs and potentially could
make them considerably more expensive to develop than some of the other
options.
At the remaining sites at Hewagama and Morakelle there is a relatively thin
layer of overburden above impervious bed rock. In the development of these
sites, the overburden would need to be removed and the site founded oti the
bedrock. Assuming that the bed rock is not excessively fissured, it should
_                        therefore be possible to install low cost pollution prevention measures at
these sites.
For the development of all the above sites, once the leachate has been
-.                    contained, it will require proper management and treatment. This treatment
_-                      may take a number of fonns, but it is understood that the cost of an
_~                      appropriate leachate treatment facility has been included in the initial
_j                      implementation budget by the World Bank. The aim of the treatment facility
will be to treat the leachate to a level of purity at which it can safely be
discharged to surface waters without significant adverse affect.
The establishment of a landfill may disrupt local drainage patterns. At the
Hewagama and Morakelle sites, cut-off drains will need to be constructed
around the perimeter of the sites to intercept surface waters from the

surrounding areas and divert them away from the landfill so that they do
not add to the leachate problem. This is Ukely to be a significant expense in
the total development budget of these sites.
At both the Hanwella and Wcisara sites, the whole potential site areas are
subject to flooding on a frequent basis. Considerable engineering will be
required to protect the landfill from thcse flood waters and any major breach
of the site's flood defences, once either of the sites has been operational for
some time, would almost certainly lead to a major pollution incident in the
area. The construction of a landfill in either location is also likely to have an
affect on flood characteristics locally, potentially leading to the flooding of
areas not currently subject to it. If either of these sites is to bc developed as
a landfili, a further study would be required to consider the upstream and
downstream effects of the development.
On this basis, in considering the potential of the sites to cause polludon and
the effects of flooding both on the sites and in the surrounding areas we
draw the following conclusions.
* The following sitcs appear to bc capablc of development at reasonabic cost
incorporating measures to contain Icachate and prevent pollution of local
surface and gro'*nd waters;
. Hewagama and Morakellc.
* The following sites appear to be capablc of development at higher cost         S
incorporating measurcs to contain leachate and prevent pollution of local
surface and ground waters;                                                     a
* Kerawalapitiya;
* Welisara;
* Hanwella.
* The following sites, if developed, are likely to cause flooding of areas not
cu-rently subject to flooding and could present a significant risk of
pollution at some time in the future if they are not adequately managed;
* Welisara;                                                                    z

A4.Z6        Impacts on Wildlife Habitats and Biodiversity                                      C
The only significant loss of natural habitat would occur at Kerawalapitiya.       (
This is considered significant due to the diminishing extent of such habitat in
the country and there would be little scope to mitigate this impact. Similarly,
the presence of threatened and rare endemic species at this site is a             C
significant concern. It is theoretically possible to adopt site management
practices to minimise disturbance to the local fauna. However, the success of (
such measures cannot be evaluated at this stage.

_Jso, the Sning of a large area of this site with an impermeable membrane is
_ -                     likely to altcr the hydrogeological characteristics in the Negombo-
Muthurajawela area, with ensuing effects on plants and wildlife. Should the
lining system fail at any point in the future, the sensitivity of the receptors is
such that the release of leachate could havc a significant detrimental impact

OrFFSrrE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS OF LANDFILL DEVELOPMENT
This annex summarises the calculations undertaken to make an initial
i _assessment of the likely impacts on the existing hydrological regime of the
area following the (progressive) development of the landfill at Welisara.
STORAGE CAPACm' CALCULATIONS
Cat dtmcnt Data
Total Catchmcnt area which contains Wclisara              61 Km' 2
Catchment arca upstream of the site                       50 Km2
Area of Landfill site                                      1.1 Km2
The maximum flood level at the Welisara site
above the normal water surface level.                     2 m
Storage Capacity of thc landfill site area
The maximum water storage capacity of the landfill site is
1.1 Km2 x 2 = 2.2 Million cubic meters (m3).
Storage Capacity of the upstream catcihment arca
Using topographical maps, the total length measured of the rivers upstream
from the site is 48.5 km
Based on the very small gradient, approximately 1/5000, over the catchment
and knowledge of the locality the average width of the flood plain of these
rivers is estimated to be 0.4 Km. This takes into account the land on both
sides of the river. It is also estimated that the height of flood storage water
will be progressively greater downstream towards the site and, therefore, an
average height of 1.5m has been taken.
The area of land acting as upstream storage is therefore
48.5 x 0.4 = 19.4 Km2
Total storage capacity  = 48500 x 400 x 1.5 Xm3
= 29.1 M m3
The storage capacity lost due to the development of the landfill, 22 M m3 is
approximately 87% of the total upstream storage capacity, 29.1 M in3.
PrAK FLOW DISCHARGE CALCULATIONS
Using Dicken's Formula run-off equation, using an appropriate coefficient,
the present volumes of run-off after a peak rainfall event can be calculated.
Flood Peak Q = CM3^

Since the catchment has such a low gradient, we may assume that the flood
flow is partly absorbed by the flood retention basin. If we assume the flood
retention is 50% then the Peak Runoff in the arca of the site will be;            C
Q  =  50 x2:3                                                          r
Q  =   11 m3l'mI
This means tihat, although an additional 2.2 million cubic metres of water will   C
be added to the systern, due to the large amount of upstream storage space it
will be ieleast-4 mradually                                                        C

Using Manning's Equation for open channels it is calculated that this extra
volume of water, given the existing channel dimensions, will cause the water
to rise by 5 to 6cm. The calculations are shown below.

At times of peak flow the channel and the flood plain both sides of the river
act as a water conduit.

During peak flow it is estimated that an extra 112 m3 s Will bc added to the
peak water flow in the area of the sitc. This would increase the discharge to

I1101  -  10.02 x A x 1.5 x 0.014

-         |                h = 2.05 m
-1        |               h in the previous calculation was 2.00 m
_                          Therefore, an increase in discharge of 112 m3 s' will causc the height of the
_                          water tc rise by 5 cm. In the main report the figure of 10 cm has been used
as a conservative value due to the assumptions and approximations that
_                         have been made.
In a similar manner, MAanning's Equation can also be used to show that due
to the progressively increasing water volumes downstream the effect of
increasing the discharge by 112 m3 Sl at peak flow becomes insignificant.
Therefore, the flooding/backing up of water will not alter significar'ly from
the present.
All the calculations are based on the stated estimations and assumptions. At
present there are no water monitoring stations along the Kalu River and no
precise figures on the peak flow characteristics for this particular catchment.
A detailed hydrological survey would be required over a full season in order
_    *:                   to give a more complete review ot the hydrological situation.

PROPOSAL FOR TH 1E
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT
*                                  WEITHIN THE WESTERN l'ROVINCIAL COUNCIL
1. PREAMBLE
S                       The Western Provincial Council (WPC), one ol the eighit provincial councils in
the island, was sanctioned by the Thirtentih Anmendment to the Constitution
*                       which introduced the PrOvincial Cotuncil system to the administrative structure
of Sri Lanka in November 1 987. Environmental protection is a subject devolved
*                       to the Provincial Councils and the WPC has to provide leadership in this field.
As the island's most densely populated province, which includes the Colonmbo
Metropolitan Area (CMvIA) conmprisiny t'he City of Colonbo, and several large
suburbs such as the Dehiwela-Mt Lavinia municipal areas, thc Wl'C5s
responsibility in protecting the environment is of paramount importance,
W 1                compared with otlher provincial cotincils.
_    §                   The Government of Sri Lanka (COSL) ha1s made a committment to achieve a
Newly Industrialized Country (NIC) status by the vcar '()0(. This will
)    |                   undoubtedly stress the carrying capacity of the urban ecosvstemns in the
province to the fullest. It is antiipated that most of the development will be in
3    B                   the WPC due to the current insufficiency of required infrastructure services in
the other parts of the country. The industrialization of the two free trade zones,
3    Z                   which are within the CMA and the rapid population growth in the suburban
areas of the cit)y have created severe problems with regard to coilection and
disposal of solid wastes and the treatment and disposal of industrial effluents.
This has resulted in significant deterioration of the qualitv of the local water
resources, land and air. Therefore, preparation of suitable administrative and
3      §                  legal infrastructure to handle environmental concerns is an essential step that
should be taken without further delay.
Additionally, due steps taken to protect the environment would, in the long
run, be beneficial to the provincial economv through sustained development
|and increased productivity of the labour force as a result of the improved health
conditions and quality of life of the people in the area. Timely investment in
the protection of environment would ultimately lead to human resource
development and enhancement in the quality of life.
2. POPULATION
The Western Province contributes 26.4 per cent to the country's total
_    ]                population. The Colombo District in itself accounts for 11.5 per cent of the total
population. The population density of the province is 1,174 persons per sq. km
_  ]                      (1992). The Colombo district where the hub of economnic activity is concentrated
in the island has a density of 2,891 persons per sq. km. Other two districts in
the province-Campaha and Kalutara-shows a lower density of i,067 and 570



C
persons per sq. km, respectively.  lh  City of Colombo, which is the most     c
densely populated urban center in the country has a density of 16,313 persons
per sq km. (Additional information on population distribution by Divisional   c
Secretary Divisions is in Figure 1).                                          c
3. ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUND
The Western P'rovince consists of three administrative districts namely Colombo,
Gampaha and Kalutara. These three districts comprise 34 Divisional Secretary  C
Divisions (Figure 2), The province has 2,493 Grama Niladhiari Divisions, which
is the smallest administrative unit. The LOCal Government Admoinistration of
the provinice is inclusive of 3 Municipal Councils (MC), 11 Urban Councils (LC)
and 28 Pradeshiva Sabl as (PS),                                               c
3.1   AIDMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF TI-HL WESTERN PROVINCIAL COUNCIL
c
The WPC is a 10.1 member Council, consisting oif elected representatives, and
has legislative power over the devolved functions in the first list of the     C
Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of thL Deniocratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka. The Governor, appointed bv the President, exercises executive   C
authoritv through the Board of M1inisters. The Board of Ministers, is headed bv
the Chief Minister who is responsible for the implementation of council
decisions. The Board of Ministers are collectively responsible and Lnswerable
to the Provincial Council. The WPC consists of five members on the Board of
Ministers, eich having separate functions in the respective ministries. The
functions of each ministry is listed in Annex 1.
C
The Chief Secretary, with a rank similar to) a Cabinet Ministry Secretaryv is the
chief executive of the Provincial Council. Four Deputy Secretaries, namelv     {
Deputy Secretarv (Planning), Deputy Secretarv (Finance), Deputy Secretarv
(Administration) and Deputy Secretary (Engineering) are in-charge of each
division. The Secretaries of the five Provincial Ministries are responsible for
implementation of the functions assigned to e:"-h Ministry.
4. JUSTIFICATION
The CMA accounts for nearly 70 percent of the total urban population and 80
percent of industrialization. The pattern of development has been changing    C
periodically and there has been no consistent plan towards ensuring
environmentally sustainable development. The past development has left
behind several environmental scars in the Colombo Metropolis which now
requires immediate remedy. In addition, the Government of Sri Lanka has
embarked on a strategy of industrialization to raise the income levels and foster
further economic development in the country. This Industrialization Strategy
is nationwide. However, with most of the existing industrial base in the CMA,

it is na;1cural that most of the industrial growth will occur in thiat region in order
to capitalize on existing infrastructure and supporting services  ['his would
result in raipid urbaUn growth and associated environmental problems that
plague other cities in developed and developinig countries.
The signs of environmental stress in the Western Plrovinice are riow cause for
serious conicerni. Thev inclulde loss of natural andILI vegetative cover of laintds,
contamination of waters, degradation ot Soil and pollution of air.
Colombo, the principal citv of the Western Province has serious problems in
disposing of urbain waste which inclu1e:
(a)   Sewage
(b)   Liquid waste from industrial processes
(c)   Wastewater from kitchiens and industries
(d)  Carbage and ndustrial solid waste
(e)   Urban storniwater run-oli that carries a variety Af wastes
(f)  [-lazardoUs Waste and Infectious Waste
Problems of waste disposal in Culombo a:re conpotnded because 50 percent ot
the population belong to the low-income category, of which manv are shanty
dwellers. Thev occupy stream and canal reservations and usuallv have no access
to sewer services and their sewage and garbage are dumped directlv into
surface water.
According to 1989 stacistics, approximately 10-15 percent of the estimated
inhabitants in the Citv of Colombo discharge sewage directly into the surface
water network In addition, industries and domestic wastewater also regulariv
enter and pollute the canal network of the citv. Organic pollution from sewage
accounts for at least 60 percent of the total waste load discharged into the canal
network in Colombo.
Industrial waste in Sri Lanka is virtually not subject to treatment prior to
a                         discharge. Most of the industries discharge their liquid effluent directly into the
_                         surface drainage network or onto the land, where it poUlutes the ground water
table and enters the nearest waterbody. Data on industrial pollution has been
_                         limnited, but it appears to be of serious concern as the information base needs
to be improved. The 1989 survey conducted by the CEA in Colombo and
_                         Gampaha districts identified 115 significant polluters. But, by 1990, the CEA
estimated that well over 230 industries may be significant polluters, including
public as well as private companies.

With the impending devolution of powers to the local authorities to regulate
environmental functions under the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980
as anmended by No. 56 of 1988 (NEA), the tlocal bodies must be in a position to  c
aissume the responsibilities, When this happens the WPC should also be in a
posibon to implement thel tasks conferred upon Local Authorities by the NEA.
A first step in this direction would be the establishment of an Environmental
Unit within the WVPC.                                                      c

7. FUNCTIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT
7.1  SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
The management of solid waste has characteristically been a function : -e
local authorities. The C,MA generates approximately 800 tons/daV Otf mur.: 7al
solid waste (MSW). The wastes generated in the Citv of Colombo is dis-: - A
of in the Wellampitiva landfill which is expected to reach capacity bv the -d
of 1994. The other local authorities are known to dispose of their waste - a
ad hoc manner in various small scale open dumps. The World Bank, thr _I
the Colombo Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), plans to estabL- a
sanitary landfill and a waste transfer station for MSW in the CIA i
composition study of the solid wastes in the CMC revealed that 85 perce-  t
the waste stream at the landfill is organic waste. This waste would serve   n
ideal resource for composting. The resulting compost could be used as : -:]
conditioner for agricultural purposes. A demonstration project to determirn -:e
feasibility of composting is underway with the intention of attracting pry. -e
sector participation in the waste management system.
_                        Since the ovi rall SWM system would encompass CMC and surrounding .:a
_                        authorities, I.ae WPC would have to play a key role in co-ordinating   h
activities. Tht 'tunctions requiring attention from  the WPC would ini& :e

'Technical solid waste management expertise is available within the Deputy   I
Municipal Engineer (Solid Waste Management) Department. Therefore, the
WPC would be in a position to draw upon this expertise with addilional input  4
from MEIP, where necessary, in its co-ordinating operations. The WPC's
legislative jurisdiction over the loc;l authorities would provide it with the ability  4
to utilize the expertise available within the CMC to better manage solid wastes
in the entire Province. While the CEA plavs a regulatory role in SWM, the     4
entire responsibility for co-ordination of the SWM svstem in thie CMA would
rest with the WTI'C. 
.   Clean Seltdements Pn,gram
The objective of this progiam is to upgrade the standards of living of the
low-income population of the CMA and thereby improve environmental and        4
health standards.
The following criteria have been identified for implementing the program;
(a)  improving physical, social and economic conditions
(b)  improving the capabilities of local government authorities in undertaking
and sustaining these efforts
(c)  establishing community based organizations to manage and carry on the    4
prog-rams.

7.3  AIR POLLUTION
6
Government of Sri Lanka has developed an action plan to address air quality
in the CMA - known as the Clean Air 2000 - Action Plan (CA2AP). An            (
Implementation Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the
Ministry of Environment and Parliamentary Affairs has been appointed to
implement various actions relating to the Plan.  This Plan includes a
comprehensive approach to air quality management in the CMA. While
tndustrial air pollution is of concern, the dominant source of air pollution is 4
attributable to automotives. With 50 percent of the vehicles registered in tl}e
country plying the roads of the CMA, it is conceivable that the WPC would be 4
called upon to implement certain components of the CAZAP.
While the CEA would be providing a regulatory role in the area of air pollution,
in-house technical expertise would be necessary in the WPC to partake in policy
initiatives of the central Government, which may have a direct bearing on the
Westemn Province.

Environmental Uniit within tlhe WPC
A key area the WPC would be called upon to provide leadership is in co-
ordinating the development and zoning activiites of the local authorities.
7.4 INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT
a
_                       The Westem Province is the most industrialized province in the country. Two
free trade zones and dense industrial concentrations in areas such as Ekala/Ja-
Ela and Ratmalana/Moratuwa cause large scale irndustrial pollution management
problems in Sri Lanka. An on-going study to develop an Industrial Pollution
Management (IPM) Strategy for Sri Lanka has identified the use of centralized
wastewater treatment plans as a feature for current and future industrial
development. The devolution of power from the CEA to the local authorities
is anticipated to call upon the WPC to provide management and policy
guidance in implementing the IPM Strategy and even in areas such as the siting
W                       of new industrial estates.
The option of central wastewater treatment plants that may cater to industries
located across local authority boundaries would require the WPC to provide
leadership and co-ordination in the areas such as plant siting and the possible
connection of domestic sewage into the industrial sewerage network However,
while in-house technical expertise in these areas are essential, the WPC should
play a co-ordination role, at least in the near term.
7.5  WATER MANAGEMENT
_                       eThe Westem  Province which consists of three coastal districts-Colombo,
Gampaha and Kalutara--comprise a large population of residents belonging to
_                       low-income groups who have no proper sanitary facilities. In these districts, a
significant portion of the population use wells, rivers and springs for water
supply. Most of these water sources are unprotected, as a result, a high
proportion of the population is exposed to health risks associated fecally
contaminated water, either through groundwater pollution or from surface
contamination. The poor water supply and sanitation have resulted, the large
population being affected by typhoid, amoebic and bacillary dyscentry
infections, hepatitis, worrn infections, etc.
There has been virtually no studies conducted on the capacity of groundwater
aquifers and its pollutant potential in the CMA. Uncontrolled extraction of
groundwater-possibly at a rate greater than re-charge-could result in critical
water management problems in the future. The current problems associated
with flooding and drainage entails signfiicant work in this area, which would

require WPC involvement. at least on a marginal basis. Policy decisions such
as tariffs on groundwater usage may become a reality in the future, and WPC      C
input in the policy making process would require the necessary expertise be
developed within the Council.
7.6  AGRICULTURE-RELATED POLLUTIONPL
Agricultural waste results from agricultural practices and agro and livestock
based industries such as pig and poultry farms. Examples of environmental
problems resulting from agricultural practices are the silt carried through run-
off, and fertilizers and pesticides contamination of ground and surface waters.   4
Agricultural pollution is an area thus far receiving little, if any, attention from
the relevant authroities. While the polluting potential from agricultural sources
can be significant, the problem is made significantly more complex by the fact    l
that most agricultural pollution originates from non-point sources. Control of
non-point source pollution is virtually impossible. Better management practices
would result in minimal non-point source pollution.                                X
Campaha and Kalutara districts and Hanwella and Homagama Divisional
Secretary Divisions in Colombo district are the main areas of irrigated paddy
cultivation practised in the Western Province.
The major upstream  factors affecting the performance of these irrigation
systems are deforestation and vegitation loss in catchment area. Deforestation
causes the acceleration of soil erosion, leading to the siltation of streams in
lower reaches. It is observed in the Kalutara district that, most of the streams
and stream banks are eroded, while stream beds are deepended due to run-off
rates which cause much erosion. This process has led to problem of collapsing
of bridge abutments, inability to retain water levels in surrouding paddy fields
for cultivation and lowering of water table in the surrounding wells.              _
Since the Western Province is under considerable agricultural production, the      I
WPC should be in a position to initiate better policy and management practices
to reduce agricultural pollution within the Province.
7.7  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAcr ASSESsMENT                                                T
It is now a legal requirement that all development projects be subjected to an     I
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Several ministries and agencies have
been designated as Project Approving Agencies (P"A) by the CEA.  The               I
] L                                                                      ~~~~~~~~~~I

Environmnentat Unit withlin the WPC
responsibility of a PAA would include the drafting of ToRs for the EIA,
J                  evaluation of an EIA and subsequent monitoring of compliance. While the
WPC has not been designated a PAA as yet, there appears a good likelyhood
of it occurring in the future, especially with the extent of devolution of powers
to the provincial councils. In the event the WPC is designated a PM, it is
3                  mandatory that it has its own EIA Cell within the Council.
Even if the WPC is not designated a PAA, the Council should have the
technical expertise to comment on the ElAs of development projects within the
Western Province, Any EIA is open for public scrutiny for a 30-day period.
This would be the opportunity for the WPC to comment on a project that may
be adverse to the local environment.
7.8  PUBLIC HEALTH
Since all environmental issues are directly or indirectly linked to public health,
the WPC should have the capability to address public health issues related to
environment. The local authorities currently address this issue through its
Public Health Inspectors (PHIs). The WPC needs to act as a technical support
service to the PHI network in environmental issues and its implications in larger
public health concerns. Areas of water supply, sanitation and eradication of the
-          3       mosquito menace could be issues to be addressed by this Unit.
8. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
OF THE ENVIRONhENTAL UNIT
8.1 PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY COUNCIL
The Environmental Unit will be given policy guidance by a Provincial
Environmental Advisory Council consisting of the foUowing members:

(i) Representative of the CMC                              - Member
8.2  STAFFING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT
One Consultant (solid waste management) will be working for two years with        t
six full-time professionals from the WPC. The Consultant will work together        I
with the local staff and train them over the period of two years, after which the  £
Unit will function on it's own. The Colombo Environmental Improvement
Project (CEIP) will finance the Unit in the first two years of operation.
The following six professionals have been identified as full-time employees of    £
the Unit.
(a)  Two Engineers                                                             a
(b)  One Scientist
(c)  Two Social Scientists                                                     £
(d)  One Administrator
9. TRAINING
Training and attending workshops and seminars will be an important integral
function of the full-time members. Training needs will be determined in
consultation with the consultant and other experts.
10.  LEGISLATION                                                                  6
An Environmental Statute has been drafted for the Western Province taking
into consideration the establishment of an Environmental Unit. We felt a
statute is necessary to confer statutory and enforcement powers on the
Environmental Unit and act as a regulatory authority within the Province. If
not the powers and functions of the Unit will not have a legal basis or be
enforceable. However, this is not an immediate priority.

A_k                    The CEA, through the National Environment Act (NEA) has jurisdiction over
_w                     the entire island. Under Section 26(1) of the NEA these powers, duties and
_lbk                   functions can be delegated to othe. Government and Statutory bodies including
_                      Local Authorities. Therefore, the need for a separate Provincial Environment
Statute to establish an Environmental Unit within the WPC capable of
administering environmental issues.
Protection of the environment within the province is devolved to the Provincial
Councils under list 1. However, environment is also a subject under list Ill
(concurrent list). Therefore, it may be necessary to have Parliament ratify the
statute once it has being approved by the Province.
