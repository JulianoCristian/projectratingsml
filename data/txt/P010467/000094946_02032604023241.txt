3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The overall objective of the project stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) is to contribute to a
sustainable environment for the long term economic and social development of the Colombo Metropolitan
Area (CMA). Specific objectives for the project are to: (a) improve municipal solid waste management
(SWM) and services in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and participating local authorities (LAs);
(b) reduce wastewater pollution in the Beira Lake catchment area and selected industrial zones; (c) develop
the capabilities of local governments and institutions to plan and manage municipal services in a
sustainable, environmentally beneficial manner, and (d) assist in mobilizing private participation in the
development and operation of urban infrastructure services.
These objectives appear to have been consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka
and was responsive to Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL)'s priority for addressing emerging environmental
problems related to the concentration of economic activity in and around Colombo. The objectives are also
in line with planned Government reforms, especially regarding private sector development and improvement
of public sector management. The objectives are clear and understandable, relating to the activities planned
in the government's sector strategy and action plans. However, they were too ambitious and the project
design too complex, considering the high risks associated with project activities and the poor capacity of
the implementing agencies.
3.2 Revised Objective.
Due to the poor implementation progress and low likelihood of achieving the development objectives by the
credit closing date, the project was downsized at the mid term review in April/May 2000. The revisions to
the objectives were proposed as follows: (a) reduction of wastewater pollution in Beira lake catchment; (b)
development of urban planning capabilities of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) in a sustainable
and environmentally beneficial manner. Cancellation of the funds allocated to the worst performing
components was effective only in 2001. However, the revision of project development objectives was not
formalized in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).
3.3 Original Components:
(a)    Municipal Solid Waste Management ($15.7 million) for:
(i)    Construction of a sanitary landfill of 3.5 million cubic meters capacity at Welisara to
meet the disposal needs of CMC and 14 local authorities located in the CMA;
(ii)   construction of a 100 ton/day capacity compost plant at the Welisara landfill;
(iii)  provision of potable water supply and other infrastructure to the community residing
adjacent to the landfill site; and
(iv)   purchase of equipment and vehicles for safe collection, transport, and final disposal of
hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill.
(b)    Wastewater Collection Systems ($11.4 million) for construction of a sewer network in each of
the two industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala / Ja-Ela, to collect and carry industrial and
domestic wastewater to two separate wastewater treatment plants to be built and operated by the
private sector in parallel with the project.
(c)    Beira Lake Catchment Pollution Control ($12.9 miUion) for:
(i)    Interception of unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm drainage
system and connecting them to the existing sewerage system; and
(ii)   reduction of sewage overflows through cleaning sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping
- 2-



stations, and adding a sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake.
(d)    Technical Assistance (TA) ($9.0 miUlion) consisting of:
(i)    Project preparation assistance;
(ii)   project implementation support through consulting services to prepare designs and bid
documents, assist in bid evaluation and provide construction supervision for the
components (a), (b) and (c) above, including consultancy services for the invitation and
evaluation of Build Operate and Own (BOO)/Build Operate and Transfer (BOT)
proposals for the two wastewater treatment plants for Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela;
(iii)  TA to CMC and other LAs to improve solid waste services through involving the private
sector under concession agreements and management contracts and irnplementing
appropriate cost recovery measures; and
(iv)   TA to UDA to (a) strengthen its capabilities in integrated urban planning through
provision of consultancy services for updating the Colombo Master Plan (prepared in
1978) and for the preparation of a Trincomalee regional infrastructure development plan;
(b) establish a geographic information system (GIS) for Greater Colombo to facilitate
urban planning, infrastructure development and construction, environmental management,
and urban service administration; (c) develop a long-term solid waste disposal strategy for
the CMA; (d) implement a program to monitor the water quality of stormwater outfalls
open to the lake and the lake itself; (e) formulate further restoration measures for the Beira
Lake; and (f) carry out an environmental public awareness program.
The components were reasonably designed to achieve the objectives. However, despite stating in the Final
Executive Project Summary that lessons leamed from prior projects in the sector/country had been
considered to design this project, some identified lessons leamed, such as the importance of a broad
spectrum of interventions for pollution abatement and sound environmental management in urban areas,
including legislation, standards, permits, zoning, enforcement capacity, and development of institutions and
human resources, were not incorporated in the final design of the project. The project components were also
too complex and ambitious as compared to the experience and capacity of the implementing agencies,
especially regarding private sector participation in the physical works, coordination between different
agencies, and sound procurement arrangements for consultants and contractors.
3.4 Revised Components:
(a) Municipal Solid Waste Management ($15.7 million)
This component was restructured in February 1999, when it was agreed with GOSL that the procurement
of the proposed sanitary landfill would be dropped from the project due to GOSL's lack of commitment to
address the political and social issues associated with siting the landfill at Alupotha, which resulted in the
failure to award a contract after two rounds of bidding for construction and operation of the landfill. At the
Govemment's request, the task team agreed to retain the TA sub-component for the development of an
integrated long-term solid waste management strategy for the CMA. Although the strategy had been
completed by the task force, no further action had been taken by the implementing agencies by mid term
review in April/May 2000. Since such poor and slow implementation performance indicated the low
likelihood of processing and completing any successful contract in the remaining time period, it was agreed
in June 2000 that this component would be cancelled.
(b) Wastewater Collection Systems ($11.4 milion)
Due to the poor performance and incapacity of the contractor to complete the construction of the industrial
-3 -



wastewater collection networks in Ekala-Ja-Ela and Moratuwa-Ratmalana areas by mid term review, the
contract was terminated in early 2001. The remaining portion of the funds allocated to this component were
cancelled due to the inadequate time remaining for re-bidding.
(c) Beira Lake Catchment Polution Control ($12.9 miBlion)
This component remained unchanged.
(d) Technical Assistance ($9.0 milion)
One of the TA sub components, Public Awareness Campaign, though implemented, did not achieve the
intended objectives of the assignment. The mid-term review mission found that while the entire contract
amount had been expended, only 25% of the Terms of Reference (TOR) had been completed. Even for the
25% the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) claims to have been implemented, there is no evidence of proper
use of funds. Therefore, the expenditure associated with the Public Awareness component of the TA were
declared ineligible for reimbursement by the Bank. No futher allocation was provided for this
sub-component. The remaining TA components were unchanged.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry of the project is rated unsatisfactory based on the following factors. First, there were
issues associated with the design of the project. Although one of the major components (clean settlements)
was separated as a stand alone project at appraisal, the remaining four components still formed an overly
complex project without adequate coordination mechanisms among various agencies concemed. The large
number of implementing agencies, lack of clear roles and responsibilities of the project coordination unit,
and lack of proper incentive structure for the agencies made it difficult to implement the project in an
effective manner. A shift in project focus from private sector oriented components to more traditional
public sector approach resulting from change in task management at the project appraisal stage also led to
the confusion by respective stakeholders.
Second, the risk analysis conducted during preparation was not sufficiently comprehensive. Although the
three risks identified (cost recovery, enforcement, and financing of wastewater treatment plants) were
highly relevant to the project, the risks connected with implementation capacity had not been addressed,
although lessons from previous projects had identified these as major constraints to implementation.
Measures to address even the identified risks were not adequately constructed.
Third, Government ownership of the necessary policy reforms was not demonstrated by concrete steps
upfront prior to committing project funds. The Government seemed to show interest and verbal
commitment to the project, however, concrete steps for sector reform were not undertaken during
preparation. For example, failure to create an enabling environment for public-private partnerships in
urban services sector contributed to a lack of interest and unsuccessful bidding of the potential contractors
for wastewater treatment plants.
Lastly, it is surprising that no formal economic, financial, and social analysis of the project were carried
out during preparation. These are key analyses that evaluate the project's viability and feasibility and
should not have been left out. Quantifying environmental benefits is difficult, however, financial and fiscal
impacts could have been analyzed to identify the consequences and impacts the project would give on the
government's financial position. The absence of an institutional assessment appears to have led to an
overestimation of the capacity of the implementing agencies.
- 4 -



All the factors identified above point to premature appraisal of the project. One reason for the rush in
appraising the project seemed to stem from external pressures. One of the project documents states that the
project was recommended for proceeding to the Board partly because of the long preparation history, the
urgency expressed by the authorities and their keen interest in the project, and the fact that there had been
no Intemational Development Association (IDA) lending to Sri Lanka in two years.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievemnent of objective:
The overall achievement of objectives and outputs is rated highly unsatisfactory primarily because the
overall objective to contribute to a sustainable environment for the long-term economic and social
development of the CMA was not met. As described in the following sections, only two out of four
development objectives were partially achieved, while the remaining objectives were not achieved at all.
The first objective to improve the management of solid waste in the project area was not met as this
component was cancelled. The second objective to control wastewater pollution was partially met. The
third objective to develop capacities for management of municipal services was partially met. The fourth
objective to assist in mobilizing private participation in urban infrastructure development and operation
was not met. GOSL was unable to recruit a private operator for any of the components.
In the absence of concrete demonstrated outcomes resulting from the project, the outcome assessment
rating is easy to conclude. While the monitoring (key progress and impact) indicators specified in the SAR
were useful for assessing the achievement of objectives/outputs, the SAR should have, for example,
calculated component specific Internal Rate of Return (IRR), where applicable, and set concrete mid term
review targets for each component to facilitate the evaluation of the project implementation progress.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Summary:
Rating        Component                                Sector
HU     Municipal Solid Waste Management                Urban/Environment
HU     Wastewater Collection Systems                   Water Supply and Sewerage
*PS    Beira Lake Catchment Pollution Control          Urban/Environment
*PS    Technical Assistance                            Urban/Environment
*PS-Partially Satisfactory
(a) Municipal Solid Waste Management ($15.7 million SAR, $0.4 actual)
This component was cancelled in 1999 and is rated highly unsatisfactory. However, potentially positive
consequences of this setback is that the WPC has initiated awareness programs among the Urban Local
Authorities (ULA)s and is assisting them to develop and implement their own Solid Waste Management
(SWM) plans, while CMC has signed a 25 year contract with a private investor for a composting plant at a
gate fee of US$6/ton without Bank support. The sustainability of this operation is, however, uncertain as
no detailed economic analysis appears to have been carried out.
(b) Wastewater collection Systems ($11.5 million SAR, $5.2 million actual)
This component is rated highly unsatisfactory because none of the envisaged works were completed by
credit closing. First, a BOT-type contract originally envisaged at project design for the treatment works
failed due to lack of private sector interest. Second, the implementing agency awarded the contract for the
sewerage network without taking adequate steps to simultaneously procure the treatment plant under GOSL
- 5-



funding, which was a commitment given to the Bank after the BOT proposal failed. Last, significant
procurement delays, an inadequate contract period, contractor's poor performance, and a shift in the
consultant's responsibilities made it impossible to complete the sewerage works before credit closing. The
decision to terminate the contract was taken only in the latter half of the year 2000; and due to insufficient
time left to re-bid, the entire component was dropped.
(c) Beira Lake Catchment Control ($12.9 million SAR, $12.7 million actual)
This component is rated partially satisfactory. Although the physical works were substantially completed,
the systems have not been effectively operationalized under the current institutional agreement between
NWSDB and CMC. UDA, which has assumed authority over the Beira Lake and its environs, has yet to
implement a comprehensive monitoring program to substantiate the anticipated outcomes from a reduction
in sewer overflows. However, the UDA has recently shown a keen interest in improving the Lake environs,
based on the Beira Lake Business plan which was prepared under the project. According to GOSL,
adequate funding has been budgeted to complete the remaining works.
(d) Technical Assistance (TA) ($9.0 million SAR, $7.3 million actual)
This component is rated partially satisfactory. Of the three major sub components, only the direct TA
provided to the UDA has been fairly well executed. The completed TAs include the update of the Colombo
Master Plan, establishment of a GIS, and development of a long term solid waste disposal strategy for the
CMA. Under the sub-component for project implementation support, the consulting services for component
(c) above has been satisfactorily completed, while the consulting services for component (b) above has been
lacking in proactivity. In spite of failure to achieve physical outputs, the outputs from the TAs have
generated a determination in some agencies, to move forward, resulting in institutions taking initiatives to
address environmental issues such as SWM. The WPC has set up a SWM Authority under a statute passed
in December, 2000. However, the unsuccessful attempts at introducing private sector participation,
incomplete physical works, and the inadequate and ineffective public awareness program have contributed
negatively to the overall achievement of the development objectives.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The SAR states that the rate of return analysis calculated based on the magnitude of cost recovery was not
conducted because the environmental and social benefits of the project were not easily quantifiable. A cost
effectiveness approach was used instead. The project's physical investments were subjected to systematic
comparisons of alternatives in terms of capital and recurring costs, suitability under local conditions,
institutional requirements and environmental impacts. These analyses are not available in the project files,
therefore it is difficult to assess whether the project represented the expected least cost solution to attain the
intended benefits or development outputs.
The net present value of the project would have been calculated based on potential benefits resulting from
the project over time and costs associated with the investments. While there are clear costs in monetary
terms in addition to the opportunity costs associated with the project, the lack of measurable benefits make
it difficult to do an effective ex-post economic analysis of the project. Baseline data should have been
collected and clear performance indicators for the economic, financial, environmental, and social impacts
should have been set up at appraisal to enable monitoring and evaluation of the progress/performance of
the project.
Review of project preparation documents show that the decisions in designing the project were not based on
any componentwise economic or financial analysis. Given that information was available on the
environmental pollution cost, estimated in a study under the Metropolitan Environmental Improvement
Program (MEIP); the investment costs, and the potential revenues generated from the sewage and solid
- 6 -



waste collection etc., it would have been possible to calculate the intemal rate of return on the physical
components at appraisal.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial analysis was carried out at appraisal; therefore, no Financial Rate of Retum (FRR) was
calculated. Hence, no attempt is made to re-estimate the end of the project FRR. However, analysis to
evaluate the implementing agencies' financial ability to pay back the subsidiary loans would have been
possible and necessary at appraisal. Failure in implementing the project with involvement of the private
sector, and in introducing a sound tariff policy aiming at cost recovery of NWSDB and CMC operations
have resulted in worsened cash flow position of the implementing agencies, which in tum could affect the
govenmment's fiscal situation if the incomplete components are to be funded by the Ministry of Finance (as
requested upon project completion). Although it is hard to estimate post project FRR due to lack of data
and resources, the estimated low sewerage tariff levels embedded in the property tax, low collection rate,
and high investment costs associated with the project indicate a low probability of FRR estimate being
positive.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact is rated modest. Evidence of the poor physical implementation
performance of the project suggests that the project has not fully succeeded in building human or financial
capacity of the implementing agencies. Although various training activities have been undertaken and
sector strategy/plans have been developed under the project, no impact assessment of such activities has
been conducted. However, some concrete results are noticeable, for example, UDA staff employed under
the GIS section have shown a strong commitment to managing and promoting GIS and this effort is likely
to be sustained. Also, evidence of Westem Provincial Councial's (WPC) and CMC's initiatives to improve
SWM are positive consequences of failed attempts to address the issues under the project.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Restriction of movement in large project areas which fell within high security zones and stoppage of works
during the period leading to Presidential elections, mainly in the Beira Lake catchment zones, were factors
outside the control of the implementing agency. These led to the need to revise programs intermittently and
implementation delays.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Failure to mobilize private sector participation in the development and operation of urban infrastructure
services was due primarily to the Government's inability to create an enabling environment. Measures such
as implementation of necessary policy reforms to introduce sewerage tariff and enforcement of the policies,
the enviromnental standards, and sewer connections would have increased the chances of success in this
area. The Govemment could have made the project more efficiently implemented by ensuring proper
coordination among the implementing agencies, solving conflicts among them, and adequately monitoring
overall project performance. More delegation in contract decisions, procurement approvals and staff
recruitment, would also have resulted in more effective project implementation. For the industrial
wastewater systems, the implementing agency could not make an independent and timely decision to
terminate the contract and, thus, there was insufficient time left to re-assign and complete the works before
credit closing.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Factors subject to the control of the PCU include quality control, monitoring, and project evaluation.
Although the PCU was responsible for monitoring project performance, it had no authority to take
- 7 -



corrective action. Better coordination among the various implementing agencies and participation of
stakeholders would have been required to improve project performance. Factors subject to the control of the
implementing agencies for the different components include implementation scheduling, contract
management as well as effective use of resources - project funds and staff.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total SAR Project cost was estimated at US$49.0 million equivalent. The final project cost is US$25.6
million equivalent. The reduction in project size is due to cancellation of the SWM component, balance of
incompleted works for the wastewater collection system and downsizing of the technical assistance - public
awareness component.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project is rated unlikely primarily due to the fact that most of the project components
were incomplete at project closing. Although the Government has expressed concems over the unfinished
components of the project because of the continued negative environmental impacts in Colombo, there is no
evidence yet that the Government is committed to allocate sufficient funds to urgently complete all the
works. It is unlikely that the works will be completed expeditiously due to weak institutional and
management effectiveness of implementing agencies, their reluctance to encourage public participation and
create public awareness about the project coupled with a lack of recognition of its urgency.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Although there are indications in the Borrower's evaluation report that some arrangements have been made
to transfer the project to regular operation, the Government has failed to demonstrate clear and credible
commitment to complete the unfinished components. The Treasury had agreed to allocate Rs.400 million
(approximately US$4.7 million) for the year 2001 to recommence implementation of the Industrial
Wastewater component but no follow-up work was evident. Further, that amount only corresponds to 75%
of the undisbursed funds and 12% of the current total estimated cost for completing the balance works.
There is no indication of how GOSL plans to fund or contract the rest of the works. Even for the Beira
Lake Catchment Control component which was substantially completed, the estimated budget for follow-up
activities has been indicated without specific future plans. As for the technical assistance component, the
only sub component indicating any future usage plan is the GIS system. The SWM component, despite its
early cancellation, appears to have motivated the local authorities to address localized issues, since these
local governments have initiated small-scale activities with their own funds.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank's performance during preparation is rated unsatisfactory. The Bank has not designed the project
adequately taking into account all major relevant aspects, especially with regards to financial, economic,
social, and institutional issues. The components were not selected based on economic or financial merits
(the rate of returns were not calculated), and measures to deal with social and political issues were
neglected in the design. Although earlier Bank project completion reports confirm the ability and experience
of some of the implementing agencies to undertake projects, there was no evidence of assessments having
been done on procurement and financial management capacity of the other implementing agencies. The
Bank also failed to ensure that the government and other implementation agencies were fully committed and
had sufficient capacity to create an enabling environment for the private sector to enter the urban/water
sector of Sri Lanka. However, the strategy/approach to have a high degree of private sector participation,
- 8 -



proposed early during preparation, was watered down at appraisal. In addition, it appears that the Bank
was pressured into expediting project preparation resulting in premature appraisal. Except for the SWM
component, none of the other components had advanced sufficiently in the feasibility studies and
procurement planning, at credit effectiveness. Measurable performance indicators identified, even at mid
term review, were inadequate and covenants were not designed to provide an exit strategy in the event of
components failing to achieve the envisaged objectives. The Bank could have explored other forms of
lending and altemative service delivery mechanisms.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank's performance during supervision is rated unsatisfactory. Reviews so far indicate inadequate
reporting of project implementation progress until 1999 which makes it difficult to assess the supervision
performance during that period. Aide-memoires and Back to office reports were incomplete and the
mid-term review was delayed almost three years, leaving only one year of implementation left before credit
closing. The Bank also paid insufficient attention to development impacts, monitoring of loan covenants
and agreed actions. Early supervision seemed to have focused primarily on procurement issues. In addition,
the critical public awareness component, including the activities of the consultative panel, were not
followed up regularly. Nevertheless, towards the end, the supervision team was recognized for its
proactivity by Quality Assurance Group (QAG) which set the "proactivity golden flag" in June 2001.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Because of the reasons mentioned in section 7.1 and 7.2, Bank's overall performance has been rated
unsatisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower's performance during preparation is rated unsatisfactory. At the very early stage of project
preparation, there were siginificant efforts made and interest shown by the GOSL to: (i) transform the
Beira lake area into a commercial center by leaming from intemational experiences, including a study trip
to Baltimore; and (ii) attract the private sector in all of the project components by raising awareness of the
project among intemational investors including a significant number of Korean firms. At that time, the
Borrower participated actively in project preparation through the MEIP office, however, such active
participation was not sustained after the project focus shifted from private sector participation to a more
traditional approach, and the coordination role was transferred to a new PCU which was established only
after appraisal. There was a failure to recognize and address the risk of not having the MEIP Colombo
Office staff providing support to the PCU although this was initially envisaged. In addition, the Borrower
made insufficient efforts during preparation to involve all stakeholders which left some implementing
agencies without the appropriate incentives to gain ownership of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Govemment's implementation performance is rated unsatisfactory. The assurances and commitments
it had given the Bank were either not implemented at all, or implemented with great delays. TheGovemment
also failed to monitor the overall performance of the project implementing agencies, including that of the
PCU, and take timely remedial measures where necessary.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agencies is rated unsatisfactory. Contract management was a
major problem, due largely to lack of delegation in decision-making among all relevant
implementing agencies resulting in failure of all components involving physical works. In particular,
the PCU was ineffective in coordination, monitoring, and quality control functions. CMC, the implementing
-9-



agency identified at appraisal for the largest component, SWM, lacked ownership due not only to the lack
of commitment and support from the Government, but also because of the conflicts experienced with the
PCU. NWSDB, which was in charge of the two sewerage components failed to proactively resolve
problems associated with its components; also due to lack of coordination with other agencies (for
roadworks, security clearances etc). UDA completed some of the TA components, but failed to take the
lead on the Beira lake component as defined in the DCA. Many of the above issues concem lack of an
adequate coordination mechanism and a clear definition of roles and responsibilities of each implementing
agency. Many of the problems lay with the PCU, which did not adequately involve the implementing
agencies and stakeholders to facilitate project implementation, but acted, for example, like a post box that
did not review and consolidate agency progress reports and failed to take up major issues with higher
authorities for resolution before forwarding them to IDA for review.
The financial management capacity of implementing agencies in terms of accounting and recording
financial transactions was adequate, but the project did not contribute to strengthen their financial
management capacity in broader terms beyond accounting and book keeping. The Borrower's compliance
with financial covenants (DCA Article 4.01) was reasonably satisfactory. Audit reports were generally
received on time and there were no major accounting issues, although the audit gave qualified "except for"
opinions. One significant financial management problem in connection to a public awareness contract for
SLRs. 13 million (approximately US$ 0.13 million) arose during project implementation. The findings of an
IDA supervision mission that there were inadequate supporting documents for payments under the contract
was justified by a review of the Auditor General and such amounts were reimbursed to IDA.
7.7 Overall Borrower petformnance:
Because of the reasons mentioned in sections 7.4 through 7.6, the overall borrower performance has been
rated unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Although the overall results of the project remain unsatisfactory, many lessons can be learned from this
project. The key lessons are:
Achieving the Envisaged Objectives:
While the Bank's general policy is not to extend the credit closing date, unless there is an extremely
compelling case, it seems that in this project there were sufficient grounds to do so for certain components,
considering that the project was appraised in haste. At credit closing, all physical components were half
constructed and the Borrower may not have adequate funds to complete them. The Bank should have
considered restructuring the project earlier to complete at least some of the components as originally
planned, particularly the discrete components which, on completion, would yield the intended benefits. In
this project, for example, when the solid waste management component was cancelled, the funds should
have been reallocated to complete the wastewater treatment system, as there was no interest from the
private sector for a BOT-type arrangement.
Negative Consequences of Premature Appraisal:
Compromising on the requirement for upfront agreements on critical prerequisites for the success of the
project leads to incomplete and unsustainable outcomes. The accepted practice of preparing necessary
designs and tender documents for, at least the initial year or two, to allow immediate bidding process was
done for the SWM component only. Lending/portfolio pressure should not influence the timing of project
- 10-



appraisal. Adequate risk analysis and measures to address them are major factors that facilitate project
implementation. A comprehensive institutional assessment study would have provided a sound basis for
clearly delineating the roles, responsibilities and links/coordination between the various agencies involved.
Designing Simple Projects:
A key lesson learned in project design is to avoid lumping together discrete components, each of them
complex in nature, to form a project which involves various agencies. Where several implementing agencies
are involved, their roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. The use of performance indicators
to monitor progress and control quality of the project is important. An appropriate exit strategy should be
formulated during preparation; for example, an upfront agreement with the Government to cancel
components (and the corresponding credit amount) that are identified to have insufficient time to complete.
Government and Other Stakeholder Commitment and Ownership:
One essential factor identified for successful project implementation is strong Government commitment to,
and ownership of reforms, especially difficult sector reforms, such as private sector participation and
service pricing. It is imperative that implementation of such reforms are demonstrated by upfront actions.
Other stakeholder interest/commitment, including that of civil society, the private sector, and the
implementing agency staff, have also been identified as critical factors for effective and participatory
project implementation. Early stakeholder involvement in the planning and decision making process would
have led to greater motivation and increased commitment of the major stakehoders.
Maintaining Continuity:
Frequent changes of task leadership (4 in this case) without adequate overlap and orientation, particularly
at critical stages such as appraisal and negotiations, would have contributed to delays in the
decision-making process to promptly address critical issues. Reconstructing the thread of events during
ICR preparation was difficult as a result of these changes.
Identifying the Issues Early:
Early identification of critical issues and proactive modification of the project as needed could lead to a
greater likelihood of achieving the objectives. Separating the task management function from an
institutional supervisory and quality control role could have helped the Bank management to take early
actions necessary to address the critical issues of the project.

Dear Sir,
Colombo Environmental Improvement Proiect
(Credit 2757 CE)
Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
We are pleased to receive the above Implementation Completion Report of the World Bank along
with your letter dated December 13, 2001.
The contents of the report have been studied substantially and we are in agreement with your views
on the achievements of objectives and outputs. However, in my opinion, the unsatisfactory position of
whole project with its implementing difficulties faced on components of Solid Waste Management &
Industrial Wastewater Networks mainly was due to many factors particularly concemed with uncertainties
and hasty commitments with poor Quality at Entry. Further, identified responsibilities of Project Director
with no executive powers on the Implementing Agency too contributed to this, while desired experience,
resources and dedication were lacking with Main Contractors and the sub contractors as well.
All in all, I have no disagreement with the whole report and the Borrowers Evaluation attached. In
regard to the Public Awareness Campaign Programme conducted, I agree that insufficient co-ordination
with the World Bank may have resulted in its failure to receive foreign funding. There too the initial
objectives lacked sufficient programming but sufficient evidence that was available on the work completed
have not however, been intimated to you on time, I suppose. Please bear with us for this failure that
occurred which was unintentional.
Thanking you again on the Report and we are in agreement with the Project unsatisfactory Status
Rating on the two components as stated in para 4.2 of the report.
Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
S/d

Supportinz Document 4: Status of Proiect Components at Credit Closine
Part A: Municipal Solid Waste Management
Client: Western Provincial Council IColombo Municipal Council
Consultant: Environmental Resources Management, UK.
1.     The municipal solid waste management component failed to meet its stated development objectives
of (i) improving municipal solid waste management and services in CMA; (ii) develop capabilities of local
governments and institutions to plan and manage municipal services in a sustainable, environmentally
beneficial manner; and (iii) assist in mobilizing private participation in the development and operation of
urban infrastructure services. The project intended financing the construction of an engineered sanitary
landfill and a 100 ton per day pilot composting facility, as well as technical assistance to develop and
implement an integrated solid waste management strategy for the CMA. International consultants procured
under the Credit assisted the GOSL in an assessment of the municipal solid waste situation in the CMA and
develop a short, medium and long term strategy for managing municipal solid wastes in an environmentally
acceptable manner. The strategy identified the potential for composting the high content of organic matter
(85%) in the waste stream and the necessity of an engineered sanitary landfill for final disposal of the
residue. Since the quality of the finished compost and markets for sale of the product were unknown, it
was decided at appraisal that a pilot compost plant will be financed under the Credit, with a potential for
expanding capacity if proved successful.
2.     Based on site identification studies, GOSL initially identified a site at Padukka for construction of
a sanitary landfill. During the project preparation stage, the project financed site investigations, an
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and conceptual designs for a sanitary landfill at this location.
Although the EIA was approved by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) after a 30 day public
comment period, GOSL reversed its decision to proceed with construction of a sanitary landfill at Padukka
in view of public protests at the site. GOSL requested that an altemative site at Welisara be considered
instead. Site investigations, an EIA, conceptual designs and bidding documents were prepared for a design,
construct and operate contract at Welisara. GOSL was informed that the site at Welisara was a water
logged marsh and while theoretically possible to design as an engineered sanitary landfill, it would be very
costly. Regardless, bids were called for construction of a sanitary landfill and pilot compost plant at
Welisara, in 1996. Response from bidders were poor with only one bid being submitted. An evaluation of
the bid revealed a cost significantly higher than available under the Credit. At this point, GOSL decided to
abandon the idea of constructing a sanitary landfill at Welisara and expand the site search to sites with
good geotechnical characteristics. A site with acceptable geology was identified in Alupotha in Meepe.
Once again site investigations, an EIA, conceptual designs and bidding documents were prepared for the
site at Alupotha. Although the EIA was approved after public consultations by the CEA, continuous
public agitation against the project, observed a reduction in the political resolve to move forward with the
project. Meanwhile, bids had been called for design, construction and operation of the sanitary landfill and
the pilot composting plant at Alupotha. IDA did not concur with GOSL's recommendation for contract
award, since in IDA's opinion, the recommended bid was not substantially responsive. Since IDA also
concurred with GOSL's recommendation that the other bids were non responsive, no contract award could
be made.
3.     At this stage GOSL requested IDA concurrence to seek an alternative site (due to public protests at
Alupotha) or re-call for bids at the same site, if an alternative site is not available. Based on IDA's
perception of a lack of political commnitment to deal with issues pertaining to siting a landfill and the fact
there was inadequate time left in the project to re-call bids and complete construction of the sanitary landfill
- 28 -



prior to project closure in June 2001, it was agreed with GOSL that this component be cancelled from the
project. With this cancellation, the development objectives of the project relating to this component could
not be achieved satisfactorily.
Part B: Industrial Wastewater Pollution Abatement - Ja-ela/Ekala & Moratuwa/ Ratmalana
Client/ Implementing Agency: National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)
Wastewater Collection Network
Consultant: DHV Consultants B V, Netherlands
Date of Commencement of Assignment: December 15, 1995
Original Completion Date: January 4, 2000
Contractor: Beijing Municipal Engineering Corporation (BMEC)
Date of Commencement of Contract: June 24, 1998
Contractual Completion Date: December 22, 1999
Contract Termination Date: January 2001
4.     Appointment of the consultant was delayed by 2 months and contract award by 16 months. Design
and contract processing was protracted due to delays in decision-making. Pre-qualification of contractors
was delayed by 11 months.
5.     Although it was originally planned at the project design stage to complete the contract in 24
months, a decision was made at the time of bid preparation to reduce the contract period to 18 months.
During the mobilization phase, there were clear indications that the selected contractor lacked planning and
organizational skills. The supervision mission of February/March, 1999 noted a lack of concem on the part
of the implementing agency, the consultant and the contractor, to resolve contractual and site issues,
particularly in view of the shortened contract period. At the end of the Feb,99 mission, a revised program
was agreed on by all parties concerned, with a revised completion date of May 31, 2000. However, in the
subsequent months, the contractor showed no signs of improving performance and the supervision mission
of July/August, 1999 concluded that the contractor was incapable of handling difficult components of the
contract. A recommendation was made to GOSL to either terminate the contract or re-assign part of the
works to another contractor/s under competitive bidding.
6.    In January, 2000 GOSL decided to terminate the contract and subsequently negotiated mutual
termination. GOSL's request to procure another contractor to complete the balance works, to be financed
under the Credit, was rejected by IDA as there was insufficient time left in the project period.
7.     Materials at site procured under the contract have been taken over by the NWSDB. The mission
notes with concern, the possibility of materials being rendered unusable, under the current conditions of
storage. The mission was informed that the GOSL had requested other donors to fund the wastewater
systems including the balance works started under this Project, except for the Ja-Ela/Ekala network which
would be funded by NWSDB under its own budget. The mission strongly recommends that NWSDB take
up as a priority the completion of the Ja-Ela/Ekala network using the sewer pipes and fittings procured
under the Credit. It is imperative that the GOSL takes immediate steps to complete the works over a
reasonable period of time.
Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Facilities
- 29 -



8.     The DCA identified the risk that 'private sector interest may not materialize in a timeframe
commensurate with project implementation'. It was therefore stipulated that 'no withdrawals would be
allowed with respect to the wastewater collection works until financing arrangements satisfactory to IDA
for the construction of the treatment plants had been concluded'. Following GOSL's failed attempts to
conclude negotiations for a BOT-type contract for the treatment works, IDA was given the assurance that
construction of the treatment works would be procured under GOSL funding. IDA was informed that this
sub component will also be funded under other donor assistance.
Industrial Wastewater Technical Assistance
9.     Consultants were engaged in December, 1995 for design, contract processing and supervision.
With the suspension of the contract for the collection networks the consultant's contract was terminated
as well. MUDCPU will make an evaluation of the consultant's performance, and include its findings in the
Borrower's proiect evaluation report.
Completion of the Balance Works
10.    The mission notes with concem, the potential waste if the balance works are not completed in the
near future. In addition to materials going to waste, there is also the cost of continued pollution and
increased health risks. NWSDB has completed a review of the feasibility studies and prepared cost
estimates for the balance works, and has carried out surveys for updating the industrial connection
requirements and wastewater discharges. The mission recommends that immediate steps be taken to
proceed with contracting for the balance works and that GOSL allocates the necessarv funds.
Part C: Beira Lake Catchment Pollution Control
Client: Urban Development Authority (UDA)
11.    Although the UDA was the designated client for this component, there was little interest shown by
the UDA to ensure that implementation was carried out according to schedule and a program for water
quality monitoring be initiated.
Beira Lake Sewera2e Works
Implementing Agency: National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)
Consultant: WS Atkins International Ltd, UK
Date of Commencement of Assignment: January 2, 1996
Original Completion Date: January 4, 2000
Contractor: China Beijing Corporation for International Economic Cooperation (CBIEC)
Date of Commencement of Contract: March 13, 1998
Contractual Completion Date: September 12, 1999
Revised Completion Date: April 30, 2000
12.    Appointmnent of the consultant was delayed by two months and contract award by twelve months.
Design and contract processing was protracted due to delays in decision-making. Pre-qualification of
contractors was delayed by ten months.
13.    At the project design stage it was envisaged that the contract would be completed in 30 months.
- 30 -



However, a decision was made at the time of bid preparation to reduce the contract period to 18 months.
Implementation of the contract was slow at the initial stages, but improved with time. It was clearly evident
however, that the completion period of 18 months was unrealistic, for a number of reasons. Working in
high security zones curtailed working hours, while in some areas, local residents prevented the contractor
from working, protesting inconvenience caused by sewer overflows. Lack of cooperation between the CMC
and the NWSDB in sewer cleaning led to unwarranted delays. In addition, the contractor sub-contracted all
the works, while providing inadequate project management. The sub-contractors in turn had inadequate
equipment and labor resources. At the end of the Feb,99 mission, a revised program for completing the
works by April 30, 2000 was agreed by the NWSDB, the consultant and the contractor.
14.    On a subsequent request by the contractor for extension of the contract to February 28, 2001, the
NWSDB agreed to put on hold the enforcement of liquidated damages, on the condition that, if the
contractor failed to complete the contract by such date, liquidated damages would be claimed
retrospectively, from the earlier agreed completion date of April 30, 2000. The contractor has since
achieved substantial completion by June 30, 2001 (39 months implementation period).
15.    Action to connect the industries and households in the catchment to the new network has been slow.
Although it was agreed that this would be closely followed up by the Project Director and that NWSDB
would assign the connection works to contractors nominated by the CMC, there has been little commitment
to completing these works by project closing. The mission strongly recommends that MUDCPU closely
follows up on this activity to ensure that the development objective for this component is achieved.
16.    Water quality data of the Beira Lake, collected under the contract, will form the baseline for a
program for monitoring the impact on quality during the post-project period. The UDA will implement the
post-project monitoring program and document the improvements as well as determine technological
options for maintaining the lake. The GOSL will include this program in the Borrower's evaluation report.
Environmental Issues in the Beira Lake Component
17.    The Mission noted that restoration of the construction sites have been completed satisfactorily.
However, it was noted that the fuel storage tanks at the pumping stations could be considered a fire hazard.
It was agreed that adequate precautions will be taken and fire extinguishing equipment will be installed at
each site.
Beira Lake Technical Assistance
18.    Consultants were engaged in January, 1996 for design, contract processing and supervision. The
consultant's contract was extended to correspond with the period of implementation of the sewerage
contract. MUDCPU will make an evaluation of the consultant's performance. and include its findings in the
Borrower's proiect evaluation report.
Beira Lake Restoration Follow-up
19.    The UDA has prepared a detailed development plan for the Beira Lake and its catchment, based on
the Beira Lake Business plan which was prepared under the project. 850 low income families are to be
re-located from the lake reservation area to new housing being constructed under the Sustainable
Townships Program of the GOSL. Dredging of the lake is being carried out with GOSL funding. Prime
State-owned land within the catchment (approximately 13 acres) will be released for private sector
development activities (mainly IT-related).

Technical Assistance to the Urban Development Authority
Geographical Information System (GIS)
20.    The GIS has been set up under the Information Systems Division of the UDA. The technical
assistance for this sub-component has been successfully completed. Several agencies are currently being
assisted by this division to prepare GISs. The Task Team requested the UDA to coordinate with other GIS
centres to ensure that there is no duplication of activities .
21.    The technical assistance for assisting the UDA (in collaboration with the CMC) in setting up a
computerized system for development planning clearance and approval has been obtained. The consultant
has installed a proto type for building application approval process. UDA is in the process of establishing
the required database and other related information. The system will be fully operational by December 31,
2001 and this will be used for processing of planning applications from the public by January 1, 2002.
Development Plans
22.    Zonal plans for Colombo city have being prepared, based on the Colombo Metropolitan Structural
Plan which was completed under this project by the UDA in May, 1998.
23.   Infrastructure development plans for Trincomalee and Matara have been completed.
GOSL's Future Plans in Solid Waste Management in the Greater Colombo Area
24.    The Cabinet of Ministers approved a National Solid Waste Management (SWM) Strategy
prepared by the Ministry of Forestry and Environment (MFE) in 2000. The SWM Strategy calls for LAs
to move away from the ad hoc waste disposal methods currently practiced into integrated solid waste
management. The Stragey addresses issues pertaining to recycling and resource recovery, appropriate
waste treatment techniques and environmentally accpetable ultimate disposal of the wastes. In addition, the
Strategy encourages public private partnerships in solid waste management. In accordance with the SWM
Strategy all LAs in the country are expected to develop solid waste management plans by September 30,
2001. The plans should make every attempt to conform to the relevant sections of the National
Environmental Act and Regulations.
25.    The CMC has commenced private sector contracts for collection of municipal solid wastes in
approximately 50% of the municipal wards of the city. In addition, the CMC has just concluded
negotiations on a 25 year concession agreement with a private sector operator to establish a compost plant
for composting the organic faction of the waste stream and a controlled landfill for ulitimate disposal of the
wastes. The contractor is expected to commence operation of the compost plant and the landfill by
September 2002.
26.    The other LAs in the GCA are currently in the process of developing SWM plans as required by
the National SWM Strategy. In order to facilitate SWM in the Western Province, the WPC has obtained
Council approval to establish a Solid Waste Management Authority. In addition to facilitating solid waste
management within LAs, the mandate of the SWM Authority includes brokering solid waste management
projects that cross LA boundaries. Under the leadership of the WPC, a semi-engineered landfill is being
contructed at Madapatha for the use of several LAs south and east of CMC.

Annex 8: Borrower's Contribution to the ICR
The overall objective of the Colombo Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP) as envisaged and
specified in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of the World Bank dated January 2, 1995 was to contribute
to a sustainable Environment for the long-term economic and social development of the Colombo
Metropolitan Area (CMA).
The well defined key components under specific objectives in the SAR that were expected to be
implemented were as follows.
*      Improve municipal solid waste management (SWM) and services in the Colombo Municipal
council (CMC) and participating local authorities
The Municipal Solid Waste Management component was to comprise the construction of a
sanitary landfill of 3.5 million cubic meters to replace open dump. The operation of the landfill
was to be contracted out to private sector operator. Equipment for the safe collection, transport
and disposal of clinical waste generated in the CMA was to be provided. Technical assistance
(TA) to CMC and other local authorities in the CMC for contracting out solid waste collection
services and for developing a long term solid waste disposal strategy was to be provided.
*      Reduce wastewater pollution in the Beira Lake catchment area and selected industrial zones
The industrial wastewater pollution abatement component was to comprise the construction of
sewer networks in the two industrialized areas, Rathmalana and Ekala/Jaela, to collect and carry
industrial and domestic wastewater to two separate wastewater treatment plants to be builts and
operated by private investors.  Technical assistance for the solicitation and evaluation of
BOO/BOT (build, own, operate and transfer/Build, operate and transfer) proposals for the above
two wastewater treatment plants was to be provided.
*      Develop the capabilities of local governments and institutions to plan and manage municipal
services in a sustainable, environmentally beneficial manner
The Beira Lake catchment pollution control component was to connect the wastewater outlets to
the existing sewerage system, rehabilitate the pumping stations and construct a new sewer line.
Also, technical assistance for formulating further restoration measures for the lake was to be
provided.
*      Assist in mobilizing private participation in the development and operations of urban
infrastructure services
The project was to provide institution building technical assistance to the Urban Development
Authority (UDA) for strengthening its capabilities in integrated urban planning. Including support
for the establishment of a geographic information system for Greater Colombo, and consultancy
services for updating the Colombo Development Master Plan and preparing a Trincomalee regional
infrastructure development plan.
A.     Assessment of Project Design & Quality at Entry

Foregoing assessment of Development Objectives, already defines the compatibility of the objectives and
components of the projects for achieving expected results and thus fulfilling the objectives.
With regard to the design of components, a commonly accepted practice is to prepare all necessary designs
and tender documents for, at least, the first two to three years of implementation, so as to allow the bidding
process to start immediate after the construction funds became available. In this project, the design of the
SWM component was carried out in a way that made it possible for the procurement process to start
immediately at the outset of the project implementation period. On the other hand, no engineering designs
and tender documents had been prepared for the sewerage components (in the Beira Lake and industrial
areas) prior to project appraisal, thus causing major delays in getting the construction mobilized reasonably
soon after credit effectiveness.
The TA activities to provide for institutional capacity building were designed only on broad terms prior to
project appraisal. Some very telling examples of this are for instances.
(i)    The unclear situation in SWM management responsibilities;
(ii)   The lack of definition of responsibilities on the Beira Lake sewerage component between the
National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NES&DB) and CMC or these can, at least, be termed
as complex, at best; and
(iii) Definition of the role of the Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU).
In this rather complex situation, the institutional assessment and design of the necessary TA activities for
an effective capacity building should have been much more advanced than was the case, a fact that
seemingly caused confusion and result in unnecessary delays during project implementation.
On the aspect of project quality at entry, key technical elements such as consistency with country's
development goals, -- as well as with the WB's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) -- clarity of project
objectives (and components), performance indicators, and altemative project designs, the project seems to
have been, by and large, well identified and prepared and ready for appraisal in 1995.
On the other hand there are aspects which should have received more attention earlier in the project
preparation process. They include the definition of clear institutional responsibilities, ensuring of political
and public support for the project, especially for its most difficult component such as the sanitary landfill,
and preparation of technical designs and bidding documents ready for tendering prior to credit
effectiveness.
A reformulation of the project took place as part of its mid-term review in April - May 2000 during which
major restructuring of various project components were agreed upon. The key actions of restructuring
were as follows.
(i)    Reduction of the scope of the sewerage works at the industrial sites;
(ii)   Reduction of the scope of the SWM component (initiated already in February 1999); and
(iii)  Further emphasis on the development of the urban planning capabilities of the Urban Development
Authority (UDA) in a sustainable and environmentally beneficial manner.
These actions, that drastically reduced the scope of the project, obviously altered the project's
developmental objectives in a substantial way.
B.     Achievement of objectives and outputs
- 35 -



The project only partially achieved its overall objective after encountering significant delays. The same
assessment also applies to the physical objectives (as several key components were dropped in the course of
project implementation) and the institutional objectives. The achievement of the financial objectives was
only marginal. In practical terms, the original financial objectives are only partially applicable because of
the reformulation of the project as a result of the findings of the mid term review of the project in April -
May 2000.
The project did not improve municipal solid waste management and services. Wastewater pollution will be
reduced after the completion of the Beira Lake pollution control component, but due to the incomplete
industrial wastewater pollution abatement components, wastewater pollution continues in the selected
industrialized zones.
The capabilities of UDA to plan municipal services in a sustainable, environmentally beneficial manner
were developed substantially through the integration of urban planning and the use of the geographic
information system (GIS). However, the success of capacity development in solid waste management and
sewerage will depend on how well the lessons learned from this project experience will be utilised in the
future.
The mobilization or private sector participation failed in both the solid waste management and the
treatment of industrial wastewater. The most obvious reason seems to be that the potential private
companies estimated business risks are quite high. The construction and operation of the facilities
attracted a low number of bidders and the few that submitted a bid had included the risk in their financial
proposal. The risks include complex institutional set-up, weak enforcement of environmental legislation
and regulations, responsibility for the environmental performance of the facilities associated with difficult
conditions (Welisara) and difficulty in controlling the discharges of individual industries to the wastewater
collection system operated by NWS&DB in Ja-Ela/Ekala. Moreover, the bidding documentation and
requirement set for bidders were tuned to conventional procurement rather than to the BOT concept. The
focus was perhaps too heavily on technical details while the main point should have been how to guarantee
the performance of the facilities and their compliance with the effluent and emission standards.
The municipal solid waste management and services (SWM) component was extensively studied and a
short, medium and long terrm strategy for solid waste management in the CMA was developed. The
construction of a sanitary landfill, however, did not get under way and was ultimately dropped from the
project scope. Bids were invited twice for the construction of a new landfill and the management and
operation of the facilities. Neither of these attempts resulted in an agreement on implementation.
In the first round, in July 1996, only one of four prequalified bidders submitted a bid for establishing a
sanitary landfill at Welisara, the site identified and studied prior to the appraisal of the project. This single
bid was not considered substantially responsive to the landfill operation requirement specified in the
bidding documents, and would probably have been rejected from the outset under normal conditions. After
long deliberations the bidder was invited for negotiations in December 1996. The critical issue in the
negotiations was the gate fee. The bidder had quoted a gate fee of USD 7.20/ ton while the SAR had
assumed the gate fee to be USD3.00/ton. The bidder was requested to consider his proposal but, possibly
due to his position as the sole bidder, he refused to come down on the gate fee. The Welisara site, while
located about 12 km from Colombo, had only a seven year design life. This, in addition to the soil
conditions, likely explains the higher than anticipated gate fee.
In an earlier estimate by the design consultants the cost had been stated as USD 6-7/ton. The assumption
- 36 -



of USD3.00/ton in the SAR was therefore unfortunate and overly optimistic. On the other hand, the high
environmental requirements and necessary resettlement compensation associated with sanitary landfills
funded by WB add to the gate fee in the order of USD7.00/ton as quoted (in 1996 prices) was feasible,
considering that the consultants estimates were carried out several years earlier. As cost levels have gone
up since, all economic calculations should be updated for new effort to implement the Alupoth Landfill,
paying particular attention to affordability to pay issues.
In any case, the sanitary landfill had been estimated to be more cost efficient than other waste management
options, including incineration and composting (both of which also produce end products to be disposed of,
although in lower quantity than unsorted waste). Later on, waste disposal alternatives were studied in the
short, medium and long term strategy for SWM in the Colombo Metropolitan Area. The credibility of the
landfill option may have been questioned and disturbed by advocates of manufactures of incineration and
composting facilities whose arguments sometimes tend to underestimate the cost and exaggerated the
benefits.
The unforeseen bidding outcome for Welisara and the complexity of the site from the geotechnical and
environmental points of view led to the decision by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to search for a
new that was expected to be more economical and better suited. The site in Alupotha about 35 km from
Colombo was identified, studied and decided upon. Four of fourteen prequalified bidders submitted bids in
March 1998. After rejecting three bids as non-responsive, the GOSL recommended to award the contract
to the only remaining bidder whose bid was considered responsive by the Tender Evaluation Committee
(TEC). WB did not concur with the GOSL's recommendation, and expressed concems about the way the
second round of procurement was handled. The most critical issues raised by the WB were the disregard of
the observations made by the consultants on bids and the lack of comrnmitment of the potential users of the
landfill, i.e., Local Authorities. Eventually, WB decided to drop the funding of the sanitary landfill from
the project proceed.
After spending some USD2.00m. For the SWM component, no practical improvements in the SWM
services were achieved in the CMA. On the positive side, however, it has to be recognized that a suitable
landfill site with detailed designs for its implementation is now available. The environmental assessment of
the site has been approved and its validity is being maintained. Also the land acquisition of the site is
reportedly being processed. Moreover, the recently developed SWM strategy should be applicable for a
longer period of time.
Unlike the SWM component, the Beira Lake catchment's pollution control (Beira sewerage) component
was subject to detailed design only after the credit became affective in December 1995. The design stage
of the Beira sewerage component took the whole year of 1996. Only two of the few prequalified
contractors submitted a bid in August 1997, about 20 months, after credit effectiveness. The contract was
signed in March 1998 and according to the original schedule, the works were to be completed in September
1999. During the Mission in June 2001, the Beira sewerage component was virtually completed with some
balance of work remaining.
The main sewer system network, on-line pumping stations at Polwatta and Slave Island, micro-tunnelling
sections with main shaft-manholes etc. that comprise the critical components of the project have been
completed by mid 2001. The civil mechanical electrical items of engineering works have been observed as
having reached satisfactorily quality levels meeting the required design criteria.  However, with
commissioning the new sewer mains in April, 2001 any defect that may be detected would be promptly
attended to during the Defect Liability Period of one year, while receiving all potential property
conmections.
- 37 -



The rest of the sub components account for the isolated Vauxhall Street Pumping Stations with a gravity
sewer sections as well as a force main to facilitate an unsewered area bordering the lake. Several other
isolated sewers have also been installed within the City sewer drainage networks under the projects. All
these have now been completed satisfactorily to receive connections from residence industries, community
centers etc. within the Catchment areas.
Properties estimated around 6300, in the catchment areas having potential to connect to.the new sewerage
system, include approximately around 1000 properties under eleven or more shanty gardens. It has been
proposed to relocate these shanty dewellers and due action has already begun, which may have to be a long
term programme over several years. Hence temporaiy connections are being planned by the UDA for the
shanty properties under the on-going programme to provide 1600 connections within the project catchment
areas.
Besides, it appears that sufficient data have not been produced by the CMC and the Consultancy studies,
with regard to main causes of sewer surcharges or foul-sewers. It is understood that long term neglect of
desilting of a large number of gullies on sewer line network had caused clogging of sewers. Polluting the
drains and storm water canal network leading to the main lake. This situation has immensely delayed the
provision of connections as envisaged to take place progressively in parallel with pipe laying throughout the
catchment areas.
All in all, the sewerage networks project completion could be rated as satisfactorily since 80% of the
connections under the contract have been reported as complete., The balance 20% of same would be
completed under the UDA programme expected to be completed as early as possible, which will put the
Beira Lake Restoration on a success note.
C.     Continuing Activities to fulfil the main objectives under the Colombo Environmental
Improvement Project
1.     Beira Lake Restoration Project
With the completion of the Main Sewer Network Components under the IDA assistance
maintenance would be sustained by the CMC Drainage Division with necessary assistance from the
National Water Supply & Drainage Board Engineering Division
Focussing on achieving the objectives specified to the Beira Lake Restoration dredging of the lake,
relocation of settlement and water displacement through flushing and cleaning, dredging material
removal etc are being done on activity programmes estimated to cost Rs.4,372.00m. Already
cleaning, gabon wall construction laying linear and nodal parks are being implemented in South
West Lake, for which a sum of Rs.273m has been budgeted for the year 2001.
2.     Solid Waste Management Strategic programmes have been launched by the WPC, CMC as
well as the NGO's and appreciable control on Solid Waste Management crisis is being
realized.
Solid Waste Management Strategies particularly the improvement made with waste collection
methods, separating at source to effect recycling, and composting bins distribution, for which
awareness programme through local authorities and NGOs have been introduced. Furthermore,
small capacity composting plants have been under operation for several years in a few municipality
- 38 -



& local authority areas.
Having failed to procure the sanitary landfill at Alupotha, Western Provincial Council being the
principal Client for provincial Solid Waste Management, was determined to pursue alternative
SWM technologies, and limited assistance of ERM-UK was rendered to Westem Provincial
Council and PERC Task Force, since June, 1999. Several proposals were made for semi
engineered landfills for Local Authorities, as well as Private Sector proposals such as large scale
composting incineration plants etc. have been studied by the Task Force. However, with the
sanctioned SWM authority under WPC being established the SWM Component would receive
early attention to fulfill the original objectives to some extent.
The CMC has the most agonizing experience of having to resolve the day to day collection and
disposal of over 600 ton of waste per day. Failure to procure SWM Component under Colombo
Environmental Improvement Project, the Colombo Municipal Council was compelled desperately
to look for the private sector and has already been successful in awarding a long term private
investment contract to operate over a 25 year period. The contract has already been awarded and
may commence operations on a large scale composting plant with a suitable engineered landfill in
place.
It must be commended that proper action has already been taken by the CMC to achieve the most
vital objective on environmental protections. It must also be emphasized that the GOSL would
pursue to have an adequate Sanitary Landfill Site developed in the meantime, either at Alupotha or
elsewhere without which it is certain that SWM problems in the GCA would aggravate.
Besides, the Transport and Environment Ministry is seriously considering formulation of strategies
programmes and implementation of long term solutions to the GCA Solid Waste crisis essentially
focussing on suitable sanitary landfill strategies already proposed by the ERM Consultant engaged
by the Colombo Environmental Improvement Project.
3.     GIS Facility and Consultancies
It must be appreciated that the GIS division is substantially and suitably equipped to assist in
Urban Planning Projects and establish Data Bank facilities with respect to some of the major
activities mentioned below:
(i)    To produce structural Base Maps and layout of designs with rapid data gathering on site
specific existing structural complex, characterized waterways, by ways, paths etc. in high
density locations.
(ii)   Expected rapid completion of Urban development Design and development architectural &
structural activities in Urban Development Projects using compatible Modern GIS
facilities, to enhance planning & design capabilities of the National Planning Department.
(iii)  In order to Develop Colombo Metropolitan Structure Planing capabilities, the GIS
facilities would directly benefit the activities ranging from project formulations, designs
and project implementation, site specific geomorphologic & physiographic corelation of
Urban Areas and also their Impact Assessment Studies.
4.     Industrial Wastewater Pollution Abatement
- 39 -



The sewer collection system and construction of pump houses had not been completed by the
contractor within the contract period. Contract was awarded in May 1998, but even at the end of
contract period (December 1999) the contractor was able to complete only 21% of work.
The treatment and disposal scheme for Ja-Ela. Ekala and Rathmalana/Moratuwa were to be
implemented with funds secured from private sector. Hence proposals had been called under BOT
arrangements in 1999 & there was only one acceptable proposal. This was not approved by the
Cabinet, as per decision at its meeting held in June, 1999 as the proposal contained a request for a
subsidy by the Government. Cabinet decision also included that this should be funded by the
Treasury funds over a period of 2 years or seek donor funding.
The Treasury agreed to provide funds for the implementation of balance work in stages over 2 to 3
years and agreed to provide Rs. 400 mln. for the year 2001. Accordingly the project components
would be implemented over a period of about 2 to 3 years.
5.     Key Lessons Learned
The Key Lessons that may be learned are clearly discernible, from the foregoing descriptions of the
project components, where the reasons for failures of at least 2 vital project component have been
widely discussed.
Summarized below are the most important issues that need special attention if foreign funded
development projects are to be dealt with in the future.
*      Project preparation should not be carried out in haste and all risks possibly related to the
project and its implementation should be carefully assessed.
*      Institutional aspects should be duly addressed in project preparation. In this project there
were several unresolved institutional issues that seriously affected project implementation.
The roles in, and responsibilities for, sewerage in Colombo between NWSDB and CMC are also
rather complex, in general. This may have affected the implementation of the Beira Lake
Components. In order to reserve more time for implementation, design should be undertaken in the
preparatory phase.
Prequalification of Contractors should be given strong emphasis by all stakeholders, including the
WB. Many of the problems encountered in Colombo Environmental Improvement Project might
have been avoided of prequalification had been better structured. In general, more emphasis should
be put on the international experience and pervious performance of the contractor and it is
extremely important to verify this data.
In bid evaluation and contract award, all stakeholders should be able to come up with one accepted
decision. Disputes in the selection of contractor will most probably result in difficulties in project
implementation. The WB should reconsider its procurement guidelines.
In contract management and project supervision, one of the client's or employers duties is to
respond to the contractors queries within an agreed time. Any delays may give the contractor
excuses and reasons for claims. NWSDB with its multi-layer hierarchical organization may not be
- 40 -



well suited to manage projects as the engineer.
The continuity and institutional memory in the project execution should be ensured by institutional
and personal commitment. The project has been affected by too many changes of key persons.
There have been four task team leaders in the World Bank two Project Directors in PCU (plus
discontinuity between the pre project PIU and PCU). A very critical issues is the change of the
Task Team Leader between the appraisal and the negotiation.
Conclusion
The project has only been partially accomplished, due to several shortcomings on the part of all agencies
including the World Bank. However since Beira Lake Restoration Project Component on pollution
Abatement foul sewer network was successfully completed it would enable to create a sustainable urban
structural business planning stratergy with the facelift programmes of Beira Lake restoration and
beautification of its surroundings. Towards this urban development, the GIS facilities that have been
provided under the project as well as sustainable institutional capacity building within the UDA must be
commended.
It may therefore, be concluded that the overall project performance may be rated as only less than
satisfactorily.
