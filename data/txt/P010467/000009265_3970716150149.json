It provides the final environmental\n            impact assessment (EIA) for the landfill site of the project\n            which will serve the disposal needs of the Colombo\n            metropolitan area over the next 15 years.  The overall solid\n            waste management system will also include one or more\n            transfer stations, through which a proportion of the\n            collected waste arisings will be processed for\n            cost-effective bulk delivery to the landfill site.  The\n            potential environmental impact at the selected transfer\n            station site is also addressed in this report.  The\n            description and evaluation of the potential environmental\n            impacts are addressed under the following headings:\n            socio-cultural factors; hydrogeology and hydrology;\n            biological factors; air quality; traffic; aesthetics; and\n            noise.  Section 2 of the report discusses the policy, legal\n            and administrative framework of the EIA process.  Section 3\n            describes the analysis of alternatives to the proposed\n            landfill site.  Section 4 provides a description of the\n            landfill design and method of operation.  Section 5 provides\n            a description of the Welisara site, including the key\n            existing environmental aspects and conditions.  Section 6\n            presents an assessment of the environmental impacts of the\n            development of the site, and highlights the mitigation\n            measures to be employed.  Finally, section 7 provides a\n            summary of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan\n            in tabular format, including a description of the mitigation\n            measures that were proposed for the site in section 6, and\n            recommendations for an ongoing environmental monitoring program."}, "docdt": "1994-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
