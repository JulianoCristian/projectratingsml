The project comprises four major\n            components. The first is a municipal solid waste management\n            component which will support the construction of a sanitary\n            landfill, construction of a 100 tons/day capacity compost\n            plant the Welisara landfill, provision of potable water\n            supply and other infrastructure for the communtiy residing\n            adjacent to the landfill site and the purchase of equipment\n            and vehicles for safe collection, transport and final\n            disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill. The\n            second component supports a wastewater collection system for\n            construction of a sewer network in each of the two\n            industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect\n            and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two\n            separate wastewater treatment plants built by the private\n            sector. The third component supports a pollution control\n            program in the Beira Lake catchment for the interception of\n            unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm\n            drainage system and connecting them to existing sewerage\n            system and reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning\n            sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping station, and adding a\n            sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake. The\n            final component is a technical assistance component\n            consisting of project preparation assistance, project\n            implementation support, technical assistance to the CMC and\n            technical assistance to the Urban Development Authority."}, "docdt": "1995-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
