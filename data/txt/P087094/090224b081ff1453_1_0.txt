                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved in May 2008 and became effective in April 2009. It will be closing on October 31, 2013. The project has achieved its Project Development Objective and
                         its Global Environment Objective which was to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity for sustainable protected area management, and expand the national network of
                         forest and mountain protected areas. Over the course of the project, areas under protection in BiH have increased by 5 percent from .5% to 5.5% (including High Value
                         Conservation forests and Special Hunting Reserves). Key threats to biodiversity and forest resources in all protected areas (PAs) have been reduced. The preparation and

                         implementation of management plans for all PAs, baseline ecological assessments for all PAs and the development of M&E systems in each park and the use of the Protected Areas
                         Management Effectiveness tool on a regular basis has contributed to the reduction in threat level in the PAs and improved both the effectiveness of park management and the visitor
                         numbers and revenue collection. The government commitment to the PAs is evidenced by the adequate and consistent annual budget allocation to cover recurrent expenditures and
                         priority capital and research and monitoring investments. Commitment to PAs on a policy and legislative level is confirmed by the recently adopted Law on Nature Protection in the

                         Federation (July 2013), and the establishment of PAs as public institutions instead of enterprises in the Republic of Srpska in 2010 through the Law on National Parks. Public
                         support and awareness of the importance of the PAs, specifically their economic and intrinsic value in BiH, has been established through the public awareness campaign in both
                         Entities, the training provided under the project, as well as the Local Initiatives community grants program. Full disbursement of the grant is programmed in both entities (100%) and
                         all project activities originally planned have been executed.
