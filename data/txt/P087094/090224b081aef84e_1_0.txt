                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last implementation mission significant progress has been made by both entities on project implementation. A majority of the project activities have been completed or are
                         underway, while the few remaining planned activities will be contracted in the next month. The disbursement rate has been raised from 55% in October 2012 to 72%. In total almost
                         85% of the grant has been contracted. In addition, all of the specific actions agreed during the previous mission have been fulfilled. Based on the progress made in the last six
                         months, and the increase in disbursement, the team believes that the project will be able to fully achieve its Global Environmental Objective and Project Development Objective.

                         Progress in key areas includes: Baseline ecological assessments for UNA national Park and Blidinje Park of Nature are completed. Preparation of the Red List for FBiH is completed
                         and awaiting final approval. The Local Initiatives Activity has been executed and grants awarded, all sub-projects in FBiH (8) are under implementation and many are completed. In
                         the RS draft management plans and related assessments for Kozara and Sutjeska National Park and Janj and Lom Protected Areas were completed and are now under review by
                         the Ministerial Review Committee. The Local Initiatives activity was also executed and 6 sub-projects are under implementation. The Public Awareness campaign has been

                         launched in FBiH and in the RS. An extension of the closing date for 6 months was granted in November to allow time for full expenditure of the grant and to accommodate delays in
                         park infrastructure due to inclement weather.
