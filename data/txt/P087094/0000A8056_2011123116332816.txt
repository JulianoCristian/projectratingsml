                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although there were some delays in implementation due to recent elections, progress continues in key areas, specifically: Protected Area (PA) Management Plans and Feasibility
                         Studies. In the Federation (FBiH), the preparation of the Una National Park (NP) management plan and Blidinje Nature Park management plan have been completed and adopted.
                         An Executive Director for UNA NP has now been appointed. In the RS, all management plans and related PA baseline ecological assessments for the NPs and Forest Reserves
                         (FRs) have been contracted and will be finalized by February 2012.

                         Protected Area (PA) Financing. In the FBiH, government has allocated EUR 250,000, for UNA NP and an additional EUR 250,000 for PA finance. In the Republika Srpska (RS),
                         Government budget support to the NPs in 2010 was at least 15% (600,000KM) of their operating costs, and was provided in regular monthly transfers. This level of funding is assured
                         until 2013 and represents a significant achievement given that in 2008 budget support comprised less than 5% of requirements.
