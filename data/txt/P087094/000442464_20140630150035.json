outcomes were satisfactory, risk to global\n            environment outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: PA\n            management planning process benefits from use of\n            participatory approaches and carefully thought-through\n            coordination mechanisms. While existing legislative\n            frameworks and centralized physical and spatial planning\n            requirements delayed project activities in some PA, the\n            amendment during the project of the financial framework\n            through the adoption of new nature protection laws in both\n            entities ensured that adequate financing was provided and\n            will continue to be provided after the project closes.\n            Flexibility of sequencing project interventions is crucial\n            in projects that involve a planning phase. Infrastructure of\n            PAs is a basis for quality and sustainable management of\n            protected areas. Additional benefits come from enabling\n            local population to engage in economic activities using\n            proximity of the protected areas. Public awareness rising is\n            crucial for establishment of new and expansion of existing\n            PAs; small grant initiatives are instrumental for raising\n            awareness. Piloting a new monitoring system (PA management\n            effectiveness (ME) tracking tool) under the project, and\n            demonstrating and building awareness of its benefits,\n            creates opportunity to expand the system to other parks,\n            thus increasing the capacity to manage and monitor the park\n            system in the country."}, "docdt": "2014-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
