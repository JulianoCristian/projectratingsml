                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Delays in implementation progress continues, however all major contracts have now been awarded and this should lead to an increase in activities. Progress in key areas, includes:
                         Protected Area (PA) Management Plans and Feasibility Studies - In the Federation (FBiH), the preparation of the Una National Park (NP) management plan and Blidinje Nature Park
                         management plan have been completed and adopted. An Executive Director for UNA NP has now been appointed. In the RS, all management plans and related PA baseline
                         ecological assessments for the NPs and Forest Reserves (FRs) have been contracted and will be finalized by June 2012.
