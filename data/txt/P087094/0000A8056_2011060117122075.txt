                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of April 2011 progress continues in key areas, specifically: Protected Area (PA) Management Plans and Feasibility Studies. In the Federation (FBiH), the preparation of the Una
                         National Park (NP) management plan and the feasibility study for Prenj-Cvrsnica-Cabulja-Vran (PCCV including Blidinje) are underway. Consultants have also been selected for the
                         preparation of the management plan for Blidijne. In the RS, all management plans and related PA baseline ecological assessments for the NPs and Forest Reserves (FRs) have been
                         contracted and will be finalized by October 2011.

                         Protected Area (PA) Financing. In the FBiH, for Una NP, FBiH Ministry of Environment and Tourism has retained 100,000 KM allocated for operational costs from 2009, and was
                         allocated 120,000 KM for 2010. In the RS, Government budget support to the NPs in 2010 was at least 15% (600,000KM) of their operating costs, and was provided in regular

                         monthly transfers. This level of funding is assured until 2013 and represents a significant achievement given that in 2008 budget support comprised less than 5% of requirements.
                         PA Legislation. In August 2010, the RS Government adopted the Law on National Parks which provides a comprehensive framework for their protection function and operation as
                         Public Institutions including the provision of government budget support.
                         Capacity and Support for Biodiversity Conservation. Training on business planning for PAs was provided in December 2010 in the RS and consultants are being selected for
                         preparation of a public awareness and outreach strategy. In FBiH, training in business planning, ecosystem-based management and application of the Protected Areas Management
                         Effectiveness (PAME) tracking tool has commenced.
                         Related Activities in Biodiversity Conservation. As the focal point for the Convention on Biodiversity Conservation (CBD), the FBiH MET has conducted several activities to promote
                         and support conservation. Activities include partnering with the United Nations Development Programme on awareness raising as part of the International Year of Biodiversity
                         campaigns, and representation in the CBD Conference of the Parties in Japan. At the COP, Dr. Senka Barudanovic from the University of Sarajevo was elected as Chair of the CBD
                         Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advance. It was agreed that Dr. Barudanovic would be invited to join the Project Guidance Committee.
