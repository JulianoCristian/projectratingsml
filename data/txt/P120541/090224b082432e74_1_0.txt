                         To strengthen the schools sectorâ€™s institutional arrangements in the short term, in ways that in the medium term will: (i) increaseaccess to school education, especially
                         for rural girls and boys at the lower secondary level; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and learning in primary and lower secondary education; and (iii) enhance
                         efficiency in decentralized governance of the schools sector.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the findings of a supervision mission held February 17-21, 2014, and conducted jointly with JICA (parallel financing). Generally speaking, the reforms supported by

                         this DPL have progressed, but with some difficulty for certain components. Positive results are observed in education access, launching of pre-service teacher training and the
                         process of decentralizing certain HR management functions to the regional offices (AREFS). The more complex reforms, namely optimizing human resources and the development
                         of results-focused management, have seen less progress, partly due to weak coordination between the various projects and activities led by the numerous actors and entities
                         involved. As a result, the PDO can be considered partially achieved, namely in terms of its access and teacher training objectives. While not all targets were met on the quality and
                         efficiency fronts, important actions were undertaken and progress has nonetheless been made (details in Results Framework).
