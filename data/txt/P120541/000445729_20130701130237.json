democratization that the\n            Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has experienced\n            since the start of the Arab Spring has also reached Morocco,\n            although its experience has been a reasonably peaceful one\n            with social demonstrations taking place regularly across the\n            country during 2011 and only sporadic outbursts of violence\n            noted. This social movement started with calls for political\n            change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive\n            development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco\n            proposed a broad and comprehensive package of political\n            reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum\n            held on July 1, 2011. The new constitution sets the basis\n            for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms\n            for the construction of a modern state of law and\n            institutions, and lays the foundation for extended\n            regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of\n            other reforms already undertaken since the current King came\n            to power. Successive national governments have overseen an\n            impressive political, economic and social transformation,\n            with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent\n            years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid\n            foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the\n            stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external\n            shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial\n            crisis. However, as shown, none of these factors provided\n            total immunity to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and to\n            the pressure from the outstanding development issues and\n            challenges. The program aims to strengthen the schools\n            sector's institutional arrangements in the short term,\n            in ways that in the medium term will: (i) increase access to\n            school education, especially for rural girls and boys at the\n            lower secondary level; (ii) improve the quality of teaching\n            and learning in primary and lower secondary education; and\n            (iii) enhance efficiency in decentralized governance of the\n            schools sector."}, "docdt": "2013-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
