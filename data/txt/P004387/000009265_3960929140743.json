project are to\n            strengthen in-service training in the public and private\n            sectors and increase the supply of specialized high-level\n            personnel to staff the Government's policy and planning\n            agencies and meet personnel shortages in technical fields.\n            Specifically the project will: (a) support the\n            implementation of the National Training Policy (NTP) through\n            strengthening the capacity of the Department of Personnel\n            Management (DPM) to promote, coordinate, monitor and\n            evaluate training in the public sector and strengthen the\n            capacity of the Department of Labor and Employment (DLE) to\n            play a similar role in the private sector; (b) upgrade and\n            reorient the Administrative College (Adcol) towards its new\n            role as defined under the NTP namely to focus on short,\n            intensive skill development courses and executive\n            development programs and place greater emphasis on research,\n            curriculum development and the training of trainers; and (c)\n            finance an overseas fellowship program for training in\n            policy and planning fields and in specific technical fields\n            which is not presently available.  The project will finance\n            civil works, equipment, teaching and consumable materials,\n            fellowships and experts."}, "docdt": "1990-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
