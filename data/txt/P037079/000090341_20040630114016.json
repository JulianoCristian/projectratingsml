sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that use of\n            participatory approaches is an effective strategy for\n            community and sustainable rural development. The project\n            installed and effectively implemented various mechanisms to\n            help increase the likelihood of sustainability and reduce\n            the risk of project gains being lost. During the first few\n            years of project implementation, the Department of Budget\n            and Management (DBM) had a one-stop shop that was\n            responsible for the overall coordination and monitoring of\n            all foreign assisted projects (FAPs). The project encouraged\n            and facilitated the active involvement of various government\n            and non-government agencies in the project Agrarian Reform\n            Communities (ARCs). The project's timely and proactive\n            mentoring and coaching of  Local Government Units (LGUs)\n            facilitated the implementation of project activities and\n            improved the quality and transparency of how LGUs do their\n            business. The demand-driven approach resulted in a cycle of\n            mutual credibility."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
