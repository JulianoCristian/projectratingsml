POLAND: KRAKOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
Draft Environmental Management Plan
The environmental aspects of the project were reviewed with officials of MPEC (Municipal District
Heating Company of Krakow), and of the Municipality of Krakow - Department of Municipal Services
and Environmental Protection (Environment Department). and the Municipal Department of
Architecture. This review focused on the assessment of the project environmental issues and the
definition of the scope of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
For the district heating modernization component of thte project, the elements of the EMP in
accordance with requirements specified in OP/BP/GP 4.01 would focus on Mitigation Plan, Monitoring
Plan, Institutional Strengthening (if required), Scheduling, Institutional Arrangements, and Public
Consultations. A format of the draft EMP is in Attachment 1 and will be agreed upon prior to
negotiations. Most project associated issues are quite minor and involve activities during the
construction phase (noise, disposal of wastes-both normal and hazardous etc.). The issue of utilizing
insulating in accordance with commitments under the Montreal Protocol was also agreed upon.
For the ESCO component, the situation is more complex, since specific investments are not known a
priori. The ESCO will either include a technical specialist on their staff or will make appropriate
arrangements with a consultant to identify prospective environmental issues associated with a specific
project. For a given project, environmental issues to be addressed will be identified by the ESCO
(directly or with a consultant), the client himself, and in consultation with the Environment Department.
Generally, there are three groups of thermo-modernization projects with respect to environmental
impact: either a project may require a construction permit or it may not; and in case a construction
permit is not required, either a project may require reporting or it may not.
1.    If the project does require a construction permit, it must receive approval from the Department
of Architecture. As part of this approval process, and because the project is energy related, the
Department of Architecture also requires approvals of appropriate environmental authorities'.
2.    If the project does not require a construction permit but must be reported, the Architecture
Department must be notified in writing 30 days before construction, and with very few
exceptions, no environmental review is legally required.2
3.    If the project does not require neither a construction permit nor reporting, the Municipal
Environment Department must be notified, in writing and on a no-objection basis, 14 days before
construction. In case enviromnental concerns are reported and not addressed properly, the
Municipal Environment Department will issue an objection to proceed with construction within
the 14 days period.
I  If the project is determined to require an EIA, both the Municipal Environment Department, and the Vovojd
Environmental Department are involved in the permitting and approval process. If the project does not require an EIA,
the Municipal Environment Department is involved in reviewing the project and offering an "opinion".
2  Same as Footnote 1.

The ESCO in consultation with the Municipal Environment Department prepared three lists of projects
in accordance with the above categories as well as the list of equipment items typically included in
thermo-modemization projects within each list (see Attachment 2). For projects requiring a construction
permit, the system in place is quite good. and together with the procedures outlined above for identifying
any issues, seems appropriate. For projects which do not require a construction permit, agreement will
be sought that: (i) before the lists are adopted, the ESCO would seek formal review and approval of
these lists by both Municipal Environment and Architecture Departments; (ii) these lists would be
included in the ESCO Operations Manual; and (iv) also, the ESCO would discuss with the Environment
Department any project not found on either list to deterrnine whether or not their review would be
appropriate. Agreement will sought that the ESCO will include a section in their Operations Manual
that would fully describe the environmental review procedures outlined above. A"Draft Operational
Environmental Procedure Concerning the Perfornance of Projects of Thermomodernisation financed
from the World Bank Loan under the ESCO Component" prepared by the ESCO is in Attachment 3.

This information should be on the same chart defining the overall project schedule
(Project Implementation Plan)
E. Institutional arrangements
A discussion for the District Heating Modernization Component (Direct Investment)
A narrative discussion supported by organizational charts detailing:
* Permitting and licensing requirements (from "Procedure-Operational
environment procedure concerning the performance ofprojects of
thermomodernisation granted by the World Bank)
* Responsibilities for mitigation and monitoring
* Environmental information flow (reporting-from who and to who and how
often)
a Decision making chain of command for environmental management (to take
action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down, etc.)
This section should briefly describe how is all the monitoring data going to be used
to maintain sound environmental performance. This would include:
-           who collects the monitoring data,
-           who analyzes data,
-           who prepares reports and how often are reports prepared,
-           who are the reports sent to and how often,
-           who does that person send it to, or what does he/she do with the
information
who has the authority to act on any recommendations presented in
these reports (order an investment, spend, shutdown, change operations etc.)

* Meeting Program/Schedule
* What is to be presented and by whom
Summary Meeting Minutes (Comments, Questions and Response by Presenters)
Note: Meetings should be held. if it hasn't been done already with. say, a sampling of
new customers who will be hooked up, people living near heat pipelines that will be
renovated, and people living near the boilers. If there are any NGOs (e.g. Polish
Ecological Club) they should be involved in this too. This (these) meeting(s) should have
an environmental flavor in terms of what people are concerned about, rather than a
market survey type meeting.

DRAFT PROCEDURE                                                       Page 1 of I
Draft Operational Environmental Procedure Concerning
the Performance of Projects of Thermomodernization
financed from the World Bank Loan under the ESCO Component
Group 1- Building permission
New investments require Building Permission (BP) with the character of decision provided by
President of Krakow. In order to receive the BP, it is necessary to apply to Architecture,
Geodesy and Building Department of Municipal Office (AGBD). Municipal Economy and
Environmental Department of Municipal Office (MEED) consults AGBD. The positive
opinion, the above-mentioned departments, is necessary to grant the BP by the President of
Krakow. In case of the negative opinion- the BP is not granted.
Group 2- Modernisation and renovation report to Architecture, Geodesy and Building
Department
Renovation and modemisation need to be reported to AGBD. In specific situations AGBD is
consulted by MEED. Both especially environmental harmful and possible to worsen the
environment BP, it is necessary to receive the BP from the President of the region Malopolska
or District Building Inspector. If the environmental threatenment is reported, any renovations
and modemisation are forbidden by the AGBD. If the answer of AGBD does not approach, it
indicates the positive opinion.
Task 3- Municipal Economy and Environmental Department Report
Renovations and modernisation, which are not included in Group I and 2 need to be reported.
Modernisation tasks should be reported to MEED within 14 weeks from the date of beginning
of the performance.
Report should contain:
1. description of place and time of performance,
2. general description of undertaking,
3. undertaken operations to perform the tasks,
4. equipment, installed and dismantled facilities,
5. produced waste.
Procedure concerning the waste will be defined by the producer in accordance with The
Waste Law.
If the negative influence on the environment is reported, MEED is supposed to report
the objection in written form. The objection may concern the part or the whole undertaking.
The objection in the environmental area automatically causes the cease of investments.
In case of objection reported to the selected parts of the undertaking (e. g. utilisation of
dismantled materials or equipment), the referent will propose another, in accordance with
environmental requirements, way of its performance.
If the answer of MEED does not approach within 14 days, it is defined as non- objected
decision of the referent, in order to ESCO's operations. Such decision is reported as
a completely acceptable for the undertaken tasks.
