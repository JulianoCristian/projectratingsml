Energy Efficiency Project for\n            Poland had a moderately satisfactory outcome and a moderate\n            risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) When appraising a borrower for an\n            entrepreneurial business, especially in a new market such as\n            the one for ESCO services, the Bank should focus on the\n            capacity of the borrower to be flexible and entrepreneurial.\n            The Bank should consider if the right type of\n            entrepreneurial people will be available to spearhead this\n            new business model and if not, how such skills/attitudes can\n            be brought in to the project. 2) When lending to a borrower\n            that will enter an unfamiliar market, initial loan planning\n            should focus on listing risks and mitigation strategies, and\n            ensuring adequate liquidity to cover acceptable\n            contingencies. 3) The opening of ESCO markets requires\n            changes in the thinking of many stakeholders. The Bank\n            should plan to provide direct technical assistance to a\n            variety of entities beyond the borrower."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
