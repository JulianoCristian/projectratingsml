Efficiency Project\n            aims at improving the efficiency of the city's district\n            heating (DH) systems, decrease heat energy consumption by\n            improving energy efficiency at the end-user level, and,\n            develop knowledge-based mechanisms to finance energy\n            efficiency projects. The project components will: 1) support\n            strategic, and development investments, through the\n            connection of new DH, and domestic hot water (DHW) to\n            customers. By connecting pipeline branches to a booster pump\n            station, the transmission capacity will be increased,\n            allowing the purchase, and dispatch heat from the cheaper\n            source, thus reducing overall supply costs to customers, as\n            well as improving heat supply reliability to the southeast\n            region; 2) finance ecological investments, by sequentially\n            discontinuing current coal-fired heat-only-boilers (HOBs),\n            to instead connect customers to municipal heating systems. A\n            certain amount of HOBs will be converted to gas, or\n            oil-firing, co-financed by a grant from the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF), and, plans to eliminate coal\n            stoves will be explored to protect the environment; 3)\n            modernize heat exchanger stations, through the installation\n            of plate heating exchangers in substations, and, by\n            replacing heating networks with pre-insulated pipe\n            technology; and, 4) finance heat efficiency investments, to\n            include institutional strengthening, by providing\n            computerization systems, and training to improve labor\n            productivity; replacing the automation of the Krakow system,\n            and a number of heat meters, as well as maintenance tools,\n            and equipment. Funding for the Energy Service Company\n            capitalization will be provided, to balance its business development."}, "docdt": "2001-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
