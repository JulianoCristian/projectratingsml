SUMMARY
i.        The Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD) was established in
1967 to provide financing for the creation or development of Rwandese
enterprises and participate in the development of all productive sectors.
The Government of Rwanda and public institutions are BRD's majority share-
holders; however, the private sector and foreign institutions own 45% of
the company's share capital.
ii.       The manufacturing sector in Rwanda is still at an infant stage:
it accounted for 3.4% of GDP in 1970 and 4.3% in 1974. Enterprises in the
sector are few and all but one (a brewery) are small in size. Obstacles
to the development of Rwanda in general and its industrial sector are
numerous including the country's landlocked position, the small size of
the domestic market, the lack of skilled manpower and limited natural re-
sources. The government gives a relatively high priority to the develop-
ment of industry and aims at a 15% annual growth of the sector. Its pol-
icies are essentially to maximize value added to agricultural and live-
stock products before they are exported and to develop as much as econom-
ically feasible import-substitution industries. The strategy is to inte-
grate industry and agriculture through development of forward and backward
linkages between the two sectors.
iii.      Tourism in Rwanda is still undeveloped despite some natural
assets. The government is trying to remedy the situation. Hotel capacity
has doubled in the last three years and tourist activities have also in-
creased substantially during that period. High hotel construction costs
constitute a serious problem for tourism development. The country's tourism
assets could probably be best exploited as part of tourism circuits with
Kenya and Zaire and by locating hotels near such sites as the volcanoes
in the North, Lake Kivu or the wildlife park. Further hotel development in
Kigali, the capital, should be done on a very limited basis.
iv.       BRD is managed by a competent and dynamic team of three persons,
the General Manager and two assistants. Project appraisals are good al-
though more emphasis is needed on the economic assessment of projects.
Procedures for follow-up, procurement and disbursement are adequate.
v.        In the last five years, BRD approved 124 medium- and long-term
loans and 7 equity investments for a total of RwF 555 million, most of which
were in the industry and transport sectors. As of December 31, 1975 BRD's
loan portfolio amounted to RwF 342 million and equity participations totaled
RwF 105 million. The portfolio has doubled in the last two years reflecting
the marked increase in BRD's activities. Arrears are very small representing
less than 1% of the outstanding loan and equity portfolio. BRD's financial
situation is sound although its profitability has been modest.



- ii -
vi.       BRD has now a pipeline of industrial projects amounting to RwF
1.7 billion, of which it could finance about RwF 450 million (US$5 mil-
lion). BRD's approvals from early 1976 through mid-1978 are projected to
amount to RwF 780 million (US$8.5 million), the foreign exchange cost of
which is estimated at RwF 625 million (US$6.8 million). BRD is presently
negotiating lines of credit amounting to about RwF 250 million (US$2.8 mil-
lion) leaving a foreign exchange gap of about US$4 million equivalent which
we recommend be financed by the proposed IDA Credit. This Credit would
represent 47% of BRD's total requirements during the period mentioned above,
or 59% of its foreign exchange requirements. Another main objective of the
credit would be to strengthen BRD's project appraisal capabilities as well
as its internal accounting procedures and to provide technical assistance
to enterprises.
vii.      BRD's interest rate averaged about 7.5% (including commissions) in
the past two years, which is considered too low. Funds under the proposed
Credit would be lent at rates of at least 9% to medium and large-scale enter-
prises and at least 7% to small-scale enterprises. BRD would pay to the
Government an interest rate of 4% p.a., which would leave a 5% spread for
most of its operations to cover BRD's administrative expenses, make a nor-
mal profit and provide needed technical assistance to enterprises. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the government. The free limit
for individual subprojects would be US$100,000 and the aggregate free limit
US$1 million.
viii.      Subject to the conditions listed in Chapter VI, the project is
suitable for a Credit of US$4.0 million equivalent.



APPRAISAL OF THE
BANQUE RWANDAISE DE DEVELOPPEIENT (BRD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Rwandaise de Developpement was established in 1967 to
provide financing for the creation or development of Rwandese enterprises,
through participation in their share capital and granting of term loans or.
guarantees.  Following discussions that took place in Washington during the
1974 Annual Meeting, an IDA exploratory mission visited BRD in May 1975 to
examine with its management the situation and prospects of the company and
consider the possibility of Bank assistance. The mission concluded that in
view of BRD's important institutional role for Rwanda, the request for an
IDA credit that was made to the Bank on June 16, 1975 by the Minister of
Finance and Economy should be favorably considered. The present report
appraises BRD for an IDA credit of US$4.0 million.
1.02      The main objectives of the proposed credit are:
(i)  to provide term financing on appropriate terms to
investment projects in Rwanda which have been well
conceived on economic, financial and technical
grounds;
(ii)  to strengthen the project appraisal capabilities,
internal organization, and accounting procedures
of BRD which is the only institution for the pro-
motion and financing of industrial investments in
Rwanda;
(iii) to provide technical assistance to enterprises
through BRD.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
The Economy
2.01      The latest Bank Economic Report on Rwanda is dated July 24, 1974.
An economic mission visited the country in October 1975. The report is
presently being discussed with the Government. According to this Report,
the Rwandese economy was adversely affected in 1974 by the worst climatic
conditions experienced for 35 years.  At the same time there was a deteriora-
tion of 20 percent in the terms of trade which affected national income,
public finance and the balance of payments. The Report also indicated that
Government was making perceptible progress in the reformulation of its dev-
elopment policies around an integrated rural development strategy, aimed at
reaching the entire population and based on the increase of productivity
mainly in food crop cultivation to ensure food supplies for the rapidly
growing population in the face of land shortages.



- 2 -
2.02      Rwanda covers an area of 26,340 square kilometers located between
Zaire, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi. With a population estimated at over
four million, it has the highest density in continental Africa (152 inhabi-
tants/square km). Current annual population growth rate is estimated at
2.8%. If it continues, the country's population would double by the end of
the century.
2.03      In 1974, GDP per capita was estimated at US$76 equivalent, which
is among the lowest in Africa and in the world. Between 1969 and 1974,
gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices increased from RwF 18.9
to 28.7 billion, i.e., at an average annual rate of about 8.7 percent. It
is estimated that, during the same period, the average rate of inflation
reached 5.3 percent p.a. Therefore GDP per capita in real terms barely in-
creased. Although no statistics are available, income distribution is con-
sidered to be fairly even. The major obstacles to Rwanda's development are
its landlocked position, the unbalance between population and soil re-
sources, the remoteness of the country from the markets for its principal
products, the small size of the domestic market, the lack of skilled man-
power, limited natural resources and high transportation costs due to an
inadequate road network.
2.04      Agriculture is the principal economic activity of the country
accounting for over 90 percent of employment. However, its share in the
GDP declined from 76 percent in 1964 to 67 percent in 1973, as other sec-
tors have increased at a faster rate. Most of the agricultural output is
for subsistence and the average farm size is a little over one hectare.
Productivity and output have failed to increase significantly because pro-
duction techniques remain traditional. Future growth in this sector will
depend on the introduction of better cultivation techniques and a wider
use of fertilizers and insecticides.
2.05      Coffee is the main source of export earnings, accounting for
about 50 percent of commodity exports and 20 percent of government
revenues. Cassiterite, from which tin is extracted and wolfram (tung-
sten ore) account for another 30% of export. Production of tea and py-
rethrum (a basic ingredient in many insecticides) account together for
10 percent of exports.
2.06      Service activities are second in importance to agriculture.
Commerce and Government services accounted each for about 10 percent of
GDP between 1969 and 1974. Manufacturing accounted for only about 4 per-
cent and mining 2 percent of GDP.
2.07      In 1972, Rwanda had a balance of payments current account deficit
of $19.6 million mainly the result of a poor coffee crop. In 1973, it
registered only a $5.4 million resource gap due to a 33% increase in coffee
production, favorable world market prices for Rwanda's major exports, and
a decline in the volume of imports, in part the result of political uncer-
tainties which seemed to have induced merchants to reduce their existing



- 3 -
stocks. In 1974, the country's current balance of payments registered a
deficit of $28.4 million due to adverse terms of trade and to a sizeable
rise in imports. A deficit of the same order of magnitude is expected in
1975.
2.08      The first development plan of Rwanda covered the period 1966-
1970. The draft of a second plan covering the period 1972-1976 was pre-
pared but was rejected by the government. For 1975, a program was pre-
pared indicating anticipated new investments during the year and costs
of ongoing projects. A development plan that will cover the period 1976-
1981 is presently under preparation.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.09      Manufacturing enterprises in Rwanda are few and, with the excep-
tion of a brewery, all are small in size. The Industry Division in the
Ministry of Economy and Finance is in the process of conducting an indus-
trial survey. There are approximately 75 enterprises above the handicraft
level operating in the country. Employment in the manufacturing sector,
including handicraft was estimated at 16,000 in 1973. The brewery, near
Gisenyi, in the northern part of the Lake Kivu area is the largest enter-
prise in the country. In addition, there are six coffee, six tea, and
one pyrethrum processing factories. Most other manufacturing enterprises
are in the food, textile and leather, woodworking, chemical (soap and
paint), mechanical and metalworking sub-sectors.
2.10      Data available on value added in the manufacturing sector are
as follows:

The food industry is the dominant activity in the manufacturing sector,
accounting for about two thirds of value added by this sector.
2.11      The brewery is majority Belgian-owned with no local partici-
pation. Few other enterprises in the country are foreign-owned and many
are government-owned. There is an acute shortage of local entrepreneurs.
Rwandese tend to prefer trade to industry as the former usually brings
faster profit. There is no concentration of industrial enterprises in
Kigali, the capital.
2.12      Manufacturing investments in Rwanda amounted to RwF 144 million
in 1972, 228 million in 1973 and 221 million in 1974 i.e., a total of
RwF 593 million over the 1972-1974 period, of which RwF 308 million (52%)
were for extension of existing enterprises, and RwF 285 million were for
new projects. Agro-industries accounted for RwF 346 million i.e., 58 per-
cent of total investments during the same period. Investments in 1975 are
estimated at more than RwF 400 million.
2.13      Investments in the coming years are expected to increase with the
planned undertaking of several large and medium-scale projects. Some proj-
ects (tea, coffee and pyrethrum processing factories) will aim at increasing
exports while others (sugar, cement, cigarette factories) will be directed
at import substitution.
2.14      The constraints for the development of the manufacturing sector
in Rwanda are the same as those mentioned for the economy as a whole in
para. 2.03, accentuated by lack of entrepreneurial aptitude or experience.
Government Industrial Policies
2.15      Within the framework of the 1976-1981 development plan under
preparation, the government gives a relatively high priority to the
development of industry, second only to agriculture. The main elements
of the industrial policy are to undertake locally the processing of agri-
cultural, livestock and mining products before they are exported and to
develop, as much as economically feasible, import-substitution indus-
tries.
2.16      The objectives of the plan for industry are as follows:
(1) an annual rate of growth of 15% p.a.;
(2) creation of 11,000 new jobs by 1981
(excluding the construction industry
and tourism);



- 5 -
(3) expansion of existing small- and medium-size
enterprises to satisfy the needs of the domes-
tic market and possibly to export to neighbor-
ing countries, particularly in the food indus-
try, agricultural implements, and clothing
sub-sectors;
(4) training and assistance, technical as well
as financial, to local industrial entrepre-
neurs.
2.18      An industrial park has been recently completed in Kigali with
European Development Fund financing. The road network will also be devel-
oped, and a Bureau for Industrial Promotion will be established by the end
of 1976. The latter, presently being organized by a team of UNIDO experts
in the Industry Division of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, will act
as a coordinating agency among the ministries and assist promoters in pre-
paring and implementing projects. This Bureau will probably be staffed by
5 or 6 experts, comprising industrial economists, project and financial
analysts.
2.19      An investment code, enacted in 1964, provides for various fiscal
advantages and incentives to productive investments. It was applied in
only one occasion and is presently being revised with a view to make it
more automatic, with incentives declining over the years. A draft new
code has been submitted to the Office of the President of the Republic.
2.20      Imports and exports are subject to authorization by the Central
Bank. Two types of duties are levied on imports: a custom duty (O to 20%)
and a fiscal duty (O to 60%), both calculated on the c.i.f. value of the
goods imported. Exemptions can be granted by the Minister of Finance for
the import of the start-up equipment of new agricultural and industrial
enterprises. Moreover, exemption of duties on raw materials imported can
also be granted to high priority enterprises. These same enterprises may
also be granted protection from competing imports on an ad hoc basis.
Customs and fiscal duties are also levied on exports. These are either
expressed in RwF (RwF 100-200) per 100 kgs of product or they amount to
5% of the export value. Some products such as tea, pyrethrin, beer, etc.
are exempted from one or both duties. A 5% customs duty and 5% fiscal duty
are levied on exports of torrefied coffee.
2.21      Corporate taxes on net profit are progressive as follows:  20
percent on the first RwF 250,000; 25% percent on the next RwF 250,000; 35
percent for the third RwF 250,000; 40 percent for the fourth RwF 250,000
and 45 percent for profits that exceed RwF 1.0 million.

Tourism
2.22      Rwanda tourism sector is still undeveloped despite some natural
assets: beautiful scenery featuring lakes, volcanoes and rolling green
hills, a fairly equable climate and an abundant wildlife in the Eastern
region. Statistics available on tourism are as follows:
1972     1973      1974      1975

international tourism)

Estimated Gross Income Derived
from Tourism (RwF million) 1/              27.9     33.4      89.1      -
2.23      Although hotel capacity for international tourism is still at a
very low level, it has doubled in the last three years. Tourist arrivals,
hotel bednights and income derived from tourism have all increased sig-
nificantly during that period. However, hotel occupancy is still low
(39%). At present most hotel capacity is concentrated in Kigali.
2.24      To promote the development of tourism the government has
created in June 1973 the Bureau of Tourism and National Parks within
the President's Office. It is responsible for the administration of
the sector, the operation of government-owned hotels and the management
of national parks.
2.25      Plans for the expansion of tourism facilities in the country
include the remodeling of five hotels outside Kigali scheduled for 1976-
1977 at an estimated cost of RwF 150 million. This would add 132 beds
to present capacity. The constraints to tourism are the same as those
that hamper industrial growth: lack of experience and shortage of trained
personnel, high construction costs, geographical isolation, and insuffi-
cient internal transport. Because of this, the Government should be
prudent in expanding tourist capacity and in any event should under-
take a critical economic analysis of each proposed hotel project. The
country's tourism assets could best be exploited as part of a touristic
circuit with Kenya and Zaire.

The Financial Environment
2.26      The financial system in Rwanda consists of the Central Bank, two
commercial banks (Banque Commerciale du Rwanda and Banque de Kigali) both
largely foreign-owned, the Rwanda Development Bank in which the government
has a majority participation, the Government-owned Savings Association,
the newly created Peoples' Bank, the Postal Checking System, and the Social
Security Fund.
The Central Bank (Banque Nationale du Rwanda)
2.27      The Central Bank formulates credit and monetary policies and
manages the country's international reserves. The major instruments at
its disposal include an overall ceiling to lending by commercial banks,
rediscount ceilings, changes in the rediscount interest rate, and reserve
requirements of up to 20% of the commercial banks' deposit liabilities.
In practice, only the first of these instruments has been used effectively.
In addition, all credit applications in excess of RwF Imillion require the
prior approval of the Central Bank. This is mainly used as a foreign
exchange control device to ensure that domestic credit does not lead to
capital flight. The Central Bank also administers a system of import
licenses which permits a selective allocation of foreign exchange earn-
ings. The Central Bank extends credit to the public sector, the commer-
cial banks (although this has been limited), the Rwanda Development Bank,
and, in some instances, directly to the private sector.
2.28      During the period 1971-1973, total domestic credit more than
doubled, mostly due to a rapid increase in net claims on government. In
1974, total credit increased by another 33%, to a level of RwF 5.4 billion,
RwF 3.4 billion of which was extended to the government or official en-
tities. The Central Bank accounted for 55% of total domestic credit in
December 1974, commercial banks 37% (excluding loans rediscounted at the
Central Bank), the Savings Association 5%, and the Rwanda Development Bank
3% (excluding loans obtained from the Central Bank).
Commercial Banks
2.29      The Banque Commerciale du Rwanda was created in July 1963.  It
has four branch offices in the main agglomerations of the country. Its
share capital has been regularly increased by incorporation of reserves
and reached RwF 80 million in August 1974. The government holds 45% of
BCR's share capital. The rest is held by a consortium of European and
North-American banks. Total outstanding loans as of September 30, 1975
amounted to RwF 1.5 billion, almost half of which had been extended to
the public sector. The rest consisted of short-term loans to the private
sector (for import-export, domestic commerce, and manufacturing) and occa-
sional financing of mortgages which represented only 4-5% of total outstand-
ing loans.



- 8 -
2.30      The Banque de Kigali was created in 1966.  Besides its head-
quarters in Kigali, it has one branch office in Ruhengeri. Its share
capital amounts to RwF 40 million, 65% of which is held by Belgian and
North-American financial institutions, and the rest by Rwandese financial
institutions (Savings Association and Social Security Fund). Total out-
standing loans as of September 30, 1975 amounted to RwF 1.2 billion, about
75% of which for financing the commercialization of the coffee crop. The
rest consisted in short-term loans to the private sector similar in nature
to those of the Banque Commerciale du Rwanda. About 2-3% of BK's total
outstanding loans were for mortgage financing.
Term-Lending Institutions
2.31      Outside of the mortgage financing undertaken by commercial banks,
the only term-lending institutions in Rwanda are the Savings Association
and the Banque Rwandaise de Developpement. Total term credit by the Sav-
ings Association outstanding at December 31, 1974 amounted to RwF 150 mil-
lion (2.7% of total domestic credit). It has at present four main branch
offices, eighteen agencies, and seventeen auxiliary offices. It lends
mostly to individuals. At the end of 1974, total deposits with the Savings
Association amounted to RwF 367 million, and represented about two-thirds
of the savings and time deposits with the banking system, the rest being
accounted for by the commercial banks. Altogether, term-deposits with the
banking system represented only 17% of total financial liabilities of the
country's financial institutions, reflecting the low level of development
of the country, its low degree of monetarization, and the limited develop-
ment of banking institutions.
Peoples' Bank (Association de Banques Populaires)
2.32      The Peoples' Bank project, started in late 1973, is financed by
Swiss bilateral aid and the government. Its objective is to open 300 bank
branches in Rwanda over the next 10 years. The role of these mini-banks
is to mobilize local savings and provide short- and medium-term financing
to the rural sector. The first 12 branches were opened in August and
September 1975 and mobilized in this two-month period the equivalent of
RwF 7 million, coming from about 1,200 depositors. It is estimated that
the savings mobilization potential in the countryside amounts to RwF 1 bil-
lion, representing 40% of total deposits with financial institutions at
the end of 1974. According to the project manager, the main constraint in
project implementation is a shortage of trained manpower.
Interest Rate Structure
2.33      The interest rate structure in Rwanda shown in Annex 1 is char-
acterized by (a) the low level of interest rates in general; (b) the rela-
tively wide margins obtained by the commercial banks; (c) the lack of dif-
ferentiation between the remuneration of savings instruments with different
maturities, and (d) the lower rates charged on medium- and long-term
credits than on short-term loans.



- 9 -
2.34      The interest rate on deposits in commercial banks, the Savings
Association, and the Peoples' Bank is 3%; the interest rate for government
bonds subscribed by the financial institutions is 4%, while four-year
bonds issued by BRD in 1975 pay 4.5%. On the debit side, short-term loans
by commercial banks carry an interest rate of 11%, except that loans for
export crop processing and export credits are at 8% and 4-6% respectively.
Medium- and long-term loans, which represent only 5-6% of total domestic
credit, are mostly extended by BRD and the Savings Association; interest
rates for this type of loan vary between 6 and 9%, with an average of
about 7.5%, including commissions. The main criterion used to determine
the actual rate charged by BRD within these limits appears to be the bor-
rower's ability to pay.
2.35      In defense of this interest rate structure, the Rwandese finan-
cial authorities argue that:
(a) Potential savers attach much less importance
to the interest rate than to security and
ready access to deposits.  The head of the
Peoples' Bank project described above estimated
that some RwF 1 billion (US$11 million) could
be mobilized at the present rate of interest if
the banking infrastructure were sufficiently
developed;
(b) There is no need for more savings because
investment opportunities are limited, and
sufficient local funds have been mobilized
so far to finance the local cost of invest-
ments;
(c) The rate of return on most investments is low
(perhaps 8-10%), and higher rates of interest
would discourage potential promoters. The
authorities attribute the low return of in-
vestments to the smallness and poverty of the
Rwandese market, the low level of skills in the
country relative to its neighbors, and the high
transportation costs imposed by its geographic
situation.
2.36      These arguments are not wholly convincing:
(a) Although it is probably correct that security
and accessibility to bank branches are more
important influences for monetary savings
than the rate of interest, both commercial
banks and the Central Bank think that higher
interest rates would attract some additional
deposits;



- 10 -
(b)  There is evidently also some need for mobiliz-
ing more savings. First, about 40% of BRD's
resources have been obtained directly from the
Central Bank rather than from financial insti-
tutions. Secondly, the expected increase in
term lending by BRD in the coming years will
require mobilization of a further RwF 75 million
in the next two years. Finally, Bank credit to
the government doubled between 1971 and 1974,
reaching almost 60% of total credit to the
economy; and about two-thirds of the increase
was through money creation. If higher interest
rates led to larger mobilization of savings,
this could reduce the need for intervention of
the Central Bank and facilitate its management
of money supply and inflation;
(c)  The contention that returns on investments are
so low that raising lending rates would seri-
ously inhibit desirable development activity
is harder to evaluate, because experience is
limited both as to actual returns achieved and
as to investors' expectations and responses.
For the bank's recent agricultural project an
ERR of 10-12% is estimated. A proposed tea
project was dropped when the ERR worked out
at only 3%. BRD estimates that the internal
financial rate of return for industrial proj-
ects under preparation may be around 10%, with
few exceptions such as coffee processing or
tire retreading.
2.37      From the foregoing, there appears to be a good case for a modest
upward adjustment of interest rates, to make the lending rate positive in
real terms and provide some additional incentive for mobilization of sav-
ings, without cutting unduly into the prospective returns to investors. The
rate of inflation in Rwanda was low (only 2-3%) in 1971 and 1972, rising in
1973, and reaching a peak in 1974 of 18% as measured by the GDP deflator and
31.6% according to the Kigali Consumer Price Index. For 1975 it is estimated
that the GDP deflator and CPI rose by about 22% and 16% respectively. In 1976
inflation is expected to decrease and will probably average 7-8% p.a. over the
following five years.
2.38      During negotiations of the proposed credit, we initiated a
dialogue with the government with regard to its policies in this field
looking toward:



- 11 -
(a)  An increase in medium- and long-term debit
interest rates;

deposits.
The dialogue with the government should continue through the period of com-

a view to seeking further rationalization of the Rwanda interest rate struc-
ture in the context of future Bank Group operations.
III. THE COMPANY
Background
3.01      BRD, established in 1967 as a limited liability company, provides
financing for the creation or development of Rwandese enterprises, partic-
ularly through equity investments and granting of term loans or guarantees
and participates in the development of all sectors of the economy. In ful-
filling its mission, BRD is authorized to receive deposits from enterprises
it assists, administer any funds, issue notes, borrow in Rwanda or abroad.
It studies and reviews for the government the public sector development
projects, participates in the preparation of the development budget,
reviews for the government projects to be implemented under the Invest-
ment Code, and assists by any means the development of enterprises in
Rwanda.
Ownership
3.02      BRD's initial share capital was RwF 50.0 million subscribed by
the government and public institutions (55%) and private investors (45%).
In December 1972, the share capital was raised by RwF 100 million, sub-
scribed by the government and public institutions (RwF 76 million) and
private investors (24 million). In October 1974, DEG and CCCE became
shareholders of the company and subscribed RwF 19 million each. With
increases in other shareholders participation, BRD's share capital was
raised to RwF 208 million with the following distribution:

Annex 2 provides a detailed listing of the company's shareholders.
Board of Directors
3.03      The Chairman of the Board and the General Manager of BRD are
nominated by the President of the Republic. The Board consists of eleven
members listed in Annex 3. Six directors represent the public sector,
two seats are allocated to DEG and CCCE, the two local commercial banks
have a representative each and one seat is allocated to the Breweries of
Rwanda, the major industrial enterprise in the country. The Board meets
about every month and approves all BRD loans.
Management
3.04      Mr. Munyarukiko, a 31 year-old graduate in Economics from
Leningrad University, has been general manager of the company since 1973.
Before joining BRD, he was Director General of Industry and Handicraft at
the Ministry of Commerce, Mining and Industry. He is assisted by a young
Burundi national, Mr. Mbonabuca (28) who attended the CEFEB 1/ and IMF
development courses and worked in Burundi's Central Bank for three years,
and a 40 year-old German citizen, Mr. Thamm, an economist-engineer seconded
and paid by German bilateral assistance, who joined BRD in April 1975.
Mr. Thamm has twelve years of experience in appraisal of industrial proj-
ects in developing countries. This three-man team is dynamic, efficient
and its members complement each other well. They constitute a good mana-
gerial team.

Organization and Staff
3.05      BRD's staff totals twenty-three of which eleven professionals.
BRD's organization chart is attached as Annex 4. It comprises one invest-
ment department headed by Mr. Thamm in charge of project promotion, ap-
praisal, implementation and follow-up; and a department of finance, admin-
istration, and personnel headed by Mr. Mbonabuca. The investment depart-
ment includes four young university graduates in economics who have still
little experience and deal with the financial and economic analysis of proj-
ects and two other staff members that are responsible for loan administra-
tion. The department of finance, administration and personnel includes two
accountants, one member in charge of buildings, vehicles, office supply, etc.
and five auxiliary staff members. The existing organization is adequate
for the present level of operations. However, if activities develop as
projected, BRD's professional staff will need strengthening and the organi-
zation will have to be more elaborate.
Policy Statement
3.06      BRD's Policy Statement was adopted by the Board in 1974.  It con-
forms generally to policy statements of most DFCs except for a foreign ex-
change risk clause which is still missing. During negotiations, it was
agreed that such a clause would be added to the policy statement before
disbursement of the proceeds of the proposed Credit. It was also agreed
that no substantial change would be made to the Policy Statement without
IDA approval. BRD's policy statement is attached as Annex 5.
Interest Rates
3.08      Rates charged by BRD on loans for industry and tourism vary
between 6 and 9 percent for term loans, including commissions. On the
average, term loans to industry carry a 7.5 percent charge. During nego-
tiations, it was agreed that the proceeds of the proposed Credit would be
relent by BRD at rates of at least 9% for medium and large-scale enter-
prises and at least 7% for small-scale enterprises.
Procedures
3.09      BRD's procedures for project appraisals, follow-up, procurement
and disbursements are generally satisfactory.
3.10 (a) Appraisals. BRD's project appraisals appear well done although
they do not contain a thorough economic assessment of the projects. During
negotiations, it was agreed that BRD would make an economic rate of return
calculation for all import-substitution projects above the free limit.
BRD's Standard Loan Agreement appears satisfactory and provides the basis
for a good disbursement and supervision system. The Governor of the Cen-
tral Bank reviews for approval all loans and equity participations made by
the company.



- 14 -
3.11 (b) Follow-up. BRD's supervision procedures are adequate. BRD visits
periodically its project under construction and the promoter is required to
keep the company informed of the status of project implementation. When
implementation is completed, BRD staff pays visits to the company every three
months. Moreover, the promoter is required to provide financial statements
to BRD every quarter or semester. These documents are examined by the unit of
BRD in charge of supervision. A note is then prepared on the visit and the
documents for the General Manager.
3.12 (c) Procurement and Disbursement. BRD's procedures in these
areas are competently handled. For most projects, pro-forma bills are
provided during preparation of the appraisal report. For larger projects
(mostly in the construction industry) BRD sometimes requires that there
be competitive bidding. In all cases, BRD requests that the promoter
receive several offers among which the most favorable is selected. Before
disbursement, BRD requires that equity funds be first spent. Loan funds
are then disbursed against presentation of invoices.
Promotional Activities
3.13      Until now, BRD's promotional activities have been limited and have
consisted mainly in assisting promoters in establishing appropriate contacts
and gathering information. In one instance (small-agricultural implements),
BRD prepared a pre-feasibility study and sent it to potential investors.
It is BRD's management intention to put more emphasis in the future on pro-
motional activities in collaboration with the Bureau for Industrial Promo-
tion to be created.
Auditors
3.14      BRD's accounts are presently reviewed and approved by two Com-
missaires aux Comptes.  They do not meet the Bank Group requirements for
auditors, and there are no auditors in Rwanda that would qualify. The
alternative to find French speaking auditors in Kinshasa or Nairobi is
already being explored. During negotiations, it was agreed that a Bank
Group mission would visit BRD in the next few months to examine BRD's 1975
accounts in detail and that, thereafter, an audit of BRD's accounts would
be undertaken annually by an auditing firm acceptable to the Association.
The cost of the first three audits would be financed out of the proceeds of
the Credit.

IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
Operations
4.01      Between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1975, BRD approved 124
medium- and long-term loans and 7 equity investments (Annexes 6, 7, 8) in
the following sectors:

/1   Of which 1 loan for RwF 92 million to a transport company and 92 loans
to individual transporters.
BRD's medium- and long-term loan approvals in all sectors amounted to about
RwF 45-65 million per annum in 1971-1973.  It more than tripled in 1974
mainly due to a loan of RwF 92 million to the National Transportation Com-
pany. Approvals in 1975 have totalled RwF 201.3 million, partly the re-
sult of another large loan of RwF 100 million to the brewery company.
For the period 1971-75, industrial loans accounted for 44% of total loans
approved, while transport and tourism represented 38 and 11% of the total
respectively.
4.02      Almost 90% of the industrial loans approved (by amount) were for
processing of agricultural products. The largest two projects, represent-
ing about two-thirds of the industrial loans approved, were for the expan-
sion of a brewery company and a tea-processing plant. The thirteen other
loans averaged only RwF 5 million, ranging between less than RWf 1 million
and RwF 15 million, in the construction, printing, mechanical and mining
industries.



- 16 -
4.03      Actual internal financial rates of return (IFRR) on BRD-financed
projects are estimated to range between a negative level in the case of a
hotel project and more than 25% in the case of a preserve factory, a car-
penters' cooperative, and a print shop. According to BRD's management,
most projects' IFRR is around 10%. The economic rate of return has not
been calculated by BRD so far but is estimated to be higher than the IFRR
reflecting the economic benefits from increased foreign exchange earnings and
employment creation.
Resources
4.04      BRD has obtained its local resources by borrowing from the Central
Bank and issuing bonds that were subscribed by one of the two commercial
banks. Its sources of foreign exchange are as follows: the Arab League has
made a RwF 92.8 million loan to the government which on-lent it to BRD for
investment in a transport company. This loan which has an interest rate of
3 percent is repayable in 25 years with a 10-year grace period. In addition
the Swiss Fund, a bilateral aid agency, has also made a loan of RwF 53.8 mil-
lion with an interest rate of 3 percent and a maturity of 3 years. A third
loan of RwF 17.5 million has been granted by KfW. It carries an interest
rate of 0.75 percent and is repayable in 50 years with a 10-year grace
period. The government has taken the foreign exchange risk on all BRD's
foreign borrowings.
Loan Portfolio
4.05      As of December 31, 1975, BRD's total loan portfolio amounted to
RwF 342 million, i.e., more than twice the level reached in December 1973.
The quality of the Loan portfolio is considered satisfactory. Loans af-
fected by arrears of more than 3 months represented only 1% of total loans
outstanding.
Equity Portfolio
4.06      As of December 31, 1975, BRD held equity participations in 8 com-
panies for a total of RwF 105 million (Annex 7). The most important and
the only dividend-paying participation is in a national storage company
(RwF 55 million or 68% of the company's capital). The government granted
BRD a RwF 60 million loan (30 years, 2%) to finance this participation.
Dividends paid by this company averaged 12% p.a. in the past five years
and represented an average 40% of BRD's total income during the same period.
The hotel company in Kigali has had some difficulties due to the low rate
of capacity utilization. The other companies are either performing satis-
factorily or have not yet started operations.
Financial Situation
4.07      BRD's summarized balance sheets for 1971-1975 are given in Annex 9.
BRD's financial situation as of December 31, 1975 is sound with equity
totalling RwF 225 million and term borrowings of RwF 280 million against a



- 17 -
total portfolio of RwF 447 million. Provisions for losses at the same date
amounted to RwF 12.8 million (2.8% of total portfolio) and were considered
adequate to cover potential losses on BRD's portfolio. However, in view of
BRD's large exposure in a few projects (para. 4.01), the mission drew the
attention of BRD's management to the necessity of including in the policy
statement a rule limiting the normal exposure of BRD in a single project to
20% of BRD's equity capital. This has now been adopted by BRD's board.
Financial Results
4.08      BRD's income statements for 1971-1975 are given in Annex 10.  Net
profits, which represented 8.5% of average equity in 1972-1973, dropped to
2% in 1974 due to a change in accounting methods. They would have repre-
sented 6-7% of average equity if the same methods had been used. In 1975,
net profits represented only 4.3% of average equity, due to a 66% increase
in provisions for potential losses. Total income from loans averaged 6% of
average loan portfolio in 1973-1975. Dividend payments amounted to 9% of
the average equity portfolio in 1973-1975. The interest received on deposits
at the Central Bank is very low (2.7%), resulting mainly from the low interest
rate stucture in the country (Annex I). BRD's administrative costs, which
were very low in 1972-73 (1% of average total assets), increased to 2.2% in
1974 (still a reasonable level) due to the recruitment of one adviser to the
General Manager and three young university graduates. These recruitments were
well justified by the development of BRD's operations. The average cost of
borrowed funds is very low (2%).
V. PROSPECTS
Business Outlook
5.01      Although the political climate prevailing is favorable, the Rwandese
environment remains a difficult one for manufacturing enterprises to operate
in due to the narrowness of the market, high internal transportation costs
resulting from an inadequate road network, the distance from the seaport,
dependence on neighboring countries for trans-shipment of goods, and lack of
trained personnel. Investment opportunities are rather limited and project
sponsors are few. In addition, there are few well-trained and capable
managers. As a result, the business outlook in the country is only modestly
promising.
5.02      The Third Development Plan that will cover the 1976-1981 period
is still under preparation. However, on the basis of information gathered
by the mission, a tentative forecast for investments in manufacturing,
tourism and transport, and the share that BRD is likely to finance are as
follows:

/ 1   Disbursements on loans and equity investment.
5.03      Industrial activities that have good prospects are tea, rice and
pyrethrum-processing, sugar manufacturing, and tannery as indicated by BRD's
pipeline of projects. Prospects for tourism in Rwanda are limited, due to its
distance from the major markets and the fact that, in the area, it is in
competition with countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The strategy for
tourism development is to include Rwanda in tours through East Africa and to
ask the international tour companies to participate in the financing of the
new facilities.
5.04      In addition to the above, BRD will be involved in the mining sector
which offers some potential for expansion. There is room for a sizeable
increase in the mining of cassiterite and wolfram. At present, the former
is exported to Malaysia and Belgium for processing. The government plans
to establish a tin-processing factory in the country in association with
Belgians. BRD is expected to provide part of the financing. Mining output
is expeced to grow by 22.5 percent between 1976 and 1981.
The Company's Strategy
5.05      In fulfilling its role as a development bank, BRD faces several
external constraints which have been mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter. Moreover, it does have a staffing constraint which, however, will
be remedied in the near future through technical assistance from Germany and
Belgium. An expert in industrial promotion and planning, financed by German
bilateral assistance is scheduled to arrive in Kigali in August 1976. Also
negotiations are under way with the Belgian bilateral assistance program to
obtain another expert possibly in early 1977.
5.06      To help circumvent the obstacles to industrial development and
raise the rate of return on industrial investment in Rwanda, it is important
to increase technical assistance to enterprises. BRD would be willing to
provide such assistance if funds are available for that purpose. It is
therefore proposed that BRD be given a one-point extra spread under this
Credit (para. 5.14) to be used exclusively to help BRD finance a technical



- 19 -
assistance program. The proposed mechanism for BRD's provision of technical
assistance and the expected size and cost of the programme are presented
below.
5.07      It is expected that BRD, in liaison with the Office of Industrial
Promotion to be established within the Ministry of Economy and Finance, would
select quarterly a number of enterprises, small-and medium-size, to which it
would provide technical assistance. The number of enterprises will depend on
BRD's resources and staff availability. The same enterprises could be chosen
in successive quarters if need be. BRD management would pay a visit to the
head of each enterprise to be assisted during the quarter to obtain their
agreement on the principle and explain the major elements of the assistance
program. Such a program should start by a general assessment of the enter-
prise and its management to determine the major strengths and weaknesses of
the enterprise and which aspects should be stressed during the implementation
of the program. Following the assessment, BRD staff members would write a
short paper recommending a specific program of actions. The report would be
discussed by BRD management with the management of the enterprise assessed to
reach agreement on the steps to be taken and their timing. The staff member
responsible for the technical assistance program to a specific enterprise
would visit the company regularly during the implementation of the actions
agreed upon with the management.
5.08      A 1% annual transfer to BRD of the forecast outstanding amount of
IDA funds in BRD's books would total an estimated US$100,000 for the period
1977-1981.
Forecast Operations
5.09      BRD's project pipeline as of June 1976 is presented in Annex 13.  It
includes about 18 projects of medium to large size, plus an additional 20
small projects to be financed each year. Projects in the pipeline are in a
wide variety of subsectors. They include mainly soap, cigarette and brick
manufacturing, peat, tin, cinchona-processing, carpentry and transportation.
Total investment costs of these projects amount to RwF 1.8 billion of which
BRD would provide RwF 490 million. There are five large projects for which
BRD's loans would vary between RwF 50 and 80 million: a cigarette manufac-
turing company, a cinchona-processing plant, a foundry for tin-processing,
a cooperative and a carpentry. Operations of these projects would start
toward the end of 1977 or in 1978. The foreign cost component is expected
to be high (80%).
5.10      BRD's projected operations during the next five years are pre-
sented in Annex 15. Given BRD's pipeline and the government's will to
develop the industrial sector, the projected operations appear reasonable.
Resource Requirements and Proposed IDA Credit

estimated at RwF 625 million (US$6.8 million). BRD is presently negotia-
ting lines of credit, primarily from CCCE and KfW, amounting to about
RwF 250 million (US$2.8 million), leaving a foreign exchange gap of about
US$4 million equivalent which we recommend to finance through the proposed
IDA Credit. Such a Credit would represent 47% of BRD's total requirements
during this period or 59% of its foreign exchange requirements. The Govern-
ment has agreed that BRD would be provided with the resources needed to
finance the local cost component of its investment projects.



- 21 -
5.13      During negotiations, it was agreed that the proceeds of the Credit
would be relent by BRD at rates of at least 9% to medium- and large-scale
enterprises and at least 7% to small-scale enterprises. 1/ The foreign ex-
change risk would  be borne by the Government.  The Credit would finance the
c.i.f. cost of imported goods, the estimated foreign exchange component of
locally procured goods (estimated at 80% of total cost) and the foreign
cost of BRD's audit for the years 1976, 1977 and 1978. The free limit for
individual subprojects would be US$100,000 with an aggregate limit of US$1
million.
Spread for BRD/Financing of Technical Assistance
5.14      To cover its expenses and make a normal profit, BRD needs a spread
of about 4% on its borrowed funds. In order to implement the proposed technical
assistance program discussed in paragraphs 5.06 to 5.08, BRD would need an
additional percentage point on its IDA borrowings. Assuming that BRD will re-
lend the proceeds of the Credit at an average interest rate of 9%, it is
recommended that the IDA funds be relent by the Government to BRD at 4%.
Financial Projections
5.15      BRD's projected income statements, balance sheets, cash flow state-
ments and their underlying assumptions are provided in Annexes 14 to 18. The
company's net profits are expected to increase from RwF 9.3 million in 1975 to
RwF 29.3 in 1980 or from 4.3% to 7.2% of average equity. This improvement in
profitability is due mainly to the expected increase in operations. Adminis-
trative expenses are projected to decline from 2.3 of average total assets in
1975 to 1.5% in 1980, while financial charges will increase from 1% of average
total assets in 1975 to 2.6% in 1980.
5.16      BRD's total assets are expected to increase from RwF 458 million in
1975 to RwF 1.4 billion in 1980, reflecting the envisaged growth of BRD's
operations. During the same period, BRD's debt/equity ratio is expected to
increase from 1.0 to 3.0, still a conservative ratio.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
&.0!      BRD's performance in recent years has been satisfactory.  It has
developed a good working relationship with the government; its volume of
1/   Defined according to the following criteria:
Net Assets       Employees   Annual Sales
(RwF million)     (Number)    (RwF million)
Small-Scale Enterprises        5.0-10.0       Up to 20         3.0-8.0
Medium-Scale Enterprises    10.0-50.0            20-80         8.0-20.0
Large-Scale Enterprises       Above 50.0    Above 80          Above 20.0



- 22 -
operations has expanded well; the quality of its appraisals is acceptable; it
has recruited some competent staff members. The company's financial situa-
tion is sound and its volume of operations is expected to increase reasonably
over the next five years. The areas in which BRD can improve are in upgrading
its economic analysis of projects, and its internal accounting procedures and
in undertaking further technical assistance and promotional activities.
6.02      An IDA Credit of US$4 million would cover about 47% of BRD's resource
requirements through mid-1978. With this first loan to BRD, the Bank Group
objectives would be: (i) to fill a gap in the import financing requirements
of the only long-term financing institution in the main productive sectors;
(ii) to strengthen BRD's internal accounting procedures through the under-
taking of regular audits; (iii) to help BRD undertake a technical assistance
program to local enterprises. Apart from this institution building effort,
the contribution of the proposed Credit to the economic development of the
country is expected to be substantial. The economic rate of return of sub-
projects is expected to be somewhat higher than the corresponding financial
rates of return, reflecting the economic benefits from increased foreign
exchange earnings and employment creation.
6.03      During negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances were
obtained on the following main points:
(i) BRD's lending rate would be at least 9% for loans to
medium and large scale enterpriss and at least 7% for loans
to small-scale enterprises (paras. 2.37, 5.13);
(ii)  BRD would calculate an ERR for import substitution
projects above the free limit (para. 3.10);
(iii)  the foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government
(para. 5.13);
(iv)  BRD would implement a technical assistance program for local
enterprises (paras. 5.06-5.08; and 5.14);
(v) BRD's accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors (para. 3.14);
(vi)  a foreign exchange risk clause would be added to the policy
statement before disbursement of the proceeds of the Credit
(para. 3.06);
(vii)  BRD would be provided with the resources needed to finance
the local cost component of its investment projects
(para 5.12).

ANNEX 5
Page 1
BANQUE RWANDAISE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
I. General Policy Statement
1.   Shareholders
At least 55% of the capital of the Banque Rwandaise de Developpe-
ment (hereinafter called BRD) is provided by the public sector, i.e, the
Rwandese Government and Rwandese public or semi-public institutions. The
rest represents the support of foreign public institutions, private banks
and other private shareholders. All of these have assumed the risk of
capital participation in BRD. The latter must therefore take their interests
into account in the pursuit of its general objective, which is to stimulate
investment capital and so encourage the creation and development of public
and private sector enterprises in the national economy.
2.   Main Objectives
BRD's principal alms are:
- to encourage the creation and development in Rwanda of indus-
trial, craft, commercial and touristic public and private
enterprises. BRD is particularly interested in the promotion
of cooperatives;
- to diversify the country's economic structure, to ensure re-
gional balance in investments and to promote and encourage
the rural sector. In the field of agriculture, BRD will
coordinate its action with that of the Agricultural Credit
Fund now being formed;
- to spare no effort in studying the financing of new enter-
prises and stimulating the flow of foreign investment into
Rwanda;
- to give professional and technical training to Rwandese
nationals, so that they can assume responsibility at every
level in BRD.
3.   Technical Studies
BRD studies the profitability and feasibility of the projects
it proposes to finance. It examines public sector development projects
and projects submitted to the State under the Investment Code and advises
the Government. BRD assists project promoters with the preparation of
applications and the design of projects that can be carried out by
Rwandese.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.   Feasibility and Profitability of Projects
BRD is the sole judge of the feasibility and profitability of the
projects in which it invests. The financial return must be sufficient to
provide the funds needed for servicing the loan. A loan reimbursement
period must correspond to the period required to amortize the investments
financed by the loan.
5.   Social Considerations
When BRD examines an application, it uses not only the tradi-
tional instruments of evaluation, such as cost-benefit analysis, but also
takes into account the socioeconomic impact of the project. BRD pays par-
ticular attention to medium-scale projects submitted by associations. In
particular, it favors cooperatives, which are democratic models of develop-
ment to the extent that they demonstrate their feasibility through the con-
tinuing efforts of their promoters. Other social considerations are: so-
cial disparities which must not widen, the creation of jobs, migration from
rural areas, etc.
6.   Integrity and Competence of Promoter
BRD requires borrowers to furnish it with complete personal de-
tails, evidence of good conduct and behavior, outstanding debts, police
records, if necessary, and a statement from the Department of Taxes approved
by the Director General.
Borrowers must be experienced, and, in the case of private enter-
prises, have a financial interest in the success of the enterprise.
7.   Banking Operations
BRD's activities are prescribed by law. Its banking operations
may be summarized as follows:
To make short, medium- and long-term loans, to subscribe, pur-
chase and otherwise acquire, hold, sell and market shares, to make endorse-
ments and furnish bonds, to take part in the marketing, issue and distribu-
tion of shares and other types of security, to receive deposits from enter-
prises in whose capital and management it participates, and, in general, to
engage in any operations likely to facilitate, stimulate or develop its
role.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
8.   Interest and Commitment Charges
BRD shall charge suitable rates in the light of the Rwandese
capital market situation and of development needs. Such rates must enable
the BRD to cover its operating costs, set aside adequate reserves and dis-
tribute dividends to its shareholders in conformity with a sound financial
policy without discouraging investment in the country. At present, the fi-
nancial terms for its assistance are as follows:
Normal Interest Rate
Rediscountable medium-term credit (1-5 years) 5.5 to 6%
Nonrediscountable medium-term credit              6 to 7%
Long-term credit (over 5 years)                   7 to 8%
Commitment Charge
This is fixed at 2% p.a. for commercial projects and 1% p.a.
for other projects.
The commitment charge is calculated like normal interest on out-
standing balance of the loan.
Agricultural and livestock projects are exempt from the commit-
ment charge.
Guarantee Commission
1/4% per quarter on the maximum amount of credit used.
Interest on Arrears
The normal interest rate on all amounts unpaid shall increase,
without need to notify the borrower, by 3%, 30 days after the debt falls
due. In the case of refinancing of the project by the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) BRD applies the following special rates:
Medium-term credit                                 4.5 to 6%
Long-term credit                                  6 to 7.5%
Commitment charge and interest are payable at the end of each
quarter and the due date.
9.   Peculiarities of BRD's assistance
In addition to the loans it grants, BRD can also subscribe to
shares of private enterprises when dividend prospects are considered
satisfactory. Except when representing Rwandese interests in an enter-
prise, BRD must not be regarded as a permanent lender. BRD shall organize



ANNEX 5
Page 4
its financing with a view to future transfer of its participation to
Rwandese institutions and individuals in order to encourage mobilization
of savings. In principle BRD shall not grant consolidation loans, i.e.,
loans intended specially to repay debts to third parties. In order to be
able to assist small Rwandese private entrepreneurs, BRD sets no minimum
level on the scale of projects. It does not, however, regard minor loans
(less than RwF 500,000 as within its scope).
10. Project Identification
BRD shall seek a profit and conduct its activities in accordance
with a prudent and orthodox financial policy. BRD is nevertheless called
upon to assist in development projects entailing risks greater than those
that other banks are usually prepared to accept.
11. Guarantees
BRD shall receive adequate guarantees for the loans it grants.
Such guarantees shall rank first when BRD is the first lender. The role
of guarantees must not, however, be over-emphasized. BRD shall also take
into consideration such other factors as the borrowers' capacity, the
market prospects and the expectations of profit.
12. Project Supervision
The BRD supervises the enterprises it is financing during the
life of the loan. Its representatives go into the field to supervise the
use of the loan and in general to ensure that the project is progressing
satisfactorily. As far as possible, it assigns supervisory staff to the
project management and board of directors. BRD requires its borrowers
to provide provisional financial statements every six months and a finan-
cial statement each year, prepared if possible, by independent auditors.
The latter shall receive timely progress reports at reasonable intervals.
13. Collaboration with Foreign Financial Institutions
BRD may collaborate with national or international foreign finan-
cial institution under the public or private law, and accept financial
assistance in the form of loans, participations and subsidies in order to
mobilize foreign capital under the most favorable conditions possible for
investment projects.
14. Creation of New Institutions
If, in future, circumstances make it necessary to expand the
institutional structure in Rwanda, BRD will undertake to create such new
institutions either for development of some sector of the national economy
(e.g., transportation, tourism, etc.) or for promotion of a certain kind



ANNEX 5
Page 5
of project (e.g., small projects in rural areas) or for perfecting new
instruments of development (such as guarantee funds, consulting and audit-
ing firms, etc.). In establishing new forms of credit, BRD shall col-
laborate with the government and the Central Bank. It considers that
social institutions should receive aid in the form of government subsidy.
15. Development Fund
A development fund is to be established within BRD. To that end
BRD shall review all investments made by the State or by international
agencies, the proceeds of which are to contribute to the development fund.
II. Policy Regarding BRD Participation in the Share Capital of Enterprises
1.   Objectives
The general objective of BRD's policy is to stimulate capital in-
vestment and encourage the creation and development of public and private
enterprises. The success of this development policy requires the formation
of enterprises in general and of enterprises directed by Rwandese in particu-
lar.
With this in view BRD expects to take up participations in order
to promote the creation of new enterprises and facilitate the expansion of
existing ones. In particular, it proposes to participate in the capital of
new companies formed by foreign promoters. The seats on boards it will
obtain will enable it to represent Rwandese interests, follow the progress
of each business and later assist enterprises with loans or guarantees.
As it was designed to mobilize funds and channel them into produc-
tive investments, BRD would be called upon to play a positive role as invest-
ment catalyst. BRD can perform this role through temporary participations.
Without setting exact time limits, BRD's policy should therefore be to dis-
pose of such subscribed shares to domestic investors. BRD would thus, in
due course be able to lighten its portfolio of participations and reconsti-
tute its finances. It would also contribute to the progressive creation of
a financial market.
2.   Rules Governing Participations
They define the nature of enterprises in which BRD can partici-
pate, the conditions to be met by applicants for participations and the
limit on the amounts of participations.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
3.   Enterprises in Which the BRD Can Participate
Under BRD's charter, it may participate in the capital of Rwandese
enterprises. It is important to make clear whether this definition includes
enterprises under Rwandese law and enterprises with headquarters in Rwanda.
Rwandese enterprises may be public private or mixed.
4.   Conditions to be Met by the Enterprise
(a) The enterprise must be a limited liability joint stock company.
(b) It must have an investment program. BRD must not engage in a
participation confined solely to working capital.
(c) The enterprise should be financially profitable with satisfactory
prospects of dividends.
(d) It must be of use to the country's economy or produce an economic
action (increase in value added, fiscal impact, impact on balance
of payments, impact on employment, multiplier effects).
(e) BRD should be assigned at least one seat on the company's board
for its participation.
5.   Limit Amounts of Participations
(a) Limit in relation to BRD's resources
In general, development banks finance participations and other
fixed investments solely from their own funds. The ceiling on participa-
tions should therefore be the total of its own funds less the value of
fixed investments other than participations. This ceiling, however, would
not cover the participations financed from allotted funds. Moreover, the
total value of any one participation should not exceed 10% of the BRD's
paid-in capital.
(b) Limit in relation to the company's capital stock
The minimum BRD participation should correspond to the value of
the shares required to entitle it to a seat on the company's board.
The maximum participation would be 50% of the company's capital
stock.
