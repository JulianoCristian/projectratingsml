STAFF PROJECT REPORT
SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
A. The Transport Sector
Transport System
1.        Somalia's transport infrastructure comprises about 17,700 km of
roads, 4 principal ports and 10 airports, but no railways or pipelines.
Road transport is by far the principal means of modern transport, although
the road network is inadequate, consisting mostly of fair-weather roads.
Some 10,400 motor vehicles operate in the country; however, camels and
donkeys are also an important means of transport. There is a newly-created
National Shipping Line which has 4 ships, mainly for international trade in
cattle and bananas; smaller craft are used in coastal shipping. Somali
Airlines operates 6 aircraft in domestic and international service, and a
number of small private aircraft are employed in charter service in the
country.
Highways
2.        Details of the highway subsector are discussed in Section B of
this chapter. Previous tank Group-financed projects in the subsector are
described in Annex 2.
Ports
3.        Four ports handle practically all of Somalia's ocean transport;
Berbera, in the north on the Gulf of Aden, and Mogadishu, Merca and Kisimaio
in the south. Ports which berth ocean-going vessels are Berbera, which
exports mostly livestock, and Kisimaio, which exports bananas and meat.
Lighterage ports are Mogadishu, which imports most of the country's general
cargo, and Merca, which exports bananas.  An alongside port, replacing the
existing lighterage facility, is being constructed at Mogadishu, financed
jointly by IDA (Credits 359-SO and 586-SO) and the European Development Fund.
4.        In recent years, import tonnage has increased sharply while
export tonnage has declined somewhat, largely reflecting the impact of the
1973-74 drought. Total foreign trade handled virtually doubled between
1970-75 from 422 thousand m tons to 835 thousand. International trade is
handled by foreign vessels, supplemented by the National Shipping Line,
which was established in 1974 as a joint venture of the Governments of



- ii -
Somalia (51% ownership) and Libya. Transport by coastal shipping is limited,
despite the long coastline, because there has been little interregional
trade suitable for such shipping.
Civil Aviation
5.        The air transport system serves 10 scattered urban areas, with
Mogadishu as the focal point. Only 3 airports have paved runways. During
1969-75, domestic passenger traffic increased modestly, from 18,000 to
20,000 passengers, while domestic freight traffic declined from 321 tons
to 180 tons.
6.        Somali Airlines connects Mogadishu with Rome, Cairo, Nairobi,
Djibouti and various points on the Arabian peninsula. Several foreign
airlines link Somalia with other African countries, Asia and Europe.
Between 1969 and 1975, international air traffic increased sharply; air
freight rose from 166 tons to 1,068 and passengers rose from 10,000 to
33,000.
Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
7.        The Government's transport objectives, indicated in the 1974-78
Development Program, are to (i) open new areas for development (mainly, of
agriculture) and thus increase the economy's productive capacity; (ii)
foster regional economic integration of the country's many isolated areas;
and (iii) lower the cost of, and facilitate domestic transport, thereby
reducing the disparity between rural and urban areas in price and avail-
ability of goods. Much progress can be made before 1978 toward these goals.
The Government intends to achieve them primarily through construction of
main and feeder roads; 2 of these main roads are included in this project.
Other key plans are completion of the Mogadishu harbor and relocation of
its airport, improvement of the Hargeisa airport, strengthening of the
national airline and establishment of a national shipping line (para. 1).
8.        Within the transport and communications sector of the 1974-78
Program, 73% of the investments are allocated to highways, 19% to ports
and shipping, 3% to civil aviation and 5% to communications. The sector
accounts for 25% of total planned public investments over the period,
compared with 35% in the previous Three-Year Program. Although only 60%
of the 1971-73 transport and communications plan was implemented (largely
because of delays in starting projects, particularly the Mogadishu port
project), actual investments comprised 29% of overall investments during
the period. While the current investment plan, which appears sound, is
not likely to be fully implemented, a substantial portion of the invest-
ments will probably be made and the country's transport infrastructure is
expected to continue to improve over the plan period.



- iii -
9.        Highway planning is carried out by the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW), through its subordinate Civil Engineering Department (CED) (para. 18).
CED is, in addition, concerned with ports and airports; the Ministry of
Fisheries and Maritime Transport is also involved in port planning through
the Somali Ports Authority. The National Shipping Line, within this Ministry,
is responsible for maritime transport planning. Airport planning is primarily
the task of the MPW; other agencies involved in civil aviation are the Civil
Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transport and Somali Airlines. Regu-
lation of motor carriers is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of
Transport (para. 15).
10.       Intermodal coordination is not an issue; there is no railway nor
plans for one, and the limited intercoastal shipping is not likely to
increase significantly in the foreseeable future. The General Directorate
of Planning and Coordination coordinates the agencies which plan transport
investments. Staff limitations in both the General Directorate and the
planning Ministries have resulted in heavy reliance on consultants. Thus,
the Transport and Communications Sector Plan of the 1971-73 Development
Program generally followed the investment recommendations made by Grimble
(consultants, Canada) in its 1966 Transport Survey, under the First
Highway Project. In preparing the 1974-78 Development Program, the 1966
Transport Survey again served as a general guide. Under the Second Highway
Project, an updated Transport Survey by consultants is to be completed in
1977.
B. The Highway Subsector
Network
11.       The length of the highway network (para. 1) has not increased
significantly since 1971. However, there has been considerable road
upgrading; paved roads increased from about 890 to 1,400 km between 1971-75.
The total network also includes about 1,000 km of gravel roads and 15,300
km of earth roads. Roads are classified as primary, 5,900 km (Map 1);
secondary, 2,500 km; and feeder, 9,300 km. Under the First Highway Project,
the consulting firm Renardet-Sauti (Italy), whose services were financed by
the UNDP, and CED staff inventoried 7,235 km of the road network during
1965-74, including all bituminous-surfaced roads and certain other important
ones. Under the technical assistance included in the project, the inventory
will be updated and the 10,000 km not yet inventoried will be included
(para. 34).
Traffic
Vehicle Fleet
12.       The heaviest vehicle concentration is in the Mogadishu area;
the second principal concentration is in Hargeisa. Of the estimated 10,400-



- iv -
vehicle fleet, which appears adequate for present demand, about three-
fourths consists of privately-owned and operated vehicles. Data indicating
the growth, age and condition of the fleet are not available. There are
no vehicle manufacturers in Somalia; Italy is the principal source of
supply. Import of passenger cars is subject to tight Government limitations
and high tariffs.
Traffic Growth
13.       National road traffic statistics are not available.  However,
between 1969-74 annual gasoline imports increased by more than 7% on
average and diesel imports rose by an annual average of 20X. (Somalia
has no refinery.) Nearly all of the gasoline and much of the diesel fuel
are consumed by motor vehicles. The lower gasoline growth rate reflects,
of course, a comparatively low traffic growth rate of gasoline-powered
vehicles. The difference between the 2 import growth rates may be attri-
buted to increased use of trucks and of diesel fuel in nontransport acti-
vities, but the limited data do not permit proper assessment of the
divergence. Because an ongoing program for collecting traffic statistics
is necessary for effective road construction and maintenance planning, the
technical assistance included in the project will assist in setting up such
a program (para. 34).
Regulations and Rates
14.       Adequate vehicle weight and dimension regulations were introduced
in 1971, and the Ministry of Interior is responsible for their enforcement.
The maximum gross vehicle weight permitted is 32 m tons; the maximum load
for a single axle is 10 m tons; for a tandem axle, 16 m tons. Overloading
is not a major problem.
15.       Truck operators engaged in public transport are required to be
registered but are not restricted to specific routes. There are no large
fleet owners and most operators have only one vehicle. The Ministry of
Transport through its regional offices allocates, with few exceptions,
specific freight transport jobs to private operators on a first-come,
first-served basis, which seems to be working satisfactorily. Truck freight
and passenger rates are set, with periodic adjustments, by the Ministry of
Transport, which follows the policy of holding rates as low as possible,
consistent with the viability of private transport operations.
Administration
16.       The CED, under the MPW, is responsible for constructing and main-
taining roads, and also for constructing ports and airports. The CED
comprises 6 divisions (Planning and Design, Construction, Maintenance,
Materials, Equipment, and Administration) and 16 regional road maintenance



- v -
sections. There are 3 main workshops, set up under the First Highway Project,
at Hargeisa, Mogadishu and Kisimaio, which cater to the needs of the 16
regional sections.
17.       Also under the First Highway Project, Renardet-Sauti assisted in
organizing, staffing and managing CED and made recommendations about
expanding CED's activities. However, with the departure of the consultants
in 1974, the full burden of the operation rested on CED staff, which had by
then fallen far short of its authorized strength. The shortage of qualified
staff has adversely affected CED operations, particularly road maintenance
(para. 23). In 1976, 3 senior and many subordinate posts were vacant,
caused in part by transfers of personnel to other agencies, including the
National Construction Agency. The Government agreed during negotiations
to fill the following key positions by December 30, 1977, or such other date
as shall be agreed between Government and the Association, with duly quali-
fied and competent persons: (i) Head of the Maintenance Division; (ii) Head
of the Planning and Design Division; and (iii) Head of the Materials Laboratory
Division.
Planning
18.       Road planning by the Government and its consultants has been gene-
rally adequate and is leading to the development of an integrated highway
network. CED has used consultants extensively for both long-term planning
(para. 10) and for project feasibility and design studies. However, technical
assistance and professional and subprofessional training elements of the First
and Second Bank Group-financed Highway Projects have contributed to increasing
CED's planning capability. Technical assistance under this project focuses
on further building up the Department's capacity to plan and carry out
maintenance of the expanding paved road system (paras. 23-24 and 34).
Financing
Road Expenditures
19.       Road maintenance expenditures more than doubled from 1970 to 1974,
from So.Sh. 2.5-6.3 million. Administrative expenditures increased more
moderately, from So.Sh. 3.5-4.5 million. Outlays for road construction rose
dramatically over 1971-75, mainly due to construction of the 1,045 km Belet
Uen-Burao road by the Peoples Republic of China; the cost of this 5-year
project has been estimated at So.Sh. 400 million, or about So.Sh. 80 million
per annum. During 1971-75, funds from external sources varied from 77-95%
of annual construction expenditures, and, in the years ahead, funds for
major construction are likely to continue to come largely from external
loans or grants.
Road User Revenues
20.       Road users contribute to general Government revenue through taxes
and duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts, and through license



- vi -
and registration fees. Among these levies, the fuel tax, collected by the
Customs Department, constitutes the major source of road user revenue. In
1974, the year for which the most comprehensive data are available, road
user taxes and duties amounted to about So.Sh. 90 million, against the
So.Sh. 146.5 million expended for road administration, maintenance and con-
struction. Although outlays thus exceeded revenues, construction expendi-
tures in 1974 were unusually high, because of the Chinese road, and are not
expected to continue at that level beyond 1978.
Engineering
21.       CED's Planning and Design Division carries out minor design work,
such as small drainage structures, while major design is done by foreign
consultants. Design standards for primary roads are adequate. Establish-
ment of appropriate standards for lower road categories is expected soon.
Construction
22.       With the exception of the Chinese road, major roads generally are
constructed and supervised by foreign contractors and consultants. In the
recent past, departmental forces have constructed some major roads but are
now concentrating on construction of earth roads. The Government favors
construction by its National Construction Agency so, apart from a few small
contractors capable of constructing simple road works or providing sub-
contracted transport, there is virtually no local construction industry.
In the past, transport subcontracts on civil works projects have resulted
in disputes because of the use of per diem rates as a basis for subcontract
prices; since it is preferable to use ton/km rates for such purposes an
agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that any such
transport subcontracts under the project would be based on ton/km rates.
Maintenance
23.       The Government is anxious to improve road maintenance, which is
carried out by CED (para. 16) through force account. Although maintenance
has improved over the years, the quantity and quality of work is unsatis-
factory and has not kept pace with the expanding paved road network.
24.       The main causes of inadequate road maintenance are lack of exper-
tise (paras. 17 and 26-27) and insufficient allocation of funds despite
recent increases (para. 19). Further, CED's equipment repair facilities are
insufficient, and the Department's personnel and equipment are often diverted
to other public works projects. These problems are addressed under the
present project. First, technical assistance is provided to aid in increas-
ing and improving maintenance planning and operations, including training
of CED staff (para. 34). Second, during negotiations, it was agreed that
the Government will adequately maintain its highway systems in accordance
with sound engineering practices and will include adequate amounts for
maintenance in its budget each year. Third, machineshop equipment necessary



- vii -
for equipment repairs and training has been included. With financing provided
by the European Development Fund under the First Highway Project, about US$1.4
million worth of maintenance and workshop equipment was purchased during
1970-73, some of which was used to set up the 3 main workshops in 1970 (para.
16). As a continuation of this effort, the machineshop equipment provided
under the project will aid in further developing maintenance capacity (para.
35). Finally, it was also agreed during negotiations that, except as the
Association may otherwise agree, CED highway maintenance staff and equipment
will be used exclusively for highway maintenance.
Training
25.       Under the First Highway Project, UNDP financed a program of
training abroad for Somali engineers and technicians during 1965-74. Of
the 17 persons who received training in various countries, 8 are still in
the MPW, and most of the others are employed in other Government agencies.
Several engineers and technicians are currently being trained abroad to meet
CED's growing needs.
26.       During 1965-74, also under the First Highway Project, Renardet-
Sauti organized and conducted courses at CED headquarters for subprofessional
Somali personnel in various areas of highway operations, particularly survey-
ing, planning, drafting and soils laboratory work. In addition, the consult-
ants provided satisfactory on-the-job training for mechanics, operators and
drivers. As a result of these efforts, a basic capability to conduct
highway operations was developed, although further training is needed (para.
27).
27.       About 40 skilled workers are receiving on-the-job training at
a field workshop set up by the Peoples Republic of China for construction
of the Belet Uen-Galcaio-Burao road. Additionally, the CED holds training
classes in Mogadishu for mechanics employed in the main workshop. Although
these programs have alleviated the shortage of trained personnel, further
training is needed and is provided under the project. Through the technical
assistance, highway manpower requirements will be assessed and a plan to meet
these needs will be drawn up, including a training program and its implemen-
tation (para. 34).
C. The Project
Objectives
28.       Somalia's road development objectives include upgrading the
primary road system, which is comprised mostly of earth and gravel roads,
in order to overcome serious traffic interruptions during rains, enable



- viii -
roads to carry livestock traffic and reduce high vehicle operating costs.
The Government also aims to improve the maintenance of its rapidly expand-
ing paved road network.
29.       The project will assist in attaining these objectives by financing
the construction of high priority road sections included in the 1974-78
Development Program and by further strengthening the institution responsible
for road maintenance. In addition, the project will finance a feasibility
study and detailed engineering of a road which the Government considers
necessary for planned agricultural and industrial development. Construction
of this road could form the basis of a fourth highway project in the
country.
Project Description
30.       The project consists of:
(i) construction, and related supervision, of the Hargeisa-Borama
road (113 km), with a link to Tug Wajale (19 km);
(ii)  a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Dinsor-
Bardera-Gelib road (about 340 km); and
(iii)  strengthening of CED through provision of technical assistance,
training and machineshop equipment.
(i) Road Construction and Supervision
31.       The Hargeisa-Borama road and Tug Wajale link are a major part
of the transport infrastructure of northwest Somalia. The roads will
provide an all-weather connection between Borama/Tug Wajale and Hargeisa,
which is already linked to the port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden by a
bituminous-surfaced road built under the Second Highway Project (Map 2).
32.       Improvement of the Hargeisa-Tug Wajale road was identified as a
priority project in the 1966 Transport Survey, financed under the First
Highway Project, and is included in Government's current development plan.
The Second Highway Project included a feasibility study and detailed engi-
neering of this road, plus an extension westward to Borama; the results
of the study, completed in June 1975, were favorable. Design standards
are satisfactory, and draft bidding documents have been completed. Con-
sultants will be engaged for construction supervision.
(ii) Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering
33.       The 1974-78 Development Program includes upgrading of the exist-
ing fair-weather road between Dinsor, Bardera and Gelib (approximately
340 km) to facilitate development of the Juba Valley where agricultural
and industrial investments are planned. The project provides for a
feasibility study of the road and detailed engineering subject to the find-
ings of the study.



-ix -
(iii) Strengthening of CED
a)   Technical Assistance
34.       Since road maintenance demands are growing rapidly, there is a
continuing need to increase and improve CED operations (para. 23-24). The
technical assistance provided under the project will assist with the setting
up of a continuous program of road and traffic data collection, including
an updated and expanded road inventory; maintenance planning and operations,
including equipment management and control; and an assessment of highway
manpower needs, including planning and implementation of staff training.
On-the-job training of professional staff is included, as well as training
on-the-job and in the classroom of existing and new mechanics, operators,
drivers and spare part inventory control staff.
b)   Machineshop Equipment
35.       The machineshop at CED headquarters has limited facilities for
day-to-day equipment repairs and for on-the-job training of existing and
new workshop mechanics (para. 24). MPW has requested assistance in provid-
ing specific equipment required for necessary workshop operations and for
training purposes; this is also included in the project.
Project Cost Estimate
36.       Total project cost is estimated at US$30.01 million (net of taxes
and duties) including contingencies. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$22.49 million (75% of total project cost). Project costs,
as of December 31, 1976, are summarized below.

Physical contingencies, to cover unforeseen quantity increases, are equivalent
to 10% of items i-v(a). Price contingencies, which provide for anticipated
cost increases over the implementation period, were derived as follows:
1977      1978-79
Civil Works          9%           9%
Equipment            7.5%
Price contingencies for civil works are equivalent to a cumulative 18% of con-
struction costs and for items ii-v(a), 10%. Risk allowance in an amount equal
to US$4.78 million is included to account for higher costs estimated by the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AF) for civil works construc-
tion; AF and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) believe that, on the basis of
their experience in Africa and Middle East and their January 1977 appraisal,
the cost of civil works construction should be US$25.32 million against IDA
appraisal cost estimate of US$20.54 million, including contingencies.
Financing
37.       IDA will finance US$7.0 million civil works construction, its related
supervision, and feasibility study and detailed engineering for the Dinsor-
Bardera-Gelib road. This amount includes US$0.41 million representing IDA's
share of the risk allowance, which will be cancelled from the credit in the



- xi -
event the amount of responsive bids for civil works construction are substan-
tially below the costs estimated by AF and IDB. AF will joint finance US$6.75
million of civil works construction and related supervision, and will parallel
finance strengthening CED, US$1.25 million. IDB will joint finance US$7.5
million of civil works construction and related supervision, and AfDF will also
joint finance this component in the amount of US$5.5 million. Government will
finance the balance of the project cost. The overall financing plan comprises:

IDA-19%, AF-26%, IDB-28%, AfDB-21% and Government 6%. The loans of AF and IDB
have been negotiated, and the AfDF loan is expected to be negotiated shortly;
the credit/loans of the external agencies, including IDA, are to become effec-
tive simultaneously.
Implementation
38.       Project implementation will be the responsibility of CED.  Con-
struction and related supervision of the project roads will take about 2-1/2
years, beginning mid-1977, with an estimated 15% of works to be carried out
in 1977, about 50% in 1978 and the remainder in 1979. The feasibility study
will be conducted by consultants over about 15 months beginning late 1977.
Depending on the results of that study, consultants will then undertake
detailed engineering, which should require a further 12 months, beginning
early-1979. Technical assistance is expected to begin mid-1977 and continue
for 2 years. The machineshop equipment will be procured over about 9 months
during 1977-78. Arrangements for reporting project implementation progress,
as well as an implementation schedule, were discussed in detail and agreed
during negotiations.
Procurement
39.       The civil works will be procured under single unit price contract
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
"Guidelines for Procurement". The co-financing agencies will follow
these guidelines. Bids on civil works construction are expected in June



- xii -
1977, and tender award in August 1977. No problems are anticipated in
acquiring land for right-of-way because the Government has the right of
eminent domain.
40.       The consulting for construction supervision, the feasibility ser-
vices and detailed engineering services will be by qualified and experienced
individuals under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.
Disbursements
41.       Disbursements from the credit account will be on the basis of
(i) 19% of the total cost of civil work construction and related supervision
and (ii) 80% of the total cost of the feasibility study and detailed engineer-
ing included in the project. The Government has informed the Association that
if the responsive bids for the civil works component are substantially below
the estimated cost, including the risk allowance, then IDA in consultation
with the Government will reduce the civil works allocation correspondingly by
an amount not exceeding US$410,000.
Environmental Aspects
42.       While some roadside commercial development is expected, no serious
environmental problems are likely to arise.
D. Economic Evaluation
Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
43.       The project roads will constitute an important element in the
national road system by extending the paved road westward from Hargeisa,
Somalia's second largest city, to Borama and Tug Wajale through an area
which produces considerable livestock and agricultural crops. In addition
to serving the growing transport demand within the northwest region, the
roads will facilitate trade with Ethiopia. The main benefits will be
increased revenues from livestock exports as a result of an anticipated
shift from livestock trekking to truck transport, with consequent reduced
loss in animal weight. Potential weight savings are a powerful incentive,
as evidenced by the virtually complete shift to trucking of livestock on
the new Hargeisa-Berbera road in the first year after the road opened.
Another principal benefit is savings in vehicle operating costs for normal
traffic. The main beneficiaries will be the direct road users, but benefits
will be widely distributed among producers, traders and consumers because
of the Government's transport rate policy (para. 15).
44.       The economic return on the road construction is 21%.  However, if
there should be a 25% increase in construction costs, as well as a reduction
of 33% in livestock price and 50% in the livestock growth rate, the return
would still be a satisfactory 12%. The major project risk is construction



- xiii -
cost increases (para. 36). An economic return on the technical assistance and
studies, which account for about 10% of project costs, has not been made;
however, their benefits, particularly improved maintenance and administration,
will be great.
E. Conclusions, Recommendations and Loan Conditions
45.       During negotiations, agreement with Government was reached that:
(i) following key positions will be filled by December 30, 1977,
or such other date as shall be agreed between Government and
the Association, with duly qualified and competent persons:
(a) Head of the Maintenance Division; (b) Head of the Plan-
ning and Design Division; and (c) Head of the Materials and
Laboratory Division (para. 17);
(ii) ton/km rates will be adopted as the basis for pricing transport
sub-contracts, if any, on civil works involved in the project
(para. 22);
(iii) except as the Association may otherwise agree, CED highway
maintenance staff and equipment will be used exclusively for
highway maintenance (para. 24);
(iv) the Government will adequately maintain its highway system in
accordance with sound engineering practices, and will provide
promptly as needed, the funds, equipment, facilities, staff,
services and other resources required for the purpose, and in
particular will ensure that adequate amounts for road mainte-
nance are included in its budget each year (para. 24);
(v) Government shall furnish to the Association necessary reports
on the agreed program of work during project implementation
(para. 38);
(vi) procurement under IDA and Government financing will be in ac-
cordance with Bank Group guidelines (para. 39); and
(vii) Government shall employ for construction supervision, the
feasibility study and detailed engineering, consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employ-
ment shall be satisfactory to the Association (para. 40).
46.       The IDA credit and the loans of the other external agencies are to
become effective simultaneously (para. 37).
47.       Having reached agreement on the issues set out above, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$7.0 million on the usual terms to the
Somali Democratic Republic.






1. TRANSPORT IN SOMALIA
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
Topography and Climate
1.01      Somalia (630,000 km ) lies in the northeastern corner of Africa
at the Horn of Africa. Its coastline is one of the longest of any country
on the continent although it contains few natural harbors. In the west and
south, Somalia borders on Ethiopia and Kenya; and in the northwest, on the
Territory of Afars and Issas (French Somaliland). The shape of Somalia
is such that the shortest transport routes between the northwest and southern
areas are through eastern Ethiopia.
1.02      Topographically, Somalia consists of plateau and steppe lands
sloping from the Ethiopian highlands to the Indian Ocean in the east and
to the Gulf of Aden in the north. In the northern region and parts of the
east, the relief is broken by chains of mountains and some steep escarp-
ments. There is a relatively broad coastal plain in the south. Apart
from the escarpments, the terrain does not impose serious difficulties
for road construction; road-building materials are plentiful.
1.03      Most of Somalia is arid to semi-arid, with a harsh environment.
Rainfall is not only low but also irregular, so that risk of drought is
ever-present. The areas more favored with rainfall are the northwest and
the south. The two main rivers of Somalia, the Shabele and the Juba, rise
in Ethiopia and flow through the south; neither is navigable. Other
rivers and streams are seasonal torrents which can cause considerable
damage to roads unless precautionary measures are taken in road construc-
tion and maintenance.
Population
1.04      Based on limited available data, total population is estimated
at 3.2 million and is growing at about 2.5% per annum. About 90% lives in
rural areas and m 9st of the rural people are nomads. The sparse population
(5 persons per km ) is unevenly distributed, with the highest concentration
(400,000-600,000) in the southern region around the capital, Mogadishu, and
in the basins of the Juba and Shabele Rivers. In the northern region, the
main population concentration is around Berbera-Hargeisa-Tug Wajale. As a
consequence of the settlement pattern, transport development has proceeded
mainly in the southern and northwestern areas.
Economic Activity
1.05      Animal husbandry is the main occupation of the rural population,
and livestock accounts for about 65% of total exports. Bananas, grown near
the southern coast, are the only other major export product and have accounted



-2-
for 20-28% of total exports in recent years. (Data on overall transport
demand in Somalia are not available, but export statistics give some insight
into an important element of commercial traffic, such as livestock and
bananas.) Total exports increased from So.Sh. 232 million to So.Sh. 391
million between 1969 and 1974, according to statistics obtained from the
Somalia National Bank Bulletin:

1.06      Somalia has no national income accounts, but available data indi-
cate that domestic output in agriculture and livestock reached a peak in 1972
and declined somewhat in 1973-74, mainly because of a drought during that
period. Over the past decade, economic growth has been most evident around
the principal ports and population centers and transport demand is concen-
trated in these limited areas.
B. The Transport System
1.07      Road transport is by far the principal modern transport mode
in Somalia, although the road network is very limited. The transport infra-
structure comprises 17,700 km of roads, 4 principal ports and 10 airports,
but no railways or pipelines.
1.08      Although some 10,400 motor vehicles operate in the country, camels
and donkeys are also an important means of transport. Many of the estimated
2.5 million camels in Somalia are used for this purpose, but no data are
available on the type and quantity of goods transported. Roughly I million
nomads use camels for transporting their belongings from place to place in
search of suitable grazing areas. Camels are capable of carrying 100 kg
loads over average distances of 30 km per day. The ability of camels to



- 3 -
function effectively in areas of limited water and forage makes them well-
suited to the vast dry areas of Somalia. Thousands of donkeys haul small
loads within cities, as well as to and from communities. Typically,
a donkey pulls a two-wheeled, rubber-tired cart on which freight such as
firewood, hay and building materials is loaded.
Highways
1.09      Details of the highway subsector are discussed in Chapter 2.
Previous Bank Group-financed projects in the subsector are described in
Annex 2.
Ports
1.10      Four ports handle practically all of Somalia's ocean transport,
namely, Berbera in the north on the Gulf of Aden and Mogadishu, Merca and
Kisimaio in the south. Ports which berth ocean-going vessels are Berbera,
which exports mostly livestock, and Kisimaio, which exports bananas and
meat. Lighterage ports are Mogadishu, which imports most of the country's
general cargo, and Merca, which exports bananas. An alongside port is
being constructed at Mogadishu, financed jointly by IDA (Credits 359-SO
and 586-SO) and the European Development Fund, with completion expected in
1977. The principal effects of this new port will be more efficient handling
of cargo and some diversion of banana traffic from Merca to Mogadishu.
1.11      The main ports have handled a sharply increasing volume of import
cargo in recent years. However, exports have fluctuated widely; the recent
downward trend largely reflects the impact of the 1973-74 drought. Total
foreign trade handled virtually doubled between 1970-75, according to data
from the Somali Port Authority:

1.12      Most of Somalia's international trade is handled by foreign
vessels, supplemented by the National Shipping Line, which was established
in 1974 as a joint venture of the Governments of Somalia (51% ownership)
and Libya. This line operates 2 refrigerator ships, of 4,000 tons and
4,700 tons capacity, a livestock-carrying ship of 2,500 tons capacity and
a small coastal vessel. A fifth vessel is undergoing modification to improve
its efficiency.
1.13      Transport by coastal shipping within Somalia is small, despite
the long coastline, because there has been little interregional trade suit-
able for such shipping. However, a 100,000 m ton cement plant under con-
struction in Berbera will send some of its output by ship to Mogadishu.
Current development of commercial fishing is also expected to stimulate some
growth of coastal shipping because the fish are to be transported from a
number of small ports to a few processing and distribution centers, parti-
cularly Mogadishu and Berbera.
Civil Aviation
1.14      The air transport system in Somalia serves 10 scattered urban
areas, with Mogadishu as the focal point. Only 3 airports have paved run-
ways. Somali Airlines operates 3 DC-3's, 2 turboprop aircraft (F-27,
Viscount) and a chartered Boeing 720-B. Domestic air passenger traffic
increased modestly during 1969-74, while domestic freight traffic declined,
indicating that air transport has yet to achieve its real domestic potential.
According to information from Somali Airlines, the traffic has grown as
follows:

Djibouti and various points on the Arabian peninsula. Several foreign
airlines link Somalia with other African countries, Asia and Europe.

C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
The Current Economic Development Plan
1.16      The Government's overall economic objectives are set out in the
1974-78 Development Program prepared by the former Ministry of Planning and
Coordination, now the General Directorate of Planning and Coordination.
The largest investments are planned for irrigated agriculture. Industry
is to be expanded, mainly to build import substitution plants using domestic
raw materials. Development strategy for the livestock sector, which accounts
for two-thirds of the country's exports and provides a livelihood for much
of the population, emphasizes increasing production. Investment resources
planned for the livestock sector in the 1974-78 Program are considerably
less than those planned for agriculture, but appear adequate for Somalia's
needs. Transport accounts for a substantial part of total investment, as
in the previous Three-Year Program.
Current Transport Development Objectives
1.17      The Government's transport objectives, as indicated in the 1974-78
Program, are to (i) open new areas for development (mainly, of agriculture)
and thus increase the economy's productive capacity; (ii) foster regional
economic integration of the country's many isolated areas; and (iii) lower
the cost of, and facilitate domestic transport, thereby reducing the dispa-
rity between rural and urban areas in price and availability of goods.
Much progress can be made in 1974-78 toward these goals. The Government
intends to achieve them primarily through construction of main and feeder
roads; 2 of these main roads are included in this project. Other key plans
are the completion of the Mogadishu harbor and relocation of its airport,
improvement of the Hargeisa airport, strengthening of the national airline
and establishment of a national shipping line (which took place in 1974).



-6-
Previous and Planned Transport Investments
1.18      Transport and communications account for 25% of total planned
public investment over the 1974-78 period, compared with 35% in the previous
Three-Year Program. Only 60% of the 1971-73 investment plan for this sector
was implemented, largely because of delays in starting projects, particularly
the Mogadishu port project. Nevertheless, actual investments comprised 29%
of overall investments during the period.
1.19      Within the transport and communications sector of the 1974-78
Program, the investment resources are allocated as follows:

While this investment plan, which appears to be sound, is not likely to
be fully implemented, a substantial portion of the investments will pro-
bably be made and the country's transport infrastructure is expected to
continue to improve over the plan period.
Transport Planning Authorities
1.20      Highway planning is carried out by the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW), through its subordinate Civil Engineering Department (CED) (paras.
2.08-.10). CED is, in addition, concerned with ports and airports; the
Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Transport is also involved in port
planning through the Somali Ports Authority. The National Shipping Line,
within this Ministry, is responsible for maritime transport planning. Air-
port planning is primarily the task of the MPW; other agencies involved in
civil aviation are the Civil Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transport
and Somali Airlines. Regulation of motor carriers is mainly the responsibility
of the Ministry of Transport (para. 2.05).
Transport Coordination
1.21      Intermodal coordination is not an issue; there is no railway nor
plans for one, and the limited intercoastal shipping is not likely to
increase significantly in the foreseeable future. The General Directorate
of Planning and Coordination coordinates the agencies which plan transport
investments. Staff limitations in both the General Directorate and the
planning Ministries have resulted in heavy reliance on consultants. Thus,



- 7 -
the Transport and Communications Sector Plan of the 1971-73 Development
Program generally followed the investment recommendations made by Grimble
(consultants, Canada) in its 1966 Transport Survey, under the First Highway
Project. In preparing the 1974-78 Development Program, the 1966 Transport
Survey again served as a general guide. Under the Second Highway Project,
an updated Transport Survey by consultants is to be completed in 1977.
2. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Network
2.01      The length of the highway network (para. 1.07) has not increased
significantly since 1971. However, there has been considerable road up-
grading; paved roads increased from about 890 to 1,400 km between 1971-75.
The total network also includes about 1,000 km of gravel roads and 15,300
km of earth roads. Roads are classified as primary, 5,900 km (Map 1);
secondary, 2,500 km; and feeder 2,300 km. Under the First Highway Project,
the consulting firm Renardet-Sauti (Italy), whose services were financed
by the UNDP, and CED staff inventoried 7,235 km of the road network during
1965-74, including all bituminous-surfaced roads and certain other important
ones. Under the technical assistance included in the project, the inventory
will be updated and the 10,000 km not yet inventoried will be included
(para. 3.12).
B. Traffic
Vehicle Fleet
2.02      The heaviest concentration of vehicles is in the Mogadishu area;
the second principal concentration is in Hargeisa. Of the estimated
10,400-vehicle fleet, which appears adequate for present demand, about
three-fourths consists of privately-owned and operated vehicles. Although
data indicating the growth, age and condition of the fleet are not available,
the following estimates, based on information collected by Renardet-Sauti,
show the types of vehicles comprising the fleet.

Total              10,400                       100
There are no vehicle manufacturers in Somalia; Italy is the principal
source of supply. Import of passenger cars is subject to tight Government
limitations and high tariffs.
Traffic Growth
2.03      Although national road traffic statistics are not available,
the fuel consumption figures given below imply growth in commercial
activity. These statistics on fuel imports (Somalia has no refinery)
were obtained from the Ministry of Planning:

Period     Average Annual Growth Rate
(%)
1969-74                 7.3            20.0
Nearly all of the gasoline and much of the diesel fuel are consumed by motor
vehicles. The lower gasoline growth rate reflects, of course, a comparatively
low traffic growth rate of gasoline-powered vehicles. The difference between
the 2 import growth rates may be attributed to increased use of trucks and
fuel in nontransport activities, but the limited data do not permit proper
assessment of the divergence. Because an ongoing program for collecting
traffic statistics is necessary for effective road construction and mainte-
nance planning, the technical assistance included in the project will assist
in setting up such a program (para. 3.12).



-9-
Regulations and Rates
2.04      Adequate vehicle weight and dimension regulations were introduced
in 1971, and the Ministry of Interior is responsible for their enforcement.
The maximum gross vehicle weight permitted is 32 m tons; the maximum load
for a single axle is 10 m tons; for a tandem axle, 16 m tons. Overloading
is not a major problem.
2.05      Truck operators engaged in public transport are required to be
registered but are not restricted to specific routes. There are no large
fleet owners and most operators have only one vehicle. The Ministry of
Transport through its regional offices allocates, with few exceptions,
specific freight transport jobs to private operators on a first-come,
first-served basis, which seems to be working satisfactorily. Truck freight
and passenger rates are set, with periodic adjustments, by the Ministry of
Transport, which follows the policy of holding rates as low as possible,
consistent with the viability of private transport operations. These
rates and fares, with which there is general compliance are as follows:
Rate                           Fare
So.Sh./ton-km              So.Sh./passenger-km

Other roads               .24             .24             .058       .035
C. Administration
2.06      The CED, under the MPW, is responsible for constructing and main-
taining roads, and also for constructing ports and airports, which are
maintained by other Government organizations. The CED comprises 6 divisions
(Planning and Design, Construction, Maintenance, Materials, Equipment, and
Administration) and 16 regional road maintenance sections. (An organization
chart is shown on the following page.) There are 3 main workshops, set up
under the First Highway Project, at Hargeisa, Mogadishu and Kisimaio, which
cater to the needs of the 16 regional sections.
2.07      Also under the First Highway Project, Renardet-Sauti assisted in
organizing, staffing and managing CED and made recommendations about expand-
ing CED's activities. In 1971, the staffing of the MPW was expanded, to a
total of 377 posts (excluding laborers) for CED. With the departure of the
consultants in 1974, the full burden of the operation rested on CED staff,
which by then had fallen short of its authorized strength. The shortage of
qualified staff has adversely affected CED operations, particularly road
maintenance. In 1976, 3 senior and many subordinate posts were vacant,
caused in part by transfers of personnel to other agencies, including the
National Construction Agency. The Government agreed during negotiations
to fill the following key positions by December 30, 1977, or such other date

D. Planning
CED's Planning Capability
2.08      Road planning by the Government and its consultants has been
generally adequate and is leading to the development of an integrated
highway network. CED has used consultants extensively for both long-term
transport planning (para. 1.21) and for project feasibility and design
studies. However, technical assistance and professional and subprofessional
training elements of the First and Second Bank Group-financed Highway Pro-
jects have contributed to increasing CED's planning capability. Technical
assistance under this project focuses on further building up the Department's
capacity to plan and carry out maintenance of the expanding paved road
system (paras. 2.18 and 3.12).
Current Construction Plans
2.09      In addition to the project roads, Government's road development
plans, as shown in the Five-Year Program, include completion of a main road
artery from the border with Kenya in the south, through Kisimaio and
Mogadishu, to the international borders in northwest Somalia; extension
of the Afgoi-Baidoa-Dinsor road to Bardera and along the Juba River to
Gelib; and upgrading of a northern coastal road and various feeder roads.
One of the principal uncompleted links in the main artery is the 653 km
Galcaio-Burao segment of the major road being constructed by the Peoples
Republic of China; completion of this segment by the Chinese is expected
in 1978. The 140 km Burao-Berbera road is to be constructed in the near
future with financial assistance provided by the Abu-Dhabi Fund. The
Hargeisa-Borama road is to be extended to Loyada on the border with the
French Territory of Afars and Issas in the 1980's. In the south, the 270
km Galuen-Gelib road is to be constructed to paved standards in the near
future, thus substantially improving the main route along the southern
coast; financing has been arranged with the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development and the European Development Fund. Extension of the
main artery from Kisimaio to Liboye (210 km) on the Kenya border is a longer
term plan. The Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road (340 km), an extension of the
Afgoi-Baidoa-Dinsor road, and the Baidoa-Dinsor improvement undertaken by
the Government will serve the important interriverine area and the Juba
Valley, where significant agricultural and industrial development is planned
over the next several years. Studies of the Dinsor-BarderaGelib road will
be financed under the project (para. 3.11).
2.10      These road development plans are, for the most part, realistic in
that the implementation of most of them is considered probable in the next



- 12 -
several years. While the economic justification for the Burao-Berbera and
Galuen-Gelib roads has been established in feasibility studies, no such
study has been undertaken of the Chinese road and its justification rests,
to a large extent, on administrative, political and social considerations.
The other road projects in the development plan will require feasibility
studies to determine their viability.
Maintenance Planning
2.11      Two Road Maintenance Programs (1966-70, 1971-74) were prepared by
Renardet-Sauti under the First Highway Project. There was some implementa-
tion, but resources were limited and the results were modest. In view of
current extensive road upgrading and construction and the sizeable program
for road building, as well as present maintenance deficiencies (para. 2.17),
there is an urgent need for updated maintenance planning, together with
increased and improved maintenance operations. Technical assistance included
under the project will update the 1971-74 Renardet-Sauti study and assist
with implementation (para. 3.12).
E. Financing
Recent Road Expenditures
2.12      The trend of expenditures on roads has been sharply upward in
recent years. These expenditures, based on data from MPW, are indicated
below for 1970-75. To maintain current levels, considerable external aid
will have to continue to be available and is likely to be forthcoming.

1972          4.5                 4.9                33.4            42.8
1973          4.6                 6.8               113.8           125.2
1974          4.3                 6.3               135.9           146.5
1975          4.1 estimated       6.0 estimated    124.3            134.4
2.13      As shown above, maintenance expenditures more than doubled
from 1970 to 1974, reflecting the heavier requirements of an expanded paved
road network; administrative expenditures increased at a more moderate
rate. Outlays for road construction rose dramatically over 1971-75, mainly
due to construction of the Belet Uen-Burao road by the Peoples Republic of
China; the cost of this five-year project has been estimated at So.Sh. 400
million, or about So.Sh. 80 million per annum. During 1971-75, funds from



- 13 -
external sources varied from 77-95% of total construction expenditures, and,
in the years ahead, funds for major construction are likely to continue to
come largely from external loans or grants.
Road User Revenues
2.14      Road users contribute to general Government revenue through taxes
and duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts, and through
license and registration fees. Among these levies, the fuel tax, collected
by the Customs Department, constitutes the major source of road user revenue.
In 1974, the year for which the most comprehensive data are available, road
user taxes and duties amounted to about So.Sh. 90 million, against the
So.Sh. 146.5 million expended for road administration, maintenance and con-
struction. Although outlays thus exceeded revenues, construction expendi-
tures in 1974 were unusually high, because of the Chinese road, and are not
expected to continue at that level beyond 1978.
F. Engineering
2.15      CED's Planning and Design Division carries out minor design work,
such as small drainage structures, while major design is done by foreign
consultants. Design standards for primary roads are adequate. Establish-
ment of appropriate standards for lower road categories is expected soon.
G. Construction
2.16      With the exception of the Chinese road, major roads generally
are constructed and supervised by foreign contractors and consultants. In
the recent past, departmental forces have constructed some major roads but
are now concentrating on construction of earth roads. The Government favors
construction by its National Construction Agency so, apart from a few small
contractors capable of constructing simple road works or providing sub-
contracted transport, there is virtually no local construction industry.
In the past, transport subcontracts on civil works projects have resulted
in disputes because of the use of per diem rates as a basis for subcontract
prices; since it is preferable to use ton/km rates for such purposes an
agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that any such
transport subcontracts under the project would be based on ton/km rates.
H. Maintenance
2.17      The Government is anxious to improve road maintenance, which is
carried out by CED (para. 2.06) through force account. Although maintenance
has improved over the years, the quantity and quality of work is unsatis-
factory and has not kept pace with the expanding paved road network.



- 14 -
2.18      The main causes of inadequate road maintenance are lack of
expertise (paras. 2.07 and 2.20-.21) and insufficient allocation of funds
despite recent increases (para. 2.13). CED's equipment repair facilities
are also insufficient. Further, CED personnel and equipment are often
diverted to other public works projects. These problems are addressed
under the present project. First, technical assistance is provided to
aid in increasing and improving maintenance planning and operations,
including training of CED staff (para. 3.12). Second, during negotiations,
it was agreed that the Government will adequately maintain its highway
systems in accordance with sound engineering practices and will include
adequate amounts for maintenance in its budget each year. Third, machine-
shop equipment necessary for equipment repairs and training has been
included. With financing provided by the European Development Fund under
the First Highway Project, about US$1.4 million worth of maintenance and
workshop equipment was purchased during 1970-73, some of which was used
to set up the 3 main workshops in 1970 (para. 2.06). As a continuation
of this effort, the machineshop equipment provided under the project will
aid in further developing maintenance capacity (para. 3.13). Finally, it
was also agreed during negotiations that, except as the Association may
otherwise agree, CED highway maintenance staff and equipment will be used
exclusively for highway maintenance.
I. Training
2.19      Under the First Highway Project, UNDP financed a program of train-
ing abroad for Somali engineers and technicians during 1965-74. Of the 17
persons who received training in various countries, 8 are still in the MPW,
and most of the others are employed in other Government agencies. Several
engineers and technicians are currently being trained abroad to meet CED's
growing needs.
2.20      During 1965-74, also under the First Highway Project, Renardet-
Sauti organized and conducted courses at CED headquarters for subprofessional
Somali personnel in various areas of highway operations, particularly survey-
ing planning, drafting and soils laboratory work. In addition, the consult-
ants provided satisfactory on-the-job training for mechanics, operators and
drivers. As a result of these efforts, a basic capability to conduct highway
operations was developed, although further training is needed (para. 2.21).
2.21      About 40 skilled workers are receiving on-the-job training at the
field workshop set up by the Peoples Republic of China for construction of
the Belet Uen-Galcaio-Burao road. In Mogadishu, the CED also holds training
classes for mechanics employed in the main workshop. Although these programs
have alleviated the shortage of trained personnel, further training is needed
and is provided under the project. Through the technical assistance, highway
manpower requirements will be assessed and a plan to meet these needs drawn up,
including a training program and its implementation (para. 3.12).

3. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      In its 1966 Transport Survey (para. 1.21), Grimble recommended
that an 88 km road be constructed between Hargeisa and Tug Wajale via
Nabadid. The Government concurred and requested IDA assistance in financing
the necessary studies of this road, as well as of a 44 km stretch from
Nabadid to Borama. Accordingly, with funds made available under the Second
Highway Project, Renardet-Sauti completed the feasibility study in 1975.
The results were favorable, and the consultants thus proceeded with detailed
engineering and preparation of tender documents. Draft bidding documents
have been completed.
3.02      Design details and cost estimates were sufficiently advanced
by March 1976 to enable an appraisal mission to visit the country. Bank
staff participating in the mission comprised an economist and 2 highway
engineers; a loan officer also took part in some discussions with Government.
Also involved in the appraisal were an economist and an engineer from the
African Development Fund (AFDF), which will participate in financing the
project. The mission completed its field work on April 17, 1976. In January
1977, two other co-financing agencies, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (AF) and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), also appraised the
project.
B. Objectives
3.03      Somalia's road development objectives include upgrading the primary
road system, which is comprised mostly of earth and gravel roads, in order
to overcome serious traffic interruptions during rains, enable roads to
carry livestock traffic, and reduce high vehicle operating costs. The
Government also aims to improve the maintenance of its rapidly expanding
paved road network.
3.04      The project will assist in attaining these objectives by financ-
ing the construction of high priority road sections included in the 1974-78
Development Program and by further strengthening the institution responsible
for road maintenance. In addition, the project will finance a feasibility
study and detailed engineering of a road which will facilitate planned agri-
cultural and industrial development of the area. Its construction could form
the basis of a fourth highway project in the country.



- 16 -
C. Description
3.05      The project consists of:
(i) construction, and related supervision of the Hargeisa-
Borama road (113 km), with a link to Tug Wajale (19 km);
(ii) a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Dinsor-
Bardera-Gelib road (about 340 km); and
(iii) strengthening of CED through provision of technical assistance,
training and machineshop equipment.
(i) Road Construction and Supervision
3.06      The Hargeisa-Borama road and Tug Wajale link are a major part
of the transport infrastructure of northwest Somalia. The roads will
provide an all-weather connection between Borama/Tug Wajale and Hargeisa,
which is already linked to the port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden by a
bituminous-surfaced road built under the Second Highway Project (Map 2).
3.07      The present tracks are of such poor quality that they are unsuit-
able for truck transport of livestock and result in high transport costs for
other traffic. In considering improvement alternatives, Renardet-Sauti
identified 3 possible alignments between Hargeisa and Borama, each of which
utilized portions of the existing alignment; on the basis of their technical
and economic analysis, the consultants concluded that the preferred align-
ment was Hargeisa-Arapsio-Gebile-Nabadid-Borama. Regarding road standards,
the appraisal mission decided against the possibility of building gravel
roads, in a staged construction process, for 2 reasons. First, the type
of gravel in the project area is unsuitable for use as a gravel surface,
particularly in a dry climate (although it is adequate for sub-base under
a paved road). Second, such rains as do occur are heavy and would cause
deep rutting. Both of these conditions would entail heavy maintenance work.
Thus, the roads will be paved. Somalia's national main road design stan-
dards (see below) are satisfactory.

3.08      The proposed roads generally follow existing tracks through
Arapsio, Gebile and Nabadid at an average altitude of 1,500 meters.
Construction will upgrade the tracks and improve alignment and drainage.
The area through which the new roads will run is mostly flat, except for
about 30 km from both Hargeisa and Borama where the terrain is rolling;
the link between Nabadid and Tug Wajale, about 19 km, also passes through
flat country. Some land for right-of-way will be acquired from private
landowners, but no difficulties are expected because the Government has
the right of eminent domain.
3.09      Because rain is infrequent in the area of the project roads
(400 mm around Hargeisa and 600 mm around Borama), paved fords instead of
bridges will be provided across major streams. Minor cross-drainage works
will consist of either corrugated metal pipes or reinforced concrete box
culverts. Suitable materials for bitumen roads are available along the
roads. The appraisal mission discovered large deposits of gravel in the
project area which will be used as sub-base material instead of the more
expensive crushed stone proposed by the consultants. Water for construc-
tion is obtainable from existing wells in the area, although some new
boreholes will be needed for construction and camp use.
3.10      Consultants will be engaged for construction supervision.  The
Bank Group has agreed with Government's proposal to engage Dorsch Consult
(Federal Republic of Germany) for construction supervision, including
assistance with bidding procedures and a review of the detailed engineer-
ing and bidding documents prepared by Renardet-Sauti.
(ii) Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering
3.11      The 1974-78 Development Program includes upgrading of the exist-
ing fair-weather road between Dinsor, Bardera and Gelib (approximately
340 km). The Government considers the new road necessary for future



- 18 -
development of the Juba Valley where agricultural and industrial invest-
ments are planned. The project provides for a feasibility study of the
road and detailed engineering subject to the findings of the study.
Terms of Reference for the study are detailed in Annex 3.
(iii) Strengthening of CED
a) Technical Assistance
3.12      Since road maintenance demands are growing rapidly, there is a
continuing need to increase and improve CED operations (paras. 2.17-.18).
The technical assistance provided under the project will assist with the
setting up of a continuous program of road and traffic data collection,
including an updated and expanded road inventory; maintenance planning and
operations, including equipment management and control; and an assessment
of highway manpower needs, including planning and implementation of
staff training. On-the-job training of professional staff is included,
as well as training on-the-job and in the classroom of existing and new
mechanics, operators, drivers and spare part inventory control staff.
b) Machineshop Equipment
3.13      The machineshop at CED headquarters has limited facilities for
day-to-day equipment repairs and for on-the-job training of existing and
new workshop mechanics (para. 2.18). MPW has requested assistance in
providing specific equipment required for the performance of necessary
operations and for training purposes. This is included in the project
and comprises:
1.   Hydraulic shaping machine

D. Cost Estimates
3.14      Total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at
US$30.01 million, excluding taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component
is estimated at US$22.49 million, or 75% of total cost. A breakdown of costs,
estimated to December 31, 1976, is shown below:

Equipment                            7.5%
Price contingencies for civil works are equivalent to a cumulative 18% of
construction costs and for items ii-v(a), 10%. Risk allowance in an amount
equal to US$4.78 million is included to account for higher costs estimated
by AF for civil works construction; AF and IDB believe that, on the basis of
their experience in Africa and Middle East and their January 1977 appraisal,
the cost of civil works construction should be US$25.32 million against
IDA appraisal cost estimate of US$20.54 million, including contingencies.

3.15      Project costs have been arrived at as follows:
(i)  Construction:  based on unit costs and quantities developed
by consultants taking into consideration current prices of
materials, labor and equipment, as well as prices on the
recently-completed Hargeisa-Berbera road. Construction
costs are summarized below:

Total                             100.62
(ii)  Consulting Services: 1/
a)   Construction Supervision:  based on 116 man-months over
the 30-month construction period, are estimated as
equivalent to 5% of construction costs, which is normal
for such works;
b)   Feasibility Study of Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib Road (340 km):
includes 97 man-months for the 15-month study, a net
average man-month rate of US$5,000 of foreign costs, plus
vehicles and equipment; and
1/   The consultant services and technical assistance included in the project
total approximately 43 man-years which, although high, are required for
project execution.



- 22 -
c)   Detailed Engineering:  calculated at 158 man-months over
12 months, approximately US$5,000 net in foreign costs
per man-month, plus needed vehicles and equipment;
(iii)   Technical Assistance to CED:  includes 144 man-months over
2 years, a net average of US$4,000 of foreign costs per man-
month; and
(iv) Machineshop Equipment: based on CED estimates, which reflect
c.i.f. Mogadishu prices in December 1976. Included are related
tools valued at 10% of total equipment cost.
E. Financing
3.16      IDA will finance US$7.0 million of civil works construction, its
related supervision, and feasibility study and detailed engineering for the
Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road. This amount includes US$0.41 million representing
IDA's share of the risk allowance, which will be cancelled from the credit in
the event the amount of responsive bids for civil works construction are sub-
stantially below the costs estimated by AF and IDB (para. 3.22). AF will
joint finance US$6.75 million of civil works construction and its related
supervision, and will parallel finance strengthening of CED, US$1.25 million.
IDB will joint finance US$7.5 million of civil works construction and related
supervision, and AfDB will also joint finance this component in the amount
of US$5.5 million. Government will finance the entire balance cost of the
project. The overall financing plan comprises:

have been negotiated, and the AfDF loan is expected to be negotiated shortly;
the credit/loans of the external agencies, including IDA, are to become effec-
tive simultaneously.



- 23 -
3.17      The Government has prequalified contractors for civil works con-
struction with procedures satisfactory to the Association. In the event any
such contractor is ineligible to receive funds in accordance with appropriate
rules of any co-financing agency, project components to be financed will be
re-arranged amongst co-financing agencies, subject to maximum contribution by
IDA of US$7.0 million.
F. Implementation
Responsibility
3.18      Project implementation will be the responsibility of CED which will
engage consultants for construction supervision, the feasibility study and
detailed engineering. The Department will also engage technical assistants
and procure the machineshop equipment.
Implementation Schedule
3.19      Construction and related supervision of the project roads will
take about 2-1/2 years, beginning mid-1977, with an estimated 15% of works
to be carried out in 1977, 50% in 1978 and the remainder in 1979. An imple-
mentation schedule, the details of which were discussed and agreed with the
Government during negotiations, is shown on the following page. Also agreed
in detail during negotiations were arrangements for reporting project imple-
mentation progress.
G. Procurement
3.20      The civil works will be procured under single unit price contract
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
"Guidelines for Procurement". The co-financing agencies will follow these
guidelines. Bids on civil works construction are expected in June 1977, and
tender award in August 1977. No problems are anticipated in acquiring land
for right-of-way (para. 3.08).
3.21      The consulting construction supervision, the feasibility services
and detailed engineering services will be by qualified and experienced in-
dividuals acceptable to the Association.

H. Disbursement
3.22      Disbursements from the credit account will be on the basis of
(i) 19% of the total cost of civil works construction and related supervision
and (ii) 80% of the total cost of the feasibility study and detailed engineer-
ing included in the project. The Government has informed the Association that
if the responsive bids for the civil works component are substantially below
the estimated cost, including the risk allowance, then IDA in consultation
with the Government will reduce the civil works allocation correspondingly by
an amount not exceeding US$410,000. An estimated disbursement schedule, drawn
up by the appraisal mission, is set out below.

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The project roads will constitute an important element in the
national road system by extending the paved road westward from Hargeisa,
Somalia's second largest city, to Borama and Tug Wajale through any area
which produces considerable livestock and agricultural crops. In addition
to serving the growing transport demand within the northwest region, the
roads will facilitate trade with Ethiopia. The main benefits from the road
construction will be increased revenues from livestock exports as a result
of an anticipated shift from livestock trekking to truck transport, with
consequent reduced loss in animal weight. Potential weight savings are
a powerful incentive, as evidenced by the virtually complete shift to
trucking of livestock on the new Hargeisa-Berbera road in the first year
after the road opened. Another principal benefit is savings in vehicle
operating costs (VOC) for normal traffic.
4.02      Although generated traffic consists largely of livestock, a modest
amount of other generated traffic is also expected, based particularly on the
anticipated development impact on agriculture. Avoided road maintenance costs
are also a benefit, but net savings are relatively small. In terms of foreign
exchange, all of the livestock benefits constitute increased foreign exchange
earnings, while 62% of the VOC savings represent reductions in foreign exchange
outlays. Unquantified benefits include improved access to schools, health
centers and administrative facilities and greater comfort of passengers. The
main beneficiaries of the road construction will be the direct road users, but
benefits will be widely distributed among producers, traders, and consumers
because of the Government's transport rate policy (para. 2.05). The economic
return on the road construction is 21%. An economic return on the project's
technical assistance and studies, which account for 10% of project costs, has
not been made; however, their benefits are expected to be great.
B. Area of Influence of Project Roads
4.03      The immediate influence area of the project roads is about 200,000
ha of plateau located in the southwestern part of Northwest Region (Map 2).
This area, which has more rainfall than any other part of northern and central
Somalia, is relatively productive. Its settled population in 1975 was estima-
ted at about 200,000; in addition, up to 300,000 nomads are found here,
depending upon the season. Hargeisa with about 95,000 population is, by far,
the largest city in the region; Borama, population 10,000, Tug Wajale, Arapsio,
Nabadid and Gebile are the other main communities in the influence area.
4.04      The area's principal output is livestock; exports of live animals,
which constitute over half of Somalia's export trade, flow in large part
through Hargeisa and the port of Berbera. During 1972-74, annual shipments

of sheep and goats passing through Hargeisa ranged from 690,000 to 1,100,000
head annually, of which about two-thirds originated west of Hargeisa. In the
same period, other animals moving annually through Hargeisa ranged from 28,000
to 73,000 head of cattle and 11,000 to 17,000 camels. The severe drought of
1973-74 seriously affected cattle herds, causing a sharp decline in exports of
these animals, and some years will be required to rebuild the herds. Sheep
and goat shipments from the Northwest Region did not decline correspondingly
because the grazing area there was less severely affected than other parts of
northern Somalia. Included in the flow of livestock through the Hargeisa
collection point are not only the animals originating in the Northwest Region
of Somalia but also a smaller volume entering the country from Ethiopia,
principally through Tug Wajale.
4.05      Agriculture is also an important activity in the influence area
of the roads; rainfed farming predominates although some irrigated farming is
practiced. About 160,000 ha of the Northwest Region is potentially arable and
this potential is being developed by the IDA-financed Northwest Regional
Agricultural Project approved in April 1976.
C. Economic Analysis
4.06      The basis for the economic analysis set out below is an assessment
of costs and benefits with and without the proposed road construction to
paved standards (para. 3.07) over 20 years, the estimated economic life of
the improved roads. The investment cost is taken as the net of tax cost
of the improvement including supervision and physical contingencies. The
quantified benefits are increased revenues from livestock exports and VOC
savings in normal and nonlivestock generated traffic. The estimates show the
proposed investment in the Hargeisa-Borama road and Tug Wajale link to be
economically sound, yielding a 21% economic return. The roads have a first
year return above 10% when using a 10% discount rate. The economic returns
for the 3 principal road segments are: Hargeisa-Nabadid, 24%; Nabadid-Borama,
19%; and Nabadid-Tug Wajale, 21%.
Costs
4.07      Project road construction and maintenance costs have been estimated,
exclusive of taxes and duties, as of December 1976. These economic costs,
based on consultants' estimates, have been used in the economic analysis:

Construction and supervision costs include a 10% physical contingency.
Maintenance costs are somewhat lower than those projected for the existing
facilities, which would amount to So. Sh. 0.2 million annually for routine
maintenance and an average of So. Sh. 3 million per year for periodic main-
tenance.
Quantified Benefits
(i) Increased Revenue from Livestock Exports
4.08      Increased revenue from livestock exports is the principal benefit
from the project roads. This benefit in 1980, when the roads are expected
to open entirely, is based on the following data developed by Renardet-
Sauti and the appraisal mission:
Gross Weight of Export Livestock to be moved on
Borama/Tug Waiale-Hargeisa Corridor in 1980:                (kg millions)
450,000 sheep and goats @ 30 kg                                 13.5
60,000 cattle           @ 235 kg                               14.1
Total                                  27.6
Savings in Livestock Weight When Trucked in 1980:
27.6 million kg x 12%                                            3.3
Additional Revenue from Livestock Weight Saved in 1980: (So. Sh. millions)
3.3 million kg @ average value So. Sh. 6/kg                     19.8
Less cost of transport and administration                        3.7
Net Benefit in 1980                    16.1



- 29 -
4.09      The number of livestock forecast to be moved on the Hargeisa-
Borama/Tug Wajale corridor in 1980 (450,000 sheep and goats; 60,000 cattle)
is based on livestock flows along this corridor in recent years and on some
expected recovery of cattle herds after the drought (para. 4.04). The estima-
ted 12% savings in animal weight, when animals are trucked rather than walked
from points of shipment (largely Borama and Tug Wajale) to Hargeisa, was
determined by Renardet-Sauti and confirmed by other knowledgeable sources.
Conversion of the weight savings into a gross benefit was based on an esti-
mated So. Sh. 6 per kg as the average revenue from animal exports. For sub-
sequent years of the project life, the net benefits were derived by estimating
a 4% annual growth rate over the remainder of the 20-year period; these
benefits increase from So. Sh. 16.2 million in 1980 to So. Sh. 32.3 million
in 1998.
(ii) VOC Savings for Non-Livestock Traffic
4.10      In addition to the livestock benefit, there are considerable VOC
savings for normal traffic, which constitute about 20% of quantified benefits.
VOC savings are based on estimated vehicles per day on road segments (para.
4.11), annual rates of traffic growth (para. 4.12), VOC on existing and new
roads (para. 4.15) and the difference in length of the existing (141 km) and
new roads (132 km). For 1980, these savings are estimated at So. Sh. 6.8
million. For subsequent years, the benefits in this category were estimated
by using the 1980 figure as a base and applying traffic growth rates of 5% per
annum (1980-89) and 4% per annum (1990-99), which reflect expected traffic
growth. For non-livestock generated traffic, benefits comprise less than 3%
of total benefits.
Traffic on Project Roads in 1974
4.11      Traffic volume on the Hargeisa-Borama during 1967-70, according to
fragmentary traffic counts, increased at about 4% per annum; no subsequent
counts were taken until June 1974, when Renardet-Sauti conducted a traffic
survey as part of the feasibility study for the project roads. On the basis
of the consultants' traffic counts, average daily traffic in 1974 was found
to total 159 vehicles on the Hargeisa-Nabadid section, 50 on Nabadid-Borama
and 98 on Nabadid-Tug Wajale.

- 30 -
4.12      During 1967-74, traffic on these road sections increased at an
annual rate of about 5%, according to fragmentary traffic data and other
indicators of regional economic growth. On the basis of this trend and the
expected favorable impact of the IDA-financed Northwest Regional Agricultural
Project, it is estimated that, without the road project, traffic would con-
tinue to grow at 5% per annum until about 1990 at 4% per annum thereafter.
Traffic on Project Roads in 1980
4.13      Traffic in 1980 on the project roads was estimated by Renardet-
Sauti taking into consideration trends in traffic growth, projected economic
development in the area of influence and a forecast that a shift would occur
in some passenger traffic from trucks to buses. The latter change is pre-
dicted to take place as a result of established Government policy to encourage
the development of bus services on paved roads.

VOC on Project Roads
4.14      VOC have been estimated for typical vehicles operating on roads
in the project area. The physical and performance characteristics of vehicles
on paved and earth roads indicate that use of paved roads results in longer
vehicle life and increased kilometerage and average vehicle speed. These
conclusions are based on the following vehicle characteristics developed
by Renardet-Sauti from data collected in Somalia from vehicle operators and
dealers:

4.15      Economic VOC for typical vehicles operating over earth and paved

from truck operators, repair shops and dealers in Somalia. These unit costs,
shown below, are reasonable and have been used in the economic analysis.

4.16      The anticipated reduction in unit VOC, based on the improvement of
the Hargeisa-Borama/Tug Wajale roads, is likely to be passed on to shippers,
passengers and other transport users in the area because it is the policy of
the Ministry of Transport, which fixes transport rates, to hold these rates
as low as possible, consistent with the viability of private transport oper-
ations (para. 2.05). Moreover, truck operators have, in the past, been able
to acquire additional vehicles to accommodate growing transport demand and
they are expected to continue to be able to do so to meet future demand.
4.17      VOC savings have been estimated by Renardet-Sauti and the appraisal
mission for 1980, when the roads are expected to be open entirely:

First Highway Project
1.        The project comprised:
(a)  the construction of a two-lane road (about 216 km)
between Afgoi and Baidoa;
(b) purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment
and construction of new offices for the Highway
Department; and
(c) technical assistance in organizing and improving the
operation of the Highway Department; a reconnaissance
study to coordinate short-term transportation invest-
ments; feasibility studies of 2 high priority roads,
Hargeisa-Berbera and Berbera-Burao; and technical
training abroad for Somali personnel.
2.        The construction of the Afgoi-Baidoa road was substantially com-
pleted on March 31, 1971. Work started on January 17, 1968, and, with a
36-month construction period, was scheduled for completion on January 17,
1971. The final certificate due on March 31, 1972, was not issued by the MPW
because of a dispute concerning the completion of certain outstanding works
specified in the completion certificate. The contractor (a joint venture
comprising Strabag Bau-Ag (FRG), Stirling Astaldi (UK) and Impresit-Rechhi
(Italy) submitted claims amounting to So. Sh. 14.88 million for arbitration.
The MPW submitted a counterclaim against the contractor charging the in-
corporation of defective materials in the works and the failure to complete
outstanding works. The Court of Arbitration announced its award in favor
of the contractor which, including the joint venture's court costs and
interest charges, amounted to DM 11,648,333.04 (US$4,480,128 equivalent);
daily interest charges on the award from December 15, 1975, in an amount of
DM 1,356.20 (US$521.62 equivalent) are to be added to the award. The Govern-
ment has expressed unwillingness to accept the award. Efforts are underway
to resolve the matter. The final cost of the road works is estimated at
US$10.47 million, excluding the award amount, against the appraisal estimate
of US$10.8 million, including contingencies.
3.        The purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment and the
construction of new offices for the Highway Department, which were financed



ANNEX 2
Page 2
by the European Development Fund (FED) have been satisfactorily completed
and the equipment and office facilities are in use. The UNDP-financed tech-
nical assistance included in the project has also been completed satisfac-
torily; the technical assistance provided by Renardet-Sauti (consultants,
Italy) has led to improved CED capability in highway management, planning,
design, maintenance and work supervision. The recommendations made by Grimble
(consultants, Canada) in its 1966 Transport Survey helped Government formulate
the 1971-73 and 1974-78 Transport and Communications Sector Plans.  The Survey
also recommended construction of the Hargeisa-Tug Wajale road, for which a
feasibility study and detailed engineering were included in the Second Highway
Project. Some 17 Somali CED staff have received training abroad under the
program.
Credit 295-SO

(a)  the construction of a two-lane road (158 km) between
Hargeisa and Berbera;
(b) a feasibility study and detailed engineering for the
Hargeisa-Borama road and Tug Wajale link; and
(c) technical assistance for transport planning.
5.        Construction of the Hargeisa-Berbera road was completed about
2 months behind schedule; the road was officially opened on June 1, 1975.
The quality of construction was generally satisfactory. The final cost of
the works is estimated at US$8.90 million, which is within the appraisal
estimate of US$9.21 million, including contingencies.
6.        The feasibility study and detailed engineering for the Hargeisa-
Tug Wajale/Borama road has been completed and is the basis for the proposed
Third Highway Project. The draft final report of the Trausportation Survey
has been received and is being reviewed.

I. OBJECTIVES
1.        The purpose of the studies is to determine the technical and econo-
mic feasibility of the road between Dinsor and Gelib via Bardera (total length
approximately 340 km), and undertake detailed engineering depending on the
results of the feasibility study.
II. SCOPE OF CONSULTING SERVICES
2.        The consultants shall perform all engineering work, economic studies,
field investigations and related work, as required to attain the objectives in
Section I hereof.
3.        In the conduct of their work, the consultants shall cooperate fully
with the Government Ministries and Departments responsible for transport and
development planning; the Government will provide the consultants with the
data and services outlined in Section III hereof. The consultants shall be
solely responsible, however, for the analysis and interpretation of all data
received and for the conclusions and recommendations in their reports.
A.  Feasibility Study
Selection of Alignment and Design Standards
4.        The consultants shall consider alternative design standards and
alignments including, if desirable, relocation of sections of the routes,
as a basis for the economic evaluation described in para. 9. Studies of
alternative alignments shall commence with an evaluation of the existing
roads linking the points mentioned above, and shall include the possibility
of upgrading the present road by relocating short sections and improving
drainage, widths, curvature, grades and surfacing. The consultants shall
first review any available investigations of possible alignments and designs
for the roads. The consultants may recommend improvements to a specific
standard over the entire road length or improvements to different standards
over different sections of road.
5.        The consultants shall prepare financial and economic cost estimates
for the alternative alignments and geometric and pavement design standards
considered appropriate to the traffic forecasts. In selecting route and
standards, the consultants may base their cost estimates for road sections
on typical construction costs per km.
6.        In considering standards of construction, the consultants shall
take into account the possibilities for staged construction suggested by the
traffic forecasts described below.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
7.        The cost estimates shall be broken down into foreign and local
cost components and all taxes and duties shall be identified separately.
The foreign cost component shall include such items as depreciation of
imported equipment, the foreign component of wages and overheads, profits
of foreign firms, and the principal foreign cost elements of locally pro-
duced materials and supplies incorporated in the works.
8.        The consultants' Feasibility Report on the Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib
Road shall include plans, typical cross-sections, and preliminary engineer-
ing designs for the proposed construction, at appropriate scales.
Economic Analyses
9.        The economic analyses of alternative alignments and design standards
for the road shall include estimates of:
(i) the types and volumes of forecast traffic for
each of the alternatives under paras. 4 and 5.
These forecasts shall form the basis for the
selection of appropriate design standards and the
estimation of potential savings in vehicle operating
costs. The consultants shall analyze all existing
statistical data on traffic relevant to the proposed
alignments. If the consultants find that additional
traffic counts or origin and destination data are
required for their study, they shall undertake the
necessary field studies with the assistance of the
Government. The forecasts shall take into account
the effects of existing and potential traffic-gener-
ating activity and the possibilities of traffic diversion
to and from competing modes;
(ii) vehicle operating costs for the types and sizes
of vehicles forecast under (i) above for both
the existing and proposed alignments and standards.
Savings through increased speeds shall be quantified
when relevant. These estimates, in conjunction
with the forecasts of traffic with and without
the proposed construction, shall form the basis for
estimating potential vehicle operating costs and
time savings;
(iii) road maintenance costs for both existing and proposed
alternatives, having regard to the respective traffic
forecasts under (i) above. The estimates shall be
used to assess the net savings or increases in total
maintenance costs likely to result from the proposed
improvements; and



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(iv)  the net benefits of the proposed improvements assessed
under (i) to (iii) above. These shall be compared
with the costs determined by the methods described in
para. 5, taking account of opportunities for staged
construction. For each alternative, the net present
value, discounted at 10%, and the internal rate of
return shall be calculated. On the basis of these
calculations, the optimum alignment, design standards,
starting date and staging schedule shall be determined.
B. Detailed Engineering
10.       Depending on the results of the feasibility study, the consultants
shall proceed with detailed engineering, as outlined below, subject to prior
approval of the Government and the Association.
11.       In broad terms, the consultants are to prepare a detailed design
for the upgrading of a portion of the Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib Road, complete
with cost estimates and bidding documents. The services shall include, but
not be limited to:
(i) definition and staking out of the proposed road
alignment;
(ii)  detailed engineering design, preparation of estimate
of quantities, plans, drawings and bidding documents;
(iii)  preparation of cost estimates of the proposed work
with a breakdown into foreign and local currency costs; and
(iv)  assistance in the prequalification of contracting firms and
in the analysis and evaluation of bids, if requested by
Government.
12.       The consultants shall carry out the necessary field surveys along
the general alignment established in the feasibility study in order to deter-
mine precisely the center line location. The center line should then be
set out, levelled and cross-sectioned, and bench marks established. No major
deviations from the approved general alignment shall be made without
approval of the Government and the Association. The consultants shall then
carry out all works necessary for detailed design of +the proposed works,
for the estimation of quantities, to an accuracy of - 10% of final quan-
tities as measured on completion of the works (excluding any approved varia-
tions to the contract) and for the preparation of bidding documents suitable
for international competitive bidding.

at all tangent points to horizontal curves. All
tangent point pegs and pegs at intervals not ex-
ceeding 200 meters on long straights shall be
adequately referenced to recovery pegs, placed
well clear of the permanent work, or to stations
on the baseline traverse, as applicable.
Cross sections shall be taken at intervals not
exceeding 50 meters to enable earthwork $uanti-
ties to be calculated to an accuracy of - 10%,
the width of the cross section to vary according
to the engineering requirements.
Bench marks shall be established along the route
at intervals of about one-half kilometer, located
near the right-of-way at points readily accessible
for use and reasonably close to the center line.
Detailed surveys shall be carried out at all
bridge sites including a sufficient length up-
stream and downstream to enable the hydraulic
design of the structure to be carried out.
All necessary topographical surveys shall be
undertaken and shall be recorded in standard
survey fieldbooks which shall become the
property of the Ministry of Public Works at
completion of the work.

followed by a study of the soils and materials
along the route.
A detailed soils investigation shall be made
along the road alignment to identify the var-
ying soils types, with disturbed samples to
be taken at intervals of about 250 meters,
and at such other places as necessary to
determine changes in soil type.
At bridge sites, and for other major struc-
tures, sub-surface conditions shall be inves-
tigated by trenching, hand augering and/or
drilling as required, including the taking
of undisturbed samples. Seismic investiga-
tions may also be carried out if considered
necessary by the consultants.
Investigations for sources of construction
materials for pavement and structures shall
also be carried out, and sites of suitable
materials shall be surveyed and shown in the
engineering plans. Analysis and testing
shall be carried out as required on the
disturbed and undisturbed soil samples and
on the construction materials.
Tests on soil samples shall include classi-
fication, liquid limit, plastic limit,
moisture/density relationship, CBR value
of proposed subgrade soils and any pro-
posed special methods of soil stabilization.
Undisturbed samples shall be tested for
determination of main mechanical characteristics
(classification, sheer strength, compressibility,
etc.).
(iii) Drainage and Bridge Site Investigations
Hydrological studies shall be carried out of
all drainage structures, with analysis
of all available data, including rainfall and
flood records, and detailed field inspections.

alignment between control points specified
as a result of the engineering investigations.
The vertical alignment shall also be deter-
mined, with detailed calculation of earthwork
quantities.
(ii) Earthworks and Pavement
Engineering analyses shall be undertaken using
the results of the soils and materials testing,
and the field investigations, to determine cut
and fill batter slopes, compaction requirements,
pavement design and other engineering treatment
dictated by the natural materials.
(iii) Drainage and Bridge Structures
All existing data and the results of the field
investigations for soils, foundations, hydrology,
etc., shall be assessed and used as a basis for the
design of drainage and bridge structures, which
shall be supported by detailed hydraulic computations.
Detailed designs shall be prepared for all bridge
structures having spans of 10 meters or greater.
All crossings with spans less than 10 meters shall
be specified as standard type structures which
shall be fully designed. Bridge loadings shall
conform to the relevant AASHO standards or other
standards as nominated by the Ministry of Public
Works.
