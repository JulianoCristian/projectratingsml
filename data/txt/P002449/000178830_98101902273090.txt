6.        With an estimated per capita income in the order of US$100 in 1975,
Somalia is classified by the UN as one of the 25 least developed countries of
the world. Of the total population of approximately 3 million, about two-
thirds are nomads and semi-nomads, who depend on livestock for their livelihood
and about 20-25% are farmers cultivating land along the Juba and Shebelli
rivers and in the higher-rainfall Northwest region. The small monetary sector
of the economy provides only limited opportunities for employment. Apart from
the traditional export of livestock, commercial agriculture is mainly centered
on the production of bananas for export, in which Italian concession holders
are still important, and the production of sugar for the domestic market.
Manufacturing and other sectors of the economy are restricted in their poten-
tial by the small size of the market, poor infrastructure, and the shortage of
capital and entrepreneurial experience. No income distribution data exist, but
we estimate that about 70% of the population live at subsistence levels of about
US$200-250 per family of five in 1975. Social services are still very inadequate;
the school enrollment ratio was until recently among the lowest in the world but
has taken a great leap forward in the past two vears.
Recent Economic Performance
7.        There is little economic data on Somalia.   Even basic figures such
as GNP, population, number of livestock, or output of major agricultural crops
are only rough estimates. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to measure
economic performance except in a very rough and ready manner.
8.        Poor rainfall in 1973 and a virtual absence of rain during 1974
and the first half of 1975 led to widespread crop failures. The drought
hurt exports of livestock and bananas, the two largest earners of foreign
exchange, and required large imports of maize, sorghum, rice and sugar.
The drought affected the entire central and northeastern parts of the country
involving a large part of the population, mostly nonsds. The Government moved
quickly to respond to the situation and began to set up relief camps in
November 1974. Relief camp population peaked at about 270,000 in late May and
early June 1975, with nearly 400,000 other people being assisted outside the
relief camps. While the Government's foodgrain reserves were almost totally
exhausted by the end of 1974, food aid was received in sufficient volume to
cope with the immediate problem of hunger. However, despite prompt action by
the Government and the response of foreign aid donors, the loss of human lives
reached 19,000 by the end of summer 1975. Given the size of the disaster,
this was a relatively low figure and is an indicator of the growing effective-
ness of the Government. However, there was extensive loss of livestock,esti-
mated at 20-25% of the national herd.
9.        The drought was finally broken in 1975 when the summer rains were
quite good. Meanwhile, the Government established a number of agricultural
settlements in the south and fisheries settlements along the coast to provide
a permanent livelihood for the inhabitants of the relief camps. In August
1975, the relief camps were disbanded and about 110,000 people were resettled
in the three agricultural areas and about 15,000 were settled in three locRtions
along the coast which have potential as fishing ports. The remaining 100,000 or
so inhabitants returned to nomadism. The Drought Rehabilitation Credit (623-So)
is assisting the three agricultural settlements.

10.       Somalia's manufacturing sector consists of a few relatively large-
scale public-owned enterprises and a large number of small private enterprises.
Out of an estimated value added in industry of US$20 million in 1973, the most
recent year for which sectorwide statistics are available, about 80% was in
the public sector. Most of the industries are agro-based, depending upon
locally produced raw materials. After making strong progress in the period
1968-70, relative stagnation started in 1971 and lasted until 1973; however,
indications are that industrial activity has picked up in 1974-75, especially
in the public sector. Several significant manufacturing investments were made
in the latter period such as a brick factory, a flour and pasta mill, grain
mills, and a corrugated carton factory. In addition, expansion and moderniza-
tion of existing plants, especially the sugar complex and the textile factory,
will come to fruition in the near future. Alsc, the expansion of the fishing
fleet is contributing to the improved performance of the fish factory. Con-
struction is reportedly starting on a 500,000-ton oil refinery financed by
Iraq.
11.       Somalia's fiscal performance has continued to be encouraging and
public savings through current budget surpluses will remain an important goal
of the Government. Together with the many self-help projects, the ability of
the country to help finance its investment plan is the most concrete embodiment
of the national policy of self-reliance. The turning point came in 1971 when
the Government first succeeded in reversing a 10-year history of budget deficits.
Since then, a surplus has emerged every year. However, the increasing supply of
all types of gove-nmental services nationwide and the recurrent cost implication
of the recent large public investments will make it increasingly difficult for
the budget to act as a generator of savings in the economy.
12.       To raise the revenues required to finance a high level of governmental
activity will require a reform of the tax system and identification of new
sources of revenue. Specifically, since the Government has invested heavily
in the parastatal sector where financial performance has been poor, ways of
improving efficiency are necessary to ensure that they generate a larger and
growing source of revenue. A World Bank mission recently studied state firms
and will be discussing its findings with the Government.
13.       Somalia's balance of trade on goods and services has been in deficit
since Independence. The gap has grown from US$18.6 million in 1970 to US$106
million in 1975, largely as a result of rapid growth in imports. Imports have
risen steadily from US$56.8 million in 1971 to US$178 million in 1975. Fast
import growth is taking place in spite of the Government's comprehensive import
licensing system and of selective measures to constrain imports of some goods.
Measures to compress non-essential imports can only have limited impact since
development-related imports already accounted for 40% of the total in 1974 and
undoubtedly account for a higher share at present. The remaining import bill
is dominated primarily by non-compressible items such as food. Exports, on
the other hand, jumped from US$31.9 million in 1970 to US$85.3 million in 1975.
A stronger-than-expected performance in livestock and meat products is largely
responsible for the high exports of 1975. Also, higher banana prices more than
offset a marked decline in volume exported (down about 20% from 1974). However,
the main positive developments in 1975 concern unrequited transfers and capital



- 4 -
inflows. As a result of the drought, Somalia received the equivalent of
US$65.8 million in cash grants and food and other assistance in kind valued
at more than US$36 million. Capital inflows totalled US$41.5 million. These
factors led to an overall balance of payments surplus of US$51.9 million.
However, since exports of livestock are likely to drop in the future as nomads
restock their herds and unrequited transfers may fall to pre-drought levels,
future years will probably show roughly balanced transactions with neither
large gains nor losses in reserves.
14.       Foreign aid has at times been the sole source of financing for
investment. In recent years, it has been supplemented by modest sums of
public savings. However, for the foreseeable future, foreign assistance
will continue to play a major role in the development of the country.
The Somali Government is well aware of this fact and, while pushing for
self-reliance by emphasizing domestic savings and self-help programs, it
has mounted a major effort to attract commitments of funds from the OAPEC
countries. The large inflows of foreign funds during 1975 indicate that
the effort has been successful.
15.       The source of foreign assistance has been changing from the western
countries (except for the EEC which continues to have a fairly large program)
towards the socialist group (mainly China and the Soviet Union) and the Arab
countries and Arab funds. Loans from the socialist countries typically bear
interest at 2-1/2% but have rather short maturities (10-15 years) while the
Arab countries tend to have terms which, while soft compared to commercial
rates, resemble Third Window more than standard IDA terms.
16.       The total public foreign debt of Somalia, as of December 1975, was
approximately US$433.7 million, of which about US$250 million were disbursed
and outstanding. IDA commitments, as of December 1975, accounted for 14% of
total debt outstanding. Although a large share of this debt is on fairly
soft terms, the debt service ratio has increased from 3.4% in 1972 to about
4% in 1975, and will probably triple by the early 1980's. At present, IDA's
share of debt service is negligible; however, it is projected to account about
3% of Somalia's total debt service payments in 1?81. In view of the country's
poverty and uncertain export prospects. Somalia should concentrate its efforts
on obtaining assistance on the softest terms possible.
Development Planning Achievements
17.       The long-range objectives of the Government are stronglv influenced
by the desire to be self-reliant. In line with this goal, the Government is
seeking to make the country self-sufficient in agriculture through both an
expansion of the area under cultivation and the development of irrigation.
In this process the Government intends to provide permanent settlement for
many of the nomads. Considerable emphasis is given to modernizing and mobi-
lizing the population. Of central importance for achieving these objectives
are education, rural literacy and self-help programs such as the agriculture
and public works "crash" prograLs. Finallv, the Government places emphasis
on developing infrastructure, especially transportation and communications,
which are necessary to facilitate the above objectives.



- 5 -
18.       Since the bulk of the population is engaged in herding or in sub-
sistence farming, a development strategy for Somalia must start with agri-
culture and livestock as a base. The major development goals of the Somali
Government include self-sufficiency in foodgrains, the partial substitution
of other food imports (oils, rice) and improvement of the lot of the tradi-
tional nomadic herdsmen through settlement programs and improvements in live-
stock production and marketing facilities. The current Plan's emphasis on
irrigated agriculture is meant to make the country less dependent on the
erratic pattern of rainfall, and assure more stable and predictable increases
in output. Attention is also being given to projects in rainfed agriculture
(mainly through the Self-Help Program, the Rainfed Crop Production Project under
the Juba-Shebelli Area Emergency Settlement Scheme, and the N' rth-West Region
Agricultural Development Project) which focus on making the best use of the
limited amount of rainfall. Improvements in livestock production and marketing
are being promoted by the IDA-financed Trans-Juba Livestock Project, designed to
provide market access to the nomads in the southern part of the country and the
Kuwait Fund-financed Northern Rangelands Project with emphasis on rehabilitation
of the denuded rangelands in the North. The Plan continues to base its develop-
ment of industry on the processing of domestic raw materials to substitute for
imports.
19.       The 1974-78 Five-Year Plan,as originally conceived,was probably overly
ambitious and its implementation has been rendered even more difficult because
of the recent disastrous drought which forced the Government to concentrate
resources on measures to save the drought-stricken population. A review of Plan
implementation after two years shows rates of implementation of 46.2% and 40.8%,
respectively in 1974 and 1975. If adjustments for investments outside the Plan
(mainly drought relief and rehabilitation) were made they would show implemen-
tation rates (in financial terms) of about 60% in 1974 and 55% in 1975. In
absolute terms, annual investment therefore increased from about So.Sh. 340
million in 1973 to an average of So.Sh. 500-600 million in 1974-75. These
figures suggest an increase in the country's capacity to absorb investment funds.
20.       The Government's achievements over the past several years have been
impressive by any standard. Before the present Government came to power in
1969, the economy was stagnant and the Government financially unviable. Today
the economy is developing in a dynamic manner and a far higher level of public
services is being supplied. Whereas, a few years ago, a bilateral budget support
grant was necessary to finance the deficit in a current budget which financed
a dismally low level of services, today, even though the country has been
beset by national calamities and is carrying on new tasks, the budget is not
only balanced but actually produces a modest surplus.
21.       Two fields where the Government's achievements have been particularlv
outstanding have been in the settlement of nomads and in education. As noted
above (para. 9), within a period of less than one year beginning in the summer
of 1975, more than 100,000 nomads were transported from the arid rangelands of
the North and settled on unutilized agricultural areas in the South. Land
clearing is taking place and irrigation facilities are being built. Small
harvests have already been reaped and this has encouraged both the Government
and the settlers. In education, the Government has concentrated on two aspects:
basic education as a necessity for people, young and old, to enable them to



- 6 -
effectively participate in the social, economic and political process; and
specialized manpower training as a requirement for national development.
With respect to the former, the mass literacy campaign conducted in the years
1973, 1974 and 1975 at a cost of So.Sh. 100 million (US$16 million) has
resulted in an increase in the adult literacy ratio from about 5% to about
50-60%, according to the Government's own estimates. The formal primary
school enrollment ratio has risen from less than 15% of the relevant age
group a few years ago to approximately 34% at present, and universal primary
education is a goal that possibly could be achieved by the early or mid-1980's.
A script introduced by the Government in 1972 made the writing of the Somali
language possible for the first time, and this removed one of the major con-
straints to progress in the field of education. With respect to manpower
development, the Government is concentrating on the training of high and middle-
level personnel in its principal development sectors -- agriculture and livestcck.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA
22.       Starting in 1965, IDA has made 11 credits totalling about US$76
million, about 48% of which has been made for transportation development includ-
ing construction of two trunk roads and a new deepwater port and associated
extensions at Mogadiscio. IDA credits were also made for education in FY71 and
FY75, livestock development in FY74 and drought rehabilitation and agricultural
development in FY76. No Bank loans or IFC investments have been made in Somalia.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 28, 1977,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Performance on ongoing projects
has been generally satisfactory.
23.       We plan to concentrate our efforts on the country's directly productive
sectors -- agriculture and livestock -- and also on education and transportation.
In addition to these sectors, we plan to support the Government's industrial
development efforts (and assist in the formulation of an industrial development
policy) through our country economic work and DFC projects. W,hile agriculture
and livestock offer potential for development, most rural development activities
are only at the beginning stage. Moreover, agricultural development in Somalia
is particularly difficult because most of the people in the rural area are nomadic.
Our first agricultural project for Somalia was the Drought Rehabilitation Picject
in the South which, together with the North-West Region Agriculturo1 Development
Project, would contribute to balanced agricultural development in Somalia.
24.       The country's transportation facilities are inadequate and the Govern-
ment plans to continue transportation development in the next few years. The
Second Highway Project, which was completed recently, provided for the feasibi-
lity studies and detailed engineering for the improvement of the Hargeisa-
Borama Road in the northern region, which is the basis of the proposed project.
On the basis of these studies, we are submitting at the same time a proposed
credit for the Somali Development Bank. Within a few weeks, we plan to seek
your approval for a credit for a third education project.
25.       In order to help Somalia make the best use of assistance available
from neighboring Arab countries, and also to ensure that IDA funds have the



greatest impact, we have agreed with the Government to spread available IDA
resources over a relatively large number of projects. Accordingly, the
Association will make a major contribution to project identification and
preparation but would, in most cases, finance a small share of project costs
and help mobilize complementary funds from other external sources. This
strategy requires extensive use of Bank Group staff, which is fully justified
in view of Somalia's state of development and its strenuous efforts to improve
its absorptive capacity.
26.       To facilitate the development and implementation of the Association's
growing operational program in Somalia, we have recently decided to establish
a one-man Resident Mission in Somalia. The Mission will represent the Bank in
its dealings with the Government, will assure an efficient and smooth day-to-
day working relationship with the Government and will help coordinate co-
financing arrangements on the basis of the strategy outlined above.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN SOMALIA
Transport System
27.       Somalia's transport infrastructure comprises about 17,700 km of roads,
4 principal ports and 10 airports, but no railways or pipelines. Road trans-
port is by far the principal means of modern transport, although the road net-
work is inadequate, consisting mostly of fair-weather roads.
28.       Highways.  Details of the highway subsector are discussed in paras.
37 to 49. Previous Bank Group-financed projects in the subsector are described
in Annex II. Project implementation in both of our previous projects has been
generally satisfactory, although there were some delays in completion of civil
construction works in each case. There is a dispute between Somalia and the
contractor over certain claims arising out of the construction of the first
project (Afgoi-Baidoa Road). The contractor submitted four major claims for
arbitration and the International Chamber of Commerce's Arbitration Tribunal
has awarded 100% (about $4.6 million equivalent) in favor of the coatractor.
The Government believes the award was unjust and objected to it, but indicated
that it is prepared to meet the contractor to resolve the dispute. A meeting
between the Government and the contractor, for discussion and resolution of the
dispute, was held recently. The meeting adjourned with a view of resuming
discussions in a second meeting to be held in the near future.
29.       Ports.  Four ports handle practically all of Somalia's ocean trans-
port: Berbera in the north on the Gulf of Aden, and Mogadiscio, Merca and
Kismayu in the south. Ports with berts for ocean-going vessels are Berbera,
which exports mostly livestick, and Kismayu, which exports bananas and meat.
Lighterage ports are Mogadiscio, which imports most of the country's general
cargo, and Merca, which exports bananas. An alongside port, replacing the
existing lighterage facility, is being constructed at Mogadiscio, financed
jointly by IDA (Credits 359-SO and 586-SO) and the European Development Fund.
30.       In recent years, import tonnage has increased sharply while export
tonnage has declined somewhat, largely reflecting the impact of the 1973-74
drought. Total foreign trade handled virtually doubled between 1970 to 1975
from 422,000 metric tons to 835,000 metric tons. International trade is handled
by foreign vessels, supplemented by the National Shipping Line, which was estab-
lished in 1974 as a joint venture of the Governments of Somalia (51% ownership)



- 8 -
and Libya. The National Shipping Line has four ships used mainly for inter-
national trade in cattle and bananas. Transport by coastal shipping is limited,
despite the long coastline, because there has been little interregional trade
suitable for such shipping.
31.       Civil Aviation.   The air transport system serves 10 scattered urban
areas, with Mogadiscio as the focal point. Only three airports have paved
runways. During 1969-75, domestic passenger traffic increased modestly, from
18,000 to 20,000 passengers, while domestic freight traffic declined from 321
tons to 180 tons.
32.       Somali Airlines operates six aircrafts in domestic and international
service and a number of small private aircrafts are employed in charter service.
Internationally, Somali Airlines connects Mogadiscio with Rome, Cairo, Nairobi,
Djibouti and various points on the Arabian Peninsula. Several foreign airlines
link Somalia with other African countries, Asia and Europe. Between 1969 and
1975, international air traffic increased sharply; passenger traffic rose from
10,000 to 33,000; and air freight rose from 166 tons to 1,068 tons.
Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
33.       The Government's transport objectives, indicated in the 1974-78
Development Plan, are to (i) open new areas for development (mainly in
agriculture) and thus increase the economy's productive capacity; (ii) foster
regional economic integration of the country's many isolated areas; and (iii)
lower the cost of, and facilitate, domestic transport, thereby reducing the
disparity between rural and urban areas in price and availability of goods.
Much progress can be made towards these goals. The Government intends to
achieve them primarily through construction of main and feeder roads; two of
these main roads are included in this proiect. Other key plans are completion
of the Mogadiscio harbor and relocation of its airport, improvement of the
Hargeisa airport and strengthening of the national airline.
34.       Within the transport and communications sector of the 1974-78 Plan
73% of the investments are allocated to highways, 19% to ports and shipping,
3% to civil aviation and 5% to communications.   The sector accounts for 25% of
total planned public investments over the period, compared with 35% in the
previous Three-Year Plan. Although only 60% of the 1971-73 transport and
communications plan was implemented (largely because of delays in starting
projects, particularlv the Mogadiscio Port Project), actual investments com-
prised 29% of overall investments during the period. While the current invest-
ment plan is not likely to be fully implemented, a substantial portion of the
investments will probably be made and the country's transport infrastructure
is expected to continue to improve over the Plan period.
Fighway planning is carried out by the Ministry of Public Vorks (MPW),
through its subordinate Civil Engineering Department (CED). In addition, CED
is concerned with ports and airports; the Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime
Transport is also involved in port planning through the Somali Ports Authority.
The National Shipping Line, within this Ministry, is responsible for maritime
transport planning. Airport planning is piimo'rily the task of the MPW; other
agencies involved in civil aviation are the Civil Aviation Department of the
Ministry of Transport and Somali Airlines.



-9 -
36.       Intermodal coordination is not an issue; there is no railway nor
plans for one, and the limited intercoastal shipping is not likely to increase
significantly in the foreseeable future. The General Directorate of Planning
and Coordination coordinates the agencies which plan transport investments.
Staff limitations in both the General Directorate and the planning ministries
have resulted in heavy reliance on consultants. Thus, the Transport and
Communications Sector Program of the 1971-73 Development Plan generally followed
by the investment recommendations made by the consultants in a 1966 Transport
Survey prepared under the First Highway Project. In preparing the 1974-78
Development Plan, the 1966 Transport Survey again served as a general guide.
Under the Second Highway Project, an updated transport survey by consultants
is to be completed in 1977.
The Highway Subsector
37.       Network.   The length of the highway network has not increased signi-
ficantly since 1971. However, there has been considerable road upgrading; paved
roads increased from about 890 to 1,400 km between 1971-75. The total network
also includes about 1,000 km of gravel roads and 15,300 km of earth roads.
Roads are classified as primary, 5,900 km; secondary, 2,500 km; and feeder,
8,300 km. Under the First Highway Project, consultants and CED staff inven-
toried 7,235 km of the road network during 1965-74, including all bituminous-
surfaced roads and certain other important ones. Under the present project,
the inventory will be updated and the 10,000 km not yet inventoried will be
included (para. 56).
38.       Vehicle Fleet.   Some 10,400 motor vehicles operate in the country.
The heaviest vehicle concentration is in the Mogadiscio area; the second prin-
cipal concentration is in Hargeisa. Of the estimated 10,400 vehicle fleet,
which appears adequate for present demand, aboutithree-fourths consists of
privately owned and operated vehicles. Data indicating the growth, age and
condition of the fleet are not available. There are no vehicle manufacturers
in Somalia; Italy is the principal source of supply. Import of passenger cars
is subject to tight Government limitations and high tariffs.
39.       Traffic Growth.   National roEd traffic statistics are not available.
However, between 1969 and 1974, annual gasoline imports increased by more than
7% on average and diesel imports rose by an annual average of 20%. (Somalia
has no refinery.) Nearly all of the gasoline and much of the diesel fuel are
consumed by motor vehicles. The lower gasoline growth rate reflects, of course,
a comparatively low traffic growth rate of gasoline-powered vehicles. The
difference between the two import growth rates may be attributed to increased
use of trucks and of diesel fuel in non-transport activities, but the limited
data do not permit proper assessment of the divergence. A continuing program
for collecting traffic statistics is necessary for effective road construction
and maintenance planning, and the project will assist in setting up such a
program (para. 56).



- 10 -
40.       Regulations and Rates.   Adequate vehicle weight and dimension regu-
lations were introduced in 1971, and the Ministry of Interior is responsible
for their enforcement. The maximum gross vehicle weight permitted is 32 m
tons; the maximum load for a single axle is 10 m tons; for a tandem axle, 16 m
tons. Overloading is not a major problem. Truck operators engaged in public
transport are required to be registered but are not restricted to specific
routes. There are no large fleet owners and most operators have only one
vehicle. The Ministry of Transport through its regional offices allocates,
with few exceptions, specific freight transport jobs to private operators on
a first-come, first-served basis, which seems to be working satisfbctorily.
Truck freight and passenger rates are set, with periodic adjustments, by the
Ministry of Transport, which follows the policy of holding rates as low as
possible, consistent with the viability of private transport operations.
41.       Administration.   The Civil Engineering Department of the Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for constructing roads, ports and airports. The
CED comprises six divisions (Planning and Design, Construction, Maintenance,
Materia3s, Equipment and Administration) and 16 regional road maintenance
sections. There are three main workshops, set up under the First Highway
Project, at Hargeisa, Mogadiscio and Kismayu, which cater to the needs of the
16 regional sections.
42.       Also under the First Highway Project, a consulting firm assisted in
organizing, staffing and managing CED and made recommendations about expanding
CED's activities. However, with the departure of the consultants in 1974, the
full burden of the operation rested on CED staff, which had by then fallen far
short of its authorized strength due to non-availability of sufficient qualified
staff. The shortage of qualified staff has adversely affected CED operations,
particularly road maintenance (para. 47).   In 1976, three senior and many sub-
ordinate posts were vacant, caused in part by transfers of personnel to other
agencies, including the National Construction Agency. The Government has agreed
to fill the following key positions by December 30, 1977 with qualified and com-
petent persons: (i) Head of the Maintenance Division; (ii) Head of the Planning
and Design Division; and (iii) Head of the Materials Laboratory Division (Develop-
ment Credit Agreement, Section 3.06).
43.       Planning.   Road planning by the Government and its consultants has
been generally adequate and is leading to the development of an integrated high-
way network. CED has used consultants extensively for both long-term planning
and for project feasibility and design studies. The technical assistance and
training elements of the First and Second Highway Projects have contributed to
increasing CED's planning capability. Technical assistance under this project
focuses on further building up the Department's capacity to plan and carry out
maintenance of the expanding paved road system (paras. 47 and 56). CED's
Planning and Design Division carries out minor design work, such as small drain-
age structures, while major design is done by foreign consultants. Design
standards for primary roads are adequate. Establishment of appropriate standards
for lower road categories is expected soon.
44.       Road Expenditures.   Road maintenance expenditures more than doubled
during 1970-74, from So.Sh. 2.5 million to So.Sh. 6.3 million. These amounts
have not been adequate and the Government has agreed that in the future it will



- 11 -
ensure that adequate amounts for road maintenance are included in its annual
budget (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.03).. Administrative expendi-
tures increased more moderately from So.Sh. 3.5 million to So.Sh. 4.5 million.
Outlays for road construction rose dramatically over 1971-75, mainly due to
construction of the 1,045 km Belet Uen-Burao road by the Peoples Republic of
China; the cost of this five-year project has been estimated at So.Sh. 400
million, or about So.Sh. 80 million per annum. During 1971-75, funds from
external sources varied from 77% to 95% of annual construction expenditures
and in the years ahead funds for major construction are likely to continue
to come largely from external loans and grants.
45.       Road User Revenues.   Road users contribute to general government
revenue through taxes and duties on vehicles, fuel lubricants and spare parts,
and through license and registration fees. Among these levies, the fuel tax,
collected by the Customs Department, constitutes the major source of road user
revenue. In 1974, the year for which the most comprehensive data are available,
road user taxes and duties amounted to about So.Sh. 90 million, against the
So.Sh. 146.5 million expended for road administration, maintenance and construc-
tion. Although outlays thus exceeded revenues, construction expenditures in
1974 were unusually high, because of the Belet Uen-Burao Road, but are not
expectea to continue at that level beyone 1978.
46.       Construction.  With the exception of the Belet UTer-Burao Road, major
roads generally are constructed and supervised by foreign contractors and con-
sultants. In the recent past, departmental forces have constructed some major
roads but are now concentrating on construction of earth roads. The Government
favors road construction by its National Construction Agency as far as possible,
Apart from a few small private contractors capable of constructing simple road
works or providing subcontracted transport, there is virtually no local con-
struction industry. In the past, transport subcontracts on civil works projects
have resulted in disputes because of the use of per diem rates as a basis for
subcontract prices; since it is preferable to use ton/km rates for such purposes,
an agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that any such
transport subcontracts under the proposed project would be based on ton/km rates
(Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 3, para. A.3).
47.       Maintenance.  The Government is anxious to improve road maintenance,
which is carried out by the CED through its force account. Although maintenance
has improved over the years, the quantity and quality of work is unsatisfacotry
and has not kept pace with the expanding paved road network. The main causes
of inadequate road maintenance are lack of expertise and insufficient allocation
of funds despite recent increases (para. 44). CED's equipment repair facilities
are also insufficient. Further, CED personnel and equipment are often diverted
to other public works projects. These problems are addressed under the present
project. First, technical assistance is provided to aid in increasing and improv-
ing maintenance planning and operations, including training of CED staff (para. 56).
Second, the Government has agreed that it will adequately maintain its highway
systems in accordance with sound engineering practices and will include adequate
amounts for maintenance in its budget each year (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 4.03). Third, additional machineshop equipment necessary for equipment
repairs and training has been included in the project (para. 56). Finally, it
has also been agreed that CED's highway maintenance staff and equipment will be
used exclusively for highway maintenance (Development Credit Agreement, Section
4.03).

48.       Training.  Under the First Highway Project, UNDP financed a program
of training abroad for Somali engineers and technicians during 1965-74. Of
the 17 persons who received training in various countries, 8 are still in the
MPW, and most of the others are employed in other Government agencies. Several
engineers and technicians are currently being trained abroad to meet CED's
growing needs.
49.       During 1965-74, also under the First Highway Project, the consultants
organized and conducted courses at CED headquarters for sub-professional Somali
personnel in various areas of highway operations, particularly surveying, plan-
ning, drafting and soils laboratory work. In addition, the consultants provided
satisfactory on-the-job training for mechanics, operators and drivers. About
40 skilled workers are receiving on-the-job training at a field workshop set up
by the Peoples Republic of China for construction of the Belet Uen-Galcaio-Burao
Road. Additionally, the CED holds training classes in Mogadiscio for mechanics
employed in the main workshop. Although these programs have alleviated the
shortage of trained personnel, further training is needed and is provided under
the project (para. 56).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
50.       A report entitled "Staff Project Report, Third Highway Project, Somali
Democratic Republic" (Report No. 1290-SO, dated March 31, 1977) is being distri-
buted separately to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III to this report. The project was appraised in March-April
1976. Negotiations were held in Washington on February 14-15, 1977. The Somali
delegation was led by Mr. Abdurahman Nur Herzi, the Somali Minister of Finance.
Objectives
51.       Somalia's road development objectives include upgrading the primary
road system, which is comprised mostly of earth and gravel roads, in order to
overcome serious traffic interruptions during rains, enable roads to carry
livestock traffic and reduce high vehicle operating costs. The Government
also aims to improve the maintenance of its rapidly expanding paved road net-
work. The project will assist in attaining these objectives.
Project Description
52.       The project consists of:
(i) construction, and related supervision, of the Hargeisa-Borama
Road (113 km), with a link to Tug Wajale (19 km) in Northern
Somalia (see map);
(ii) a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Dinsor-
Bardera-Gelib Road (about 340 km) in the south (see map); and
(iii) strengthening of CED through provision of technical assistance,
training and machineshop equipment.



- 13 -
53.       Road Construction and Supervision.   The Hargeisa-Borama Road and Tug
Wajale link are a major part of the transport infrastructure of north-west
Somalia. The roads will provide an all-weather connection between Borama/Tug
Wajale and Hargeisa, which is already linked to the Port of Berbera on the Gulf
of Aden by a bituminous surfaced road built under the Second Highway Project.
54.       Improvement of the Hargeisa-Tug Wajale Road was identified as a prior-
ity project in the 1966 Transport Survey, and is included in Government's current
development plan. The Second Highway Project included a feasibility study and
detailed engineering of this road, plus an extension westward to Borama; the
results of the study, completed in June 1975, were favorable. Design standards
are satisfactory, and draft bidding documents have been completed. Consultants
will be engaged for construction supervision.
55.       Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering.   The 1974-78 Development
Program includes upgrading of the existing fair-weather road between Dinsor,
Bardera and Gelib (approximately 340 km) to facilitate development of the Juba
Valley where agricultural and industrial investments are planned. The project
provides for a feasibility study of the road, and detailed engineering subject
to the findings of the feasibility study.
56.       Strengthening of the Civil Engineering Department (CED).   Since road
maintenance demands are growing rapidly, there is continuing need to increase
and improve CED operations (para. 47). The technical assistance provided
under the project, comprising a senior highway engineer, two highway super-
intendents, and a workshop superintendent, will assist with the setting up
of a continuous program of road and traffic data collection, including an updated
and expanded road inventory; maintenance planning and operations, including
equipment management and control; and an assessment of highway manpower needs,
including planning and implementation of staff training. On-the-job training of
professional staff is included, as well as training on-the-job and in the class-
room of existing and new mechanics, operators, drivers and spare part inventory
control staff. The machineshop at CED headquarters has limited facilities for
day-to-day equipment repairs andfor on-the-job training of existing and new
workshop mechanics. Specific equipment required for these purposes is included
in the project.
Project Cost Estimate
57.       Total project cost is estimated at US$30 million (net of taxes and
duties) including contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at US$22.5 million or 75% of total project cost. Project costs as of December
31, 1976 are summarized below (for detailed breakdown, see Annex III):
US$ Million
Road Construction and Supervision                         16.91
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering                 2.00
Strengthening of CED                                       1.06
Physical and Price Contingencies                           5.26

Total Project Cost                                        30.01



- 14 -
Besides the normal physical and price contingencies (physical contingencies
of 10% are provided for; price contingencies are provided at 7.5% for equip-
ment and 9% per year for civil works during the implementation period), a
special risk allowance of $4.8 million for the road construction was included
to allow for possible higher costs which may result in view of the level of
recent bids for similar works in East Africa and the Middle East.
Financing
58.       The civil works construction and the consultants services for super-
vision of construction would be financed jointly by all of the co-financing
agencies, i.e., the African Development Fund, the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development, and the Islamic Development Bank, all in concessionary
terms. Two additional components would be financed under parallel arrangements
-- (a) the technical assistance component, by the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development, and (b) the feasibility studies and detailed engineering
for the Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib Road, by the Association. The proposed IDA credit
includes US$0.41 million representing IDA's share of the risk allowance, which
will be cancelled in the event the amount of responsive bids for civil works
construction are substantially below the above cost estimates. The financing
plan, including the Government's contribution, is outlined below.

Participation in the jointly financed construction and supervision would be based
on the following percentages: IDA - 19%, Arab Fund - 26%, IDB - 28%, ADF - 21%,
and Government - 6%. The loans of Arab Fund and IDB have been negotiated, and
the ADF loan is expected to be negotiated shortly; the above credit/loans of the
co-financing agencies, including IDA, are envisaged to become effective simul-
taneously (Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01).
Implementation
59.       The project will be carried out by CED with the assistance of consultants.
Construction and related supervision of the project roads will take about 2-1/2
years, beginning mid-1977, with an estimated 15% of works to be carried out in
1977, about 50% in 1978 and the remainder in 1979. The feasibility study will
be conducted by consultants over about 15 months beginning late 1977. Depending



- 15 -
on the results of that study, the consultants will then undertake detailed
engineering, which would require a further 12 months, beginning early 1979.
Technical assistance is expected to begin mid-1977 and continue for two years.
The machinsehop equipment will be procured over about nine months during
1977-78.
Procurement
60.       The civil works will be procured under single unit price contract
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guide-
lines for procurement. Bids on civil works construction are expected in June
1977, and tender award in August 1977. No problems are anticipated in acquiring
land for right-of-way because the Government has the right of eminent domain.
61.       The consulting services for construction supervision, the feasibility
studies and detailed engineering will be by qualified and experienced consultants
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.02).
Disbursements
62.       Disbursements from the credit account will be on the basis of (a) 19%
of the total cost of civil work construction and related supervision, and (b)
80% of the total cost of the feasibility study and detailed engineering included
in the project. A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex III.
Coordination
63.       A draft Memorandum of Understanding amongst all co-financing agencies,
covering project composition and financing plan, procurement and disbursement
procedures, project supervision, consultation and exchange of information on
various matters of mutual interest, has been reviewed recently between repre-
sentatives of the co-financing agencies. The memorandum is expected to be
signed by the co-financing partners shortly.
Environmental Aspects
64.       No serious environmental problems are likely to arise from the project.
Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
65.       The project roads will constitute an important element in the national
road system by extending the paved road westward from Hargeisa, Somalia's second
largest city, to Borama and Tug Wajale through an area which produces consider-
able livestock and agricultural crops. In addition to serving the growing
transport demand within the northwest region, the roads will facilitate trade
with Ethiopia. The main benefits will be increased revenues from livestock
exports as a result of an anticipated shift from livestock trekking to truck
transport, with consequent reduced loss in animal weight. Potential weight
savings are a powerful incentive, as evidenced by the virtually complete
shift of truc'1ng of livestock on the new Hargeisa-Berbera Road in the first



- 16 -
year after the road opened. Another principal benefit is savings in vehicle
operating costs for normal traffic. The main beneficiaries will be the direct
road users, but benefits will be widely distributed among producers, traders
and consumers because of the Government's transport rate policy (para. 40).
66.       The economic return on the road construction,representing about 90%
of project cost,is 21%. However, if there should be a 25% increase in con-
struction costs, as well as a reduction of 33% in livestock price and 50% in
the livestock growth rate, the return would still be a satisfactory 12%. The
major project risk is construction cost increases which may result in view of
the level of recent bids for similar works in East Africa and the Middle East.
We have therefore included a special risk allowance in the project costs (see
para. 57). An economic return on the technical assistance and studies, which
account for about 10% of project costs, has not been made; however, benefits,
particularly improved maintenance and administration, will be great.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
67.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali Democratic
Republic and the Associaticn, the recommendation of the Committee provided for
under Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed development credit,
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
68.       Special features of the proposed Development Credit are referred
to in Annex IV. Effectiveness of the loans from the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development, African Development Fund and Islamic Development Bank
is an additional condition of effectiveness (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 6.01).
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
70.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed develop-
ment credit.

B.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - SOMALIA-/
Cr. No. 123   Highways Supplement (Afgoi-Baido); $2.3 million Credit of
June 26, 1968; Date of Effectiveness: February 25, 1969;
Closing Date: Originally December 31, 1971 and postponed
six times to December 31, 1977.
The construction of the Afgoi Baidoa road was substantially
completed in March 1971. The contractor has submitted four major claims
for arbitration, and ICC Arbitration Tribunal has awarded 100% in favor of
contractor. The Government believes the arbitration award was unjust and
objects to it. A meeting between Government and contractor for discussion
and resolution of dispute was held recently. The meeting adjourned with a
view of resuming discussions in a second meeting to be held in the near future.
Cr. No. 295   Highway II (Hargeisa-Berbera); $9.6 million Credit of March 30,
1972; Date of Effectiveness: May 11, 1972; Clsoing Date:
originally December 31, 1975 and postponed twice to December 31,
1977.
The construction of the Hargeisa-Berbera road has been completed
and opened to traffic. The Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering for the
Hargeisa-Borama Road have also been completed.
Cr. No. 359   Port of Mogadiscio; $12.95 million Credit of March 15, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: September 10, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Cr. No. 586   Mogadiscio Port Extension Project; $5.2 million Credit of October
15, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977.
The physical execution of the civil works is going well after a
slow start. The contractor is working three 8-hour shifts and completion is
expected in April 1977, 12 months behind the original schedule. A harbor tug
financed under this credit was completed in July 1976. The management consult-
ants to the Somali Ports Authority started their work in April 1976 and are
performing well.
Cr. No. 452   Livestock (Trans-Juba) Project; $10 million Credit of February 20,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: October 29, 1974; Closing Date:
Jurne 30, 1980.
Owing to an apparent large increase in project costs and a 50%
decrease in world market prices of quality beef, an indepth review of the project
was carried out in February 1977. The above review has estimated a 30% increase
in project costs. The study has proposed a smaller fodder farm. wh-ch 'Vculd

still enable the whole project to be implemented within existing funds.
Economic viability will be assured by a change to selling mainly live
cattle for export, which commands a premium over processing and selling
chilled meat on the world beef market. Some tendering problems and changes
in management and consultants may entail small delays in project implementa-
tion.
Cr. No. 511   Second Education; $8 million Credit of September 19, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: December 19, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The
Elementary Teachers Training College is complete and in use. Construction
of remaining nomadic centers and the Academy of Somali Studies and Marine
Institute are scheduled for a second phase, to commence in mid-1977. Pro-
curement of furniture and equipment is progressing well. Arrangements are
under way for recruiting the three fisheries and marine teclulical assistance
specialists as well as key project unit specialists. Although the project is
proceeding on schedule, current estimate of final project cost is about $1
million above appraisal estimate including contingencies.
Cr. No. 623   Drought Rehabilitation Program -- Juba-Shebelli Emergency Settle-
ment Scheme; $8 million Credit of July 7, 1976; Date of Effective-
ness: September 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The Government has fulfilled the conditions of effectiveness by
enacting the law establishing the Settlement Authority, appoint the Authority's
General Manager and opening an account for the Authority. The consultants to
assist in carrying out the project have been appointed. Model tender documents
and specifications for the procurement of land clearing and cultivation machinery
have been sent to the Government.
Cr. No. 635   North-West Region Agricultural Development Project; $10 million
Credit of July 7, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: February 9, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
This Credit has recently become effective with the appointment of
a project manager and the signing of the consultant team contract. Disbursement
has already commenced and implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.

tants under terms and conditions acceptable
to the Association,
