Sector-wide lessons\n            highlight the quality of the initial project design which\n            was clear and relatively simple, yet not simplistic: the\n            components were both consistent for the stakeholders and\n            understandable to the public. This ensured clear guidance to\n            all those involved in implementation. Nevertheless, areas of\n            weakness point at the absence of a sector-wide base-line\n            survey, which could have been carried out at the start of\n            the Project. In the specific case of Moldova, such a survey\n            would have clearly displayed the state of art of the current\n            system; at the same time, it would have constituted a\n            valuable frame of reference for any further project\n            evaluation. Moreover, the project did not have a clear set\n            of quality indicators and quality monitoring mechanisms.\n            This proved necessary; and the implementation quality\n            monitoring should have been in place as of the early stages,\n            offering valuable and timely data for further improvements.\n            The institutional reform undertaken under the project\n            covered mostly Ministry or Ministry-related bodies. While\n            this was part of the first reform steps and cannot be\n            considered a weakness, schools need more support to shift\n            from their status of mere implementing bodies, to the one of\n            responsible learning organizations, and it is this that\n            should be addressed in future projects. Similarly,\n            intermediate level managers - i.e. rayon inspectors,\n            methodologists and school managers - should have been\n            specifically trained for the implementation process. The\n            discrepancy between the training provided to teachers, and\n            the one for school administrators and inspectors was a\n            highly dysfunctional factor during the implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
