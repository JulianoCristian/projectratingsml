The\n            project's key objective is to modernize and improve the\n            quality of primary and lower secondary education. Its four\n            components consist of curriculum development, textbook\n            production and financing, learning assessment, and\n            in-service teacher training. The first component, curriculum\n            development, comprises (1) establishing an integrated\n            institutional structure for curriculum development and\n            assessment/evaluation, (2) developing and establishing\n            updated subject curricula for grades 1-9, and (3) supporting\n            teachers with the implementation of the new curriculum. The\n            learning assessment component improves the assessment and\n            examination system in five key areas: (1) integrating\n            assessment objectives into the new curriculum; (2) improving\n            key national examinations at grades 4 and 9; (3) developing\n            and disseminating assessment materials to teachers for key\n            subjects; (4) training trainers in the use of these\n            materials; and (5) conducting a sample-based survey of\n            student achievements to compare performance before and after\n            the project's implementation. The teacher training\n            component will finance technical assistance, development and\n            dissemination of training materials, implementation of\n            centralized courses for trainers and decentralized courses\n            for teachers, and provide necessary equipment. The textbook\n            development and financing component will finance producing\n            new textbooks and textbook guides in the mother tongue for\n            core subjects for grades 3-9; support a new cost recovery\n            system for textbooks; and provide training and technical\n            assistance for Ministry staff, textbook evaluation\n            committees, and publishers in competitive bidding\n            procedures. Finally, the project will finance technical\n            assistance, equipment and incremental operating costs\n            necessary for project management and studies needed to\n            prepare for a possible future project."}, "docdt": "1997-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
