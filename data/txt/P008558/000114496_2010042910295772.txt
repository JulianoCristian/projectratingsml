Cancellation - Amendment to the Loan Agreement                                     
Dear Ms. Grecianii:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (General Education Project) dated June 2, 1997, between the 
Republic of Moldova and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), as 
amended. We also refer to your letter dated March 12, 2002, requesting cancellation of US$527,335 from 
the Loan and certain amendments to the Loan Agreement.
Cancellation
As the funds are not required to finance Project costs, pursuant to Section 6.01 of the General 
Conditions, the Bank hereby cancels as of March 12, 2002, the amount of US$527,335 equivalent from 
the Loan, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from March 12, 2002.  Schedule 
3, the Amortization Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a result of the cancellation, and the revised 
figures will be sent to you shortly.
We enclose herewith (Attachment) a revised Schedule that indicates the amounts now allocated 
to each of the Categories set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, as a 
result of the cancellation.  In addition, this Schedule reflects the reallocation of proceeds requested in you 
letter of March 12, 2002.
Amendment
We hereby confirm the Bank’s agreement to the following amendment:
Part D.1 of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement is revised to read:
“1.
Acquisition of learning materials (including textbooks) in line with the new curricula for core 
subjects in mandatory general education schools for  Grades I through IX.”  
Please confirm your agreement to this amendment by countersigning, dating and returning to us 
the enclosed copy of this letter.  This amendment will become effective as of the date of countersignature 
upon receipt by the Bank of the countersigned copy of this letter.
