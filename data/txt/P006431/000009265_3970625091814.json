To\n            achieve these objectives, the project intends to provide\n            funds for (i) training and fellowships; (ii) studies and\n            research; (iii) instructional materials; (iv) related\n            technical assistance; (v) equipment and furniture; and (vi)\n            civil works.  When the facilities are fully operational in\n            1995, they would provide improvements to the quality of\n            training directly benefitting about 253,000 trainees\n            annually, and capacity for additional enrollments of 230,000\n            annually.  Project benefits would accrue to a wide range of\n            participants in the labor force, from industrial technicians\n            trained in advanced technologies to commercial and\n            agricultural skilled workers. Estimates of the poverty\n            impact of the project suggest that between 35 and 55 percent\n            of total project costs would benefit poor individuals."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
