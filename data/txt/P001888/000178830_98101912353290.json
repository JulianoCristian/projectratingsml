restructuring secondary education to\n            reflect the needs of the Mauritian socio-economic\n            environment and to improve the quality of education and make\n            access to educational opportunities more equitable. The\n            major components include: (i) technical assistance and\n            facilities for a reorganization of the Ministry of Education\n            and Cultural Affairs, and improvements at the Primary\n            Teacher Training College, the Ministry's Audio-Visual\n            Center and the Maritius Institute of Education; (ii) the\n            creation of 9,120 additional student places in junior\n            secondary schools; and (iii) technical assistance to assist\n            the establishment of a Central Training Office. The project\n            would strengthen the planning, coordinating and\n            implementation capacity of the Ministry of Education and\n            Cultural Affairs and improve efficiency of junior secondary\n            education by reducing operating costs per student/year."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
