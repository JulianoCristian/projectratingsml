            Re:
Loan No. 3281-AR (Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Project) 
Amendment
Dear Sir:
     Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated August 13, 1991, between the Argentine 
Republic and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) for 
the above Project.
     As a result of recent discussions held by Bank staff and Mr. Jorge Rais, 
Undersecretary of Water Resources, we propose to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
     1.   The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is amended to read as set forth in 
the Annex to this letter.
     2.   Part E of the Project is eliminated.
     If you agree with the foregoing amendment, please sign and date the two 
counterparts of this letter, and return one to us. This amendment will become 
effective upon receipt by the Bank of this letter countersigned by you.
     Because of their interest in the matter, we are sending copies of this letter to 
Mr. Jorge Rais, Undersecretary of Water Resources, and to COFAPYS.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
