3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Overall project objectives, in line with Government policies, were to: (a) promote greater sector efficiency
and financial viability; (b) expand service coverage; (c) improve the quality of the water supply and
sewerage services while protecting the environment; and (d) encourage private sector participation in the
water and sanitation sector.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Although there were no revisions of the project development objective, the strategy to achieve those
objectives was modified to reflect the changes in Government policy. The initial emphasis of the project
was to strengthen the decentralized public utilities so they would become more efficient and financially
viable. As discussed in the Staff Appraisal Report, the decentralization of water and sanitation services in
1980 after 50 years of centralized service provision was hastily carried out, and resulted in weak provincial
utilities and declining service coverage. Although promotion of private sector participation (PSP) was one
of the project objectives, the degree of PSP expected to be achieved under this project was modest, limited
to outsourcing of meter reading, billing and collection, and system maintenance.
Since in the early 90s, after years of declining investments and deteriorating service quality, a new
paradigm emerged. The policy was increasingly one with a greater reliance on the private provision of
infrastructure services and strengthening of the regulatory function of the public sector. This first took
hold at the federal level, and has gradually spread to the provinces. Today, more than half of the country's
population receive water and sanitation services from the private operators. In response to the changing
priorities, and encouraged by the success of the Buenos Aires water concession, the project shifted its
support to that of providing direct technical and financial assistance to the privatization of public utilities,
while building public sector capacity to formulate policy and regulate privatized utilities.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of five components to be managed by COFAPyS, a Federal water sector agency,
which would make sub-loans to provincial and other local water utilities that fulfill the eligibility criteria.
The components were: a) improvement of existing operations of water utilities through institutional
development, commercialization of services, operational imnprovements, and training (US$74.6 million);
b) rehabilitation and upgrading of water and sewerage systems (US$56 million; c) expansion of water and
sewerage systems (US$46.6 million); d) preparation of other studies and preparation of engineering designs
by the water utilities (US$7.5 million); and e) improvement of COFAPyS' operations (US$1.9 million).
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were revised several times in response to the changing priorities of the Government.
During project implementation, five out of the seven sub-borrowers decided to privatize their water utilities
in the form of long-term concession agreement with private operators. Many more provincial and
municipal governments expressed their interest in pursuing private concessions or other forms of private
sector participation in their water and sewerage utilities and requested technical support from the Federal
Government. In the meantime, some of the earlier water concessions started to have trouble and required
some backstopping capacity at the Federal level.
Reflecting such events, in 1995, the loan allocation to the improvement of existing operations was
drastically reduced. Then, in 1997, through a loan amendment that was approved by the Board of
Executive Directors, a new technical assistance component to strengthen the capacity of the Borrower
(Federal Government) for policy formulation and implementation was added. The main activities to be
financed by the new component were: (i) preparation of a sectoral strategy; (ii) development of a
- 2 -



country-wide water and sanitation sector data base and information system; (iii) strengthening the
regulatory framework for the provision of water and sanitation services; (iv) assisting provincial and
municipal governments in the privatization of their water utilities; and (v) supporting the development and
enforcement of water related environmental policies and regulations.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is rated marginally satisfactory. The project's objective was consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was to support the Government in: (i) strengthening public finance at the
national and provincial levels; (ii) improving the allocation of public spending; and (iii) increase private
sector participation in providing public services. The project design reflected the Government's policy in
the late 1980s, which was to strengthen the decentralized public institutions.
The Appraisal report rightly identified the project's institutional and political risks. Indeed the project
suffered from COFAPyS' inability to lend under agreed economic, financial, institutional, and
environmental criteria. As a result, the project remained practically undisbursed until the end of 1994.
Although the consultant team hired by COFAPyS (a risk mitigation measure identified at Appraisal) was of
high quality, COFAPyS as an institution found it difficult to apply many of the loan conditions to the
sub-borrowers. The weak capacity of provincial utilities, also foreseen at Appraisal as risk, contributed
significantly to the delays in project implementation and eventual partial cancellation of the Loan.
The project was innovative at that time, as it required sub-borrowers to comply with various efficiency and
financial criteria. These criteria, however, faced resistance from the provincial utilities which had been
accustomed to the culture of expand and spend, with little emphasis on efficiency or financial
self-sufficiency. Such resistance from the provincial utilities were underestimated when project was
designed, and lead to the overdimensioning and eventual partial cancellation of the Loan.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's outcomes are considered satisfactory. The project achieved its principal objectives to: (i)
promote greater sector efficiency and financial viability; (ii) expand service coverage, (iii) improve the
quality of water and sewerage services while protecting the environment, and (iv) encourage private sector
participation.
The fourth objective of "encouraging private sector participation" in fact became the primary vehicle to
achieve the first three objectives. During project implementation and supported by the project funding, five
out of seven sub-borrowers (Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Formosa, Misiones, La Rioja) were privatized
in the form of long-term concessions. As a result, sector efficiency and financial viability have improved
and are expected to improve further (see Annex 3, Table 1). Some of the recently privatized utilities such
as Misiones and La Rioja have only seen a modest positive impact of privatization. In terms of service
coverage, all utilities substantially expanded the coverage as shown in Annex 1, Table 2-4. Quality of
water and sewerage services as well as environmental standards are now more closely monitored by the
provincial regulatory agencies that were established in conjunction with privatization. Many of the service
quality and environmental indicators constitute a part of the concession contracts. In the case of the two
cooperatives financed under the loan (Puerto Madryn, Chubut, and San Martin de Los Andes, Neuquen),
institutional development programs were implemented and regulatory frameworks were established to
clarify the responsibilities of the cooperatives vis-a-vis the municipalities.
- 3 -



By loan closing, there was a significant improvement of the financial condition of the participating water
companies, as reflected by the indicators in Annex 1.
4.2 Outputts by components:
The project substantially achieved its sector, institutional, and financial objectives. The project directly and
indirectly contributed to a significant increase in the quantity and quality of the services provided and in the
number of people served (see tables 2, 3, and 4, of Annex 1). Nearly in all provinces and municipalities
that the project worked on, the results achieved by the end of the project exceeded the pre-established
targets in sub-loan agreements.
4.2.1 Improvement of Existing Operations (US$44.5 million original loan allocation; US$5.8 million
disbursed)
This component is rated satisfactory, despite the fact that only US$5.8 million of the US$44.5 million
original loan allocation was expensed. The difference is largely explained by the shift in project strategy as
described above. In 1995, at the request of the Borrower, loan allocation to this component was
substantially reduced. The new strategy was to focus on the institutional and regulatory reform efforts, and
leave the institutional development programs to the incoming private operators.
The expected outcomes of the component included commercialization of services, operational
improvements, and well trained utility staff. The expected outcomes were thus achieved not by investing
in the existing public utilities but by supporting the privatization process. As mentioned before, five
utilities (sub-borrowers) were privatized under the project. In most cases, one of the first things that the
private operators did after they took over the services was to retain and/or hire capable staff and improve
the commercial operation, as demonstrated in the marked improvements in collection rates and accounts
receivables (see Annex 3).
4.2.2 Rehabilitation and Expansion of systems (US$50 million original loan allocation; US$37.6 million
disbursed)
These components are rated satisfactory. The expected outputs were to increase the service coverage and
improve service quality. The project financed works in seven provinces and municipalities. The project's
physical objectives in most cases were substantially met or exceeded the original targets, except for the
Misiones subcomponent in which many of the planned works were not implemented during the project
execution period. As a result as shown in Tables 2-4, of Annex 1, all sub-borrowers increased their water
and sewerage services substantially during the project implementation period. Most of the subprojects
suffered start-up delays because of the weak execution capacity at the local level. However, when the
utilities were privatized mid-way through project implementation, about US$25 mnillion of the loan
proceeds were transferred to the private operators which, in most cases, successfully completed the planned
works. In the case of la Rioja and Misiones subcomponents, subloan allocation for works were partially or
fully canceled, while the project focused its effort to support the privatization of the water utilities. Most of
the unfinished works constitute a part of the concession contracts, and will be implemented regardless of
Bank financing. Furthermore, with legally binding concession contracts and sector regulatory frameworks
put in place as a result of the project, we expect that the service quality and efficiency will be much better
controlled.
4.2.3 Preparation of other studies and preparation of engineering designs by the water utilities (US$4
million original loan allocation; US$9.4 million disbursed)
- 4 -



This component is rated highly satisfactory. The expected outcomes of this component went beyond what
was envisaged at appraisal. Instead of financing master plans, feasibility studies, and carrying out research
studies to be used by the existing public utilities, the project financed consulting services to prepare
technical and financial background studies, bidding documents, concession contracts, and regulatory
frameworks for the privatization of the provincial utilities. The component also financed setting up an
appropriate regulatory framework for the cooperatives. Such shift in project implementation strategy
resulted in a more lasting institutional change. The specific outcomes achieved by this component in
beneficiary provinces and municipalities are summarized in Annex I Table 1.
4.2.5 Improvement of COFAPyS (later ENOHSA) operations (US$1.5 million loan allocation; US$0.2
million disbursed)
This component is rated unsatisfactory. The component aimed at strengthening the executing agency,
initially COFAPyS and later ENOHSA which replaced COFAPyS. With frequent changes in the
management of COFAPyS and ENOHSA, and lack of clarity regarding its mission, this component was not
implemented fully. The project focused more on providing financial and technical assistance to the
provincial and municipal governments by hiring extemal consultants, rather than strengthening
COFAPyS/ENOHSA's role in providing such assistance. Since most of the consultants have left
ENOHSA since then, ENOHSA is left with limited intemal capacity for providing such support. It is
important to note, however, that the project did contribute to developing the sector capacity indirectly, as
many of the consultants who worked under the project became top executives of the private water utilities.
4.2.6 Strengthening the Capacity of the Borrower for Policy Formulation and Implementation (no
allocation originally; US$3.1 million disbursed)
This component is rated highly satisfactory. As discussed in Section 3.4, this component was added in
1997 to reflect the changing priorities of the Government, and in an effort to develop the Borrower's
capacity to formulate and implement sector policies. The activities financed by this component included:
(i) National Plan for Water and Sanitation; (ii) National Information System of Water and Sanitation
Sector (SPIDES); (iii) technical assistance for privatization; (iv) technical assistance to resolve
post-privatization problems; and (v) technical assistance and training to strengthen the water sector
regulatory agencies.
By 1999, more than half of the urban population in Argentina was receiving water supply and sewerage
services from utilities with some form of private sector participation. The National Government needed
further development of its capacity not only to provide technical assistance to the privatization process in
the provinces, but also to support emerging post-privatization issues, which included weak regulatory
capacity, difficult contract renegotiation, premature termination of the concession contracts. This
component was pivotal for the National Government to develop and exercise such a capacity. One example
is the technical assistance to ETOSS, the regulatory agency of the Buenos Aires Concession, in preparation
for the first five year review of the concession contract. Another example is the technical support the
project provided in an effort to resolve problems with the Tucuman water concession, and later through
financing of the interim management team of the Tucuman water company after the early termination of the
concession contract. The project also funded the training seminars for the sector regulators, organized
jointly with UADE, an Argentine University of Business, and WBI. The seminars were successful with
four hundred people in attendance, and received high evaluation rating on course materials and instructors.
The course materials developed for these seminars are now being used in other Latin American countries.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
No specific economic rates of return were calculated at the time of Appraisal. Instead, all investment
projects to be financed out of the line of credit were expected to have the internal rates of return of more
than 12% to become eligible. Other expected economic benefits included higher water sales and cost
savings resulting from the investmnents to promote efficiency, a more rational tariff policy, lower
consumption, and reduced water loses thanks to metering.
The project's economic benefits were substantial, especially when we consider the economic benefits from
the utility privatization. In all utilities privatized under the project, a more rational tariff structure based on
metered consumption was introduced. Consumers also benefited from lower tariffs in the provinces of
Santa Fe, Formosa, and Misiones, because concessions were awarded based on tariff discounts. In the case
of Misiones, a detailed cost-benefit analysis to measure the economic impact of the reforrn (privatization
via concession and the establishment of a provincial regulatory entity) was prepared as a part of the
preparation of a follow-up project. According to the analysis, economic value of the reform was estimated
at US$16 million with an internal rate of return of 17%. The fiscal impact of the reform was estimated to
be even larger with a NPV of US$28 million.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No specific financial rates of return were calculated at the time of Appraisal. Instead, selected financial
indicators were used as eligibility criteria. The indicators included operational ratio, debt service coverage
ratio, collection rates and return on assets. Table 1 of Annex 3 shows the financial indicators before and
after the project/utility reform. Most financial indicators improved, except for the debt ratios in Santa Fe
private utility which obtained a large sum of external credits to finance the investment program.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional development impact was substantial. The project contributed significantly in helping the local
governments in changing their roles from that of service providers to policy setters. Under the project, five
provincial utilities were privatized in the form of long-term concession. These concessions cover an
aggregate population of 2.8 million. Two additional utilities which received the project's technical
assistance, covering an aggregate population of 230,000 were subsequently privatized in the form of
long-term concessions. In addition, 11 provincial and municipal regulatory frameworks were drafted under
the project of which eight were approved and are in effect. A summary of the institutional and regulatory
reform programs financed under the project is presented in Annex 1. Furthermore, the project also helped
develop the policy formulation and backstopping capacity at the Federal level, through establishment of the
National Water Sector Information System (SPIDES), development of guidelines and standard documents
for regulatory frameworks, tariff regime, concession contracts, concession bidding documents, and a
poverty strategy for the sector.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were no major factors outside the control of government or implementation agency that affected the
project's outcome.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project suffered major delays mainly due to the following factors: (a) institutional, operational and
commercial difficulties of several agencies that hindered their eligibility; (b) lack of interest by several
sub-borrowers in making changes in the institution; (c) sub-borrowers' lack of managerial/administrative
capacity to execute projects; (d) different policies in different borrower provinces both in general terms and
specifically at sectoral level; (e) the fact that nearly half of the loan (44%) proceeds were allocated to a
- 6 -



single province which faced major implementation problems. Many of these difficulties were overcome by
the shift in the project strategy from that of public utility strengthening to private sector participation,
combined with reallocation of loan proceeds, and a more intense technical support by the project executing
unit.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The implementing agency's capacity was evaluated during project preparation and found to be weak, in
terms of project management, financial management, project evaluation, and other administrative
procedures. The weaknesses were to be overcome through staff training and the hiring of experts financed
by the project. With the help of experts, COFAPyS/ENOHSA has established the standard procedures for
project evaluation. The agency, however, continued to suffer from frequent changes in management and
occasional political interference, which often hindered timely execution of the subprojects and prevented the
long-term capacity building of the agency.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The cost changes were significant. Actual cost was 56% of the figure estimated at appraisal, due mainly to
the partial loan cancellation of US$36 million in 1998. The major part of the US$36 million corresponded
to the amount allocated to the provincial water utility of Misiones. The US$50 million Misiones water and
sewerage project was requested by the National Government to mitigate the negative environmental impact
to be caused by the construction of Yacyreta hydroelectric dam, and was appraised in 1994 by the Bank as
an independent project. Considering the fact that more than half of the Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
loan remained uncommnitted at the time, the Government and the Bank agreed to finance the Misiones works
through the ongoing loan. Although the engineering design of the works worth US$50 million and a master
plan were prepared, the implementation of the works faced major delays. During a supervision mission in
1997, the Bank found the provincial water utility financially, technically and operationally not capable of
implementing the works in a timely manner, and communicated the findings to the provincial and the
Federal govemment authorities. After an intensive discussion among the Provincial government, Federal
government, and the Bank, it was agreed that the best solution would be for the provincial government to
accelerate the privatization of the public utility in the form of a 30 year concession. At the request of the
government, therefore, US$36 million of the loan was canceled, with an understanding that once the utility
is privatized, the works will be implemented by the private operator with a grant financing from the
National Government.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the project is rated likely.
At the provincial level, the sustainability of the institutional and regulatory reforms supported by the
project is highly likely. The water utilities were privatized in the form of long-term concession (mostly 30
years). Continued performance improvements of the utilities are also likely, given the autonomy and
financial health of the concessioned services, and the regulatory frameworks and contracts that ensure
service quality and standards. By project closing, more than 60% (nearly 70%, if we include cooperatives)
of Argentina's urban population were being served by private operators. Provinces will most likely
continue with the institutional and regulatory reform, as evidence by the interests shown by provinces in
seeking technical assistance support of the newly approved Water Sector Reform Loan (Loan 4484-AR, a
US$70 million Adaptable Program Lending approved by the Board in June 1999).
- 7 -



At the national level, in addition to continuing to support sector reform at the provincial and municipal
level, the Government will likely focus its effort in improving the existing PSP models, and solving the
emerging post-privatization issues, including the weak regulatory capacity, slow extension of services to
the poor (urban and rural) and unclear environmental standards.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not applicable.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during project preparation stage is rated less than satisfactory. The project was
prepared by a multi-disciplinary team with additional inputs from sector experts. The project preparation
team conducted a detailed analysis of the financial and administrative capacity COFAPyS, the
implementing agency, and an ambitious plan to turn it into a self-sustaining and independent sector
financing agency. It also developed the comprehensive credit regulations which specified eligibility criteria
and other rules for the Bank financed line of credit to be administered by COFAPyS.
In hindsight, however, the project team could have spent more time in developing a sector strategy and a
more adequate financing model, and in assessing the sub-borrower capacity and demand. When the project
was prepared and appraised, the country was going through an economic crisis (hyperinflation, etc) and a
rather dramatic change in government. The new Menem administration during 1989-90 was struggling
with its battle against inflation, and had embarked on a program to privatize some of the federal public
enterprises. At that time, water companies had not yet been targeted for privatization, and the sector
strategy was not clear. In addition, some federal authorities did not support the institutional arrangements
for the project, i.e., to make COFAPyS an independent financial agency responsible for financing public
urban water and sanitation utilities, in light of the obvious failure of similar institutions, such as the public
mortgage bank and the SME development bank.
The institutional capacity of the provincial utilities and thus demand for the loan was significantly
overestimated. Although the Bank was working with some of the larger provinces -- Buenos Aires, Santa
Fe, and Cordoba -- through an ongoing loan (Loan 2461-AR), there was very little information of the state
of other smaller provincial utilities. The participation of IDB in the program, which doubled the size of it
(from a US$200 million program to a US$400 million program), also contributed to the over-dimensioning
of the programn. As a result, the loan had very limited disbursements until late 1995, almost four years
after signing of the loan.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance is considered mixed. As discussed earlier, the project suffered major
startup delays. Nonetheless, the Bank supervision missions were less frequent in the earlier years
(1993-1994), and Bank task managers changed several times during the period. In hindsight, a more
frequent mission, a more stable supervision team, combined with a more proactive stance could have
accelerated the project implementation.
Starting in late 1994 and 1995, the Bank intensified its supervision efforts in order to accelerate the pace of
project implementation. In 1995 five supervision missions were carried out, compared with an average of
two missions per year before that. At the recommendation of the Bank supervision team, the project
- 8 -



executing unit was strengthened with a new coordinator supported by a group of expert consultants. The
decision was made to focus on a selected number of water companies, instead of diverting efforts on
potential participants. Around the same time, faced with severe fiscal deficits exacerbated by the Tequila
crisis, many provincial governments started to consider concessioning of water utilities, one of the actions
included in a series of Fiscal Pacts signed between the federal and provincial governments during
1992-1994. Reflecting such a trend, the Bank supervision team shifted its emphasis away from the
traditional institutional strengthening program, to the support for privatization of the public utilities.
The Bank supervision team acted proactively in the later years of project implementation, as demonstrated
by the shift in strategy as mentioned above, the cancellation of a substantial amount of loan allocated to the
province of Misiones (described more in detail under section 5.4), immediate support to the province of
Tucuman, when it faced early termination of concession, support to ETOSS, the regulatory agency for the
Buenos Aires water concession, with the first five-year review of the contract, and the organization of a
training course for the sector regulators.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance is rated marginally satisfactory, despite less-than-satisfactory performance
during preparation and early years of supervision. The Bank responded well to the changing Government
priorities, and in the end, achieved the project objectives with less financing.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower perfornance during project preparation is considered mixed. Although the Borrower was
committed to the project, the Borrower's executing agency (then COFAPyS), which had mainly worked on
rural water projects, had a very limited experience in dealing with the urban water supply and sanitation
projects. Although such weakness was somewhat overcome by the hiring of external consultants, it
contributed to the eventual delays in the project start-up.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's implementation performance was also mixed. During the course of the project
implementation, the line Ministry responsible for water and sanitation sector (and thus for COFAPyS and
ENOHSA) changed several times. At appraisal, it was the Ministry of Public Works that was responsible
for the sector. The responsibilities were then changed several times to Secretariat of Public Works under
the Ministry of Economy, and then to the Secretariat of Natural Resources, then to the Secretariat of Public
Works under the Ministry of Infrastructure. Reflecting such changes in the Government, COFAPyS and
later ENOHSA suffered frequent changes in top management. Needless to say, such frequent changes were
highly disruptive to the Project's performance.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Implementing agency's performance is considered marginally satisfactory. COFAPyS, a relatively new
institution at the time of appraisal (created in 1988), overtime became an overstaffed institution that did not
function well. COFAPyS suffered political interference in its day-to-day operations, including staffing and
lending policy. The main problem was its institutional structure, with its board of directors comprising
provincial government representatives with different interests. In 1995, to correct the problem, the
Govemment decided to abolish COFAPyS and replaced it by ENOHSA. ENOHSA was subject to less
political interference, as the new institutional model separated the policy formulation and the sector
financing functions, by creating a separate entity, COFESA for policy setting. It also reduced the number
of employees substantially through voluntary retirement plans and not renewing contracts for consultants.
-9-



Today, ENOHSA is a much slimmer and more technical organization with much less political interference.
Much of the difficulties faced by COFAPyS and ENOHSA were also due to resistance and weak capacity
of the provincial utilities. The fact that COFAPyS initially had only limited experience in dealing with
urban water and sanitation projects (the predecessor of COFAPyS focused on rural water supply) did not
help its interface with the provincial utilities. Such difficulties were somewhat overcome with the hiring of
external consultants with such experiences, which provided semi-annual and annual project progress
reports to the Bank.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated marginally satisfactory. Although Borrower performance in the last
years of project implementation improved, the frequent political interference and inexperienced executing
agency during project preparation stage and in the earlier stage of project implementation made it difficult
for the project to be implemented smoothly.
8. Lessons Learned
Project Design
Subproject identification and selection. The project suffered major delays because: (i) the demand for the
Loan was overestimated, (ii) incentives for the provincial utilities to carry out institutional reform was not
clear; and (iii) the project faced various administrative difficulties in processing the subloan agreements
with provincial utilities. The project was designed as a demand driven line of credit. However, an
assessment of demand for the loan was not sufficiently carried out, and subprojects were not well identified
during project preparation. Partly because of the lack of efforts by the project executing unit to create
demand (promote the project concept, disseminate the project objectives and rules, etc.), and partly because
of the lack of interest and incentive of the provincial utilities to strengthen its capacity and to become more
efficient, demand for the project was much lower than expected. Furthermore, once identified, public
utilities had limited capacity in identifying and implementing investment projects. A detailed preparatory
work could have ensured that the project is front-loaded with a significant pipeline of subprojects at loan
effectiveness. Provision of technical assistance to prepare the engineering projects on grant basis also
could have helped accelerate project implementation.
Subloan allocation. Subloan allocation and reallocation mechanisms were too rigid. The investments to be
financed by the loan could have been competitively allocated, driven by demand. The project could have
had a mechanism where if a subloan remains unused for a certain period, it can be reallocated to other
subprojects. In addition, a supply driven approach to loan allocation resulted in strong initial resistance by
the public utilities for any kind of institutional reform. Furthermore, the allocation of nearly half of the
loan in a single subproject resulted in a large cancellation of the loan. The risk, including the capacity of
the local executing agency could have been analyzed better.
Project Implementation
Local govenmuent procurement process. Local governments interfered frequently in procurement, thereby
paralyzing the processes. A clear understanding about the Bank's procurement process should be achieved
prior to subloan allocation. This was overcome once private operator started implementing the subprojects.
Monitoring indicators. Although detailed monitoring indicators were designed at appraisal, and were
- 10-



included in the subloan agreements, these were not well collected or followed closely. The privatization
process made it hard for the executing agency and the Bank supervision team to collect and follow these
indicators. More effort should have been made to follow the indicators more closely.
Project Execution Unit. The project execution unit at COFAPyS and later at ENOHSA consisted mainly
of external consultants. The qualified team of consultants helped the project execution, and ensured the
continuity of the project through several changes in the management of these institutions. Such an
arrangement, however, failed to transfer project knowledge, administrative know-how's to the permanent
staff of COFAPyS and ENOHSA.
Sector Policy Lessons
Institutional strengthening programs. Institutional strengthening programs for public utilities has proved to
be ineffective. Due mainly to the lack of incentive mechanism and/or culture of expand and spend, public
utilities showed little interest in improving their operational efficiency. A major institutional reform - in
the case of the project, privatization - was needed to reform these utilities.
Private Sector Participation
*   Strong political commitment to reform from the top level of the government is important
*   Hasty PSP with poor preparation and lack of competition may make things worse (Tucuman,
Argentina). Proactive action and support by the National Government to solve the problems and to
promote PSP processes in general could be key to establishing investor confidence in the sector.
* PSP without a sound regulatory framework and capable regulators can jeopardize its success. Major
efforts to train and develop regulators are required, preferably before PSP transactions are completed.
* Where politically feasible and economically efficient, multi-sector regulatory agency at the provincial
level is encouraged, instead of a single sector regulatory agency for every water concession.
* Credible dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration, must be included in the PSP contracts.
* A study to review and develop efficient dispute resolution mechanisms that work in Argentina's judicial
system will be financed through the recently signed follow-up project (Loan 4484-AR).
* Standard clauses on arbitration should be included in the concession contracts.
* The gradual approach to privatization, combined with targeted subsidies for service connections for the
poor, may work well, where there is a clear strategy by the government as in the case of Chile and a
strong institutional base on which to build.
* The Federal Govermment's support (with Bank financing and technical assistance) to the local
governments during transition -- on regulation, public policy formulation, training, initial investment
support, strategy for the poor, issues regarding environment -- proved to be essential for the
sustainability of the institutional and regulatory reform.

See Annex 8.
(b) Cofinanciers:
IDB financed a part of the sector Program, called "PRONAPAC" by the Borrower, which included the
IBRD-financed Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Project. The IDB and IBRD projects were executed in
parallel with separate project execution units. In no case IDB and IBRD financed a same sub-project
- 11 -



jointly. The IDB portion of the Loan was fully disbursed to 16 water utilities. Except for a few cases, IDB
portion mainly financed municipal utilities and cooperatives of smaller cities. Although IDB portion also
supported private sector participation and regulatory reform at the local government level, it had much less
emphasis on sector policy reform at the Federal level. The two institutions occasionally exchanged
information, but rarely performed supervision missions together. Although collaboration between the two
institutions improved towards the end of the project, a closer collaboration from the outset could have been
beneficial in aligning the program strategies and overcoming implementation difficulties.

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Partially Financed by the World Bank
July 2000
1- Background
The National Program for the Optimization, Rehabilitation and Expansion of Drinking Water and
Sewerage Services (PRONAPAC) was a Global Credit Program cofinanced by the World Bank and the
Interamerican Development Bank. The contribution promised by the World Bank was equivalent to
US$100 million. The Loan Agreement was signed on August 13, 1991, and effectiveness conditions were
fulfilled on March 12, 1993.
On March 3, 1998 a US$36 million reduction was made, so that the total Loan was set at US$64 million.
The closing date was January 31, 2000 -approximately 8-1/2 years after the signing date and 6 years and
10 months after the Credit became effective- for the subloans financed by funds from Loan 328 1-AR, and
April 30 of the same year for investments under Category 9 of the Project, with the objective of financing
until that date a number of expenses related to the preparation of Loan 4484-AR.
Total disbursements requested from the Bank were US$56,200,000.
The preparation of the ICR is based upon the Staff Appraisal Report, correspondence and the Bank's
Aide-Memoires, and working information in ENOHSA.
ENHOSA's current administration took office on December 16, 1999, and therefore the entire management
of PRONAPAC corresponded to the previous administration. Therefore, the observations expressed in this
report respond to documentary references representative of the previous administration.
2- General Part- Origin; Benefits and Risks of the Project
2.1 Origin of the Project
-23-



The Project originated from conversations that began in 1983 between the National Government and the
Bank, aimed at formulating and implementing a reform program for the Sanitation Sector. As a result of
this dialogue, the first project financed by the Bank for the drinking water and sewer supply sector was
formulated: Loan 2641-AR, approved in December 1985.
Based on the experience gained and the data and recommendations of the sector study that was prepared to
give continuity to the process of modernizing the sector's activities and extending service coverage- the
PRONAPAC Project was formulated.
The assistance foreseen in the Project was aimed at strengthening the sector's organizations, increasing
efficiency in water use and decentralizing services. All of this was based on the commitment of providers
to implement policies that would permit the self-generation of funds for the modernization and expansion of
the system, as well attracting funds in capital markets.
2.2 Anticipated benefits
It was estimated that the project would have economic, fiscal, social and environmental benefits. Economic
benefits are considered as increased income from sales stemming from the expansion of services and cost
savings resulting from investments aimed at promoting efficiency. By promoting the metering of water
consumption, the Project would facilitate the saving of wasted water at a production cost of around 15% of
the marginal costs which would require increasing production capacity. With tariff levels nearing this
marginal cost, the investments made for metered service would have a high cost-benefit ratio.
It was also foreseen that investments in operational improvements and adequate maintenance systems
would make it possible to increase the system's capacity to provide services to more clients, at a cost
equivalent to one-fifth of that of constructing new installations.
The accumulated fiscal benefits in excess of the funds needed to cover the operating costs of service
providers, as well as clients' contributions, would begin to replace income from national taxes allocated to
the sector.
The most important social benefits were considered the expansion of service coverage to lower-income
social groups and the creation ofjobs in project-related activities. Likewise, tariffs would be gradually
replaced by others based on metered consumption, making it possible to subsidize low-income users who, it
was estimated, would also have new levels of consumption.
Environmental benefit would occur as a consequence of the introduction of a discipline for the preparation
of environmental impact studies in projects financed by the former CoFAPyS, now ENOHSA.
Environmental benefits were also expected, stemming from investments aimed at reducing water
consumption and the volume of waste utilized.
2.3 Risks in execution
The principal risks anticipated in project execution were of a financial, institutional and political nature.
Financial risk was related to the lack of timely availability of local contributions and the risk of changes in
the exchange rate. It was estimated that this risk would be diminished by the emphasis on investments in
components aimed at increasing the financial viability of the sector's service providers and on the
requirement for small local counterpart contributions. In addition, it was recognized that the management
- 24 -



of agencies that lacked experience and were subject to tariffs established by provincial authorities,
represented a substantial challenge.
The institutional risks to the Project's success depended on the capacity of the former CoFAPyS to grant
credits according to criteria agreed with the Bank and on the capacity of provincial enterprises to deal with
institutional reform, carry out the rehabilitation of existing installations and deal with adequate
maintenance plans.
Finally, there were the political risks that were expected to be decreased by the National Government's
decision to increase the efficiency of the public sector and improve finances at national, provincial and
municipal levels.
3- Project Objectives and Description
3.1 Proiect Objectives
The Project's general objectives were the following:
(i) to improve the efficiency, financial viability, coverage and quality of drinking water and sewerage
services in the country's urban centers with over 15,000 inhabitants, while at the same time protecting the
environment;
(ii) to strengthen the institutional performance of CoFAPyS (now ENOHSA) and of sub-borrowers; and
(iii) to encourage the participation of private capital in the water and sanitation sector.
3.2 Proiect Description
The Program consisted of an overall line of credit to grant, through the former CoFAPyS, subloans to
entities in charge of providing drinking water and sewerage services that were eligible in accordance with
the Credit Regulation approved by the international agencies that were financing the Program: the World
Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank.
Using the Program's resources, subloans were expected to be granted for five types of activities:
*   Type A: Projects for the operational improvement of the Program's beneficiary entities, including
procurement of goods and services for institutional development, marketing of services, operational and
physical improvements, staff training and studies for better participation of private capital;
*   Type B: Projects for the improvement, optimization and rehabilitation of drinking water and sewerage
systems;
*   Type C: Projects for the expansion and execution of new drinking water and sewerage works;
*   Type D: Preparation of master plans and feasibility studies; designs for drinking water and sewerage
works; environmental impact studies and applied research for the improvement of systems; and
*   Type E: Support to the operational activity of the former CoFAPyS, now ENOHSA, which included
training of its staff.

The World Bank later authorized the allocation of resources to prepare a National Sanitation Plan for a
total of US$9 million, creating a special category for this purpose.
4- Subloans: Description, Objectives and Results.
Under World Bank Loan 3281-AR, 8 subloans were financed with the following objectives and results:
4.1 General Administration of Sanitation Works of Formosa- (AGOSF):
Initial loan: US$4.5 million
Disbursements: US$2.7 million
* Objectives
a) To provide technical assistance for the transforrnation of the Basic Sanitation Sector in the Province
of Formosa, including support for the creation of a Regulatory Agency for the services to be awarded;
b) To execute works to improve drinking water services in the city of Formosa; and
c) To perform environmental studies aimed at defining the sewage treatment and disposal system.
* Evaluation
The investment plan foreseen at the beginning of the Project was partially complied with, since
some lack of definition in government policy, as well as dissension between the Executive Branch
and the Legislature, kept this plan's investments from being completed.
Nevertheless, in general, the Project's overall objectives were met, as indicated below:
1. The Province's Regulatory Agency for Public Works and Services was created in 1995.
2. Provincial services were awarded in the cities of Formosa and Clorinda. Later, services in the latter
locality were sub-awarded Aguas de Formosa S.A. to the local electrical cooperative.
3. Works were carried out to expand the existing plant's potabilization capacity and to improve the
quality of service provided and to obtain greater service coverage.
Note should be made of the good performance of the provincial water service in the construction of
works in the city of Formosa.
4.2 Municipality of San Martin de los Andes - Province ofNeuquen
Initial loan: US$3.6 million
Disbursements: US$3.0 million
* Objectives
a) To carry out a study of alternatives for the design, creation and/or consolidation of a municipal
enviromnental sanitation organization and to define the environmental regulatory framework;
b) To carry out studies and projects for commercial improvement based on a cadaster of users and
definition of the drinking water and sewerage service tariff;
c) To carry out studies for the cadaster of networks and for the definition of a network intervention
system;
- 26 -



d)  To formulate the master plan for rainwater-sewer drainage and for solid waste disposal; and
e)  To rehabilitate and optimize drinking water installations and carry out complementary works in
sewerage networks.
* Evaluation
The objectives stipulated in the Subloan Agreement were met, i.e.:
1.  Municipal services were regulated and municipal sewerage services were awarded to the existing
cooperative in charge of providing drinking water.
2.  A tariff table was established, based upon metered consumption.
3.  The cadaster of users and the network intervention system were defined.
4.  A Master Plan was prepared.
5.  Water system rehabilitation works were executed, and 80% of the sewage collection system in the
inner city and surrounding neighborhoods, feeding the existing tertiary treatment plant, the construction of
which was financed by Province del Neuquen.
Nevertheless, the collection system could not be completed due to the failure of a bid because of
abusive prices and the IBRD's denial of a six-month extension to carry out a new public tender.
4.3 Provincial Sanitation Works Agency of La Rioia - Province of La Rioia
Initial loan: US$5.2 million
Disbursements: US$0.5 million
* Objectives
a)  To monitor the process of institutional transformation, including private participation in the provision
of drinking water and sewerage services under the responsibility of EPOSLAR;
b)  To update the cadaster of users and present network;
c)  To increase the capacity of providing services;
d)  To install micrometers for 100% of drinking water service users in the principal localities served by
the company;
e)  To optimize the drinking water systems of the localities of La Rioja, Chilecito and Chamical;
f)  To optimize the Province's systems that were not privatized.
* Evaluation
The Project's objectives were only minimally met since, according to information collected, there
was a lack of understanding between the Province's Executive Branch and the Legislature. This
produced a reduction in planned investments, reducing them to the financing of studies needed for
international bidding on the awarding of EPOSLAR's provincial services in the cities of La Rioja,
Chamical and Chilecito.
Currently, the company is privately managed, and services are expected to be awarded in the
second half of 2000.
4.4 SERVICOOP - Puerto Madrvn - Province of Chubut:
- 27 -



Initial loan: US$4.9 million
Disbursements: US$4.3 million
0   Objectives
a)  Commercial and operational improvement of the Cooperative, for the purpose of strengthening its
business development;
b)  Rehabilitation and optimization of drinking water and sewerage installations to expand coverage and
meet demand; and
c)  Formulation of a sewerage and effluent disposal master plan.
*   Evaluation
Most of the investment plan was complied with, i.e.:
1.  In terms of commerce, a management information system was developed, a telemetering system and
household meters were installed, and various equipment was purchased with the objective of providing the
Cooperative with modem management tools in accordance with the entity's needs.
2.  Drinking water and sewer rehabilitation and expansion works were carried out, making it possible to
improve and expand services.
3.  The sewer master plan was formulated.
Nevertheless, a certain imbalance in the Cooperative's financial management impeded the
proper completion of planned actions.
4.5 Provincial Bureau of Sanitation Works - Province of Santia o del Estero:
Initial loan: US$7.5 million
Disbursements: US$5.2 million
*   Objectives
a)  Technical assistance for the institutional transformation process of the provider-DIPOS- and the
awarding of drinking water and sewerage services to a private company. Definition of areas to be awarded,
and proposal of policies for the regulation of the future concession and of the provision of services that
remain the responsibility of the Province;
b)  Optimization of installations for conduction of the sewage collection system in the city of Santiago del
Estero;
c)  Carrying out environmental studies aimed at defining a sewage treatment and disposal system for the
city of Santiago del Estero.
*   Evaluation
The objectives were only partially met because, according to information collected: (i) there
were disagreements between the Province and the Program, and difficulties arose in the
international bidding for works, which motivated the extension of deadlines; (ii) conflicts with
the Contractor caused the contract to be rescinded; (iii) the closing of the Loan impeded the
financing of the balance to be executed.
- 28 -



The following were concluded:
I. Consultants' studies in support of the concession;
2. Services were awarded in 11 localities of the Province.
3. 73.8% of the sewer work for the city of Santiago del Estero. With this level of progress, the contract
cancellation occurred, to the detriment of the population.
4.6 Provincial Bureau of Sanitation Works - Province of Santa Fe
Initial credit: US$29.4 million
Disbursements: US$27.4 million
* Objectives
a) Technical assistance for the transformation of the sanitation sector at provincial level and the
awarding of services provided by DIPOS.
b) Execution of works to optimize and rehabilitate the water purification plant and distribution pipes of
Rosario's drinking water networks, as well as works to optimize and rehabilitate the water purification
plant of the cities of Rosario and Santa Fe.
* Evaluation
Objectives were met in accordance with commitments made:
1. The planned works were constructed.
2. The provincial service was awarded to private capital.
3. The design of the regulatory system was financed.
4.7 Provincial Sanitation Works Administration - Posadas - Misiones
Initial credit: US$44.4 million
Disbursements: US$6.64 million
* Objectives
First Stage:
Preparation of studies and designs for the Second Stage
Second Stage:
a) Strengthening of the Regulatory Agency.
b) Water works: optimization of the water purification plant and expansion of the water distribution
system.
c) Sewer works: IPRODHA Peninsula Collectors and household collectors .
d) Expansion of the drinking water system in Garupa and Candelaria. Installation of the drinking water
and sewer system in Villa Sarita.
* Evaluation
- 29 -



The First Stage was fully completed. With regard to the Second Stage, only the following
components were executed:
1. Strengthening of the Regulatory Agency.
2. Expansion of the drinking water system in Garupa and Candelaria. Installation of the drinking water
and sewer system in Villa Sarita.
Considering that this operation arose as a substitute for the commitment made in the Binational
Agreements signed for the construction of the Yacireta Hydroelectric Plan, the Loan's low
level of execution is due to the fact that, in light of the commitment made by the Federal
Govemnment, the Province of Misiones adopted a passive attitude with respect to the demands
of ENOHSA and the World Bank under the Program's framework, adjusting them to its
government plans.
In this regard, the provincial government delayed the legal transformation of APOS until after
the Provincial Bank, the insurance system and the electric company were privatized.
In 1998 the Government of Misiones and the National Executive Branch signed an Agreement
under which they agreed to request a new loan from IBRD (4484-AR) that would partially
finance the sanitation works of the cities of Posadas and Garupa.
4.8 National Sanitation Plan
4.8.1 Tripartite Regulatorv Agency- ETOSS -
Initial loan: US$0.56 million
Disbursements: US$0.56 million
* Objective
The loan was granted to finance the "Five-Year Review of Tariffs" called for in the Concession
Contract with Aguas Argentinas SA.
* Evaluation
All of the planned studies were completed.
4.8.20ther Consultancies
Disbursements: US$5.9 million
* Objective
Loan 3281-AR financed consulting firms who, together with the Project Preparation Team in the
Secretariat of Public Works and with Bank staff, performed a technical analysis of reform
programs for about 23 service providers. This program consisted of defining a strategy for private
sector participation, a regulatory framework for water and sanitation services, and bidding
documents for the awarding of services. It also included a technical analysis of the service
provided by each company, a proposal of service and investment objectives, and a financial and
economic feasibility analysis.
- 30 -



*   Evaluation
Consultants presented detailed estimates for 5-year investment programs - and service objectives -
that totaled US$382 million for the first 5-year period, and aggregated investments for a 30-year
horizon totaling approximately US$1.2 billion.
5- Borrower's Evaluation.
5.1 Evaluation of project obrectives. desizn and implementation.
The Project's overall objectives were well presented, even though the design for their implementation in the
field lacked sufficient flexibility and supervision that would ensure their full compliance.
In particular, the objective of strengthening the institutional performance of the executing agency and of
sub-borrowers was not met due to the large relative weight of the work of intemational consultants in the
Program's Executing Unit who were not related to the Entity, due to a lack of training of the regular staff (
on-the-job training) of agencies involved.
In addition, the encouragement of private capital participation in the water and sanitation sector turned out
to be indiscriminate, leading to situations of pressure and lack of foresight concerning undesirable collateral
results, such as due attention to deficient areas and to less profitable localities that were left out of the
model.
5.2 Evaluation of the borrower's performance and lessons learned.
The performance of the executing agency was excessively passive, relying heavily on ad hoc consultants
lacking sufficient experience in the sector, and with very limited guidance and supervision with respect to
sub-borrowers. These aspects indicate the need to strengthen, during future interventions, the
participation of regular staff and intensify supervision efforts and guidance to participants.
At the level of the provincial authorities responsible for jurisdictions in which subprojects were
implemented, there were -according to information collected- serious misunderstandings among
authorities and dissention and lack of definition regarding the implementation of policies -including
differences concerning the Program's objectives or passive attitudes - in many cases leading to delays that
kept planned investments from being completed. These aspects indicate the need to improve prior
political interaction with local authorities, agreeing a priori on the instruments to be applied and
expected results.
There were also imbalances among sub-borrowers, particularly in financial management and conflicts with
contractors, which also contributed to the fact than planned actions were not properly completed. These
aspects indicate the need to intensify training efforts and to adjust the supervision of proceedings for
the adjudication and contracting of works.
5.3 Evaluation of the performance of the Bank and other participants.
The World Bank's performance, in relation to that of the Interamerican Development Bank (cofinancier of
- 31 -



PRONAPAC), was inferior. It is felt that it would have been better for the Bank to have a local operating
office that could have carried out a more timely, better adjusted supervision of actions.
In effect, the Bank's technical assistance and supervision, through missions with multiple objectives and
with few members and of short duration, did not make it possible to properly transfer the important
know-how required in operations - of the scale, scope and level of innovation - as those proposed.
In addition, the passiveness of the above-mentioned local actors was facilitated by the intransigent attitude
of the Bank whose unilateral decisions led to several unfortunate interventions. In this regard, mention
could be made of the Bank's suggestion to cancel a large part of the works to be implemented in the city of
Posadas due to the presumed institutional and technical inabilities of those responsible for these works.
Moreover, the lack of flexibility in the final stages of execution -denial of a final extension- did not
permit several actions to be properly completed.

Y FOMENTO (B.I.R.F.)
Myrna ALEXANDER
S.                  D.
Me dirijo a Ud. a fin de hacerle Ilegar los comentarios que ha merecido la versi6n final del Informe
Final de Cierre del Programa Nacional de Optimizaci6n, Rehabilitaci6n y Ampliaci6n de los Servicios de
Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Cloacal (PRONAPAC) Prestarno BIRF No. 3281-AR.
Las areas tecnicas y directivas del ENOHSA han analizado el documento y comparten en gran
medida las conclusiones del Infonne. Sin embargo, existen algunas observaciones especificas y
aclaraciones que se resumen a continuacion:
En relaci6n al punto 4. "Cumplimiento de los Objetivos y Resultados", en particular 4.2.1 "Mejora
de las Operaciones Existentes", se estima que no resulta satisfactorio el hecho que s6lo fueron
desembolsados 5.8 rnillones de los US$44.5 millones de la asignaci6n original del prestamo. El excesivo
enfasis dado al objetivo de "promover la participaci6n del sector privado" hizo decaer mas alla de lo
conveniente el desarrollo de la componente "mejora de las operaciones existentes de entes de agua a
traves de desarrollo institucional, comercializaci6n de servicios, mejoramiento operacional y
entrenamiento ".
*      En relacion a los puntos 4.2.3 "Preparaci6n de otros estudios y preparaci6n de disenios de
ingenieria por los entes de agua" y 4.2.6"Refosamiento de la capacidad del prestatario para la formulaci6n
e implementaci6n de politicas", los montos desembolsados de US$9.4 millones (frente a US$ 4 millones de
asignaci6n original) y US$3.1 millones (sin asignaci6n original) hizo que la proporci6n del prestamo
dedicada a consultoria creciera mas alla de lo razonable frente al monto de inversiones, alcanzando mas del
22% del prestamo frente al 5,5 % originalmente previsto.
- 33 -



*      En relaci6n al punto 4.2.5 "Mejorar las operaciones de COFAPyS (posteriormente ENOHSA)",
iltimo parrafo, debe remarcarse que el "desarrollo indirecto" de capacidad en el sector que se menciona se
logr6 transfiriendola desde el sector oficial (que debia profundizar su rol de regulaci6n y control) hacia el
sector privado operador. Se entiende que esta circunstancia sumada a la falta de enfasis en el desarrollo de
esta componente obstaculiz6 mis que favorecer el proceso buscado de mejorar las operaciones del Ente
rector sectorial, ya que se capacit6 al sujeto de la regulaci6n y se desguarneci6 al cuerpo regulador.
*      En relaci6n al punto 4.5 "Impacto sobre el desarrollo institucional" se considera excesiva la
calificaci6n de "sustancial" que se asigna al resultado de este item. Al efecto debe tomarse en cuenta la
pobre performance que ha revelado la concesi6n llevada a cabo en la Provincia de Formosa. Asimismo, se
han magnificado los resultados alcanzados en aspectos tales como la ayuda para el desarrollo de una"
estrategia para el sector careciente".
*      En relaci6n al punto 6.1 "Bases para la Calificaci6n de Sustentabilidad", en el cual se expresa"...
Las provincias muyprobablemente contintuen con la reforma institucionaly regulatoria, como se
evidencia por el interes mostrado por las provincias en buscar apoyo de asistencia tecnica del nuevo
prestamo aprobad... ", se hace notar que la mayoria de las solicitudes de apoyo recibidas hacen referencia a
situaciones que no hacen a la voluntad de privatizar nuevos servicios sino a dar soluci6n a problemas
emergentes de las privatizaciones ya realizadas. Por otra parte, la aseveraci6n que "En el nivel provincial,
la sustentabilidad de las reforrnas institucionales y regulatorias sostenidas por el proyecto es altamente
probable" no se ve confirmada por los problemas evidenciados en la concesi6n de la Provincia de Formosa
antes mencionada.
Como resumen de lo expuesto, y a fin de completar las "lecciones aprendidas" incluyendo el punto
de vista del Prestatario, cabe compartir lo expresado en el ultimo parrafo del punto 6.1, en el sentido que
"...el Gobiemo focalizara su esfuerzo en mejorar los modelos existentes de participacion del sector privado,
en resolver los problemas emergentes de la post-privatizaci6n, incluyendo la debil capacidad regulatoria y
la lenta expansion de los servicios a las areas carecientes (urbanas y rurales)..." con la salvedad, que dada
las escasas oportunidades de privatizaci6n remanentes en el pais, deberia agregarse enfaticamente la
necesidad de retomar durante el transcurso del nuevo Prestamo la estrategia de apoyar a los entes puiblicos
de servicios para mejorar su operaci6n, de manera de poder expandir la cobertura del servicio y mejorar la
calidad del suministro de agua y servicios cloacales, objetivos primordiales de todo el programa de
cooperaci6n entre la Argentina y el Banco Mundial para este sector.
Sin otro particular, saludo a Ud. muy atentamente,

Borrower's Comments on ICR - Unofficial Translation
ENOHSA Note No. 137
January 17, 2001
Ms. Myrna Alexander
Director
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay
World Bank
Re: Loan 3281-AR Comments to ICR
I am writing to provide you our comments on the final draft of the Implementation Completion Report of
the Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Programa Nacional de Optimizaci6n, Rehabilitaci6n y
Ampliaci6n de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Cloacal PRONAPAC -- Loan 3281-AR).
ENOHSA's management and technical teams analyzed the document and in general share the conclusions
of the Report. However, there are some specific observations and clarifications that we would like to
make:
*      In relation to Section 4. "Achievement of Objectives and Outputs", in particular 4.2.1
"Improvements of Existing Operations", we consider that this component was not satisfactory, as only
US$5.8 million out of the original allocation of US$44.5 million was disbursed. Excessive emphasis
placed on the objective to "promote private sector participation" discouraged, more than necessary, the
efforts to "improve existing operations of the water companies through institutional development,
commercialization of services, operational improvements, and training".
*      In relation to Section 4.2.3 "Preparation of other studies and preparation of engineering designs by
the water utilities" and Section 4.2.6 "Strengthening the Capacity of the Borrower for Policy Formulation
and Implementation", the amount disbursed of US$9.4 million (compared with the US$4 million original
allocation) and US$3.1 million (compared with no original allocation), respectively. This made the
consulting services component much larger than reasonable, in comparison to the amount of investments,
reaching 22% of the Loan, as compared with the 5.5% of the Loan as originally foreseen.
*      In relation to Section 4.2.5 "Improvement of COFAPyS (later ENOHSA) operations", the last
sentence which says that "the project contributed to developing the sector capacity indirectly, as many of
the sector officials who worked under the project became top executives of the private water utilities", must
be cast in different light. We understand that this circumstance created an impediment, not a favor, to the
institutional development of the leading sector agencies, as it created the capacity in the regulated entities,
leaving the regulators unprepared.
*      In relation to Section 4.5 "Institutional Development Impact", we consider that it is too much to
say there was "substantial" impact. We must consider the poor performance of the water concessionaire in
the province of Formosa. In the same vein, the report exaggerates the results achieved in aspects such as
the support it provided to the development of a "sector strategy for low income population".
*      In relation to Section 6.1 "Rationale for sustainability rating", in which you mention "...Provinces
- 35 -



will most likely continue with the institutional and regulatory reform, as evidence by the interests shown by
provinces in seeking technical assistance support of the newly approved Water Sector Reform Loan...", the
major part of the requests are not for the privatization of services but for providing solutions to the
problems emerging from the past privatizations. On the other hand, your statement that "At the provincial
level, the sustainability of the institutional and regulatory reforms supported by the project is highly likely",
is not substantiated if you consider the problems faced by the Province of Formosa.
In summary, and to complement the lessons learned from the point of view of the Borrower, we share what
is expressed in the last paragraph of Section 6.1, "...the Government will likely focus its effort in irnproving
the existing PSP models, and solving the emerging post-privatization issues, including the weak regulatory
capacity, slow extension of services to the poor (urban and rural)..." Given the decreasing opportunities for
privatization in the rest of the country, we should, through the new Loan, revisit the strategy to support
public utilities to improve its operation, so they can increase service coverage and improve the quality of
water supply and sewerage service provision, the primordial objective of all the programs of cooperation
between the Government of Argentina and the World Bank for this sector.
