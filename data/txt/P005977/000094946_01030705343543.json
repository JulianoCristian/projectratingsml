Project sustainability is rated likely.\n            Overall World Bank performance is rated marginally\n            satisfactory, despite less-than-satisfactory performance\n            during preparation and early years of supervision. The Bank\n            responded well to the changing Government priorities, and in\n            the end, achieved the project objectives with less\n            financing. Similarly, overall Borrower performance is rated\n            marginally satisfactory. Although Borrower performance in\n            the last years of project implementation improved, the\n            frequent political interference and inexperienced executing\n            agency during the project preparation stage and in the\n            earlier stage of project implementation made it difficult\n            for the project to be implemented smoothly. Lessons learned\n            pointed to problems with project design, specifically\n            sub-project identification and selection, and sub-loan\n            allocation and reallocation mechanisms; project\n            implementation problems such as local government\n            interference with the procurement process, the privatization\n            processes' interference with collecting and following\n            monitoring indicators, and the failure of the transfer of\n            knowledge and know-how from the qualified and effective team\n            of consultants to the permanent staff; and sector policy\n            problems like ineffective institutional strengthening\n            programs for public utilities. Other lessons concerned\n            private sector participation (PSP) and included the need for\n            the government's political commitment to regulatory refor"}, "docdt": "2001-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
