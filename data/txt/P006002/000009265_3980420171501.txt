MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERN3ATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A FIRST HOUSING SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Government of the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$300.0
million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
15 years, including five years of grace, with interest at the Bank's
standard variable rate.
2.       Background.  The unmet housing demand in Argentina is estimated to
be as high 2.5 million units  and  is  growing.   Demand for new housing is
increasing at 220,000 units per annum, but only about 80,000 were built in
1986. The need is especially acute among the lower-income population.
Low-income housing is currently financed by the Secretariat of Housing and
Environmental Management (SVOA) and the National Mortgage Bank (BHN). SVOA
allocates the funds from FONAVI (National Housing Fund) to the Provincial
Housing Institutes (IPVs) for the execution of housing programs. The
construction of houses is undertaken by private construction firms selected
by the concerned IPV under competitive  bidding.   FONAVI is funded by a 52
earmarked tax on salaries and an income levy on the self-employed. In
recent years, some 28,000 FONAVI houses have been completed annually.
FONAVI has been inefficiently managed and has targetted beneficiaries
poorly. On average, the FONAVI houses have been costly (about US$20,000
each)  and  have  taken  too   long   to  complete  (around  three  years).
Furthermore, only about 10? of the costs are recovered. Some corrective
measures were adopted with limited success in 1986/87 to address these
problems. Because of deficient programming and lower than expected tax
receipts, FONAVI funds for 1988 were overcommitted, leaving little room for
new investment. During the fifties and sixties, BHN was the main credit
institution for housing. Its importance declined in the seventies. A fall
in internal cash generation, only partial loan indexation and a high level
of inflation, decapitalized BUN almost totally, making it highly dependent
on Central Bank transfers. In connection with recent understandings on the
Banking Sector Loan, the Government has dscided to limit the rediscounts of
the Central Bank to BHN.    A  UNDP-funded housing sector study (July 1987)
identified a number of deficiencies in the sector and the Government is
keen to introduce far-reaching  sector  policy  reforms.   Knowledge of the
sector and of the need for new policies has been heightened by Bank work
during preparation of the Technical Assistance Project for Social Sector
Management. The Government agreed in November 1987 on the need for reforms
of socioeconomic, financial, technical and institutional policies of the
sector and requested urgent Bank assistance to fund a housing program
directed at lower-income segments of the housing market.
3.       The main  sector  problems  are  three:    (i)  Inefficient use of
FONAVI's earmarked resources with relatively few and expensive houses
produced  in  an  untimely  fashion.        There  is  little  incentive  for
construction companies to control costs and increase productivity through
innovative design and  construction  methods.    (ii) PONAVI's policies and



precedures have resulted in low recovery of investments. Both FONAVI's
salary tax and mortgage payments erode rapidly with the country's high
inflation rates and there is no incentive for families to save for houses.
(iii) The large built-in subsidies are poorly targeted and not transparent.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank involvement in the sector is
the logical culmination of several years of sector policy dialogue with the
Government, at a time when the sector is experiencing an acute shortage of
investment funds. The unmet demand for affordable low-income housing has
been rising, as a result of the disappearance of the long-term capital
market of housing funds and the insufficient supply of FONAVI housing. By
supporting far-reaching reforms of the sector's policies, the Bank would
endorse the Government's objective of redirecting public housing investment
to the low-income segments  of  the  housing  market.   The proposed sector
investment project would raise the productivity of scarce public funds,
improve capital recovery, strengthen SVOA's institutional capability and
rrovide the basis for the maintenance of a comprehensive housing policy
dialogue with the Government.    The  project  would also introduce private
savings for down payments as the fJrst step in the re-creation of a
voluntary savings system for housing.   It is expected that the renaissance
of a voluntary housing finance system would be further supported by the
Bank under a possible restructuring project for the Banco Hipotecario
Nacional (BHN).
5.       Project Objectives.  The  overall  objective  of the proposed loan
would be to support the Government in its efforts to reform its sectoral
policies. The main purposes of policy reforms are to increase productivity
of  the  housing  programs  financed   by  FONAVI,  improve  the  financial
performance of FONAVI and reduce subsidies and improve their targeting.
The project would achieve this through: (i) reducing unit cost and size of
FONAVI houses and the time required to build them; (ii) establishing
standard bidding procedures; (iii) improving the selection of beneficiaries
by establishing national and provincial registries; (iv) improving the
recovery of FONAVI loans through the introduction of a new mortgage
repayment system; (v) promoting and mobilizing family savings, with special
emphasis   on   the   participation   of   non-governmental  organizations;
(vi) redirecting, making more transparent and reducing housing sector
subsidies which will permit an increase in cost recovery from the current
level of 1O to an average recovery of 672, taking into account the home
improvement loans; and (vii) improving the administrative and financial
procedures of SVOA/FONAVI. As stated in its Policy Letter provided to the
Bank, over the longer term the Government intends to replace gradually
public sector resources by  private  funds.    In  this connection, a study
would be undertaken to consider the possibility of replacing the FONAVI
earmarked tax by general revenues.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project would include a package
of policy improvements, as evidenced in the Government Housing Policy
Letter, covering, inter alia: (i) the establishment of national and
provincial registries of potential beneficiaries in order to facilitate the
targetting  of  subsidies   and   selection   of  beneficiaries;  (ii)  the
introduction of new economical housing designs to lower unit costs; (iii)
the relaxation of such standards that unduly restrict innovative and more
economical housing designs; (iv) the introduction of improved and standard
bidding procedures; (v) the introduction of a new mortgage repayment system



to improve cost ,ecovery; (vi) the promotion of savings to be applied as
down payments; (vii) the establishment of transparent subsidies targetted
to the lowest income groups; and (viii) the introduction of a new system of
allocating FONAVI funds among provinces according to effective demand and
other factors, such as their repayment record and IPV's efficiency.
7.       The proposed loan will  finance  the  construction of about 39,000
two-bedroom houses; 20,500 three-bedroom houses; and the improvement and
rehabilitation of about 40,000 existing  houses.   On the basis of improved
design and bidding procedures, housing construction perieds will be reduced
from the present three years to less than a year. Housing unit costs will
be lowered to less than  half  of  historical levels.  SVOA would introduce
norms and criteria to promote, through competition, a variety of designs
and constructioi1 techniques.   Procurement  methods, uniform throughout the
country, would ensure  transparency  of  the  bidding  process.   A line of
credit up to 15: of the base cost of the project, would be directed to
improving and rehabilitating current substandard housing.
8.       The proceeds of  the  proposed  loan,  together  with FONAVI's own
resources and beneficiaries' down payments, would finance the full costs of
the housing units to be constructed or improved under the project. The
Government, through FONA;_, would assume the cross-currency exchange risk
and the US dollar exchange risk.    The proceeds of the proposed loan would
be made available to the IPVs in local currency in accordance with
allocation  criteria  satisfactory   to   the   Bank,  under  participating
agreements which would define the IPVs' obligations, including the recovery
of the loans made to the beneficiaries.    The funds so recovered are to be
returned to SVOA. Loans for home improvements would be provided by SVOA
through BHN or other financial agents satisfactory to the Bank with SVOA
assuming the risk  of  loan  repayment.    Under  the proposed project, the
monthly payments schedule would have the following characteristics: annual
real interest rate of 8.7Z; maximum repayment period of 25 years and
monthly  payments,  adjusted  for  actual  inflation.    The  value  of the
repayments will be a portion of the cost of the house, the remaining being
a subsidy that depends on the income level of the beneficiary. Subsidies
would be reduced from over 95? in the past to an average of 37? under the
program. Eligibility for houses to be financed by FONAVI would be limited
to the lowest forty percent income earners. No subsidies would be granted
to families with incomes above US$280 per month. Families earning less
than US$100 per month  would  receive  the  highest  subsidies.    The home
improvement loans would be for five years, adjusted monthly and with a real
interest rate of 8.7? per year, plus a charge to cover the financial
agent's administrative costs.
9.       The proposed project would  include  technical assistance to carry
out studies and implement recommendations in several areas required to make
SVOA and the IPVs more efficient, including, inter alia, the creation of a
sector information system, new procedures for the management and control of
FONAVI's portfolio, new procedures to collect and administer FONAVI's
resources, new ways to mobilize savings for the housing sector, and a more
stable and modern legal framework.   Local cost financing (25?) is included
because of the current financial constraints of FONAVI and serious fiscal
constraints of the  Government.    It  is  also  recommended because of the
project's high social and institutional impact, in line with decisions
already adopted for the Public Sector Management Technical Assistance,
Municipal Development and Social Sector Management Technical Assistance
Projects in Argentina.

10.      Main Agreed Actions:  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that: (i) FONAVI programs would be restricted to housing with economic
standards and lower unit costs; (ii) SVOA would introduce new flexible
housing designs' specifications to assist the construction companies to
build more efficiently; (iii) SVOA would introduce improved and standard
bidding procedures that would ensure transparency of the bidding process;
(iv) SVOA would establish new national and provincial registries of
beneficiaries that would favor those families with a proven need taking
into account their capacity to mobilize savings; (v) SVOA would facilitate
the participation of intermediate groups, such as cooperatives, in the
housing programs in order to improve beneficiary selection and mobilize
savings; (vi) SVOA would put into effect a new mortgage repayment system
that would cap and make explicit all subsidies as noted earlier; (vii) SVOA
would adopt measures to improve FONAVI's financial performance, through
increased collections and loan recovery to generate sufflcient incremental
revenue to cover costs and service the Bank debt; and (viii) SVOA would
allocate funds among IPVs according to their repayment record and financial
and operational efficiency. The whole regulatory system (embodied in the
required FONAVI Resolutions), must be in place and approved by all
appropriate authorities, as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.    Retroactive  financing  of  US$2  r.illion  would  be  provided for
technical assistance, equipment contracts and pilot civil works concluded
after April 30, 1988.   Finally,  as  a condition of disbursement for civil
works, SVOA and the IPVs must execute participating agreements. Execution
of an agreement satisfactory to the Bank, between SVOA and BHN or other
financial institution acceptable to the Bank, would be a condition of
disbursement for  the  home  improvement  loans  program.    The release of
disbursements after the  initial  US$150  million  would  be subject to the
following conditions: (a) substantial progress on implementation of the
"FONAVI  Tax  Compliance  Plan"   (payments  by  provincial  and  municipal
governments  of  amounts   owed   to   FONAVI   on  account  of  employers'
contributions); (b) incremental revenue improvements directly attributable
to the project would be at least double the entire FONAVI debt service
payable during the twelve months previous to the date in which the initial
US$150 million was fully withdrawn; (c) satisfactory progress in carrying
out the project, the program (as defined in the Government's Policy Letter)
and  the  FONAVI  Resolutions;   and   (d)  satisfactory  progress  in  the
implementation of the recommendations of the studies carried out under the
technical assistance program, including studies on the possibility of
replacing earmarked taxes, mobilizing private savings for housing, and
increasing the role of the private sector in housing finance.
11.      Benefits.   The  project  would  provide  about  60,000 additional
houses at a much lower unit cost than before. Additionally, some 40,000
houses would be upgraded and  expanded.   The proposed project would reduce
the housing sector's fiscal deficit through its lower overall subsidies and
higher  savings  and  recuperation  of   mortgages  that  would  more  than
compensate for the debt service under the Bank loan. Moreover, the higher
FONAVI housing output will substitute for BHN low cost housing which in the
past have  been  financed  with  Central  Bank  overdrafts.   Socioeconomic
benefits comprise the sharper targeting of subsidies (to those earning up
to the 40th percentile) and the creation of about 180,000 man-years of
employment.

12.      Risks.  The  main  r_sks  are  financial, legal and institutional.
FONAVI tax receipts and loan recoveries are sensitive to high inflation
rates and have fluctuated in the past.   In part, these financial risks are
not specific to the project but are associated with the country's macro-
economic difficulties. In order to ensure a more steady flow of revenue, a
new mortgage repayment system will be introduced, and the technical
assistance  component  would  strengthen  the  management  and  control  of
FONAVI's portfolio. In order to minimize the project risks, disbursements
after the initial US$150 million would be subject to FONAVI's compliance
with  clearly  defined  improvements   in  its  operational  and  financial
performance. All agreed FONAVI reforms would be introduced through FONAVI
Resolutions, which  legal  authorities  have  confirmed  would be permitted
under the current FONAVI legislation, backed by the Loan Agreement. SVOA
is understaffed and its personnel is underpaid and unmotivated. The result
has been administrative weaknesses  and  low productivity and staff morale.
Moreover, the quality and efficiency of the IPVs vary widely. The proposed
institutional  and   financial   arrangements   would   facilitate  project
implementation while increasing efficiency of SVOA and IPV's, and ensuring
that only efficient IPVs will be able to participate fully and take
advantage of the  proposed  project.    The technical assistance component,
through the introduction of new procedures, training and the provision of
equipment, would also contribute to improve SVOA's performance.
13.      Recommendation.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
