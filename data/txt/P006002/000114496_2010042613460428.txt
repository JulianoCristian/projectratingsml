Re:
Loan No. 2997 AR
First Housing Sector Project
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sir:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement"), dated November 29, 
1988 between the Argentine Republic and International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank).
We are pleased to advise you that the Bank agrees to your request to amend the 
method of calculating the maximum amounts of monthly household income of a Beneficiary 
and of an Improvement Loan, as well as to have the minimum downpayment requirements 
apply to Beneficiaries on an average basis.  The Bank, therefore, proposes the 
following amendments to the Loan Agreement:
Section 1.02 (d) is hereby deleted and the following new Section 1.02 (d) 
substituted therefor:
"(d) "Beneficiary" means any person who is the Borrower in respect of a 
Housing Loan or an Improvement Loan (as such terms are hereinafter defined) 
whose monthly income, when added to all other income of his or her household, 
shall 
not exceed $ 280 equivalent, calculated applying the exchange rate of $1  - 16.40 
Australes representing the rate applicable on December 31, 1988.  Such 
maximum 
amount be subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with 
ISPI 
(as hereinafter defined);"
Section 1.02 (k) of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted and the following new 
Section 1.02 (k) substituted therefor:
"(k) "Improvement Loan" means a loan, made or proposed to be made by the 
Borrower through SVOA utilizing a Financial Agent (as hereinafter defined) to 
a 
Beneficiary for purposes of financing the improvement or rehabilitation of a 
Housing Unit, in an amount not in excess of the equivalent of $1,800, 
calculated applying the exchange rate of $1 - 16.40 Australes representing the 
rate 
applicable on December 31, 1988.  Such maximum amount shall be subject to 
adjustment from time to time in accordance with the Indice del Costo de la 
Construccion ("INDEC") furnished by Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Censos 
of the 
Borrower;"
Section 5.01 (d) of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted and the following new 
Section 5.01 (d) substituted therefor:
"(d) within five business days of adopting any changes to the maximum 
monthly income of the Beneficiaries, the maximum amount of the Improvement 
Loans or the cost limitations of the Housing Units, as permitted pursuant to 
Section 1.02 (d), Section 1.02 (k) and paragraph 3 (a) of Schedule 6 to this 
Agreement, respectively, notify the Bank thereof, and together with such 
notice, provide to the Bank documentation evidencing the ISPI or Indice del 
Costo de la Construccion based on which such changes have been adopted, and 
the dollar equivalents of such changed maximum monthly income, maximum amount 
of the 
Improvement Loans or cost limitations of Housing Units, using for such 
purpose the 
rate of exchange applicable to disbursements of loans made by the  Bank".
 
Paragraph 2 (a) of Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted and the 
following new paragraph 2 (a) of Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement substituted 
therefor:
"(a) Only a household having a monthly total household income of $280 
Page  2
equivalent or less, which amount may be adjusted in accordance with Section 
1.02 (d), shall be eligible for a Housing Loan or an Improvement Loan."
Schedule 6, paragraph 2 (b) is hereby deleted and the following new paragraph 2 
(b) substituted therefor:
"(b) The maximum cost of the Housing Unit for which a Beneficiary shall 
qualify, as well as the average minimum down payment per Beneficiary required 
in 
order to qualify for a Housing Loan, shall be determined in accordance with 
the 
total monthly household income of the Beneficiary as specified in the 
Table 
to this Schedule 6."
This Amendment shall come into force and effect on the date upon which the Loan 
Agreement becomes effective.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating the 
attached confirmation copy of this letter and returning the same to the undersigned.
Very truly yours,
