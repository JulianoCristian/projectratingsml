systems with sustainable use of natural\n            resources, focusing on the needs of the smallholder sector.\n            The project consists of three components.  First,\n            strengthening agricultural research system will bring about\n            more effective and efficient agricultural research\n            institutions, and an effective arrangement for donor\n            coordination and for coordinating regional and other\n            collaborative research programs.  Second, organization and\n            management of agricultural research will provide\n            demand-driven, client oriented research, efforts to\n            introduce participatory techniques, and guidelines for\n            small-farmer oriented and gender-sensitive research.  Third,\n            human resource development will support increased number of\n            research personnel in needed disciplines, and strengthen\n            financial management and information services."}, "docdt": "1997-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
