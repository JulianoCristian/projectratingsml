project, which would seek to: (a) achieve low-cost\n            qualitative improvements in primary education; and (b)\n            strengthen the administrative and technical capacity in the\n            education sector. The project would provide assistance to\n            about 700 primary schools in six of Nepal's 75\n            districts through the provision of effective in-service\n            teacher training systems with follow-up supervision, better\n            school management and community support, better teaching\n            materials, and improved physical facilities. Communication\n            problems and economic constraints would be addressed in part\n            through the clustering of schools around a resource center\n            which would assume some of the educational responsibilities\n            for teacher training and supervision. Technical assistance\n            would be extended to the Curriulum,Textbook, and Supervision\n            Development Center and other agencies of Ministry of\n            Education and Culture responsible for project planning and\n            implementing the Government's educational policies. A\n            reform of the examination system for the School Leaving\n            Certificate would be undertaken."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
