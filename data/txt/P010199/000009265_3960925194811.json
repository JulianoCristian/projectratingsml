for Nepal was satisfactory. The project achieved\n            many of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was partially satisfactory, and sustainability\n            is likely. However, both the Bank and Borrower acted less\n            than satisfactorily overall. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the project did not impose\n            unrealistic targets on the sector. Second, macroeconomic\n            performance and general administrative and staffing policies\n            have an impact on project performance. Third, well prepared,\n            timely, and well supervised pilot projects can succeed in\n            focusing public attention on the sector, make positive\n            impacts, and test the ground for national full-scale\n            expansion. Lastly, strengthening the administrative and\n            technical capacity of the sector is difficult to achieve\n            without integration of project and line ministry functions."}, "docdt": "1993-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
