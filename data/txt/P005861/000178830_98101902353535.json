"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project, which constitutes the first\n            construction stage of a long-term water supply master plan,\n            seeks to increase the critically short supply of potable\n            water, and meet the maximum demand up to 1987, in Aden, the\n            capital and largest agglomeration of PDRY, and to\n            rehabilitate the existing system which is fast\n            deteriorating. It provides for the expansion of the\n            distribution network into the poorer districts of Greater\n            Aden to allow low-income residents to be directly connected\n            to the public system. The project also provides for\n            technical assistance aimed at improving PWC's\n            management capability. Part A of the project includes the\n            construction of wells, rehabilitation works, studies,\n            management assistance to PWC and training of its staff; Part\n            B covers the well equipment and water transmission to Aden;\n            and Part C includes the construction of reservoirs, the\n            installation of water disinfection equipment, and the\n            expansion of the distribution network. A total of 328\n            man-months of consulting services, at an estimated average\n            cost of $8,200 per man-month, is required. Provisions have\n            been made in the project to minimize these risks."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
