SDR 6,470,000, may be made on account of payments
made for such expenditures before that date but
after July 1, 1982; and
(ii) payments made for expenditures for spare parts
under Category (3) above unless such spare parts


﻿- 16 -
shall be included in the list which shall have
been approved by the Association in accordance
with the provisions of Part C.1 of the Schedule to
the Project Agreement; and
(b) no withdrawals in excess of an aggregate amount of
SDR 258,000 shall be made until:
(i) all measures shall have been taken for the in-
crease of CIMAO's subscribed share capital to an
amount of not less than CFA francs 25,300,000,000,
and
(ii) CIMAO shall have called for the paying-in of the
unpaid amount of CFA francs 5,684,400,000 in a
manner satisfactory to the Association.
5.   The proceeds of the Togo and Ghana Development Credits shall
be disbursed to the extent practicable pro rata on the basis of a
38:62 ratio.
6.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Togo and
Ghana Development Credits tr the disbursement percentages set
forth in the table in paragraph 1 above, if the Association has
reasonably estimated that the amount of the Togo and Ghana
Development Credits then allocated to any Category will be in-
sufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures
in that Category, the Association may, by notice to the Borrower:
(i) reallocate to such Category, to the extent required to meet
the estimated shortfall, proceeds of the Credit which are then
allocated to another Category and which in the opinion of the
Association are not needed to meet other expenditures; and (ii)
if such reallocation cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall,
reduce the disbursement percentage then applicable to such
expenditures in order that further withdrawals under such
Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall
have been made.
7.   If the Association shall have reasonably determined that the
procurement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the
procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expend-
itures for such iLc'nM shall be financed out of the proceeds of the
Credit and the Association may, without in any way restricting or
limiting any other right, power or remedy of the Association


﻿- 17 -
under the Development Credit Agreement, by notice to the Bor-
rower, cancel such amount of the Credit as, in the Association's
reasonable opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures
which would otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the
proceeds of the Credit.
