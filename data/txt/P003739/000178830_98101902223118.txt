INTERTLNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELO1IEN-T
REPORT AND RECCX^IIEN4DATION OF THE PRIIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBIC OF ThDONESIA FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$48 million to
help finance a railway project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
includitng 5 years of grace with interest at 71¼ percent per anmum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The latest economic report on Indonesia (The Indonesian Economy:
Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75, November 26, 1973, R73- 27
described and analysed the substantial changes which had taken place in the
Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been important further
deveOopments, especially in oil prices. A Basic Economic Mission is planned
for September/October 1974 to reassess Indonesia's longer term development
prospects and policies.
3.Tne Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-oriented
in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great depression in the
'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for independence, in the
'forties,  After a relatively brief period of recovery in the early 'fifties,
the economy stagnated again in the decade 1957-1967 largely as a result of
adverse economic policies. Thus, after a long period of economic difficulties
in wrhich the population nearly doubled, Indonesia has become one of the poorest
large countries in the world (1970 population about 115 million, per capita
income about $80).
4.         After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabilization
program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of the
mid-L960s, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation under the
E,irst Five-Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was close to 7 percent in
the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments increased considerably,
thus providing the basis for continued economic expansion after the rehabi-
l-itation phase. By 1972, investments, excluding those in the oil sector, had
grown to an estimated 17 percent of the GNP, of which more than two-thirds
were financed from domestic sources. In agriculture, sustained efforts were
made to increase food production, with emphasis on rice. Although a drought
in the second hal-f of 1972 led to a setback in food production and a steep
increase in prices, prodluction has recovered since then. Efforts to expand
food production continue to receive high priority and in this connection the
kovernment plans a large increase in fertilizer imports in 1974, international
.,u>-pplies ?ermitttLng.. i!X,AaSion Of domestic fertilizer capacity is being
actively pursued.



5,        Even before the world energy shrt;4ge .amne to a head in the
latter part of 1973, the money economry was '.aiim'. .nd real growth
was probably accelerating under the influence of steep increases in
indonesia's export prices, a signifi4cant physical expamsion of produc-
tion in the oil and forestry sectors, a rapid growlti in direct forelgn
investment (initially in mining, but increasing-_y in manuf:a.cturing),
and a large inflow of short-term credit,. The sa-. faators, however,
also caused significant inflation, reaching a rate of 40% per annum in
the beginning of 1974. The Government has takeni a number of measures
to combat the inflation, most recently in April 1974.
6.        The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September
1973. The Indonesian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in
that month, reached $11.70 per barrel on April 1, 1974. IB. addition,
Indonesia has renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies
to receive a larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the
net oil contributions to the balance of payments and the Government's
oil revenues were below $0.5 billion in 1972/731! (less than 5% of the
GNP), they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 15,74/75, an
increase of $20 per capita. Given also the external and domestic in-
flation, total exports as well as budgetary receipts will probably
exceed $5 billion in 1974/75; a rough quadrupling irn two years.
7,         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget.  Average IndoneEian import prices
are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974, with the
largest increases occurring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs (rice,
wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against the
effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these imports
at an annual cost of nearly $1 billion. In addition, the Cbvernment has to
pay more for domestic goods and services (including Governirent salaries).
Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will be eroded
by the different effects of inflation. Cf the other half, a significant
part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays, including
much-needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures, routine
material expenditures, and subsidies to regions. Nevertheless, there will
r-r hly er,ain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 -   1.0 billion in 1974-75.
c-e expected overall surplus on the balance of payments is somewhat larger,
and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on Miarch 31,
1974 to about $2 billion (about five months of imports at the then expected
rate) a year later.
8.        These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field,
as specified in the Second Five Year Plan (197T/75-1978/79). Moreover,
1/ Fiscal year starting April 1.



-3-
earlier problems of absorptive capacity are gradually being overcome.
Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consumers' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not
be long before the new resources are fully absorbed.
9.        The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social, regional and equity aspects of'
development.  It is recognized that, while the Government's initial
economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a
number of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the
population, the benefits of investments in the modern sector - much
of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the
continued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure
has ultimately benefitted the rural areas, but is severely reducing
the real income of the urban poor. The Government's policy to keep the
prices of basic comodities in check through subsidization of imports
is providing relief, but it is the intention to gradually work out and
implement a number of more basic scocially oriented policies in the
fields of employment, education, housing, etc.
10.       In the short and medium run, Indonesia therefore faces the
problems of efficient utilization of additional resources, and of the
implementation of more socially-oriented policies. In this context,
there will be a need for continued international technical assistance
for project implementation and institution building. After the new
resources have been absorbed, Indonesia will also still need financial
assistance to finance further programs to alleviate its poverty. There
is therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indonesia, even though the country may generat'n relatively modest
budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
all probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
disbursements from new projects become significant.
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI), and the
rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreement with the WIstern countries and Japan, and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern Eurppean countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively l,7w. Service payments on re-
scheduled and subsequently incurred puilic debt are estimated at $320
million in 1974, will reach a peak of $380 million in 1975, and are pro-
jected to decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with
the projected export level of over $5 billion in 1974W75, and given the
fact that Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain
favorable, it appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service
signt.ficant additional debt.
12.       The chaDges in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent by the time of the IGGI pledging meeting in
May 1974. As a result, it was generally agreed that program aid was
no longer necessary on economic grounds, although some donors will



continue such aid, at least for some time, for reasons of ccnvenience.
At the same time, the meeting endorsed the view that a con.Siderable
expansion in project aid was warranted to assist, Indornsia in carryintg
out a more ambitious development strategy.   Although some members were
not in a position to make pledges, it seems li '<ey that total aid
commitments (including IBRD loans) in 197V/75 will exceed the aid re-
quest of $850 million.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.       For the reasons indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue
to need substantial external financial and technical assistance to re-
habilitate and improve infrastructure and expand production capabilities
in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the con-
tinued growth of the economy, the Government will also be able to devote
increasing attention to development of effective programs designed to
ensure that the benefits of development are distributed wide'ly.
Agricultural programs to increase the productivity of smallholder
farmers, regional development in the outer islands, family p'lanning and
other social programs will therefore have an important place in the
development strategy during the period of the Second Plan.
14.       The work of both the headquarters and Resident Staff has been
oriented toward these development objectives. The basic economic
mission, scheduled for early this fall, will concentrate on questions
of employment and income distribution.
15.       All Bank Group lending so far has been on IDA terms.   As a
result of Indonesia's rapidly improving balance of payments and re-
source position, described in Part I of this report, Indonesia is now
able to borrow on less concessional terms. The Bank has therefore in-
formed the Government that all lending after FY74 will be provided on
Bpnk terms. In addition to the Indonesian projects being presented to
the Executive Directors at the same time as this project, one IDA
credit is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors during
the next month.
16.       The Bank Group has in the past financed local currency costs
under its projects in Indonesia. Such financing will contintue to be
necessary if the Bank Group is tc increase assistance to the agriculture
and social sectors, where projects frequently have a low fore!ign ex-
ochange component.  In such cases, the Bank Group will therefore con-
tinue to provide limited amounts of local cost financing.
17.       As of April 30, 1974, Indonesia has received 34 IDA credits
anounting to US$509.3 million. The Bank Group accounts for less thani
4% of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt. By 1978 it is ex-
pected to account for less than 11% of total outstanding debt and less
than 5% of Indonesia's annual debt service obligations. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going IDA projects.



18.       In accordance with the prior4tle3 of Indonesi,9's Five-Year
Plans, over 35% of IDA lending to date has been for agriculture. The
Association has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop
plantations in the Government estates sector. Other credits for agri-
culture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems
and one each for a fisheries project, a seeds multiplication program,
beef cattle development, smallholder rubber development, sugar industry
rehabilitation and smallholder tea development. Industry is of growing
importance to the Indonesian economy and the Association has assisted
in four projects in this sector. It organized a consortium of lenders
to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assisted in
the reorganization and financing of the major state development bank
(BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for Indonesia's first industrial
estate project, and assisted in the establishment and financing of the
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority
sectors to which credits have been extended are power, transportation,
telecommunications, education and population. In addition, four tech-
nical assistance credits have been made to assist the Government in
preparing projects and formulating appropriate development policies.
A fifth irrigation project is expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors soon and projects in rural works, telecommunications, water
supply and urban development are under preparation.
19.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has
increased rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the
undisbursed portion of IDA credits is relatively large. Virtually
every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, draft-
ing of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which
has taken much time. A number of projects have experienced delays,
particularly in the initial stages of implementation. However, project
execution has improved sharply during the last year as organizational
improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian staff have become
more familiar with Bank Group procedures. Given the status of projects
at the beginning of calendar 1973, disbursements under Indonesian pro-
jects during 1973 were about the same as would have been expected on an
IDA-wide basis for a program of the same size and composition. There
are, nevertheless, still several projects, including the first agri-
cultural estate project and the smallholder rubber project, which
continue to suffer from management weakness and to require continued
close attention from the Bank's Resident Staff.

PART II- - RAILWAYS IN INDONESIA
General
20.        The transport system in Indonesia conprises highDtays, railways,
marine services and limited but rapidly increasing air transport.
21.        The railway and highway network on Java is extensive, though
badly maintained on many sections.  In Sumatra, railways serve only the key
production regions, and the highway network is limited to basic links
between principal cities. On the other islands there are onily a few roads
in areas around ports and towns.
22.        The recently approved, Second Five-Year plan provides for
continuation of the present rehabilitation program for transport infras-
tructure coupled with gradual upgrading of transport services and facilities.
In addition, an expanded program for development of rural transportation
and a "pioneer network" for sea, air and land communications to economically
neglected or remote flegions will be undertaken.  Coordination of planning
and investment among competing transport modes to ensure economic allocation
of resources has been inadequate and the Government is determined to remedy
this situation.  To assist the Government in this effort, the Bank Group is
reviewing the sector and finance for substantial technical aissistance for
transport investment planning and coordination is available from the UNDP
and one of the Technical Assistance Credits.
Railways
23.        The Indonesian State Railways (PJKA) handles about 4.9 million
tons and 1.1 billion ton-km of freight traffic and about 30 million passengers
and 2.7 billion passenger-km annual-ly. Over 80 percent of national freight
traffic and 90 percent of national passenger traffic is carried in Java.
There are about 4,700 km of railway lines on Java and about 2,000 km on
Swnatra. They were built over 70 years prior to the Second Wbrld War, at
which time there were six separate systems and 40 percent of the network was
privately owned. Nationalization took place after independence. Traffic on
lines built to move primary products to foreign markets declined with the
reduction in exports of these products in the 1950's and 1960's. Railway
operations were also affected by the expansion of competing modes of trans-
port, especially in Java, where road transport can compete effectively with
some branch lines, particularly over shorter distances.
24.        For many years, PJKA's revenues have been barely sufficient to
meet operating costs excluding depreciation. Maintenance, repair and new
investment were neglected and the quality of service suffereid; track and
structures have deteriorated badly; ballast is inadequate irL many sections;
track fittings need large scale replacement and sleepers are in poor ccndi-
tion. As a result, speed restrictions have been imposed ovEr long sections.
Communications facilities are inadequate and result in poor train control
and rolling stock utilization. A large proportion of the motive power and



-7-
rolling stock is too old for economic maintenance or is out of service due
to lack of spare parts and inadequate repair facilities.
25.        As part of the country-wide rehabilitation of infrastructure
begun  during the First Five-Year Plan (Repelita I, FY69-74), the Govern-
ment employed consultants under German bilateral assistance to make a com-
prehensive study of the Indonesian railways and formulate a five-year
investment plan for its rehabilitation, taking int  account the future
economic role for the railways in Indonesia's transport system, A modified
version of this investment plan has been adopted by the Railways and
Government for Repelita II.
Railway Operations and Traffic
26.        In the early 1960's, freight traffic dropped sharply (7.5
percent per annum in tornage) due to poor railway service, increased com-
petition from road transport for short hauls and reduced production of
rubber, coffee and coal. However, from 1967 to the present, freight traffic
has increased at about 8.5 percent per annum in tonnage and 9 percent per
annum in ton-kn, due to the improved economic climate, some modest additions
to locomotives and rolling stock and efforts by the PJKA management to
improve operations. The proportion of agriculture, forestry and miscellaneous-
goods freight traffic has been declining over the past decade while the share
of petroleum products and building materials has increased. Over the next
five years, petroleum-products traffic is likely to become relatively less
important due to the construction of pipelines. The share of agriculture and
forestry traffic will increase due to greater production in those sectors.
Gleneral goods and building materials traffic carried by rail is also expected
to increase as railway efficiency improves.  During F774-79, freight traffic
is expected to increase by about 5.5 percent per annum in tonnage and h.9
percent per annum in ton-km.
27.        Passenger traffic has undergone a decade-long decline, with an
average decrease of   percent per annum from 1966 to 1972 in the number of
passengers carried. The main causes of the decrease have been the growing
competition from road transport, inadequate service due to the deterioration
of track and rolling stock, reduction in operations on branch lines and
cancellation of some commuter services due to the lack of locomotives and
passenger cars. In 1973, there was another drop in the number of' passengers
carried because of a further reduction in services coupled with an increase
of about 30 percent in basic passenger fares. This increase discouraged
short distance passenger traffic, but resulted in an increase in overall
passenger revenues.
28.        Even with such a reduction of passenger traffic over the last
few years, the railways remain a major carrier of long-distance passengers
in 5ndonesia and many services are overcrowded. Rehabilitation of track and
passenger cars will ensure more regular and rapid service. With better
control of ticketless traffic and unauthorized travel on freight trains, it
is reasonable to expect passenger traffic and revenue to increase, especially
for long distances. It is estimated that by the end of Repelita II,



passenger traffic wi--l have re--established itself at earlier levels (1971)
or some 35 percent higher than in 1973. There may be substantial additional
passenger traffic if the Government's ongoing Transmigration Program is
implemented on schedule. Recently, Government has decided, for reasons of
s fety and orderly movement,that all transmigration travel under the Program
must, where possible, be by rail (from East and Central Java to southern
Sumatra). Since January 1974, rail travel for transmigration has risen
sharply with implementation of the Government decision and if present estimates
are correct, 2,250,000 transmigrants will move by PJKA services to southern
Sumatra between 1974 and 1979.
PJKA's Organizational Status, Management and Staff
29.        Established Government policy in Indonesia is for state enterprises
to have legal personality, the power to raise funds and maintain their own
budge-ts, and the capacity to operate in accordance with sound business and
financial principles. The Government recognized that PJKA would be unable to
meet these standards for some years, because of falling traffic and revenues
znd deteriorating plant and equipment, and in 1971 changed the legal form of
the railways from a statutory corporation under the Minister of Communications
to a CGovernment agency responsible to the same Minister. As a Government
agency, PJKA still has its own management and accounts, but io longer has legal
personality.
30.        Overall responsibility for important policy decisions is in the
hands of the Minister of Communications. Responsibility for the day-to-day
management cf PJKA is vested in a Chief Directors who is suprported by four
directors in headquarters and six regional operating divisions, three in Java
and three in Sumatra, each with considerable management responsibility. PJKAts
headquarters management is being functionally reorganized by increasing the
number of director positions from four to six and reallocating departmental
responsibilities among these directors to provide closer, more specialized and
efficient control.
31.        Since 1966, staff employed by PJKA have decreased in number from
over 88,000 to about 60,000 and total staff is expected to be reduced further
-to 48,000 by 1979. This decrease in staff is part of an ongoing program in
all state enterprises for retirement of large numbers of sur)lus, mainly
unskilled staff. These reductions are possible because of serious overstaff-
ing in the past and the increase in staff efficiency expected1 to result from
the new investments to be made under the Plan and from operation and manage-
ment improvements (including increased training).  Severance compensation is
included in PJKA's budget.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
32.       A preappraisal/preparation mission visited Indonesia in November
1972 to review the operations of the Indonesian Railways and the status of
the Railway Investment Plan for FY74-FY79. Following further work on the
Plan, the proposed project was appraised in August/September 1973 and nego-
tiated in April 1974. The Government's delegation was lead by Mr. Bayuadji
Sumpono, Director General of Land Transportation. The Appraisal Report,
dated May 10, 1974 is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Loan and Project Summary is presented in Annex III of this Report.
The Investment Plan and the Project
33.       Government and PJKA have prepared the detailed Railway Investment
Plan for the next five years in consultation with the Bank, following a
review of PJKA's physical assets, their condition and utilization, and
expected railway traffic. The Flan is designed to remedy the neglect of the
past 25 years and to assure the sustained provision of more efficient rail-
way service and the financial recovery and viability of PJKA. The total
proposed investment is estimated at about US$248 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$150 million.
3L.       The project consists of investments and improvements to be under-
taken during the first three years of the Investment Plan and is aimed at
enabling PJKA to regain and maintain its proper economic role and financial
viability. Therefore, the project, also includes a financial recovery plan
designed to allow PJKA to break even by 1979/80 (see paragraph 36). 9pecific
investments to be executed during the project include: the rehabilitation
of track and signalling equipment on the main lines, and the rehabilitation
of 59 diesel locomotives, 120 passenger cars, and four diesel rail cars;
the procurement of 40 diesel locomotives, ten sets of electric rail cars
and 12 sets of diesel rail cars, 61 passenger coaches, 200 bogie freight
cars; fitting of air brakes on about 3,700 freight cars and automatic
couplers on 670 freight cars. Technical assistance for training in all
fields of railway operations and project implementation would also be provided.
35.       Total project costs are estimated at US$158 million equivalent,
of which the proposed loan would finance US$48 million of the US$98 million
foreign exchange cost. The Governments of.Australia, France, Germany, Japan
and the United Kingdom have made, or are finalizing, bilateral aid commit-
ments to cover more than $35 million of the remaining foreign exchange costs.
Subject to further bilateral aid which may be arranged, the balance of project
costs will be financed from Government resources. A summary of costs for
the Investment Plan, the three year Project and the financing plan for the
Project is shown in Annex III. Costs have been estimated at current prices
for materials and equipments with foreign and local contingencies of 20
percent, and 26 percent respectively.



iA described in Part TI of this Report, PJKA's operations and
revenues have deteriorated for some years and   in 1973 there was a cash
operating deficit (excluding any provision for depreciation) of US$2.5
million eauivalent. Therefore, as an integral part of the proposed
project, the Government has agreed with the Bank on a comprehensive
recovery plan taking into account all aspects of PJKA's admniistration and
operations and designed to allcw PJKA not later than its fiscal year
lSi79/80 to cover out of the revenues from its services all its admiinistra-
tive and operating expenses (inzluding maintenance, adequate prov:Lsion for
depreciation and bad debt, and taxes, if any) and interest and other
charges on debt (Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement). The investments under-
taken as part of the project would contribute directly to PJXA's financial
recovery tlirough reduction in unit operating costs, improved reliability,
quality and speed of service, and staff reduction and traininlg. The
recovery plan, which is outlined in detail in an extensive Supplemental
Letter between the Borrower and the Bank, separately distributed to the
Executive Directors, involves improvements in all aspects of PJKA's opera-
tion and maintenance of railway equipment, facilities and se:-vices, plann-
ing, budgeting and finance, personnel training, as well as construction
and procurement.  For the purpose of carrying out the recovery plan, PJKA
will plan and implement detailed annual programs for improvement of these
aspects of PJKAIs operations, designed to ensure adequate progress toward
recovery each fiscal year (Section 3,03 of the Loan Agreement). The
Government will review and assess with the Bank, at semi-annual intervals,
the actual progress made by PJKA toward achieving full recovery. Fbr this
purpose, Part C of the Supplemental Letter includes a series of operational
and financial performance indicators which have been agreed between the
Covernment and Bank to represent the pace and extent of improvements which
PJKA should achieve in executing the recovery plan. As these perfomrance
indicators show, PJKA's operations and financial position are expected to
improve rapidly in the later years of the recovery plan when the benefits of
the rehabilitation and investments financed under the project; begin to be
realized.
27.        In the context of the recovery plan   PJKA's tariffs deserve
mentions The principles upon which the tariff structure is based are sound.
For passenger fares, long run variable cost constitutes the floor for
pricing and quality of service dictates the ceiling. Freight, tariffs follow
traditional patterns of charging "what the traffic will bear." The Gbvern-
ment increased PJKA's freight and passenger tariffs by an overall average
of 30 percent in May 1973. During negotiations for the propcosed project,
the (overnment publicly announced its intention to increase the general
level of railway tariffs on about June 1, 1974. While the details of this
tariff increase are noti available at the time of writing of this report the
Government has indicated that it will try to eliminate minor deficiencies
in the existing freight tariff structure which were identifieid during
appraisal of the proposed project. Insofar as these deficiencies cannot be
fully eliminated by the June 19Th increase, the Government has agreed that
the necessary adjustments will be made to PJKA's tariffs by May 31, 1975
(Supplemental Letter on the Recovery Plan, page 5, section 2 (b) (1).

After PJKA will have achieved full recovery the Cbvernment has agreed to
take, or cause to be taken, all necessary or desirable steps (including
adjustments ir tariffs) as shall be required to ensure that in each fiscal
year the revenues from PJKA's operations will be sufficient to cover all
of its administrative and operating expenses, interest and other charges
on debt, and to provide a reasonable contribution towards PJKA's new
capital investment needs (Section 4.07 (a) of the Loan Agreement).
38.       During the early years of the recovery period, PJKA may suffer
a shortage of cash and therefore be unable to meet its operating obligations
ol working capital needs. The Government has therefore agreed: a) to
ensure that PJKA will have, at all times, sufficient liquid funds to meet
promptly all administrative and operating expenses and debt service
requirements of PJKA (Section 3.01 (d) of the Loan Agreement); and b)
that all funds for the project, including the proceeds from the proposed
loan, will be made available and treated as equity on PJKA's and Govern-
mentls accounts and, until PJKA shall have achieved financial recovery, all
fumds for PJKA's capital investment program, would be made available as
equity. (Section 3.01 (c) of the Loan Agreement).
Technical Assistance
39.       As part of the proposed Bank support of the investment plan, $5.6
million would be provided in the proposed loan to cover the cost of about 70
man years of short-term, technical assistance by groups of experienced
railways personnel workir.g in the field alongside their Indonesian counter-
parts and assistance by financial and procurement specialists. This specific,
on-the-job technical assistance will emphasize and include training for:
modern workshop practices and production planning and control in mechnnical
workshops and depots; establishment and introduction of appropriate standards
for track rehabilitation and maintenance; improved train and wagon control,
train scheduling and operating practices; identification and collection of
adequate statistical and financial data for management control and planning
purposes; an improved accounting system; improved traffic costing to provide
the basis for tariff adjustments and investment evaluation; rail transporta-
tion planning and investment analysis; and reorganization and improvement of
inventory control. In addition, permanent training schemes would be estab-
lished within PJKA to ensure continuing adequate training and refresher
courses for staff.

Procurement and Disbursement
40.        All items financed under the loan would be procured under inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurenent, except for certain components and spare parts required for
equi meiit already in service (estimated to cost about US$6.5 million equiva-
lent). For these items, procurement would be negotiated,
mainly with original suppliers, after consultation with the Bank. Where
international competitive bidding is required, the standard preference margin
for qualified local manufacturers has been provided for the purposes of bid
comparison, in the event local industries may prove capable of producing
items required for the project.
41l.       The loan would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost of imported
goods and equipment and the foreign exchange costs of consultants' services,
overseas training and procurement assistance.
Economic Evaluation
42.       In spite of inadequate facilities, the railways still retain
important traffic on medium and long haul routes, and have a competitive
advantage over available alternatives. The 1974-79 Investment Plan is a
coordinated program of rehabilitation and modernization designed to enable
the railways to carry efficiently the rail traffic forecast during the plan
period. Rehabilitation now will prevent further rapid deterioraticn of
assets and increases in costs of maintenance of essential lines. If the plan
is not implemented, declining quality of service and diminishing capability to
move traffic will result in diversion to other, less econoric modes of traffic
and, where there are no alternatives, to the cessation of traffic.
1h3.       The benefits of the project mainly result from the reduction in
operating costs of railway serviczs, attributable primarily tothe increased
use of diesel loconotives which are much more efficient than PJKA's present
steam-powered locomotives. On the basis of savings in operating costs and
from the avoidance of the costs of diversion of traffic to higher cost modes
of transport, the overall rate of return from the planned investments is
estimated to be 23 percent. Economic rates of return for project invest-
ments in specific operations of PJKA are:
Freight Services in Java . . . 33%
Freight Services in Sumatra . 29%
Passenger Services in Java . . 14%
Passenger Servioes in Sumatra. 27%
Building up of adequate inventories would result in improved maintenance and
better availability of rolling stock. In addition to the investments in
physical assets, the specialized technical assistance and training proposed
would result in overall improvement in operational efficiency. Benefits



- 13 -
resulting from investments in signalling, track, ballast, bridges, etc.,
which would ensure minimum safety standards and improve train schedulings
turn-around time, load factors and speed have not been quantified.
Li.        While PJKA's current financial position is weak, its operations are
basically sound and efficient in those instances where modern rolling stock
and equipment is available. PJKA's senior management is competent and well
aware of the complex tasks that face them in implementing an extensive training
and physical rehabilitation program during the Second Five-Year Plan. The
recovery plan, which has been worked out with Government and PJKA as a part of
the proposed project, represents a goal to which the Government and PJKA
are comumitted, The requirement to formulate the annual programs of specific
and practical measures to improve operations provides a mechanism by which
the Bank can assist and encourage PJKA, through close supervision, to move as
rapidly as possible toward financial recovery. The rehabilitation work and
equipment financed under the Project will make a substantial contribution to
PJKA's earnings and, with the continued support of Government and assistance
from the Bank, the railway has a reasonable prospect of achieving full recovery
by 1979/80.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the Supplemental Letter on the Recovery Plan, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for railway
projects.
46.        1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMKENDATION
h7.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 Million Credit of
tember 6, 196; Closn              December 317T175
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98% of appraisal timetable.   Final completion of the
project is expected to be delayed by about two years in ord3er to complete
much additional needed drainage work, the financing of which w2s not pro-
vided for under the cdredit. These additional costs will be met by the
Government. The revised economic rate of return on the project, which
was calculated at 50% at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25%. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing IDte: December 31, 1974L
The project is now progressing satisfactorily. The closing
date has been postponed by one year to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective six months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management, advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was found
to be genetically unsuited and, an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices
seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds. With recent
improvements in management and much higher international prices for rubber
the financial situation of the PNP V is expected to improve.
Now that field and factory standards have been raised to a good
technical level the management has been advised to concentrate on cost
control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less
attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the Management,
consultants and IDA supervision missions are beginning to yield good

Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project is progressing satisfactorily. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particuler to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 193 PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The project has progressed satisfactorily after n new time
schedule was agreed to allow for time required to meet all conditions of
effectiveness and the procurement requirements of all cc-lenders. The
general contractor now is expected to complete the plant by early July- 1W7y
about one-and-one-half months ahead of the revised schedule. The construc-
tion and installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 65 mile trans-
mission line has also been delayed but the plant is now receiving gas for
testing and the gathering system is expected to be completed two months
ahead of startup.
Cost for the fertilizer plant has increased by about 17% due
to currency revaluations and changes made as detailed design progressed
and the true composition of the gas became known. The gas system has
been enlarged to meet the increased need of the fertilizer complex and
to supply a greatly increased usage by Pertamina's refineries and by
power plants.
Latest cost estimates show an increase of about 130% against a
system capacity increase of 104%. Current estimates indicate a foreign
exchange cost over-run of nearly $30 million compared to the appraisal
report estimates. AID, OIEF and IDA are contributing $4 million, $3.7
million and $5 million respectively to help finance the foreign exchange
cost over-run. The Governnment will cover the balance required to com-
plete the project.
Despite the capital cost increases the project has become more
remunerative. Given the substantially lower capital cost compared to
estimates for similar projects presently under consideration, and the
presently expected long-range international prices for Urea, the economic
rate of return, calculated at 1h% at the time of appraisal, should now
be in excess of 30%.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, i975
This project was for the rehabilitation of two Government-owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective eight months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was
found to be genetically unsuitable, and an urforeseen sharp fall in
rubber prices seriously restricted the availability of self-generated
funds. However, during 1973 a record 3,200 h'a of oil palm were
planted on PNP VI and the program will be virtually on target.   Tne 1973
rubber program was reduced following the advice of the last Supervision
Mission as PNP IV was over-extended; if the high standards of replanting
now being achieved can be maintained, it should be possible to increase
the size of future programs again.



ANNEX II

Mnagement has improved in the field ahd factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained.  More enphasis is required on cost control
and management has agreed to take the necessary action. Solid progress is
being achieved and PNP VI's financil situation has been greatly helped by
the present higher producer prices. PNP IV has also made mwrked progress
during 1973 and is in a satisfactory financial position.
Cr. No. 195  Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$l8.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 197Th
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
186,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of
tender documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is
now proceeding somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still
exist, but, the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and this
sitUation is improving. Estimated costs remain within the overall
appraisal estimate, but the project will be one year behind appraisal
schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders for
all equipment except the tropospheric scatter system have now been placed.
The management consultants have completed their work but have been retained
to implement the recommendations being discussed between the Government
and the Association to work out appropriate measures. The Government is
requesting reallocation of the proceeds of the credit and postponement
of the closing date to complete disbursements.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries; US.$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After a slow start this project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Project management satisfactory to the Association has now been .ppointed;
contracts with engineering and management consultants have been concluded
and the consultants have begun work and the contract for the shore facilit'as
has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216  Technical Assistance I'; US$4.0 Million Credit of
September 15, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to comDlete disburs m-
ments for on-going studies.

Cr. No. 219  Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1576
The project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay in
the appointment of the architect but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Four out of five contracts for civil works have been approved by the
Government and the Association, as also heve equipment lists. The leader
of the team of overseas specialists has arrived and is assisting the train-
ing of the first group of technical teachers for the centers. While dis-
bursements were initially slower than expected, it is likely that construc-
tion of the five centers will be completed in less time than originally
estimated and the final implementation would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$14.5 Million Credit of
November 6, 1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, and a review is
being carried out to determine the effect of the dollar devaluation on
civil works and equipment contracts yet to be awarded. Disbursements are
improving to about 52% of the level estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity
tests run at the time of appraisal showed that a two year delay and 15%
cost overrun would reduce the economic rate of return from 25% to 21%.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of MbY 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management and effective procurement. These problems are
being overcome but, because of procurement delays, inflation, currency re-
valuation and design changes in the seed processing plant, a 20% cost in-
crease for the original project proposal became likely. However, recent
studies indicate that the market size for rice seed may be only about half
the original production target. Therefore,the latest Supervision Mission
has recommended reduction of the seed production target from 22,000 tons
to 12,000 tons per ar2nun in 1977, by which time the need for further
development of the seed industry would have been reviewed. The possibility
of such a reduction in project output was foreseen at the time of appraisal
and provided for in the Credit Agreement. Therefore, two subsidiary seed
processing centers will not be constructed and the funds now remaining in
the credit will be adequate to complete the project. The expected economic
benefits of the project remain substantial with a rate of return of 59%,
not including the research and seed certification conponents whose benefits
are not easily quantifiable.

Closing Date: June 30, 1970
This credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Government-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and re-
lationships between management and consultants are good. Recently revised
cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially
above appraisal estimates and project consultants have been asked to review
them.
Cr. No. 260  Highways II; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This project is in Sumatra and consists of construction with
supervision of about 200 km. of highway, detailed engineering of further
highway sections and a regional development study. The project is about
six months behind schedule, but the construction contracts have all been
awarded and no further delays are expected.
Cr. No. 275 Technical Assistance III; Us$4 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date to complete disbursements for on-
going studies.
Cr.-No. 288 Second Education; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9-, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation has been slow due to delays in concluding
a contract with consultant architects and in recruiting technical assistance.
However, the architectural contract has now been signed and the project unit
has decided to recruit technical assistance through a FA0 Fund-in-Trust
arrangement. Project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 289 Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabilita-
tion of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of 0 & M in five
non-contiguous areas totalling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean. It
also provides for the enployment of consultants to assist in the execution
of Pekalen-Sampean and for feasibility studies of further irrigation re-
habilitation projects. Civil worts and equipment purchase for the main
project, Pekalen-Sampean, are just beginning and are on schedule.
Consultants for the various studies are at work with their counterparts.
Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to procurement difficulties.
The rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule.
Disbursements are on schedule.

Cr. No. 300  Population; US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20 1972
Closing Date:- June 30, 1978
Progress under the project is currently being hampered by
organizational weakness and delays in obtaining necessary local currency
funds. The procurement of vehicles has also been delayed due to
Government ban on importing fully built-up cars. These matters are
currently being discussed with the Government.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance; US$10 Million Credit of
June 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976

Disbursements are rising quickly.
Cr. No. 318  Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation; US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 20, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak financial
position of PELNI, the Government-owned shipping company and main sub-
borrower, has caused concern.  An aiudit of PELNI has been completed and
in consultation with the Association and BAPINDO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthen PELNI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agricultural Estates IV; US$11 Million Credit of
June 2U, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This credit is for the rehabilitation and development of 8,600
ha rubber and 9,400 ha oil palms, including factories, on a group of
Government-owned estates in South Sumatra. After a delay of several
months to allow additional time to appoint inspection services and
executive assistants, this credit became effective on February 1, 1973.
The project has recovered from these initial delays and in now progressing
very satisfactorily. Agricultural standards are improving rapidly and
procurement planning is well advanced.
Cr. No. 334  Electricity Distribution II; US$40 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
This credit became effective March 12, 1973 and initial progress
is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 355  Beef Cattle Development; UJS$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 195O
Increased costs, due to inflation and exchange adjustments,
will be offset by higher sale prices for cattle but have caused cash
flow problems, which are being resolved.

has been monitoring the project closely and Government is considering
actions to overcome present problems and accelerate project implementation.
Cr. No. 387 Education III; US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation, testing and book production is well advanced. The
development of programs for book distribution and teacher training depend
largely on the timely recruitment of technical assistance. The Government
approached UNESCO for this technical assistance under a contract reimburs-
able under the terms of the credit and an agreement will be signed to this
effect between the Government and UNESCO.
Cr. No. 388 Highways II; US$I4 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This credit for the construction of 124 kma. of highway and two

Cr. No. 405  Sugar Project; US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Closing Date: wie 3U_, 1979
The effectiveness of this credit was delayed because it took
longer than expected for the Government to implement legal and institu-
tion changes to amalgamate existing PNPs into larger PT estate groups
and to establish a joint sugar projects unit to provide overall coordina-
tion. These changes have now been implemented and the credit was de-
clared effective in April 1974. However, the Government engaged the
necessary consultants services prior to credit effectiveness and work
is proceeding on schedule.
