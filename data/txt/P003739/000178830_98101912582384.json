The project includes a financial recovery plan\n            designed to allow PJKA to break even by 1979/80. Specific\n            investments to be executed during the project include: the\n            rehabilitation of track and signaling equipment on the main\n            lines, and the rehabilitation of 59 diesel locomotives, 120\n            passenger cars, and four diesel rail cars; the procurement\n            of 40 diesel locomotives, 10 sets of electric rail cars and\n            12 sets of diesel rail cars, 61 passenger coaches, 200 bogie\n            freight cars; fitting of air brakes on about 3,700 freight\n            cars and automatic couplers on 670 freight cars.
