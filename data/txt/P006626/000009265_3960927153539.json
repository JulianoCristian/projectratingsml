will\n            include all of the investments of the Ministry of Housing\n            and Urbanism (MINVU) in the housing sector for 1989-91, and\n            it will introduce a package of policy measures to reduce\n            subsidies and improve mortgage collections. A total of\n            177,000 new houses will be built and 36,000 existing houses\n            improved. Specific investment components include : (a) the\n            provision of upfront subsidy certificates to increase the\n            access of lower and moderate income families as well as\n            rural families, to housing constructed by the private\n            sector; (b) the production of basic houses of different\n            sizes and finishes for allocation to families in the\n            absolute poverty group; and (c) home improvement loans for\n            existing houses. In addition, the project will include\n            technical development and training for the private housing\n            finance system and for MINVU."}, "docdt": "1989-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
