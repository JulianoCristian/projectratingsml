MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND HOUSING SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$200.0 million is submitted
for approval to the Board.    The  proposed  loan would  have a term of 1l
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at the Bank's standard
variable rate.
2.       Background.    In  1978,   the   Chilean  Government  launched  an
innovative housing policy meant to increase sector productivity and sharpen
targeting of Government programs  toward  the  poor.   The policy's guiding
principles include the following: (a) the private sector should play the
major role in increasing housing supply and improving the stock; (b)
Government efforts should emphasize assistance to the poor; (c) subsidies
should be direct, explicit, and provided through the Government budget; (d)
the  selection  of   beneficiaries   for   Government  programs  should  be
transparent and unbiased; (s) savings for home-ownership as well as home-
ownership itself should be encouraged; and (f) the long-term viability of a
market-based housing finance  system  should  be  assured.   The policy was
consistent with Government decisions on macroeconomic management to reduce
budget outlays in all social sectors by increasing efficiency. It followed
reforms in housing finance whereby commercial banks issued mortgages at
market rates to replace a bankrupt savings-and-loan system. Programs to
carry out this new policy are implemented mainly by the Ministry of Housing
and  Urbanism  (MINVU)  and   its   Regional  Housing  Services  (SERVIUs).
Currently MINVU concentrates on producing new houses for lower-income
people through (a) a subsidy certificate program and (b) turnkey contracts.
Under the subsidy certificate program, beneficiaries locate their own
privately-constructed houses and use the certificate to cover part of the
capital cost. Under the turnkey program, MINVU contracts with the private
sector (with an upfront subsidy) for the construction of small houses for
allocation to the very poor.    Complementary  mortgage loans are issued by
commercial banks or by MINVU at market interest rates (now 8-10% and a full
adjustment for inflation).
3.       Results of this  policy  have  been positive.  Publicly-stimulated
housing production increased from 19,000 to 52,000 units per year at unit
costs which are one-third their 1978  level.   Moreover, the staff of MINVU
has been reduced from a peak of 45,000 to 3,000. Housing production now
keeps up with population growth.   Ninety percent of public investments are
targeted to the poor, and the selection of beneficiaries is fair and
transparent. The provision of housing benefits to the poor has alleviated
the social hardship produced by Chile's recent economic depression and
period of structural adjustment.    Total public expenditures and subsidies
for housing have not exceeded 3% of the total Central Government budget or
6Z of Government social expenditures, a level considered sustainable in
view of Chile's strong fiscal performance.
4.       Nevertheless,  there  is  still   room  for  improvement  in  cost
recovery, in the content of MINVU's programs, as well as in the private



mortgage  market.    Deficiencies  in   cost  recovery  include:  (a)  very
inadequate collections of mortgage repayments; (b) the continuation of some
implicit and indirect subsidies; and (c) relatively high levels of upfront
subsidies. Gaps in the content of MINVU's programs include: (a) MINVU has
made no effort to improve the existing housing stock; (b) few houses have
been made available in the US$3,400-6,800 price range, which falls between
MINVU's two  major  programs.    Finally,  the  institutional  framework of
Chile's mortgage market needs to be developed since its growth and depth
are limited and mortgage finance is expensive.
5.       Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.    The  Bank  has  been closely
invelved with Chile's housing-sector policies through the First Public
Sector Housing Loan (Loan 2482-CH) and the Third Structural Adjustment Loan
(Loan 2892-CH). Both loans supported policy improvements to reduce subsidy
levels and sharpen targeting toward the lowest-income groups. The proposed
operation would permit the Bank to continue its support during a period of
transition to a new  Government.    It would  sustain  Chile's efforts to
provide a safety net of basic services to the poor; it would reinforce
cost-effective, transparent, and replicable programs that emphasize private
initiative and increased household savings; and it would support programs
to increase and improve the stock of affordable housing for low-income
people. In addition, the sector's annual public investment of US$155
million provides the Bank with an opportunity for meaningful resource
transfers at a time when net disbursements will decline sharply.
6.       Project Objectives.  The  objectives  of the project would support
the efforts of the Government to (a) increase the number of housing
solutions for low income people, (b) offer a greater variety of new housing
types to meet the needs and preferences of low income people, (c) introduce
programs to upgrade the existing housing stock, (d) improve cost recovery
by increasing mortgage collections and reducing upfront subsidy levels, and
(e) improve the resource mobilization and efficiency of the private
mortgage finance system.
7.       Project  Description.    The  project  comprises  all  of  MINVU's
investments in the housing sector  for  1989-91.   The project provides for
the construction of about 177,000 new houses and the renovation of about
36,000 existing ones.    It will  introduce  measures  to improve mortgage
collections, eliminate implicit and indirect subsidies and reduce upfront
subsidies, and improve the capital market for housing finance.
8.       To address the housing  finance  system needs, a working group of
financial and housing agencies would be constituted to study and monitor
recent  reform measures--the  creation  of  the  endorsable  mortgage  and
permission to form private mutual funds for purchasing mortgages--and to
plan  further  actions.     Technical   assistance,  including  a  twinning
arrangement with a mortgage entity in another country, would facilitate the
group's work. This component will be closely coordinated with a Financial
Market project under preparation.
9.       Arrears in MINVU's large  mortgage  portfolio result from years of
inadequate efforts to bill and monitor collections, coupled with debtor
repayment problems related to Chile's  recession.   MINVU has already taken
definitive  action  to  improve  collections  by:    a)  computerizing  the
portfolio, b) hiring a private agent for billing and follow-up, c)
reprogramming existing debt, d) initiating payment incentives, and e)



limiting future mortgage holdings.    Concrete results are already evident.
Cash collections in real terms increased by 63Z for the last six months of
1988 compared to 1987. The project further addresses these problems by
tailoring conditions to ensure that additional targets will be met during
implementation.
li.     Investments  would  include  the  following  components:  (a)  the
subsidy certificate programs (84,000 houses); (b) the basic housing program
(54,000  houses);  (c)  the   public/private  partnership  program  (40,000
houses); and (d) home improvement loans for poor homeowners (36,000 units).
The  subsidy   certificate   programs   and   basic   housing  program  are
continuations of existing programs but with some modifications--basic
houses would be more diverse and have lower average subsidies. The
public/private partnership program would institutionalize a successful
pilot effort carried out in 1987-88, in which MINVU contracted with
organized low-income groups (e.g. unions) for the construction of houses to
suit members'  personal  requirements  and  payment  capacities.   The home
improvement component would be a new effort to be implemented by NGOs under
contract to MINVU.
11.      The project provides funds  for civil works, technical assistance,
training, and office equipment. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$1133.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$282.2 million (25X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The loan would be disbursed over 4 years. To provide
incentives for producing more houses at lower cost, Bank disbursement for
new housing construction would be set at a fixed amount of US$1400 for each
new house which is constructed or subsidized. Bank financing would not be
used for houses costing more than UF 400 (about US$7,000). Because the
loan would finance a time-slice of on-going programs, disbursements would
cover both new committments and some of the committments made under the
previous program. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Chile
are given in  Schedules  C  and  D,  respectively.    A  map  and the Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7648-CH, dated March 3, 1989, are also attacbed.
Retroactive finance would be made available for 10 of the loan amount on
account of payments made for expenditures incurred after June 30, 1988, or
a date twelve months prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement, whichever
is later.
12.      Agreed Actions.    At  negotiations, the Government confirmed that
it would continue to subscribe to the basic policies stated in Paragraph 1,
and to execute programs that implement these policies. In addition, the
Government agreed that it would (a) furnish information by September 30 of
each year to the Bank on MINVU's planned investment programs for the
following year; (b) not invest more than US$250 million per year of public
expenditures in housing programs; (c) carry out an agreed subsidy action
plan; (d) maintain agreements with the Banco del Estado or other banks to
grant complementary mortgage credits to beneficiaries of MINVU programs;
(e) make MINVU's upgrading program effective by November 1, 1989; (f)
organize an advisory group to study the mortgage market; and (g) carry out
action plans to improve the efficiency of the mortgage market. Regarding
MINVU mortgage collections, the Government agreed: (a) on a formula for
SERVIU investment allocations based on mortgage portfolio performance; (b)
not to initiate any general renegotiation process or payment incentives for
mortgages financed under the loan; (c) that at least 80? in 1989-90, 852 in



- 4 -
1991, and 902 in 1992, of the new loans added to MINVU's portfolio will be
no more than 4 months in arrears; and that disbursement will be denied to
any SERVIU that falls below levels of 702, 752 and 80 in thcse respective
years; (d) that at least 902 of MINVU mortgage revenues will remain
available  to  MINVU  for  housing   investments;  (e)  to make  available
sufficient funds, facilities, and staff to ensure that prompt judicial
action can be taken on defaulters of MINVU loans and complementary loans to
the MINVU program given through the Banco del Estado; and (f) to continue
indexing MINVU loans in a manner acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the
Government confirmed that it is pcssible to initiate foreclosure procedures
on MINVU debtors after arrears lave exceeded 3 months of payments.
13.      Benefits.  The project would provide housing and basic services to
about 800,000 low- and moderate-income people. About 752 of benefits would
be affordable to persons below the absolute poverty level and 932 to those
below the relative  poverty  line.    Over  the  past decade, Chileans have
experienced severe  changes  in  their  level  of  household  income.   The
improvement in housing and living conditions envisioned by the project
would help to alleviate some of the problems created by structural
adjustment. The project would help to institutionalize and consolidate the
efficiency gains of MINVU in providing shelter in partnership with the
private sector and NGOs, and to reinforce the current transparent system of
selecting beneficiaries and awarding subsidies. The project would initiate
needed new programs, improve cost recovery, reduce subsidies, and improve
the capital market for mortgages.
14.      Risks.  The major risks relate  to cost recovery and continuity of
policies. The strain of an election campaign may make it difficult for the
Government to take strong measures to improve MINVU's mortgage portfolio.
However, the conditions in the project, including the incentives to the
SERVIUs, are sufficiently binding to ensure that cost-recovery targets will
be  met.    In  addition,  many  measures  already  have  been  taken (e.g.
contracting  for   private   collections,   liberalizing  foreclosure)  and
increased cash collections are already evident. The election campaign also
may create pressure to widen subsidies to middle- and higher-income groups.
To address this possibility, the program for 1989 has been agreed at
negotiations, and future programs will be sabject to Bank review. In
addition, there is the political risk that another government would change
basic housing or  financial  policies.    In  gsneral, the present programs
enjoy widespread support among  the  populace;    however, there is concern
that the present market-based housing finance system might be changed to
provide subsidized credit for  housing.    Here,  too, the legal agreements
clearly indicate that the project is predicated on continuity of present
policies, with the Bank exercising the right to review any policy and
program changes introduced by a new Govarnment.
15.      Recommendation.  I am  satisfied  that  the proposed loan complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
