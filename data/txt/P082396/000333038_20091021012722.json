{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Kenya Agricultural\n            Productivity Project (KAPP) for the Government of Kenya\n            (Gok) were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: although first phase of the project had\n            some elements that focused on promotion of sector-wide\n            approach, it nevertheless became clear during its\n            implementation that there is need to invest more on these\n            sector-wide approaches for greater impact. The GoK, the\n            Bank, and other development partners have, therefore, agreed\n            to promote the sector-wide approach in the agricultural\n            sector, as well as harmonization of programs, in line with\n            the Kenya joint assistance strategy. The formulation of the\n            GoK's agricultural sector development strategy, which\n            is a sector-wide policy, has brought in the necessary\n            impetus and platform on which to promote the sector-wide\n            approaches in the sector in phase two. Equally important is\n            the need to strengthen focus on crosscutting issues such as\n            gender mainstreaming. Although attempts were made under KAPP\n            one to mainstream implementation structures into the GoK\n            system, some project structures and systems were maintained.\n            The rationale for maintaining stand alone project structures\n            and systems was based on low capacity within sector\n            ministries. However, during KAPP I implementation, it became\n            clear that the stand alone project structures were not only\n            expensive and unsustainable, but also tended to distort the\n            incentives and other conditions for public civil servants.\n            As the capacity of sector ministries has improved over time,\n            the implementation of KAPAP will be mainstreamed within the\n            GoK structures, and aligned for sector coordination. The\n            results from the learning pilots under KAPP I have shown\n            that adoption of new technologies can increase if funds are\n            provided directly to empowered farmer groups for the\n            preferred extension approaches. Therefore, increased\n            provision has been made for investments in farmer\n            groups' subprojects under KAPAP."}, "docdt": "2009-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
