Pwver and Telecommunications Expansion ProJlects
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        At the request of Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) a
power and a telecommunications project have been appraised which consist of
the following:-
Powet Project
ii.       The Power Project consists of (i) the Rio Macho hydroelectric plant
expansion to add 60 MW of generating plant to the system; (ii) the raising of
the existing Cachi reservoir to its full level; (iii) transmission system ex-
tensions associated withi the added generating plant capacity.
iii.      The total cost of the project including interest during construction
is estimated at US$25.7 million equivalent of which the Bank has been requested
to finance US$12 million. ICE's total power expaasion program during 1968-1975
is estimated to cost about US$75 million including interest during construction.
iv.       The project is needed to meet forecast system demand in ICE's inter-
connected system by 1972 and is the most economical means of doing so. The
incremental rate of return on the nev investment would be about 15%.
Telecommunications Project
v.        The Telecommunications Project is part of ICE's second stage Tele-
communications Program (1967-1973). It consists of new automatic exchanae
equipment for 22,500 telephone lines, cable and line networks and long-distance
facilities to be completed over the four year period 1969 through 1973.
vi.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$9.5 million eauiva-
lent of vhich the Bank has been requested to finance US$6.5 million.   ICE's
total second stage telecommunications program during 1967-1973 is estimated
to cost about US$11.8 million. The proJect is required to meet a reasonable
growth of demand. The incremental rate of return on the new investment would
be about 17%.
Procurement and Disbursement
vii.      With the exceptions noted below, procurement would be made after
international bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines; disbursement. would
be for the foreign exchange cost of materials and equipment and the foreign
exchange component of civil vorks construction contracts and consulting ser-
vices.



viii.     Under Loan 346-CR Costa Rican suppliers were granted a 15% prefer-
on-e& for puraoses of bid comnarison. In order to compLy with the terms of the
Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development,
,rndAr the pronosed Loan supoliers from Central American Common Market (CACM)
member countries including Costa Rica would be granted a preference of 15% or
'ini nf the customs dutvy whichever is lower, for DurDoses of bid evaluation.
Contracts so awarded to Central American Common Market bidders would be finan-
-ed inder the nronosed 1oan. It is expected that about US$2.4 million euuiv-
alent of contracts may be involved under this arrangement; US$1.8 million for
the Power Projeet and U11.S6- million for the Telecommunications ProJect.
ix.       Tn nrder to meet power nvatem construction achedules ICE had to
start placing orders for equipment in January 1969. On the assumption that
the proposed loan is made. hbr mid 1(60 it mary be _neasrsy to reimburse TGE up
to US$500,000 for expenditures on equipment and materials made since January 1,

Projects show that internal cash generation net of deDt service would rinance
about 39% of total construction expenditures.
The Proposed Loans
xiii.     The two projects would be suitable for Bank loans totalling US$18.5
million. The proceeds of the loans would be allocated as follows:- (a) US$12
million equivalent for the Power Loan for a term of 25 years including a grace
period of 43 years; (b) US$6.5 million equivalent fqr the l'elecommunications
Loan for a term of 20 years also including a grAce period of 4½ years.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers hUe appraisal OI the power and teleeimications
expansion projects of the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) which
incl-ude (ii the Tapsati Power Project consisting of the addition of two 30 MW
generating units to the existing 30 MW Rio Macho Hydroelectric Station and
the construction of associaeed civil works and transmission facilities; the
installation of gates at the Cachi Hydroelectric Station to bring the reservoir
to its final level, and (ii) the Second Telecommunications Project consisting
of new automatic exchange equipment for 22,500 telephone lines, cable and
line netvorks and long-distance facilities for expanding existing systems and
serving new areas.
1.02      The estimated cost of the two projects is about US$37.5 million
equivalent of which US$25.7 million would be for the Power,Project and US$11.8
million for the Telecommunications Project. The Bank has 'oeau requested to
finance US$18.5 million equivalent of the cost including interest during con-
struction: US$12 million for Power and US$6.5 million for Tolecommunications.
The remainder would be financed from ICE's internal cash generation and by the
sale of bonds in Costa Rica.
1.03      The Borrower would be ICE to which the Bank has made two previous
loans aggregating US$30.8 million. The first loan (276-CR) of US$8.8 million
was made in January 1961 for the first stage of the Rio Macho Hydroelectric
Station (30 MW) and the installation of 8 MW at the Colima Diesel Station.
The second loan (346-CR) of US$22 million was made in July 1963 of which
US$12.5 million was used for Power Expansion and US$9.5 million to start the
formation of the Telecommunications System. The project financed by Loan
346-CR consisted of the first stage of the Cachi Hydroelectric Station (64 mW)
and associated transmission lines; and the construction of automatic telephone
exchanges, outside plant for about 35,000 telephones, and long-distance net-
works. The work financed under the previous loans has been satisfactorily
completed except for some minor telephone exchanges which are expected to be
completed during 1969. Both loans have been fully disbursed.
1.o4      The proposed Power and Telecommunications Projects are the logical
next steps in-the expansion of these systems to meet the increasing demAnd
for electric and telephone service. They were first discussed in December
1966 during a project supervision inspection. In October 1967 a loan appli-
cation and a feasibility report for the power pro.ect were sent to the Bank
by ICE. This was accompanied by a separate report by Societe Francaise d'Etudes
et de Realisations d'EauiDements Electriaues (SOFRELEC) as power consultants
to ICE. The project was discussed with ICE in Costa Rica in December 1967
.and asain in Washincton in Mav 1968 to obtain additional information. A fea-
sibility report and loan application for the Telecommunications Project were

2.  THE ELECTRIC POUWER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTORS
2.01      Costa Rica is one of the six Central American Republics and is
bordered oh the north by Nicaragua and on the south by Panama. It stretches
across the isthmus from the Cari4bean Sea to the Pacific Ocean (see Map 1).
It has a total area of 51,000 km- and a population of about 1.59 million of
which two-thiids live in the Cent5al Highlands at between 500 and 1,500 meters
elevation, in an area of 9,200 km where the climate is mild. The remainder
of the country is close to sea level and is mainly tropical in nature.
2.02      The economy o? Costa Rica is based mainly on agriculture, which
contributes about 26% to GDP. The importance of the manufacturing sector
has been increasing during recent years and has contributed about 21% to GDP
in 1968. The GNP, at 1962 prices, increased from US$503 million equivalent
in 1963 to an estimated US$674 million in 1968 or by about 6% per annum. Due
to the rapid population growth of about 3.5% per annum, however, per capita
GDP rose by only about 2.5%. It is expected that GDP will continue to grow
at about the same pace as in the recent past. While the industrial sector is
expected to substantially participate in this growth process, the annual growth
rates of the industrial sector are likely to be somewhat below those achieved
in the recent past, because the industrial import substitution process is
unlikely to continue to expand as rapidly as it has recently. This prospect
was taken into consideration when reviewing the proposed proJects.
Electric Power Facilities
2.03      The DrinciDal supplier of electric nower in Costa Rica ia ICE and
its subsidiary Cia Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL). About 94% of all power
generated is used in the central zone which has the canital city of San Jose
as its hub.  A series of transmission lines stretch from Puntarenas on the
Pacific coast to San JOae and to Turrislba nn the &"tern nlopne Of the Gentra.1
Highlands. This is known as the Interconnected System (see Map 2). All the
malor power generating stationg and several minor stationa are connected to
this system. The remainder of the country is served by a number of small iso-
lated diesel and hydroelectrie plants, some Of whinh TCE ewnq whil& the mainr-
ity are privately or municipally owned.
2.04      The total installed generating capacity in the country increased by
about 90% from   962-106?7   At the end 0f 1967 the total eapacity was nbout
216 MW of which ICE had 157 MW in 9 stations and CNFL 38 MW in 8 stations;
the remaining 21 MW w*weire a ditw4hiibaid avne%  a it"nhbr oee amoll mnt4+4ta.  PM

sold directly to retail customers tnrougn ICE's distrioution systems at Li4on
and Puntarenas and at other isolated locations.
Telecommunications Facilities
2.07      The major part of internal telecommunications facilities in Costa
Rica is provided by ICE. As in the case of electric power these facilities
are principally in the Central Zone of the country where the population is
concentrated. The long-distance system links this zone with the ports of the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and to the neighboring countries.
2.08      Most of ICE's telecommunication system was established and developed
under ICE's first stage program vhich was financed by loan 3X6-CR. The pro-
gram provided a modern automatic telephone system in the San Jose area, where
80% of the telephones in the country are located, and interconnection with
the main outlying towns. By December 31, 1968, there were 37,500 telephone
stations including 29,000 main subscriber stations; automatic stitching equip-
ment for 35,300 telephone line units had been installed in 24 exchanges. Sub-
scriber networks consist of primary underground duct and cable systems with
secondary extensions by overhead cables and pole lines.
2.09      Long distance arteries comprise underground carrier cable routes
between San Jose and the principal cities of the central plateau and microwave
radio links to Liberia, Limon, Puntarenas and to the border of Panama. Dis-
tant smaller exchanges are connected with provincial centers by VHF radio
links. An automatic trunk exchange equipped with 1000 circuits in San Jose
and the necessary trunking units in the local exchanges provide country-wide
subscriber trunk dialing (STD). All systems are modern and use high Perform-
ance equipment. Details are given in Annexes 9 and 10, and in the attached
Map 4.
2.10      International telecommunications are operated principally bv Radio-
grafica Costarricense S.A., a concessionary company owned jointly by ICE (50%)
and-nrivate shareholders.   Radiozrafica provides adequate and reasonably ef-
ficient interconnection for telephone, telegraph and telex services with North
Avme ra and EuronEp and, for the present. limited traffic with the rest of the
world.  It also operates 19 circuits of the regional interconnectilon network
smbv.-4,  the fhve et'nuntriea of the Central Ameriean Common Market (CAVM) And
Panama, developed recently by ICE on a temporary basis to cope wit3 increasing
demn-vd for serwvice.  The fnnrg iimportance of the CAGM hA Rti41lisAtd traf-

-5-
--g'u,tory Agency and Tariiff
2.12      Tne electric power and telecommunications industry 'i Ccost;a Rica Ls
reguliLted by the Electric Service Law enacted in 1941. The Law is o.dminis-
tered by the Servicio Nacional do Electricidad (SNE), which awards :zranchislts
for the producticn and distribution of electric energy and for operation of
telecommunications services subject to approval of Congress. SNE iin also ri.-
spons:.ble for the appraisal and regulation of tariffs and service stiandards,.
Tarif:" changes are subject to Government approval.
2.13      The tariff provisions of the Electric Service Law state thkat elec.-
trici';y and telecommunications tariffs shall be comjiuted to provide revenue i
suff4i!ient to cover the cost of the service including a fair compenniation f:)r
the uze of capital.
2.14      SNE has in the past authorized electric and telecommunications tar-
iffs  or ICE vhich were estimated to provide a rate of return of 7.5% on thl
net fi.xed assets in operation as required under Loan 346-CR. Telephtone rat !s
(see details in Annex 11) have been adequate to achieve this objectl.ve. As
regar(Is power, adjustments have not always been made in time and thu return
achieved were in general not quite satisfactory.  As a result of adJustment
made i.n February 1968, ICE's electric tariffs are adequate at presetit. To
meet 1;he financing needs for the proposed power and telecommunicati,ns pro-
jects rates of return higher than the 7.5% agreed upon between the 11ank and
ICE wv11 have to be reached in future years.  ICE would be able to iearn the!;e
higheV returns without adjustments to tariffs at present.
2.15      The matter of tariffs was discussed during negotiations aind assur-
ances obtained from ICE and the Government that a rate of return of not les

sufficient to enable it to fulfill the obligations of its new concei;sion co L-
tract. (See paragraphs 3.07 to 3.12 for CNFL's situation). For the. tele-
commut.ications section. assurances were obtained that the present level of
tarifis would not be reduced during the construction period of the program
withouct the Bank's consent, and that ICE should earn a return on nel; fixed
assets in operation of at least 11% from 1970 to 1972. Telephone trtiffs
would be reviewed after 1972 bv ICE and the Bank in the light of ICE"s fi-
nancit g requirements at that time. The Bank would also be given thn oppor-
tunitv to review tariffs which would apply to now services to be haudled bv
ICE stc.h as telegraph and telex and also any readjustments in rates to ensu 0
compli3ance with the agreed financing plan (see paragraph 5.21).

3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be ICE, a government-owned statutory corporation
established in April 1949 to plan and carry out a coordinated program of elec-
trification of the country. The law establishing ICE defines it as an autono-
mous organization which shall carry out its activities completely independent
of the Government except for the approval of tariffs.
3.02      By a Law No. 3226 of October 28, 1963, ICE was given the additional
responsibility and permanent concession to provide telecommunications services
in Costa Rica. The law authorizes ICE to unify these services and to acquire,
for this purpose, the rights and properties of the present concessionaires.
Organization and Management
3.03      ICE has a Board of Directors consisting of seven members appointed
b'r th. Pre.ident of the Republic. They serve stagwered 8-year terms. Accord-
ing to the law, at least three members must be engineers, one a lawyer, one an
economit and the last two must have acquired experience in the fields of fi-
nance, industry or agriculture. The members are eligible for reappointment.
This arranement heas worked very well and the Board has conducted the affairs
of ICE on a businesslike basis substantially free from political interference.
3.04      The Chief Executive officer of ICE is the General Manager who is
LprpoInted hy the Board, which also appoints the Denutv Manazer the Treasurer
and the Chief Auditor. All other officers are selected and appointed by the
General Man-ere ICE is satisfactorilv managed and operated: it has a capable
and experienced stsff which is able to construct the proposed power and tele-
comm-ications projeets and to o-r ate the ne    fatilitie..
3.05      ICE's ¶,wer aind teleommmu-nic4ations n-y,rati-nm are nrganiemd into
operating departments which are satisfactorily staffed and efficiently run.
Telecommicaltion operatio4s start-ed only in 1963 under the fi4rst teltecmmu-
nications program financed by Loan 346-CR. They were initially handled by a
technical section maimly 4      ^-h arr-o the contru-ti^_ -n putting  --to oper-
ation of the facilities. Due to the groving importance of the operational and
admi-istratiLve r-espoLs' 5bl'tI  of the teleco icai4c    seo   n, its     isna
gerial and technical staff iq being,progressively strengthened. The size of
the teleeommunications netwoArk is groving rapidly and the complexity of re-
gional and international operations is also increasing. These developments
point to the need for eparsting power and teleco--munications operatIon- & udr
independent and autonomous entities. A suitable time for accomplishing t#is
would be in asbout five years -w-hen higher management prsoi--e l o-r the telT-
communications section would have been trained.
3.06      Up to the end of 1968 the accounts of the power and telecommunications
sections were only partially separatted and no separate balance sheets were pro-
duced. During the appraisal of the proposed project it was agreed that in
future ICE will have completely separate accounts and financial statements for
power and telecommunications (see also paragraph 3.13). Due to the growing



7
complexity and importance of both power and telecommunication bperations (see
also paragraphs 3.07 to 3.12 on ICE's acquisition of CIPL), consideretion
should now be given to the steps to be. taken to achieve a more complete
financial and administrative separaticn between these tWo main activities to
fully reflect their size, importance, and costs. During negotiations ICE
agreed to take appropriate steps to progressively achieve a complete separa-
tion of the tio sections in the future.  It also agreed to coniult the Bank
baefore making any changes to the position of General Manager.
Cia Naciorka de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL)
3.07      in 1968 the Government authorized ICE, by law dated September 20.
1968, to purchase CNFL, the principal power distkibuting company in the country.
For"erly owned by Electric Bond & Shar Companv (EBASC0), CNFL serves San Jose
and the surrounding area and has operated in Costa Rica since 1928. The mat-
ters of principal interest to the Bank in ICE's acquislition of CNFL have to

3.09      CNFL will be regulated and its tariffs appraised by SNE as before.
Its new concessiLon contract approved by Congress el4iinates the r-strictions
previously imposed on the foreign owned company and brings CNFL under the
proviBions of the Electrie Sevrice Laww in common w-th all power ent5t;lis in
Costa Rica.
3.10      The purchase of CNFL was effected by ICE through a cash do%a-paYrmeLt
of US$1 million and the issuance of US$9.5 million 7_3/4d negotiable    %1ot e. -
deemable over a period of 17-1/2 years and guaranteed by the Government. The
Bank waR kept informed during the negotiations of this saule and had no ob-
jections to the terms and conditions. CNFL's new concession contract. providEs
that it be granted tariffs sufficient to maintain axrunugs at a iGl which
would permit it to carry out the investments in its distribution netw-rk nec-
essary to serve future power demand and to provide ICE with the   undus for
meeting the debt service payments to EBASCO. CNFL would not be requi1xed to
construct additional generating stations as it would continue to purciaue
from ICE all future power requirements above those provided by its ova gener-
ating plants.
3.11      CNFL's present earnings would not be sufficient to meet the finan-
cial obligations outlined above. CNFL plans to sell ¢3 million bonds during
1969 to make up the difference. In addition, ICE is studying hoW to tgiange
the structure of CNFL's tariff schedules to increase revenues without having
a declared tariff increase, which would be politically unacceptable bocause
of the tissurance given Congress that there would be no immediate incrtsse



- 8 -
after it approved the new concession contract for CNFL. It is estimated that
the rescheduling of tariffs would result in about a 7% increase in gross reve-
nues. If the proposal under study materializes, CNFL would be placed in a
satisfactory financial position in 1970. SNE is aware of these plans to in-
crease earnings.
3.12      Since CNFL has only just started to operate under its new concession
contract it is difficult to forecast operating costs. Also, since its assets
may be undervalued, it is not possible at present to determine a specific rate
of return which would allow CNFL to meet all its obligations. This matter was
discussed during negotiations and assurances obtained from the Government and
ICE, that CNFL will be granted the level of tariffs permitted in its concession
contract (see paragraph 3.10). Annex 4 gives details of CNFL's financial sit-
uation.
Accounts and Audit
3.13      ICE keeps its accounts on a calendar year basis.    For several years
ICE's auditors have been Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. ICE's accounting prac-
tices. especially the allocation of overhead charges and the separation of
the accounts for power and telecommunication operations, have been the subject
of discussions between ICE and the Bank for some time.    The auditors hsue nor.
agreed also to advise ICE on accounting methods and procedures and to give
their oninion on the financial statements of ICE as a whole and of it, piwer
and telecommunications divisions separately. This arrangement is satisfactory
to the Bank.   This matter was discussed during negotiations and assurAnt,.

3.16      ICE's fixed assets are fairly valued. Net fixed assets are re-
corded at original cost loss straight-line depreciation and adjustments were
made when the Colon was last devalued in 1961.
3.17      ICE's capital consists mainly of contributions made by the Govern-
ment through the year 1967 in the form of equipment, the proceeds of certain
taxes, and budget appropriations. These contributions have now reached ¢155
million and no further government contributions are to be expected. The re-
mainder of the capital was furnished by ICE's telephone clients in the form
of non-refundable subscriber connection fees. Reserves comprise reserves for
contingencies and capital development accounts which represent the accumulated
earned surplus to date. No dividends are paid by ICE.
3.18      To carry out its sizeable expanaion program ICE has had to rely to
a large extent on debt financing which caused the debt/equity ratio to change
from 43/57 at the end of 1964 to 60/liO at the end of 1968. Details of the
long-term debt are shown in Annex 2. Of the total debt 48% is owed to the
Bank undr Jonens 276-CR and 346-CR. 17% is owed to local bondholderi4. 16% to
EBASCO far tho purchaae of C-nF, and 19% to various other qrrditcrs.

3.19      During the past four years ICE has successfully tapped the local
capital market by floating 8% 10-year or 20-year bonds at an average annual
rate of about 013 million. Some of these bonds carry a repurchase agreement
which obliges ICE to repurchase them after due notice. Up to nov ICE has not
encountered any difficulty in immediately reselling all repurchased bonds.
ICE's bonds are well rated in the market, and are being quoted at par. At
the Bank's request ICE has agreed to limit the amount of bonds sold with a
repurchase agreement to 40% of the total amount of bonds outstanding at any-
time. During negotiations ICE formally confirmed this agreemnt.
3.20      ICE's current position has been tight over the past years. At the
end of 1968 the current liabilities of 047.7 million and 026.6 million of bonds
placed with a repurchase agreement exceeded the current assets of 067.0 mil-
lion by 07.3 million. Since thon the situation has improved somewhat due to
refunding of short-term obligations. In view of the fact that ICE has found
no difficulties to immediately reselling all bonds repurchased, ICE's current
position appears manageable.
Earnings Record
3.21      Summaries of the audited income statements for the four fiscal years
1965 throu,h 1968 are shovn in Annex 3. Under the conditions of Loan 346-CR
ICE is required to earn a return of not less than 7.5% on its investment in
pover falelitll s durina, each fiscal year beoinning January 1. 1964. and a re-
turn of not less than 7.5% on its investment in telecommunication facilitles

the program are:
(i)  The start of construction in 1972 of a new thermal
plant (50 MW-) and a new hydro plant (120 MW) for
services in 1975 and 1977, respectively.
(ii)  The construction of further,transmission and dis-
tribution system facilities to meet system demand.
(iii) The construction of an office building.
Rio Macho Extension (Tapanti Project)
4.03      The Rio Macho (30 MW) hydroelectric station, which was constructed
under Loan 276-CR in 1961, formed the first step in the utilization of the
Reventazon River and its tributaries for power generation. At that time the
tunnels for the Rio Macho statton were sized for an ultimate installed capac-
ity of 120 MW. The proposed Project is one of two steps previously envisaged
to extend the Rio Macho station. The final step would consist of the instal-
lation of a fourth 30 MW unit.
4.04      Map 3 shows the proposed Project and the existing Rio Macho Project.
The proposed Project would consist of the construction of an intake at Grande
de Tapanti in the upper reaches of the Reventazon River to divert its waters
into a 14.5 km 3.62 meter diameter tunnel also to be constructed to join the

8wwitchyard, additions to transformer Capacicy, anud control aud metering equip-
ment.
Cachi Reservoir
4.08      The Cachi hydroelectric station (64 MW) was constructed under Loan
34O-CR and the thin arch dam was built to its full height but the gates were
not installed in the spillway. It is now proposed to carry out this work which
would consist of (i) constructing a grout curtain in the left abutment of the
dam above the present reservoir water level and (ii) installing gates in the
spillway. This work wouild raise the3reservoir elevation by 20 meters and in-
crease the storage by 50.5 million m , which would enable the existing pl4nt
to generate about 32 G-Wh more annually. During the time that the reservoir
was being operated at its maximum level some 8 MW of additional capacity would
also be obtained from the existing plant due to the increased head. However,
the principal advantage of raising the res9rvoir would be t9 obtain the addi-
tional energy already referred to above.
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.09      In order to convey the poaer generated at the Rio Macho and Cachi
statiomi to the consumers, it will be necessawy for ICE to make miscellaneous
transmivsion and distribution line extensions;and to construct associated
substati.ons. The total cost of these works is estimated US$1.8 million equiva-
lent or less than 8% of the total cost of the project.

The cost estimates are reasonable and adequate. Equipment costs are based
upon known costs for the recently completed Ccehi (64 MW) hvdroelectric sta-
tion, adjusted for estimated price increases. The civil works costs are
based on unit costs now being eperiened for work on ar-cess roads; tunnel

the engineering with its own staff and intends to carry out the construction
work which has already been started, -with its own crews.  This arrange-ent
has been satisfactory in the past and would be acceptable for the proposed
project.

weurnces -cre obtained %mrAu,-  negot'ioU I.U5 .L#-i WX.n.L  to employ
experienced consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to
assist ila probelems associated with the uesign ana construction or tne Project,
as well as, for system studies and management and accounting matters for ICE
L.14      Construction work on the proposed project was started in 196T with
the building of access roads and tunnel adits, and in 1968 work was started
on parts of the main tunnel. rhis was necessary in order to meet the construc-
tion schedule which is designed to achieve completion of the project by mid
1972 when it will be urgently required to meet forecast system demand. This
schedule is realistic and can be met provided the procurement of equipment and
material can go forward as planned.
4.15      ICE proposes to follow its usual custom of procuring all equipment
and materials for the project through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. In the past the Bank
has agreed that ICE give Costa Rican suppliers a 15% preference vhen making
the evaluation of international bids. During negotiations when this matter
was discussed ICE advised the Bank that in May 1969 a Central American Agree-
ment on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development became effective. Under
this agreement even though ICE is exempt from the payment of customs duties
it would be obliged to give preference to suppliers from all member countries
of the Central American Common Market by adding 50% of the import duties, lev-
ied by Costa Rica on imports by non-exempt agencies, to the bids from non
member countries when making bid comparisons. It was therefore agreed during
negotiations to allow ICE to give suppliers from Central American Common Market
member countries including Costa Rica a preference of 15% or 50% of the import
duty whichever was the lover. The items most likely to be found competitive
under this arrangement are cement, reinforcing steel, tires, fuel and welding
rods. An amount of up to US$1.8 million equivalent of contracts for materials
and equipment might be avarded under the above procedure to suppliers in Costa
Rica. Of this, the foreign exchange component is estimated at rather over
US$800,000 and the local currency component at just under US$1.0 million. How-
ever, the cement industry in Costa Rica is already having difficulties in meet-
ing local demand, and this may mean that additional cement requirements have to
be met from imports. In that event, the amount of local cost financing under
the proposed Bank loan would be reduced to under US$500,000.
4.16      In order to meet the construction schedules it has also been neces-
sary to invite tenders for most of the major equipment and large contracts for
materials. Some of these contracts have to be awarded durinz the first half
of 1969 before the proposed loan could be made effective. ICE has made com-
mitments of about US$0.4 million to date. It was agreed during negotiations
to allow up to US$500,000 for retroactive disbursements from the proposed loan
to finance initial and progress payments for those contracts made after Janu-
ary 1, 1969.
4.17      Disoursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made for the cost
of equipment and materials and the foreign exchange components of the e-st
works and consultants contracts.                                       c iViL-

4.22      Tne sales forecast prepared by ICE for the Intterconnected   stl;m
was discussed extensively during the Bank's supervision visits in D#cbnr
1966 and 1967.  It has been modified several times to refleet cerikez in tkhe
economic situation in Costa Rica.  The present forecast for 1969-1975 r-hor.ring
an average annual growth of 9.3% in sales is realistic and conservati.v-Xs   of
industrial development exceeds the forecast level the growth could acceleraee
to about 10% per annum.
4.23      The Interconnected System is supplied by power generated by t,;he
plants of the various distributing companies serving the system plus pa.r
these same companies purchase in bulk from ICE.   In 1968 all po-er pl.rnsts
other than those belonging to ICE were producing their maximum outplut. Thus
in future, all growth in sales for the Interconnected System will have to be
supplied by ICE. As time goes on the plants of the distributing companien



will tend to become less efficient so that their outputs will decline until
they are ultimately retired completely. Annex 7 gives the actual and forecast
s-les for ICE alone. It shows that from 1965-1968 the average annual growth
of sales was 10.6% and that the forecast annual grodth in sales from 1969-1975
will average 11.4%-
EstimRate of Demp-rd
4.24      The climate in the area served by the Interconnected System is rela-
tively stable throughout the year, therefore the system load factor is fairly
constant. The annual load factor wan about 50% in 1962 wnd has improved to
52% at the present time due to the growth of industry during the past 6 years.
T+ is expected that- the load factor will imprmove aradu a1v during the next 5
years.
4.25      The actual and forecast system demand and inste.lled capacity from
19 Y6,5-197m 'F5 is given in  _-ex 8.  It will- be seen that- tvo f'orecaf-ts are madae:
(i) the "low level" which takes into consideration a probable slow-down in
the pace of industria1 impo-t substi+vution, And (i) the "high level" which
assumes that industrial import substitution would continue at about the same
[-t1, reecent past. The aver,mig     D  increase in deim-nd frnm 1962-
rate as inL u"e  lw                  _ge
1968 was 7.6% and the "high level" forecast from 1969-1975 gives an average
annual increase of 8.5, while the "low level" forecast g4ves a   a.-rae a-
nual increase of 7.5%. The "low level" forecast has been used in the sales

maximum demand will just be met in 1972 when the proposed project is scheduled
to be completed. However, if system demand i"ncreases at the 'high level"
shown La the upper curve there will be a critical period from late 1971 until
the proposed project is compleeed in 1972.  It is expected that whIle som0
power shortage may occur during this period the situation will be manageable.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that the proposed project m-.,ist move forward as
scheduled if serious power shortages are to be avoided.: This iB the reason
ICE started preliminary work in 1966, and has now in-vited tenders for equip-
ment and materials (see comments under procurement paragraph 4.16).
Analysis of System Plant Additions
4.27      ICE with the assistance of SOFRELEC has made a detailed analysi,s of
the various alternatives of system development to meet fore-sat demand through
1975. In essence this involved eight different combinations or programs of
hydroelectric plant and thermal plant devlopment.   Comparisone were made
between the alternatives by discounting the total capital and operating costs
at various interest rates for the period up to the year 2OUv. fThe proposed
project which would be followed by a thermal project was demonstrated to be
the best of the programs studied.



4.28      The proposed Tapanti project was compared with an alternative thermal
plant of equivalent capaclty. The discounted cai4h flow comparison on a pro-
ject basis gave 12% as the equalizing interest rate, showing that the proposed
hydroelectric project would be economically prererred as long as the cost of
capital is below that rate.
Rate of Return of the Project
4.29      The incremental rate of .beturn on the new assets of the proposed
Tapanti project was calculated by quantifying incremental net revenues attri-
butable to the project and by valuing the output at current tariffs. The cal-
culations show that the revenues from the new investment would yield a rate of
return of 14.5%. The influence of risk on this result was tested by assuming
increases in construction cost of about 10%, in operating cost of about 20X,
and by assuming that the plant would reach its maximum output after 8 instead
of 5 years. Even under these conditions the rate of return remained above
12.5%.

rate of reture which was 7.6% in 1968 would increase to about 8.3% in 1969
and 10.8% in 1Q71. There vould be a doeline to aboust 9,     in 1972 anA 1973

4.32      ICE's financial needs and the fact that no further Government con-
tribAio     -~can be             ---ecte7 (see  a.17) mae  i  u ----_fiy ffor ICE to
earn a minimum rate of return of 9% beginning in 1970. During negotiations
an unde-taking was obtaUned froA ICE and the Uovernment that ICE -will apply
for and the Government will cause ICE to be granted, tariffs which would give
ICE an nnua1 rate of rexurn of not less tha-n 9  Deginning in 9Yfu.
4.33      interest would be covered 1.8 to 2.5 timee by income before interest
in the 1969-1975 period. Debt service coverage is tight in the years 1969
and 1970 due to the substantial amount of medium-term debt already contracted
by ICE,i Internal cash generation would cover debt service 1.3 tim,es in 1969
and ±970.  Tne ratio would tnen improve rrom 1.4 in 1971 to 1.y in ly-97  wnlcn
is more satisfactory.
4.34      ICE's debt management ha;X given cause for concern in the past.  Du-
ring negotiations for Loan 346-CR a debt limitation covenant was agreed upon
in the form of an earnings test which allows ICE, without Bank approval, to
incur debt as long as its overall power and telecommunications earnings for
a past 12 months period would cover overall maximum debt service 1.5 times.
On the basis of this test ICE would not at present be qualified to assume any
of the debt proposed in the financing plan for the proposed project. However,
as the financing plan is satisfactory, it was agreed during negotiations that
the Bank agree to the 037.5 million bond issues required to finance part of the
local cost of the proposed project. The major part of these bonds would be
issued in 1969-1971, i.e. 015 million in 1969 and ¢7.5 million each in 1970
and 1971. Based on past experience ICE should not encounter difficulties in
placing these bonds. The debt limitation covenant under Loan 346-CR has been
repeated under the proposed loan with the only modification being that the
test be applied separately to ICE's power and telecommunications operations.
The debt limitation covenant would also have to be applied to CNFL since it
is now a subsidiary of ICE.

5. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTION
The Telecommunications Project
5.01      ICE's second telecommunications program provides for a total ex-
penditure of US$11.8 million equivalent over the 1967-73 period. The program
is the logical next step in expanding the domestic telecommunications systems
which were started under Loan 346-CR.
5.02      Part of the above program is already financed. In 1967 and 1968,
tovwards the end of the project financed by Loan 346-CR, ICE had to install in
advance about 5,000 lines and some additional channeling equipment, which
were originally planned as part of the next stage. This was to prevent sat-
uration of the new facilities provided under the first program for which de-
mand and use proved much higher than anticipated. In 1967, ICE started con-
struction of this part of the program, after consultation with the Bank. at a
cost of approximately US$1.6 million equivalent. ICE arranged suppliers'
credits for approximately US$0.5 million, and the balance of the funds were
secured through other borrovwings. Construction is scheduled for completion
in 1969.
5.03      The proJect for which ICE is nov requesting Bank financing is the
remaining portion of the domestic program scheduled for construction from the
second half of 1969 throuih 1973. It provides for a total capital expenditure
of US$9.5 million during the four and a half year period. The proposed Bank
loan would cover US$6.5 million for procurement in foreign exchange. The
main items included in the Bank project are the expansion of local and long
distance telenhone systems and the establishment of a modern network for telex
and telegraph services.
5.04      International telecommunications facilities will have to be expanded
over the same priod (Annex 17). Sorvee to eountries outside Cantral America
is adequate, but service to CACM countriep will require considerable strength-
ening. A Central Amrican 'numunie aLti nst Notirrnvk h^- hbn pnronp^-   to fi I
this need. Final arrangements for the network are still to be agreed to by the
CACM cointries, aa,d it is epected that IrE will play an important part in
the construction and operation of Costa Rica's portion of the project. ICE
4 11 hae taoa scon'ent- before incv-rin- ,, debt in connection
with the financing of the network. This will permit the Bank to review and

of 1968 to 64,ooo at the end of 1973, or an avetageiannual growth of 11%. The
urban networks and outside plant in the exchange areas will also be expanded
to keep in line with the increased capacity of the exchanges. A detailed list
or the proposed extensions and the schedule for completion of the exchange
installations are given on pages 3 and 4 of Annex 10.
5.o6      The project also provides for the expansion of multiplexing equip-
ment on the existing backbone microwave and coaxial routes. The planned trunk
circuit increases take into account the traffic growth observed on existing
links and the development of local systems. In addition, about 24 small ca-
pacity VHF links will be installed between distant exchanges or isolated public
telephones and the principal microwave stations. Details of the routes are
shown on Map 4. Trunk switching equijpment will be added in San Jose and in
the main exchanges to terminate a total of 300 new long-distance circuits and
to provide automatic interconnection for all subscribers within Costa Rica.
Telex and Telegraph Facilities
5.07      A 400-line automatic telex exchange for local subscribers and trunk
circuits would be installed in San Jose, and two small 50-line telex exchanges
in Limon and Puntarenas. Subscriber telex stations would be provided in these
cities and equipment for distant telex subscribers would permit the c,onnection
of about 50 isolated stations :in 15 cities. The proJect also includes a number
of teleprinters and trunk telex circuits which would be installed in and be-
tween the principal cities. In cooperation with the Government Telegraph De-
partment, the telex network would be used for public telegraplh between the
telegraph offices of the principal cities. This would greatly improve tele-
graph service in Costa Rica, which is presently obsolete and inadequate.
Program Costs
5.08      Details of the cost estimates of the second stage program (1967-1973)
showing separately the proposed Bank-financed works to be realized from 1969
through 1973 under the project, and the projected yearly expenditures, are

5.10      IWE proposes to ro±±ow its usual practice or procuring equipment.
and materials through international competitive bidding. The issue of local
preference does not arise. However, in respect of equipment required to extend
existing telephone exchanges and long distance systems up to their planned
capacity, estimated at about USO$1 million, ICE proposes to procure from the
original suppliers equipment of the type presently installed.
5.11      This is the most practical way to obtain the needed capacity and at
the same time make Null use of the available common equipment. Procurement
from other manufacturers would involve the planning of separate systems which
would require duplicating common units, extra building space for new equipment,
installing junction units, transferring or scrapping unused materials, etc.
IThese added costs, estimated at about 30%, would outweigh the possible gains
from international competitive bidding, particularly in this case where the
prices of extension units would be based on the prices in contracts awarded
after international competitive bidding under Loan 346-CR, which, at about
US$90 per line in large exchanges and US$80 per line in small exchanges, were
and would continue to be highly competitive. In negotiating the prices for
the extension equipment, ICE will take into account these earlier prices and
also the price levels set for other similar equipment for which tenders will
be issued. The proposed method to ensure the competitiveness of the prices
negotiated is realistic. ICE could seek supplier financing for these instal-
lations as an alternative to Bank financing. This was done for the extensions
already carried out (see paragraph 5.02), but ICE's heavy debt service obli-
gations make such financing unsuitable (see paragraphs 5.22 and 6.02). Equip-
ment for both new and extended installations of the proJect have therefore
been included in the proposed loan. All contracts to extend installations
procured under Loan1356-CR will be subJect to Bank approval and in each case
ICE will be required to produce satisfactory evidence of the reasonableness of
the negotiated costs.
5.12      During neaotiations it was agreed that the mreference to suppliers
from CACM member countries described in paragraph 4.15 under the Power Project
would also applv to the Telerenmuninations Proiect- It in likely that about
us$o.6 million equivalent of contracts for telephone cables would be awarded
under this arrangement to suppliers in CACM countries other than Costa Rica.

under the first project and a detailed survey of the requirements. It has been



drawn up to satisfy essential demand and is based on the use of well structured
and efficient modern systems which provide the required capacity with the low-
east investment and operating cost.
5.15      For planning local systems, in addition to its own statistical ob-
servations and forecasts, ICE carried out an on site survey of the number of
potential commercial and residential subscribers in each town, and then studied
local industrial and urban development projects and population trends in order
to determine the probable growth rate of demand. Detailed forecasts and plan-
ning were prepared in each case, and adjustments to the program can easily be
accommodated if necessary. The predicted grovth rate in number of telephones,
which averages 11% per year, is conservative. Telephone density would in-
crease from the present 2.0 to 3.1 telephones per hundred population by 1975.
International comparisons which have shown a high correlation between tele-
phone density and GNP per capita, would indicate a potential density of 4 to
4.5 telephones per hundred population for a country at Costa Rica's stage of
development (GNP per capita in 1968 estimated at US$450).
5.16      Long distance systems are at an early stage of development.  ICE is
presently making a careful analysis of the traffic and of the use of the new
facilities. Annual growth rate of trunk calls was more than 40% in 1968, how-
ever, this growth rate is not indicative of future demand since the systems
have been established only recently. The experience in other countries is
that the rate of growth of long-distance calls is as much as twice as high as
the growth rate of telephones when quality of service is good. The new sys-
tems and extensions have been designed to eliminate present congestion of
certain links and to cope with an expected traffic growth of about 18% up to
1974, which is conservative and reasonable.
5.17      The telex project is limited to facilities in and between three
l.rge cities and the principal provincial towns where business, trade and pub-
lic administration are concentrated. The anticipated demand was surveyed in
detail by ICE with all prospective customers.  The new network will replace
the present temporary network of private circuits. In addition, the telex
net+work vi1l be utilized for the nublic telegraph service between the main
cities and for international traffic. The government has assigned a high
priority to the improvwment Of this service.
Ba+e    Rtw R-l-
5.18      The incremental rate of return on the new investment for the pro-
posed expansion of telecommunications services is about 16.9% (see Annex 18).
.Tis rate of return has been caleulated using estimates of coat And incre-
mental net revenues derived from ICE's projections, and excludes benefits to
telecommunaications *users i excess of the ratea they p-a f  -+ the sevice-
These additional benefits can be expected to be considerable in a country like
Costa Riea, in which the main center of co4 = rcial, industrial ead ad-inis-
trative activity, San Jose, is removed from the main import/export centers
(Puntarenas and ruerto Limon) and from the more dynamic agricultural areas in
the south and in Guanacaste (Map 1). The project is economically justified.

of return would improve to about 14% in 1972, decrease to about 13.5% in the
following two years due to large asdditions to operating capacity, and then im-
prove to about 14% in 1975. The average rate for the whole period would be
5.21      in order to avoid a casn deficit in tne years 9LY7u to 1972, it will
be necessary for ICE to earn a rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
of not less then 11% during these years. Assurances were obtained during ne-
gotiations from ICE and the government that ICE's present tariffs will not be
reduced without the Bank:s consent before 1972 and that ICE will seek and the
government will authorize any tariff increases necessary to maintain a return
of at least 11 in hne years 1y9u to 1yf7. After 1y-9e, this rate of return
will be reviewed by ICE, the government and the Bank taking into consideration
ICEls investment program and financial position.
5.22      Interest would be covered 1.4 to 2.7 times by income before interest.
Debt service coverage is tight in the years 1969 through 1971 due to the sub-
stantial amount of short and medium'term debt (including suppliers' credits)
contracted by ICE to finance construction and expansion of the telephone sys-
tem. However, with the Bank's consent, ICE has arranged suitable refinanfing
of the shorter maturities of its debt. Debt service coverage would be unsat-
isfactory until 1972. The ratio would be 0.9 in 1969, 1.3 in 1970, and then
would improve from 1.4 in 1971 to 2.1 in 1975, which is satisfactory.
t
5.23      As already mentioned in paragraph 4.34, the debt limitation covenant
under Loan 346-CR would at present not allow ICE to incur additional debt for
its telephone operations.  Hovever, as the proposed financi*g plan appears
satisfactory it was agreed during negotiations that the Bank would permit a
5, million bond issue in conjunction with the proposed Bank loan. The debt
limitation covenant under Loan 346-CR was repeated in the proposed Telecommuni-
cations Loan.

6. FINANCING PLAN AND FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION FOR ICE'S POWER
- ~  ~rMI ^  &kT1f r^TTT9A Mrl  e  fImtM-r,TO. flf¶WflTW1T%
Proposed Financing Plan
6.01      The financing plans for the proposed power and telecommunications
projects show that internal cash generation net of debt service would finance
about 36% of the applications of funds and about 39% of ICE's total construc-
tion expenditures. To a large extent ICE will have to rely on borrowings to
carry out its investment progrfm and meeting its other obligations.  Borrowings
will total 0213.7 miLlion (US$.J2.2 million) and will provide about 5:c or all
funds required. The overall financing plan is acceptable. A forecast of
sources and applications of funds for ICE as a whole for seven years 1969-1975
is given in Annex 21.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.02      The income statement projections for ICE's combined operations
(Annex 22) show that earnings during the seven years 1969 through 1975 would
be satisfactory. Interest would be covered in the forecast period 1969-1975
between 1.7 and 2.6 times by income before interest which is satisfactory.
The debt service coverage, though unsatisfactory in 1969 and 1970, gradually
improves to a satisfactory level in 1975 when debt service would be covered
2.Q0    times by internal cash generation.  (For the proposed debt limitation cov-
enant see paragraphs 4.34 and 5.23 and for debt service requirements Annex 23.)
6.03      Forecast balance sheets for the period 1969 to 1975 are shown in
Annex 24. Total net fixed assets during these seven years would increase from
0535 million at-the end of 1968 to 0955 million at the end of 1975, or by about
80%. ICE4s eauity would more than double during this period, reaching 0567
million by,the end of 1975 whereas outstanding long-term debt would only in-
crease by about 32% to 0510 million. The debt/equity ratio is therefore ex-
pected to improve steadily from 60/40 at the end of 1968 (during which year
the debt for the purchase of CNFL was incurred) to 47/53 by the end of 1975
which is satisfactory. ICE's current position which improved during NM is
expected to improve further in the coming years.                     1969
Security
6.o4      At present. practically all properties of ICE are encumbered in one
way or another. The Bank's first two loans are secured by mortgages on prop-
erties used for the power and telecommunications systems. It was agreed during
negotiations that the proposed loans also be secured by existing mortgages on
prnnertie8 used for the power and telecommunications svstems and/or by extend-
ing existing mortgages.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      The following principal agreements were reached during negotiations:-
(i) The Government and ICE agreed that:
(a)  electricity tariffs vould be established to enable ICE
to earn a return of not less than 9% on net fixed assets
in operation beginning 1970;
(b)  electricity tariffs would be established to enable CNFL
to fulfill the obligations of its new concession contract;
and,
(c)  telecommunications tariffs would be established to enable
ICE to earn a return of at least 11% on net fixed assets
in service from 1970 to 1972, and that the rate of return
for later years would be reviewed by ICE, the Government
and the Bank before the end of '1972; tariffs will not be
reduced without the Bank's consent before 1972.
(ii) ICE agreed to restrict the amount of bonds sold with a repur-
chase agreement to 40% of the bonds outstanding.
(iii)  ICE agreed to inform the Bank of any impending change in the
position of its General Manager and to give the Bank an oppor-
tunity to comment.
(iv)  The Bank agreed to grant suppliers from Central American Common
Market member countries, including Costa Rica, a preference of
15% or 50% of the customs duty whichever is lower when comparing
international bids.
(v) The Bank agreed to allow up to US$500.000 equivalent under the
prcposed pover project for retroactive disbursement for con-
tracts made after Januarv 1, 1969.
(vi) The Bank aureed to all oi ICE to award eauinment contracts for
about US$1 miglion for the extension of existing telephone.in-
atAllatoinn  nn a negotiated basis using funds from the pronosed
loan provided that satisfactory evider4ce is produced regarding
the reasonableness of the neffgntiated prices sad the pnrposed
contract awards are approved by the Bank in each case.

1.        Prior to being taken over by ICE, Cl rF was a private compaiy and
operated under a concession contract which imposed restrictions which may
have influenced the value given its fixed assets and caused distortions in
the financial statements. Consequently condensed balance sheets and income
statements for the years 1965, 1966, 1967 and of September 30, 1968 are
given simply as a matter of record. The results shown therein do not
necessarily give any indication of CNFL's future operatimng results under
its new concession contract which eliminates the previous restrictions and
places CNFL under the Electricity Law along with all other electric utilities
in Costa Rica.
2.        During the appraisal of the proposed project forecast income and
cash flow statements were prepared by CNFL. It became evident from an
analysis of these forecasts that CNFL would not be able to meet its financial
obligations under the new concession contract which require it to provide
from internal cash generation sufficient funds to finance distribution system
expansion and to pay such dividends to ICE which would enable the latter to
make the debt service payments to EBASCO, the former owners of CNFL. In
order to overcome the shortage of internal cash generation during 1969 CNFL
will sell bonds on the local market.
3.        For the long term solution CNFL is studying its tariff schedules
and expects to be able to change these during 1970 to obtain a more equitable
distribution of charges between domestic and industrial customers. At the
same time about a 7% increase in gross revenues is expected to result from
those tariff changes. The forecast financial statements of this annex are
based on that assumption and show that CNFL would be able to meet its
obligations on this basis.

4.        The transmission facilities installed for STD during the first
stage are beginning to show signs of congestion during peak hours prlnci-
pally between the main cities of the central plateau and between San Jose,
Limon and Puntarenas. It will be necessary to expand them to handle pro-
jected traffic. Equipment on existing routes installed during the first

cases will be limited to additional channeling equipment. Map h shows
the existing main long distance links and the proposed expansion.
C. Local Telegraph
5.        Local telegraph service is provided by the Bureau of Telegraphs
and Radio, a Department of the Interior Ministry, which also provides a
limited radio telegraph service to other Central American countries. Domes-
tic telegraph network and installation operated by this dePartment is ob-
solete and insufficient. The Bureau rents some of its lines from ICE.
There are no switching facilities for domestic telex service in Costa Rica.
After completion of the second stage program, it is envisaged to use ICE's
domestic telex network for public teleeraDh between the principal cities.
This will result in largely improving and rehabilitating telegraph service
within the country.

TAR IF FS
1. General Tariffs Structure
The present tariffs, which were reviewed by the Bank under Loan
346-CR, were approved by SNE in September 1967 and are in force until the
middle of 1969. The tariffs include a monthly rental, which entitles the
subscriber to a specified number of call units, and a charge for call
units in excess of this limit. Subscribers are divided into three
categories:
1.   Duplex (two-party line);
2.   Residential; and,
3.   Commercial.
Metering is applied for local and long-distance calls based on registration of
pulses in call units in the subscribers' meters. The subscribers are
charged accordingly on the basis of 00.10 per unit pulse. Basic duration of
local calls is five minutes which are metered as one call unit or pulse, and
so on per subsequent five minute calls. Long distance calls within the
country are charged in relation to distance and duration. Duration of call
units in interurban service is reduced as the call distance increases.
Lower tariffs apply in off-peak hours. Representative telephone rates as at
November 1968 are set out in paragraph 2 below. These tariffs reflect costs
adequately, although the structure is somewhat complicated. The local
service rates are not out of line with those in other developing countries, ex-
ceot for the rather low e-ll eharge, which iA enqiivA1Ant toa aboult US cents 15
per five minute call. ICE expects that SNE will authorize the continuation
of these tariffs, with some adiustments to simnlifv their structure. during
1969, and in successive years.

COSTA RICA
ICE - TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTION
International Services and Proposed Central American Communications Network
1.        International communications are operated by Radiografica Costa-
rricense, S.A. (see para. 2.10) which has the concession for international
services to countries outside Central America until 1978. ICE holds 50%
of the shares of the company and is not directly concerned with the develop-
ment of its facilities which are presently adequate and sufficient to meet
the demand for these services.
2.        In addition to its domestic program, ICE will be involved in a
project of the five Central American Common Market (CACI') countries for
international communications within the region. This consists of a high
capacity microwave link between Guatemala, San Salvador, Tegucigalpa
(Honduras), Managua (Nicaragua), and San Jose, with extension links
towards the Mexican border from Guatemala and the Panamanian border from
San Jose. The regional network is being advanced pursuant to the Central
American Communications Treaty which was ratified by Costa Rica in 1967.
Costa Rica is represented by ICE on the Regional Technical Communications
Commission (COMTELCA), created by the Treaty. COMTELCA has prepared a
feasibility study and is in charge of coordinating the project. COMTELCA's
Permanent Secretariat is housed in ICE's Telecommunications Department in
San Jose and ICE's staff had a major role in preparation of the study.
The project is considered of high economic priority by all CACIH countries.
3.        The attached statements, which are taken from the feasibility
study from the COVITELGA nroiect. show the forecast income statements
and sources and applications of funds for Costa Rica's section of the
project. The total estimated cost of the Droject excluding interest
during construction is US$11.8 million equivalent of which Costa Rica's
portion would be TTS$2.5 million equivalent   CA-RE! has agreed in prin-
ciple to extend loans to each participating country to finance both
local and foreign  costs of its portion of the network.
4.        In August 1968, an international call for tenders from pros-
pective suppliers of equipment was made. The scheduled completion
datie for the network is 1971 and operations are expected to commence
in 1972. The study assumes that foreign currency expenditures will






AiiiiEX i7
Page 2 of 3 pages
be financed with a 20-year loan (including four years grace) with an
interest of 7%, and local currency expenditures will be financed with
an li-year loan (including 5 years of grace) with an interest of 8%.
If the assumptions of the forecast are realized, the network will
earn a return of 13.2% on net fixed assets in operation in 1972, its
first year of operation and higher thereafter. Debt service coverage
will be 1.2 times in the year 1974, in which repayment on both loans
is assumed to start, and increases thereafter.
5.        Final construction, financing, and operating arrangements
for the network are still to be agreed to by the CACM countries.
As is explained in para. 4.34h ICE will not be in a position to
incur additional debt without the Bank's consent. This circumstance
will permit the Bank to exercise adequate supervision over the scope
of ICE's eventual commitments and responsibilities in connection
with the proposed COMTELCA project.

COSTA RICA
ICE - TELECOMYiUNICATIONS SECTION
Cost Benefit Analysis
1.        A cost benefit analysis in the telecommunication sector is
difficult and can be no more than indicative.   There is not much
difficulty in analyzing the costs of communication which broadly fall
into three categories viz. using mail, telecommunications and personal
visits.   The difficulty is to establish data which will help to assign
value to benefits arising from a communication, or even from the fact
alone that communication facilities are available.   These benefits,
direct and indirAct, vary considerably and denend on the circumstance,
nature of activity and a number of other less material factors.
2.        Within cities, telecommunications provide a more economical
forn of communiCation - -and -aspeed er and easier form - than the other
forms of communication.   Elsewhere,long-distance telephone calls are
less 'cstly~ thanr prso-nal vi--sit  ar.d -in r+.os cases achieve t.he des4redi

profit.   The importance of telecommunication to decentralization of

public health and protection, etc., are clear.
3.        A cost benefit analysis using the customary competitive
equilibrium -model, which attempts to quantify benefits in terms of the
prices consumers would be willing to pay for the service, was not
consiludereu nPece-sUsry EIn th1is Case.  SUch!l a s tUU Wudy WUUld req4ui-re ans
estimate of the demand curves for telecommunications services in Costa
nlca for eacn year in tUhe period of the a[ialysis.  The inLLU.LiUc±Ii.LULI
needed for such estimates would have to be obtained through special
surveys.   As a first approximation, the cost benefit analysis has been
carried out using market prices to value telecora.nunications services.
Although this approach leads to an understatement of benefits, the
tariffs in Costa Rica are evidently near to the value of the service
for the marginal subscriber; this situation is different from that
prevailing in countries with long waiting lists for telephone services.
Another factor which decreases the divergence between market prices and
total benefits is the use of discriminatory pricing: ICE's business
rates are higher than its residential rates, presumably reflecting
higher value of the service to the former class of subscriber.
4.        Benefits were calculated on the basis of the additional cash
inflows generated by the project.   Collections of revenues from tele-
phone services were divided between the project and existing installations

on the basis of ICE's projections of demand by- exchange. An occupancy factor
of 100% was assumed. In normal operating practice, the factor would not ex-
ceed 90%. The higher factor was chosen as a conservative assuxgtion WhiCh
depresses the rate of return on the new facilities, due to delayed saturation
of the existing exchanges. A part of the traffic on existing installations
should be attributed to the availability of new subscribers. At the same time,
it may be argued that the intensity of use of existing install ations might be
higher in the absence of the project. It is assumed that these effects are
mutually offsetting. Other benefits include revenues from telex services,
connection fees and subscriberst deposits. It was assumed that the useful
life of the project would be 20 years, and that subscribers' deposits would
be returned at the end of that period.
5.    Costs were estimated as being equal to the investment and operating
costs (excluding depreciation) of the new installations plus an allocation to
reflect the increase in administrative and general costs due to the new
installations.
6.    With the above assumptions, the internal rate of return of the proposed
program is about 16.9%.
7.    In order to determine whether risk analysis should be carried out, the
return was tested for sensitivity to lowered per-line revenues, overruns on
construction costs, shortened economic life and slower initial growth in
demand. It was found that sensitivity was very low and that a risk analysis
was therefore not required. None of the tests described below reduced the
rate of return below 1h4,.
8.    Sensitivity to lowered per-line revenues, which could come about as a
reunlt of traffic falling below expectations or of a different subscriber mix
from that assumed, was tested by assuming that per-line revenues would not in-
crease from their September 1968 level of 0776.  This produced lower total
revenues in each year. (The resulting reduction in net income could also be
attributed to higher costs-  For example, second stage telephone revenues in
1975 would fall from 017.3 million to 016,1 million.  This decrease was
equivralent to about 22% of out of pockpt costs in the year.)
9.    Sensitivity to overruns in capital costs was tested by assuming that
costs would be 10% higher than the estimates.
10.   Sensitivity to a lower initial growth rate in demand was tested by
assumring that te number oA subscr.bers .r.,o,ld grow at a rate of 1 0  ner annun.
The rate assumed in the forecast was 11.5% through 1973 and slightly lower
thereafter.  Sensitivity might be magnified by geographical shifts in growth
rates. (For example, the growth rate might be lowered in an area with excess
excnange capaci'-y, and increased in areas where capacitay is nearly saturated.)
This factor was not considered. It was assumed that further capital invest-
ment after the second stage would be deferred in view of the lower demnard
projections.
11.   Sensiti-ity to a shortened economic life was tested by assuming that
the project would be in ser-vice for 17 years instead of 20 years.
