income and economic activity in rural areas.\n            To achieve this objective, the project involves various\n            components including (a) supply of agricultural inputs; (b)\n            reinforcement and expansion of agricultural extension and\n            input supply by non-governmental organizations (NGOs); and\n            (c) support of agricultural research and development.\n            Further to this, the project intends to provide (d) short\n            and medium-term credit to smallholders and to community\n            associations; (e) medium-term credit to medium-size rural\n            enterprises and farms; as well as (f) rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of rural roads."}, "docdt": "1987-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
