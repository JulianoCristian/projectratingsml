Dear Sir: 
 
Re:  
Tamil Nadu Road Sector Project (Loan No.4706-IN) 
Amendment to the Loan and Project Agreement 
–

We refer to the Loan Agreement dated August 28, 2003 (the “Loan Agreement”) between 
India (the “Borrower”) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the 
“Bank”), and the Project Agreement of even date (the “Project Agreement”) between the Bank 
and the State of Tamil Nadu (“Tamil Nadu”) (the “Project Implementing Agency”) for the above-
referenced Project (the “Project”), as both subsequently amended on March 27, 2009. We also 
refer to the letter from the Government of India dated June 18, 2009, requesting the Bank to 
provide additional financing to finance cost overrun in the Project, and to subsequent discussions 
between representatives of the Bank, Borrower and Tamil Nadu related to the additional 
financing.  
 
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed with your request. Accordingly, 
the Loan and Project Agreement are proposed to be amended as follows:

Tamil Nadu on December 19, 2009,  and satisfactory to the Bank, setting forth

transparency and accountability under the Project, as such plan may be revised
