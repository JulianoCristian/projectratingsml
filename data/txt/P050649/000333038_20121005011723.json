Tamil Nadu Road Sector\n            Project (TNRSP) for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a dedicated project unit with an empowered\n            leadership supported by an appropriate skill mix can be very\n            useful in managing large projects spread over several years\n            and seeking to introduce new approaches on multiple fronts.\n            Yet, it is important to recognize that the units that are\n            put together just for the sake of the project tend to lack\n            full empowerment and leadership from within and often rely\n            on the strength of individuals assigned to lead them. Hence,\n            the Government, implementing agency and the Bank should pay\n            more attention to enhancing the leadership and empowerment\n            of dedicated units at multiple levels. The organizational\n            structure and culture of most of the works departments seem\n            to willy-nilly attach relatively less priority to planning\n            and preparation activities such as design, including land\n            acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) and\n            utility shifting. Inadequate attention to these activities,\n            as highlighted in TNRSP, is likely to have negative ripple\n            effects. Hence, utmost priority should be given to complete\n            planning and preparatory activities within a reasonably\n            tight schedule. Also, if there is a significant time lapse\n            from preparation to implementation, care should be taken to\n            suitably update the designs and to ensure reasonable level\n            of maintenance in the interim to avoid acute deterioration\n            of road structure. In a project with a strong institutional\n            development agenda, the teams may consider choosing more\n            granular targets/indicators to measure achievements and\n            impacts. Such targets, ideally, should relate not only to\n            mere completion of all sub-activities/components but also to\n            the actual improvements achieved in project implementation\n            and other operational efficiencies (e.g., reduction in time\n            and cost overruns; reduction in per km costs of construction\n            and maintenance, etc.). Land acquisition through private\n            negotiations, coupled with innovative approaches to\n            valuation, appears to offer significant promise to expedite\n            land acquisition in a timely and amicable manner. This\n            lesson was already highlighted in a World Bank dissemination\n            note building upon the experience from four State Highway\n            projects (in the states of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Uttar\n            Pradesh, and Gujarat) and a hydroelectric power project\n            (Himachal Pradesh)."}, "docdt": "2012-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
