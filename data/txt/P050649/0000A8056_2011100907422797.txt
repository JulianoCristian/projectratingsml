                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve the quality and sustainability of the state's core road network. The core road network refers to the state
                         highways and the major district roads being managed by the Highways Department of Tamil Nadu. This objective is to be achieved through the following four
                         outputs (i) capacity and quality enhancement of about 750 km of state roads in the core network with proper management of environment and social impacts; (ii)
                         major maintenance of about 2000 km and accident black-spot improvements at a number of critical locations; (iii) improvements to the management of the state
                         road network through institutional strengthening and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); and (iv) enhanced funding and improved allocation procedures for the
                         road sector.

                         were facing delays have now been substantially completed. Since the last mission in October 2010, all the contracts have progressed well and most of the works have been
                         completed. The construction of Tsunami Bridge is expected to be substantially completed by September 2011. Construction of the 4 km-long Kumbakonam bypass, which started in
                         October 2010, is expected to be completed by December 2011.

                         849 km of roads have been improved in the first-year and second-year maintenance programs. 142 km of roads have been improved in the third and fourth year maintenance works.
                         Works on another 41 km of roads are in progress through the third and fourth-year maintenance programs. Works have commenced about 8 months back for improvement of about
                         300 km of roads on performance-based maintenance contract (five-year duration). With these, periodic maintenance of a total of about 1330 km of roads is being implemented under
                         the project as against 2000 km originally envisaged.

                         The Highways Department has leveraged the program of black-spot improvements more than the target of improvement of 50 black-spots under the project. The Highways
                         Department has planned for improvement of 307 black-spots and, of these, 277 black-spots have been improved and works on another 30 are in progress.

                         Under the ICT Strategy of the Institutional Strengthening and Policy Development component, hardware and software were purchased and installed in the offices of the Highways
                         Department and the staff has been given basic training. Further, the Road Management System is operational and being used by the Highways Department. Two sets of equipment
                         [ROMDASS] have been procured under the project for road data collection. Road Accident Database Management System is operational and the Police Department and the
                         Highways Department are extensively using it. Consultancy Services for development of GIS and Project Financial Management System are in progress.
