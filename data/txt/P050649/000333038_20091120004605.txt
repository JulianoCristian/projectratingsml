    m the ti.rSt four treatments but only matntenance of the road shall be earned OUt 10 the EPM. For each
    of the treatments three vaClattons of the cross sect10ns as rural, VIllage and urban are considered for the
    deSign. These are aimed at rrtlntmlzmg unpacts on the roadside assets and econorrtlse on the deSign
    aspects. Table 1.1 gtves detads of the treatment gwen to the corrrdors.
A descnpt100 of each of the treatments gtven for upgradat10n corridors IS gtven below.

    1.5.1.1 2 Lone Sealed ShoJllders (2L.fS)

The 2LSS standard of road proVldes a 10 m sealed Width with a carnageway of 7m for cwo lane and
sealed shoulders of 105m Width on either Side, conSIstent with IRC 73-1980. The project will 1nclude
normal road lOfrasrrucrure, such as longitudinal drams, kerbs and footpaths m urban and village areas. A
COm~lOat10n of overlay of the eXlsttng road (wherever pOSSible) and p'avement wlderung wtll achieve the
10m seal. The rural sect10ns WIll have 1.5 m of sealed shoulder ~nd 1.0 m of gravel shoulder. The paved
shoulders mcrease the capaCIty of a cwo-lane road to Its ltIDlt, pnor to the lugh-cost alternauve of four
lanes. They allow for separat10n of slow and fast moving vehicles, and also prov1de a secure stopping
area for verucles dear of the traffic lane (Figure 1.2). A Cont1nuous palOted ltne will deflne the traffic
lane edge.
10 the past, a sealed shoulder compnsed a coarse textured premix carpet over a trun granular base. This
was not attractIve to slow-movmg velucles. To encourage slow-movmg velucles to use the shoulder, and
for trs proteetton, there WIll be full-depth pavement under the seal. \,"·ithout this, the fleXlbuIty of the
shoulder subgrade under frequent truck loadlng wul lead to Its early faIlure and loss of asset and seal.
Sealed shoulders are prov1ded where traffic volumes IS rugh and trus tmphes frequent use. As well as
slow-movmg vehtcles, heavily laden vehtcles use the shoulder to aYold on-comtng traffic that 15
overtakmg.
Paved shoulders perm1t fast verucles to overtake Without forctng oncomtng traffic off the se:tled surface
and should therefore contrIbute to a reductIon 10 the accJdent rate. The sealed shoulder will allow 1.8 m
WIde ox carts to essenually leave the traffic lane used by fast mOVIng traffic. The IRC standard IndICates

The 2LGS standard of road pro\-tdes a 7m carnage way, conSistent With IRC 73-1980. It lOcludes normal
road mfrastructure, such as longItudinal drains, kerbs and footpaths m [Owns and sealed ltght traffic
surfaces m the Villages (Figure 1.3) A comblOauon of overlay of the eXlsung pavement (wherever
pracucal) and pavement wlderung achieves the 7m seal. In the rural secuons shoulders are of gravel, 2.5
m WIde and meet the IRC: 73 (1980) standard for a 12 m roadway (two lane State HIghways In piam and
rolling terrain).

Urban secUons Include a sealed slow lane of 2.5 m on both sloes of the cat!lageway. Tlus may, however,
be reduced to a mirumum of 0.5 m In constraIned sltUaUons. Village secuon Includes a 1.5 m widened
pavement both Sides of the carnageway, which may sl1rularly be reduced In constratned village areas .
                                                               ·
.Urban and vtllage secUons Include local dralOage VIa masonry drains, covered in the urban areas and
 open in the VIllages to facilitate clearung and mamtenance. A local COm.ffiltment 15 reqw.red to maintam
 the drams. However, the benefits of a dratnage system to terms of addtuonal pavement Me, qualIty of
 ltfe and ameOlty, outweIgh the addtuonal matntenance reqw.rement. The PCC conSIdered VarlOUS
 opuons for vdIages, mcluding covered drams, dnve-over open concrete spoon drams and:' kerbs.
 Covered draIns, wlule desuable, are not ltkely to be approprtately malOtamed. A drtve-over concrete
 drain would reqw.re ful1~depth pavement on both SIdes and bave Imle capacity; 10 the flat terram It
 would be very hard to maIntaIn a fall on [he su.rface levellnvecc.
The !ugh cOSt of these alternatives made them undesuable. A broken separator kerb (300 mm break
every 4 m) Will allow draInage but exclude heavy traffic from the low~strength pavement for hght and
pedes wan traffic be!und the kerb.

\'X'acer reqUIrement foe constructIon IS a crltlcal element, especially along the coastal stretches of TNRSP
02, 03 and 04, where Intrus10n of seawater has rendered the ground water unfit for consumptlon. Fcesh
water along these stretches IS hnuted to the surface water bodIes as tanks and ponds, wruch get
recharged from the perched aqwfers. QuantIty of water requued for constructIon IS eswnated to be
1280 m3 I day for no.cthern co.rrldors and 910 m3 I day for eastern corndors Since no clash of use
between the construction requlIements and domestic water requuements of the local people IS to be
encountered, appropoate arrangements have to be made by the: contractor for procu.remellt of water.

 1.7. 1.3 Earth (Borrow material)

Borrow mateoal IS reqwred for filling embankments, approaches to bodges and at locatIons requirIng
correctIon of vemcal alIgnments. The quantities of borrow matenal reqwred for the upgradauon
corndors are estimated to be 2,954,162 ml. The mate.t:lal shall be procured moscly from pond beds and
other regions as Idennfied 1n the detatied deSIgn. It 1$ the responslbIhty of the contractor to transport
the matenal In such a manner as to cause nurumum impacts on the haul roads.

1.7.1.4 Quarry Material

Road metal and gravel from quarry shall be utilized for pavement surface and layers below pavement.
The qua.cry matenal requlIed for the upgradatIon comdo(s are estImared to be 5,777,502 ml. The
mateoal procurement will be responslbll1ry of the contractor.

1.7.2       SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Though the project deSIgns have been wo.cked our to accommodate the pcoposed cross-sectlons wltlun
the eXlSting Ro\'<', clearance of squatters and encroachers wIthIn the Col has been una¥Oldable. Also,
there eXist several stretches where the Ro\"V' av:ulable IS LOsufficlent to accommodate the proposed
cross-section. At these locatlons, acqwSltlOn of pnvate land and structures has been necesslt:lted. Apart
from these, the 13 bypasses that have been proposed 10 the project Will involve acqulslUon of land,
mostly agncultural. InCidental to the acqwslt10n of land for the proJect, Impacts on roadSIde propertIes

                                                 Box 1: Government of India Amendment on EIA requirements in 1997
     In April 1997, a nonficanon was issued by MOEF amendlOg Schedule-I of the EL;\
     Notification, 1994 that lists proJects reqwrlOg Em.jronmental Clearance. The 1997 Nonfication
     states:

     " ... Environmental Clearance from the MoEF IS not required for Highway projects relanng to
     Improvement work Including Widening and strengtherung of roads with marginal land
     acqulsiaon. along the eXISting allgnments provided the hlghways do not pass through
     ecologIcally senSItive areas such as National Parks, Sancruanes. TIger Reserve, Reserve Forests
     etc."


     It IS Important to note that the present proJect Invoh-es Impro"l.'"ement of the eXisting single lane
     to cwo-lane road, Poor geomemcs, habnaaon along the corndor and very less lwd WIdth
     avaIlable, warrant a bypass or reallgnment at several locations, _1.t these locatIons, acqwsltlon of
     a 27m smp to accommodate the cross section becomes inevItable. Therefore the GoI
     Amendment regardlOg the margtnalland acqwsltlon for highway proJects does not hold good,
     as sigruficant land acqUlsltlon is envisaged In the proJect.

This chapter presents the E.-\/SA methodology In the pro/ecr The enqronmental and social Inputs
obnuned durmg varlous proJect srages nnd [he process followed In integrating ennronmenr:tl and $ocutl
con$lder:ltlOns Into the project planmng nnd design are dlscllssed


3.1 FEASIBILITY STAGE
The feasibility study !n'1:ohred prl0rmzaClon of 3,328 km of SOS roads to Idenufy the candidate roads for
Improvement m the proJect. The srudy was completed by the PCC m December 1997. The feaslblhry
study mcluded an analysls of the englOeerlOg, economiC, environmental and social components for the
project roads. As part of the feaslbll.tty, an envlronmental and social screenmg was carned out.

3.1.1   ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING

Envlronmental and socIal screening that was carned out for the road network. Idenafied In the SOS,
Involved the followmg steps:

   1.   Deternuning evaluation criter1a for screerung
  u.    Assigrung weightages to the evaluauon crIteria
 ill.   EvolVIng evaluaaon matrix by scree~lOg corridors for the idenufied cnterla and
  IV.   RankIng corridors in oeder of sensltlvuy
Coendors lOrucaung best environmental performance were screened for further analYSIS. An Inventory
of environmental features along aU- the roads was developed to enable determtnaaon of evaluaaon
critena and thelr weightages. Pub!!c consultauon dunng the screemng also prOVided necessary IOput In
determimng weightages to evaluatIon cntena. Road l..\Oks screened With the above methodology were
ranked 10 order of senslOvlI:y, and senS1Qve road l..\Oks Identified.

3.1.2   SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Sectoral E.\ (1999) for TNRSP was prepared after the investment deCISions were made In the feaSibilIty
study- The Sectoral EA co'-ered the set of roads establ.tshed as candidates for Impro'·emenr b~· the
Feaslb!llty study, to prxoIluse amongst the sub-prOjects 10 terms of envIronmental/social Impacts,
benefits and EA/SA reqwrements. The Sectoral E.-\ approach was used to estabhsh mechamsms for
assessment, analYSIS and Implemenrauon    In   the yanous project phases

Sequence of acuvmes followed tn the SEA preparation IS presented below:

    ·   Study of eXlsang msututlonal setup

 3.1.3      ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE ALIGNMENTS / CORRIDORS

 Allgnmenrs proposed for upgradatlon based on the outputs of feasibility study have been subjected to
 further analysIs on the enYlronmental and social Impacts. Certam locahzed envIronmental and sOCIal
 unpacts Identified dunng the stud~' \vere to be aVOided to mmimize the Impacts :\Iternatl\-e alIgnments
 at such locations were anal;'sed, FollOWing methodology        IS   adopted for analYSIS of the alternatn"es

        ·  IdentIhcauon of alternative alignments - both eXlsung and ne\,' ahgnments
        ·  Esumauon of engmeenng and economIC parameters for companson of alternatn"es
        ·  PreparatIon of Inventory of enYlronmental and SOCial features for likely alternaaves
        ·  Consultaaon wtth che pubhc on the Idenafied aiternaaves
        ·  Qualttaave and quanmaave     anaI~'sls   of the envlronmenral and SOCial inVentorr      to   arnve
           at the best altgnment

3.2       DESJGN STAGE

Final ahgnmems/corr1dors selected for upgradauon are subjected to detruled designs. Publtc
consultanon has played major role 10 various deSign deCISions. Cross-secnons for the corndors were
fwaltzed with the mputs from public heanngs and lessons learnt from the fIrst phase of east coast road
(ECR) DurlOg the design process, IDlnor modificauons are carried out in the width of Col to reduce
unpacts. Design speeds are reduced in lOhabtted porn~ns of the corndor to reduce the geomecnc
correcnons and consequent land acqwsltion. Minunum pOSSible cross section was adopted through out
the alIgnment, wruch did not necesmate analysis for alternanve cross-secnons as It can be of higher
width only and would obViously have higher Impacts compared to the adopted cross secnon.

About 2600km of roads are subsequently taken up under mamtenance component. As no widenmg and
land take IS envisaged, these corrIdors are not subjected to &\/SA. However, to adequately address any
Inconsequennal envIronmental/SOCial Impacts, an envIronmental and SOCIal management plan IS to be
prepared as part of the consoLdanon exerC1se.

 CRZ are stucited.

 II:       Analyze the eXlstmg land use characteristlcs along [he corndor

The land uses along the project road for a citstance of 100 meters on either side were Inventoried
through a reconnalssance survey wherein the adjOining land uses along the corridor were recorded. The
recorded data IS analysed to prOVide section Wlse landuse character along the corridor.
III:       Identify development trends and locatlons vulner~ble to induced development

To understand tbe development trends of mdividual· setdements and to assess thetr potential for
                                                        \
induced development, extensive consultatlons were held With the community and the various
stakeholders along the corndor. These citscussions together with a basic analysis of the census and
socio-economic data of the project dlstncts provided the basis for identifytng areas susceptlble to
induced development impacts.
IV:        Assess the environmental constramts and potentials for development

To assess the water situation along (he coast and to understand the implicatlons of the developments
that can be induced due to the proJect on the eXlStlng water situation, extensive data collection on the
ground water resources. (of about 200 wells wlthm 30km from the coast) was carried out. The
environmental components analyzed meluded:
       c   Geomorphologtcal characteristics.
       o   SOll types and characterlsucs 

       c   Water resources lOclucitng,

 Stretches of project roads are subject to floodmg durmg heavy ralns especlally along the low-Iymg
 stretches. Ai: various locatIons along the Northern Corridor from Arcot to Elavanasur a flooding depth
 of 0.3m IS common. Along ]ayamkondam to Thiruvarur greater flooding depths of up to 1m are
 common as the stretch falls wldun the Cauvery delta. The flooding depth along the Eastern Corodor
 vanes from 0.1 to 0.5 m. The stretch of the road between Nagaparunam and Muthupet passes through
 the Cauvery basin. Data on the damage caused by floods i~ 1993 and 1994 (Refer Table 4.4) give an

Geologically, the eotue scace can be broadly classlfied Inco hard Rock or Cryscalltne Formanoo and
Se&mentary Formanons. Nearly 73 % (95467 sq. Km) of the state is underlaID by crystalline rocks of
Archaen metamorphic complex compnslng of grarute, charnodcices, gneisses, sdusts ecc. They are
further mtruded ac many places by quartz vems, pegmatites and ?ther ultra baSICS lIke doloautes. The
sedimentary rocks occur along' the coast, flanklng the crystallIne mass 10 che west. This sed!mentary
formanon mamly composes of recent allUVIal deposHS, cernary sandstone, ltgruce, crecaceous lImestOne,
argillaceous sandstone etc. BeSides these, sporadic occurrences of upper Gondwana formations
COnS1Sl:lOg of compact sandstOne, shale etc. are found as thm and Isolated patches. Younger allUVIal and
deltaic deposus cover me entue coastal belt.

Alfisols (Red Sandy and Reddish Brown Loams)

These sous have a large clay accumulation and are prone to gully erOSIon if the velocuy of surface runoff
1S lugh. As a consequence of the rugh clay accumulation (and therefore small partlde SIZe), these soils
resule In rurbld runoff that generally remalnS suspended in water. T~ese solls occur along the Northern
Corridor over parts of the route between Arcot and Aram, Polur and Tirukkovilur, Jayamkondam and
Anyalur and Kumbakonam and Thuuvarur. In the Eastern Coendor they are found in severallocatlons
on the Cauvery delta, areas around Manora and Kattumavadl, and along the coast south of
Devlpattinam [0 Tutlconn

 These s011s are character1sed as betng crada.ng day sods that shrInk and swell over the seasons and that
have WIde deep cracks durmg penods of m01Sture defic1ency These sods are generally formed over
gentle slopes and their erosion potenUalls only moderate These solls are found over parts 0 f the route
between Jayamkondam and Truruvarur along the Northern Corndor. 10 the lower reaches of the
Cauvery delta 10 extensn-e !Uland areas, and south of Mlffilsal nght upto Tutlconn along the Eastern

Entisols (Recent Sandy Soil)

 These SOlIs are common to the flood plaIns and are charactensed by rece1\-ing new depOSits of allUVium
at frequent mtervals. These SOlIs ha,"e the potenual for rugh erOSlOl1 but crus seldom occurs due to the
low-lYing flat terram and related low flow veloclues. These are only found between Arcot and Polur
Vndhachallam and Jayamkondam and on the northern SIde of the Kolhdam River.

 The corndors cue across numerous lrrlgatlOn channels, creeks. mInor and malor rrt;ers, and estuaries.
 The proJect road tra'v'erses across the rl\-er baslOs of Palar, Ponnalyar. Vetiar and Kolhdam along the
 Nonhern Comdor and CaU\'eC)', :\gOlar, Pambar, \':ugal, Gundar and V:uppar along the Eastern
 Corndor Apart from the major rl\'e.:. canals and creeks constlCute a major pare of the watercourses}
 traversed {Refer Table 4.12}.
 The drainage basins of the comdors are shown In Figure 4.4 (A) & (B) The Palar, Ponnalyar and
 Cauvery catchments have thell: upper reaches In the Eastern Ghats lylOg 10 Kerala and Karnataka which
 receIVe ram from the souch.west monsoon from June to September, at a arne when there may be htde
 ram 10 the lower pares of these catchments. Ie is, therefore, pOSSIble to have !ugh flows In che lower
 reaches of these dratnage bastns at times of lade or no local rams.

 qualtty was collecred from rhe P\VO for wells wIthm 30 Km from the coast. Since the problem of sale
 water intrusIOn IS contined to only the Eastern Corndor, It was exclusively taken up for detaded
 assessmenr. Conrours for Total Dissolved SolIds ([DS) and Sahnll::Y were plotted based on maximum
 values recorded by the P\VD m the observaoon wells over a perIOd of 10 years.
Figure 4.6 (A) & (B) maps the TDS and Sahmry of groundwater In the dlsrncts traversed by the
Eastern COrrIdor. The desIrable level of TDS In dnnklng water as per IS. 10500 IS 500 mg/I which In
absence of an alternate source IS permmed up to 2000 mg/! l\!ost districts along the Eastern COrtlclor

 The predommant use of water 10 the corridor-of-tnfluence along the Northern Corndor IS for
 agnculture. Crops 111c1ude paddy, cotton, sugarcane, banana, horse gram, groundnut, mustard and
 Others (see SecooQ 3.4.5). The water comes from canals (fed by ramfall), tanks (fed from ca.I1lfall and
 groundwater) and wells (fed from groundwacer). The di'stttbution of these sources for the districts
 traversed by the Corndors is shown 111 Table 4.16. Canal urigat10n IS part1culatly unportant In the
 dtStrlcts of the Cauvery delta; ThanJavur, Nagappattmam and Tluruvarur. In Pudukkottai,

The results of analyses of water samples are presented                     Ul     Table 4.18,
Ground Water Quality: pH of the ground waters was found to be 10 the range 7.04-7,87 along the 

Corndors, TDS content was ranglOg from 460 mg/1 (fondl) to 4600 mg/1 (Sayalgudl). Chlonde values 

were analysed In the range 75 (Tondl) -1750 mg/l (Sayalkudl) and Sulphate values were found to be 10 

the range 28 mg/l eM. Pattangadu near Manamelkudl) - 260 mg/1 (RaJamadam) Low BOD «2-2 mg/l) 

values reveal the fact that the groundwater sources IS free from any 10dustrlal polluaon. Lead contents 

were found to be below the detecuon ltrrut. In general the follOWing Inferences can be made' 

In the Northern COrridor (TNRSP 01), the ground water can be used for dnnklOg after suitable 

treatment and dlslOfecaon. 

In TNRSP 02 (Nagappumnam - Katrumavadl), the ground water IS unfit for dnnklOg as TDS content IS 

high At Sangandi and RUJ3madam high Percent Sodium values were mOO1[Ored.

      In TNRSP 03 (Katruma,radl - Ramanathapuram), the ground water quahry comply wlCh the dnnk.tng
      water norms (IS' 10500) In the absence of an alternate source (except for Total Cohforms) The ground
      water quahty at the Toad! dugwell fluctuates from potable to unpotable dependmg on the avallabl.hry of
      water at a nearby surface water source (pond) wruch helps to rechargmg all ground \vater sources 10 that
      area (as reported by the local people)
      In TNRSP 04 (Raman:tthapuram - Tutlcorm), the ground water has become braclush and IS unfit for
      dnnlung .i.t Saralkudl and Val par \'er~' hIgh chlonde ntues (1078 - 1730 mg/l) \Vere mooHored.
      Surface 'tXt aler Quality pH of the surface waters was found to be In the range 7 66-8 18 along the
      Corndors. TDS content was ranglOg from 560 mg/l (Ervadl) to 17500 mg/I (Papagam R!,"er) Chlotlde
      \'alues were analysed 10 the range 103 (r...hnambham Tank) - 8950 mg/l (Papagam River) and Sulphate
      values were found to be In the range 32 mg/I (Kumlapam Tank) - 290 mg/l (Papagam RIver) Low
      BOD (2-5 mg/I) and COD (48-240 mg/I) values were mOOltored at these sources. Lead contents were
      found to be below the detectlon hrrut.
     In general, surface water quahry along the Corndors IS good and compiles With CPCB Surface Water

In general for all morutonng stauons the RPM values were morutored 10 the range 26-65 ug/m l with an
average value of 41.7 ug/ml . \Vhtle companng WIth the Nauonal Ambient At.r Quality (NAAQ)
Standard of 100 ug/ml (24--hourly) for ReSidential, Rural and other Areas prescribed by Central
Polluuon Control Board (CPCB), all the morucored RPM values were found to be very well within the
snpulated value. SPM values were rangmg from 55-118 ug/ml with an average value of 87.6 ug/ml ·
\Vlule companng wtth the NAAQ Standard of 200 ug/ml for Residenual, Rural and other Areas, all the
morutored SPM values were found to be well wtthlO the lIffilt.
The maximum S02 and NO:ot levels morutored were 21 ug/ m 3 and 22 ug/m l respectively. WluIe
companng With the NAAQ Standard of 80 ug/ml, the mean SOl (8.1 ug/ml) ~nd NOx (9.6 ug/ml)
levels were found to be well wlthlO the hffilts. The ma.:umum CO concentratlon monitored was 78
ug/ml and most of the CO levels were morutored below the detectable luntt of 40 ug/m3· Wlule
companng the NAAQ Standard of 2000 ug/ml, the morutored CO levels were found to be well within
the limn. All HC values were found to be below the detectable uffilt of 65 ug/m3 ·
AU Paruculate Lead values (except at Jayamkondam Intersecuon) were found to be below the detectable 

Uffilt of 0.01 ug/ml and wttrun the NAAQ Standard of 1.0 ug/ml (2+.hourly). 

Hence from the above       diSCUSSIOn   the follOWing mferences can be drawn: 

o      All morutored RPM, SPM, S02, NOx, CO, He & Parnculate Pb concentranons were found

It may be noted that as the nOise survey was carned out at sensitive receptors I.e. School Zone and
Hospital Zone at Muthupet and Manamelkudt respectIvely, nOise standards for senSlClve zones have
been compared With. However, those morutored values were well within the MoEF Standard for
ReSidential Areas. Araru Bypass is dose to a sigruficanr road Junction (Arcot-Araru-Cheyyar Road
Junction) With conSiderably high traffic flow especially of two wheelers. Jayamkondam Intersection is a
congested market place where anthropogeruc acuvIties also contnbute s1gruficantly to the nOise levels
apart from traffic. AnalysIS of traffic flow data lOdicates t~at the htgh n01se levels morurored at Araru
bypass and Tuoconn NH45B-ECR juncuon can be attnbuted predominantly to the vehtcular traffic.

 The Muthupee Reserve Forese, essentially a mangrove forest, hes at a dIstance of about 5 km from the
 proposed road upgrade bet\veen Km 91 0 - 92 0
 Flora: The Muthupet m::lngro"·es are charnctensed by the presence of only 4 exc!uSl\·e mangro\'e species
namely AUMnn/a manna. Ex£'OutJn" llgallod1tJ. A~glm'aI ,'ornulI{tJIlIm and AUlIIthtlJ' IIM/olun (Kannan. 1994)
Srudles on the Impact of past management pracuces and the present statuS of the mangrO'l.·e ecosystem
tn Muthupet reveal that the species composltl0n IS very poor \vhen compared to the number of
exclUSive mangrove species present In Pitchavaram, whIch IS, located Just 140 km north of Muthupet.
Uncontrolled and unregulated explOltauon, cattle graztng, and some environmental factors lIke poor
InundatIon and damage due to cydoOlc stOrm seem to be the reason for the low species wverslty of the
Muthupet mangrove forest RestoratIon and conservatIon of these mangroves IS being carIled out with
funwng from Inwa Canada Envlronment Faclltty (ICEF) by the MS Swaffilnathan Research Foundation.

the breeding sues for these arumals. Manne fosslls further reveal that thIS area was under sea at some
stage, There are fosstls of both lower and higher plant forms to a depth of 1 meter. These fossil
resources are' being m10ed for cement production. The fossa bed hes at a distance of mOre than 4 kID
from end of the corador.

4.2.6     COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES

Tamil Nadu bas a coast of 1,000 kID and a contlnental shelftatea'Qf 41,412 sq. kID WIth a high diversity
of coastal speCles. There ate numerous fislung villages, old trading ports and also a high diversity of
coastal resources includmg fisheries, aquaculture fatms, mangroves, salt pans, coral reefs, seagrass beds,
marme algae, chank beds, oyster banks and sea-cucumbers.

The coast is 1ffiportanr to the economy of Tamil Nadu. The State's fish catch of 439,000 tons 10 1994
95 and 449,000 tons 10 1995-96 produced an annual return It) excess ofRs 400,000,000. Along the coast
there are 442 marine fishtng villages supportlng a total population of 537,000 (Ella/llatlon and App/ud
Ruearrh Depanment. 1997). MaJor fishelles centers eXist at Chennat, TutIcoI1n and Chmna 'Muttam, whlle
med!um s1zed centers operate at Palayar, Vallnokkam, Cuddalore and Nagappattlnam. The three rustncts
of NagappattInam, Pudukkottat and Ramanathapuram together account for nearly 60% of the fisherIes

Tanul Nadu from Sethubachatram (ThanJavur distrtct) to Kanyakuman (KalimJlthJl and KalalapeT'JIma/,
1996), Manne algae are the only source for production of phytochemicals such as agar, carrageenan and
algtn which are w1dely used as gelllOg, sterilizing and thtckening agents, Commerc1al harvesting off the
coast of Tanul Nadu has taken place SlOce 1966, People ~so collect seaweed and sea grasses for local

The dtstricts along the Northern corridor roads have anml;al rate of populanon growth almost equal to
that of the state average (1.4) whtle the dtstnct along the Eastern corndors have a compuauvely lower
growth rate. The populauon growth rate has seen a decline between 1981-1991 especially due to the

by Vellore, TlIUchlurappali and TanJavur. The least urbarused distncts ue those of Tiruvannamalai,

As eV1dent from Table 4.42, the maxunwn percentage of land along the corndor IS that of agnculturalland
uses (-1-2%) follOWing by settlements that are present along 25% of the length of the corndor. The other uses
are salr pans and shamp faraung. The maxunum length covered by salt pans IS In TNRSP 04

 shrunp farms are presem along some scretches. Udayamarthandapuram bird sanctuary IS Situated at a
 dIstance of 800 m from the corndor. From RaJamadam to Kactumavadt the coendor runs parallel to the
 coast and at some places withm 500 m. In the absence of any agncultural acttvmes, fisrung IS the only
 economtC acttvlty and most of the settlements along the road are fislung Villages or small market centers
 for fishing produces.


Apart from Nagapatttnam, three major settlements ViZ., Ttruppundt, Ttruthuratpundl and Muchupec are
beIng bypassed In trus seCClon. These bypass altgnments are routed through agnculture lands.


TNRSP 03 (Kattumavadi - Ramanathapuram): The Kattumavadt - Tondl section of the cowdor for
a major length runs wltrun a km from the COast. Along the roadSide most of the lands are vacantiscrub
lands. These lands are not utilized for agnculture due co the lack of water. As the SOlllS sandy, the land
IS not sUlted for either salt ffilll1ng or shnmp farmtng. At stretches where the S0111S not sandy, espeCIally
along Pudupatttnam to Mandmpatttnam (10km) shrlmp farms are present for a continuous stretch. In
the absence of any other agricultural produces, the only speCIes that survIves on trus tract IS palm, due
to which extenSl\-e palm plantations are present along a sigruticant length of the corrIdor.


The urban centers along trus stretch can be broadly categoClzed as follows Tondl - commerCial center,
Manamdkudl - a newly declared Taluka he:ld quarter and r.LnusaL Denpatunam - other maJor
settlements


TNRSP 04 (Ramanathapuram - Tuticorin): The entl!C stretch between Ramanathapuram and
Tutlconn 15 sandy and does not support any agricultural actlntles Consequentl\" scrub lands and dry

publtc sites. RemalO1ng corridors would reqwre hmlted enVIronmental and SOCial assessment. The
outputs of screerung study were seen In conJunCtIon With economic feastbthty to denve the feaSible

3.1.1         WITH OR WITHOUT PROJECT SCENARIO

The' wHh' and 'without' project $cenanos are analysed with respect to the developmem of the stare
by the backdrop of reqUIrement of rehab Ie quahry Infra$trucrure for SU$r:uned growth economy and
consequent well-betng of ItS cmzens

Prondlng better Connectl\'m' \\'111 ensure [hat goods and people from areas CO\'ered by the rond can
mo\'e In and out of the nreas qULcker and S\l\'e time Increased trade and commerce nctl\'lt\· nre
expected Accounting ,ust for the sanngs 10 the Vehicle Operlltlng Cost~ makes the project nable
The packages TNRSP 02, 03 and 0-1- ha\'e been deSigned to connecr the important pons such as
Cuddalore, Nagapattlnam, and Tu[tconn. It prOVides greater lmperus to trade through rrunor pOrts
10 the coastal regIOn It has a ,'ery good toUrlsm potenual due to famous reltglOus and tOuriSt pl:lces

hke Velankkam, Nagur, Slkkal. Errukkudl. ~Ianora and several rellglous SpotS 10 ThanJavur delta.
The 10duswal acovlty wtll be gemng a good boost due to trus road to ONGC and IOC faciltues 10
Nagapattmam and Karalkkal belt. The IOdustnal acuvlty Will gLve: rISe to employment potennal for
people In and around the regIOn. However, there would be an Increase 10 the vehicular pollUtlOn-alr
and nOise, In the VICInIty of the road. Some agnculruralland Will have to be dtverted for road use to
construct bypasses at 13 locauons. In other setde:ments, some people WIll lose tbel! propemes close
to the road to accommodate the proposed wlderung.

If the project IS not 1mplemented, there: is every hkelihood that the project roads will detenorate
further. Only certam roads may be mamtruned regularly, There 15 every l..tkehhood of detenorauon
of the e:usung pavements. In the absence of the prOJect, the highway department will also find it
extremely dIfficult to generate funds for such a massive lffiprovement of the rOll.d Infrastructure
from ItS own resources. Increased al! polluuon, due to slow movlOg traffic and congestion, will
follow. NOIse levels will me due to detenorauon of the pavement as well as 11lcreased honhog.
Without the bypasses, the traffic would conunue pass10g through the settlements and conunue to
pose a safety nsk for the rendents In these al~eady congested towns.

Therefore, the "Wlth" project scenano, with 1[S minor adverse Impacts IS more acceptable than the
"without" project scenano wruch would mean an aggravation of the eXIsung problems. Potenual
benefits of the proposed road Improvements are substanual and far-reacrung both 10 terms of the
geograplucal spread and time. Hence, It IS clear that the lffiplemenrauon of the project WIll be a
defimte advantage to Tanul Nadu 10 order to acrueve: all-round development of its economr and
progress for ItS people.

3.1.2        ROUTE ALTERNATIVES FOR EASTERN CORRIDOR

Objectl'lre of selecuon of eastern coendor IS to proVide connecunty to the coastal Villages as they
are deprIved of the quahty road Infrastrucrure. Consequently, the regton IS backward and affected
by calarrutles, wh1ch warrants Improved connecuvlty to aid 10 speedier evacuauon, InCIdentally the
corndor proVides connectivity to southern poruons of Taffill Nadu as weU. Alternatives for

Corndor-13 connects Madural on NH--\.5 With NH-7 at T1!Uchdurapalli The stretch between
Madura! and T1!Uchc!:urapalh IS 42 km shorter than the route along NHAS. It IS lIkely to carry the
most long dIstance traffic because of ItS nauonal htghway l1!lks, duect route and £Owns that 1(
serves. Between Madural and Tlfuchchuapalli, Corr~dor-13 IS a two-lane road carrymg htgh

The eastern corndor (Nagapamnam - TUClcorm) 1S envisaged to provide connecllVlty to bacrnard
coastal villages An alternate connectlYlty to these coastal villages. whIch IS thought to be
envlronmencaily bemgn, IS suggested by NGOs. The alcernanve (referred henceforth as InJand
alternauve) suggested mvolves twO parts as a) proVIsion of an tnland route parallel to the coast and
b) unprovmg the eXlsnng connecung roads to the mdlvldual villages from [he Inland route. The
!Oland route opuon suggested IS an eXlsnng road connecung NH-45 nearer to Vtllupuram and
JOlmng the NH-45B near Kurukkuchalal A reconnaissance survey of the tnland route was earned
out. A WIndshield survey, Inceracnons with stakeholders, commutllnes and truck operators were
conducted for assessing HS Viability as an alternate corridor. Observatlons based on [he
reconml1ssance sun"ey are as follows:

·  The corndor runs tnland and parallel co the coast at an aenal dtstance of 30-50km upro
   Pararnakkudl (end of comdor 4). It crosses the NH-49 Just above Paramakkudt, touches
   Mudukulattur and from here It deViates [0 the west to Kamudl Smce there IS no direct route
   (0 Tutlconn from here !C has to Jom the NH-4S B, by movIng south-east before 101rung.

   greatly Increasmg the distance Distance from Muduku1atrur Upto Tuucortn IS found [Q be
   l03km \"m Inland route \vhereas .the distance from Unarakosamangal (located parallel to
   ,\[udukulartur on the coast) IS found ro be 90 km. Therefore; che mland route Will be lengthier
   chan COrridor 1
·  .--\ malor powon of the route suggested IS already In a good condillon With 5.5 m Wide
   c!l.rrtagewar Also, 5075 km IS bewg Included In the TNRSPOI as upgradanon comdor
·  The road passes predommantl~" through ferule agricultural tracts, and IS conunuouslr inhabited
   upw Karalkkudl Any IrnprO\'ements to the highway would Im'oh-e slgntficant resecciemenc
   Impacts. Also, slgmficant felhng of roadslde trees Will be reqUired, much higher than the
   eastern corndor.
Obsen'atlons on Improvement of connectlng routes from the Inland route (part b of the Inland
aJrern:lIl ve) are as foHows

The ob,ec[1\"e of the proJect. CO prOVide connecUvltr to the coastal commumtJes Will be lost as there
are not mam" roads connecung the Inland road to the coastal Villages The connecung roads :lre

about 589km of connecting roads have to be Impro\"ed, This ml.-okes enormous COSt expenditure
for de\-eloptng both the 238km mland route and 589 km connecting roads to coastal Villages Sull
another 103km has to be traversed to reach Tutlcorin from Mudukul:lttur, The eXIsnng connecung
roads are pro\"ldmg access to 1.+ Villages out of 1.+0 vtllages In the east coast. In order to fulfill the
project obJectl\"e all these Villages are to be pronded better connectl\"lC!" co the Inland roure. A COSt

components are deleted from conSideration 10 both the alternatives Cost compa!lson of both the

Vembar     IS   a small coastal village (1991 populanon 1,665)        In   Tuucorm dIstrict, Just mSlde the border
of Ramanathapuram diStrIct, and the luncHon of the Vtlathlkulam-Vembar and Vembar
Sara1gudl roads (Fig. 5.7) At Surangudl the TharatkudI-Surangudl road leads to Tutlconn. An
ODR bet\veen Surangudl and Sayalkudl IS an alcernaC1\-e route for Corndor 1 co the route na
Yembar

Traffic conslder:mons

The direct route between Surangudl and Sa~'alkudl IS 2.2 km shorter. The rOute na Vembar IS 10
better condmon and carnes more traffic. If the Project selects the dll:ect route, about 50 per cenr
more traffic Will use the roure because of the dIstance sanng.
Thts would mean that the maloney of traffic on the road would be medIum dIstance traffic rather
than local traffic.

Planrung consideratlons

With the direct route, Vembar wul be 5.S kIn from the mam road. It IS hkely that some of the
buses currently servtng Vembar wIll bypass the vulag~, especIally If the brIdge at Vembar 15 not
1lI1proved. Gradually, towns and VIllages on the malO road, especIally Sayalgudl (1991 populauon
10,182) and Surangudi (1991 populatIon 2,085) will ~o\v faster than Vembar_ For tourists, the
Vembar route 15 more attractIve, offermg more trees, atcracuve landscape, ghmpses of water, and
old bwldlOgS at Vembar

Eng:meering conslderacions

The duect route IS substanually cheaper than the route VIa Vembar (Rs 1844 lakhs compared WIth
Rs 2395 lakhs. The cost saVIngs malnly deC1ve from the shorter dIstance and lower br1dge costs.
The FeaSibility Study Report calculated the EIRR for upgrading the SayalkudI-Vembar road to 2
LMR standard at 11.5 per cent, and the Vembar-Kulattur sectIon at 4.2 per cent.

Ennronmental conslderanons

Vembar hes on the Gulf of Mannar. The coast IS here low, sandy and covered \v'1th palm crees.
The Vembar rOute passes through the CRZ but not through CRZ-I. The beach at Vembar provtdes
excellent structural support for nesnng of turtles. However, corCldor IS at a dIstance of 0.5 km to
1.0 km from the coast and no turtle habitat IS reported along the comdor Hence no 1lI1pacts are
annclpated

Traffic consideratIons

Four major roads serve Tutlcorl1l. In decreasl1lg order,of importance to me port, the roads are:
                                                                           \

    IJ    from the north-west, the TuncorlO(l-.Iadurat Road, an MDR;
    c     from the south, the Tuaconn(Tlt'Uchendur Road, an MDR;
    c     from the north-east, me Tuncorln(Tharavatkulam Road (Corador 1). an MDR (but
          beyond the Tharavatkulam(Suranguw road 15 an ODR).
Being a port and center for me baSIC chelUlcal mdustry and power generatlon, there are Large
volumes of heavy traffic. The port facwnes are on the south Side of the City. ,A bypass prOVIdes
good access from the port to NH-7,A and the Tutlcorm (Madural road. These two roads are the
most Important lmks to the port.

Planning conslderaaons

The Tuacorln (Tharavalkulam route has no paracular merlt from an eco,nol1l.lc development
perspecave. The local salt and aquaculture !ndustries would benefit from the proJect. but the I!
traffic would be msufficlent to sustain an upgrading to the eXlsang road.

EnglOeerlOg conslderaoons

Upgradtng the Kuiatrur (TUtlCOrlO toad                   to   2LMR standard is expenSive (Rs 1778 lakbs) because
mose of the road of ODR or PUR classlficaaon and smgle camageway. The Feaslblhty Studr

UtIliZing eXlStlng roads. A new allgnment would follow the same route as the eXlStlng road
alignment as far as the southern end of the Kamandalanaga Nadlu brtdge. It would then cross
paddy fields [0 Palyur Eel and run along the embankment. It crosses open land and an aDR to

For the Arcot - Cuddalore SH the eastern bypass IS the only senSIble one But a complete nng road
of lugh standard would be prolubmvely expensive and not econoIDlcaL Even also the western
route would be far [00 long, and pass nowhere nearer to the bus and ra.tl stauons on the northern
Side of the town.

J.J.}A           Integrated Eastern BypaJ'J
Tlus proposal IS integratIng either option With the eastern bypass for the Arcot - Cuddalore route.
The bypass starts at km 104/6 of the Cuddalore -' Chmoor road, near Vennamalat En. The
                                                         I

alignment will convert the sharp bend at dus POInt into a Y-Junction Wlth the bypass conunwng 10
a north.easterly dlrecuon to cross the Katpach Branch of the Southern RaIlway on an over.bridge at
km 64/5. The bypass WIll pass to the east of Kumman EEl and cross the Pondlcherry - Knshnagtri
NH at km 131/2 (Fig. 5.10). It wLlI contmue 10 a northwesterly dlrecuon to cross Nochchunalai
En and then Avarlurpet ODR at km 1/0. Finally, the bypass Will cross the rallway agatn at km
68/5 on an over.bndge and reJom the Cuddalore - Chmoor SH at km 110/0_ The total length wtll
thus be about 7.3 km.

5.}.}.;          5el"#011   of Alignment
Out of all the OptIons the tntegrated opuon IS taken lOtO considerauon. Integrated eastern bypass
has the chsadvanrage of nor connecnng dIrectly \vIth the Tiruvannamalal - KanJI MDR and the
compensaung advantage of pro-nchng a more chrect route for the .-\rcot - Cudalore SH traffic.
Further It helps tn removing .-\rcot - Cudalore SH traffic from the .-\runachala GU'lValam
c1!cumambulauon route and thus redUCIng veh1cular traffic on the pIlgrImage route around
.-\runachalam. For about 2 km the route crosses open land not under culu\'auon. The bypass would
cross the agnculture land that could otherw1se be used for growmg sugarcane or nce. The bypass
'''ould facUuate the growth of the town by Improvmg access to fnnge area. The Table 5.14 shows
comparatl,-e analYSIS of the al[ernaw:es at Tlruvannamalal bypass. Due to the above-mentioned
advantages, Integrated eastern rOute       IS   selected as bypass.

The following ahgnmem optIOnS are considered for the project road.
         ·       Northern ahgnment
         ·       Southern Bypass
5}      j    2          Northern Alignmmt
The Cuddalore--Salem road IS ahgned east west and many trucks ply on the Cuddalore-Salem
i\IDR (mostly through traffic) carryIng coal from Neyveh to the steel plant at Salem. Traffic on dus
route IS hkely to grow substantIally with the commencemem of new projects at Neyveh. The most
disadvantage of any ahgnment other than southern roure IS that the bypass picks up the through
traffic on "the Vnddhachalam--Bhuvanagm MDR. Northern ahgnment WIll be longer In length and
not cost effective.

J} 5J                   Southern Bypau route
The proposed ahgnment commences at km 64 of the Cuddalore-Salem MDR and runs alongside
the i\femattur Main Canal (on the south SIde of the canal) as ,far as the Vtllupuram
Tlruchchuapalh Chord hne of the Southern Ratlway It crosses the hne on a rat! over-brtdge and
contInues southeastwards across V rtddhachalam En, Sat[:lkkudal PUR, and Vnddhachalam
RaJendrapacunam road to reach the nver Just south of Chavadlkuppam Village (Fig. 5.12). The
route then follows the high-tensiOn tranSffilsslon hne (on the north ~Ide of It) to the
Vnddhachalam-Bhuvarugw J\IDR and thence [0 reJom the Cuddalore-Salem MDR at km 57/5.
The rotallength of the bypass IS about 6.5 km.
5} 5.-/-               St!IMlOn of Altgnment

The southern bypass IS selected as It connects Vrtddhachalam--Bhuvanagtn i\fDR The eastern half
of the bypass Will affect between 30 and .+5 dwelhngs, some of them pucca structures. In the case
of the other half of the bypass there are no such Impacts on bUIldmgs. There will be one radway
o\-er-bndge on high embankmems The follOWing Table 5.16 shows the alternatives selected for
Vrtddhachalam brpass.

Most of the through traffic IS on the Perambalur-Manamadural SH, and a western bypass route
would be the most convement for thIS traffic. However, trus route would be of no benetit to any
of the traffic on the other roads servtng Anyalur. It would also not pass anywhere near the bus
stand. Trus alternatlve does not provide requued connectlvlty from the project corndor to the
major traffic carry1ng roads unless It forms a complete nng road.

The route al.tgnment starts at km 25/2 (Fig. 5.13) of Perambalur-Manamadurai SH, JUSt north of
warehousmg corporation, godown and traverses towards east across scrub jungle skirttng the
fencmg of the Godown compound. The alignment crosses Southern RaIlway at Its junction With the
TANSEM line and forms a four legged Junction at km 2/6 of Anyalur-Senthurai ODR (at km 2/4
+ 85 m) about 110 m north of eXisting level crossmg. The road cuts across dry lands and scrub
Jungle to km 1/6 of Anyalur-i\yyanathur MDR., and It crosses dus road 800 m east ofTamJ.l Nadu
State Transport Corporation (Inch}') Bus Depot and west of TANCEM Cement Factory (at km
3/8 of Anyalur-Ayyanathur MDR). The rOute then cuts across scrub Jungle sktrnng two
cremanon sheds located on the left SIde, but well away and an open play ground to the east of
Industnal Traming Insntute to meet at km 1/4 of Anyalur-Vilangudl MDR. Further ahead It
traverses two high-tenSion transnussion towers across scrub Jungle to reach km 1/0 of Anyalur
Subbarayapuram ODR.
ThiS proposed ahgnment pass across generally flat tereatn on the east. The approximate length of
the route 15 7.0 km. Except for ffilnor field channels, there are no nvers or canals to cross. The
roadside drams will have to be prOVIded WIth adequate graruems to lead them to narural dratnage
courses nearby A famous temple (Kahaperumal temple) at km 5/6 of Arlyalur-Ayyanathur MDR
attracts huge crowds dunng fesuvals. The bypass Will serve as an easy access road to the temple.

The bypass proposal IS an extension of the Kumbakonam-Kodavasal-Truruvarur MDR. The
route wl.ll have T -]uncnons at either end ViZ. at k.m 27/0 of Nagapattlnam-Karur road (NH67) and
at k.m 2/8 of Thuuvarur-Kodavasal road (Fig. 5.15) One mInor bndge across Odambokkal nver
runrung parallel to NH67 needs to be constructed and the appro:\1mate length of ltnear waterway IS
50 m. The appro:runare length of the route IS 750m and a 45 m nght-of-way IS proposed nght
through except at Odambokkal river bndge location. where the bndge Width wlli be kept as 7.5 m
between kerbs. The gradient IS flat. The alignment IS, straIght a low. A Low-TensIOn ltoe crosses
the proposed altgnment between the nver and Tluruvarur-Kodavasal road.

S~""IIM   of AIiJ,nmmt
The preferred altgnment for the bypass of T1.Cuvarur IS Western opoon, The gradtent IS flat and the
ahgnmenr 1S stra1ght. The alIgnment cuts across paddy and sugarcane tields, a number of irngaoon
culverts will be reqUIred to be pro\-lded. The stanrung water level dunng monsoon penod IS about
03 m above field leveL Hence, the road embankment up to the top of subgrade needs to be raIsed
up to 1.5 m. The roadSIde drams on either Side have to be prOVided to dram away the storm water
towards OdambokkIar nver and ocher natural dramage channels. Table 5,18 shows the features of
Thtruvarur bypass.

Chldambaram once was the capital of Chola dynasty IS a place of malor tounst attractlon. The
populatlon of the town IS 67,90010 1991 census. Traffic passlOg through the town 10 a north south
dlteCtlOn has to negotlate four rIght angle turns, and several sectlons of road are narrow. The
hentage value of the center of Chldambaram makes property acqwsltlon for road wlderung most
unlikely There IS thus no easy alternatlve to a bypass for allevlatlng the long-rerm craffic
congestion.
S.) 9.1          AnalYsis of A/rernatMj
Two ahgnmenc OptlOOS proposed for the prolect road are
    "     Eastern Ahgnment
    o     \Vestern Alignment
S ).9.2          Easlml Alignment
This alignment would dtVlare at MudO! and bypass Bhuvarugul, savlOg 5.3 k.m cravel dtstance. ThiS
was the alIgnment was chosen when the bridge over the Vella.r RIver collapsed durmg floods.
In 1982 H&R\VD undertook prelurunary m....escigauons for the bridge SIte on thiS alignment. The
lOveStlgatlons Included 8 bores and Identlfied very low beanng capacity stlts to a depth of 12 m
below suli water leveL There would also be a reqwrement for nver cralrung works to protect rhe
northern abutment. The bypass would affect nearly 150 bwldlngs all along Irs length. Nevertheless,
the eastern route would greatly Improve the access of coastal COmmUnloes to ChIdambaram, and
has WIde publtc support. On the southern Side of the C1ver the approach to the bridge wtll be on a
high embankment. Tills bypass on the east Side would be closer to the coast with a consequent risk
of encouragIng development near the ~enSlOve Plchchavaram mangroves.

i 3.9 3          IPulern Ailgnment
H&R\'VD undertake the englOeenng detads as COmmIssIoned by Institute of Hydrauhcs and
Hydrology, Pondlcherry, 1985, which revealed the follOWing facts. They concluded that from an
englOeenng pOint of View the Muduc :me was not a desuable one for a bridge, and that a site about
1 7 km upstream, closer to Bhuva01gm. was preferable and It would be much less cosdy .

The western bypass proposal offers several advantages over an eastern bypass. There are three
practIcable alignments for a western bypass. All starts from the Crudambaram-Sirkazhi Road at
60/8 km on the north Side of the town (near the village of Olatyamputrut) and follow the same
altgnment as far as a bridge over the raIlway hnes (Fig. 5.17). The three opaons are:

ThIS will produce better economtc returns (because more traffic travels towards MaY1ladurur:u and

In both Nagore and Nagappamnam there are long stretches of narrow road. Because of eXt-,lSI\'e
udal areas along the Venar Rl\'er at Nagore, a smgle bypass foc both Nagoce and Nagappamfi.lm IS
appropnate (Fig. 5.18). The 9 km bypass proposal for Nagappamnam diverrs from rhe eXIsting

Although traffic levels are low 10 Tluruttutatpoondt, but the routes through the town are narrow,
tortuous and congested. One link road is under cons~cnon on Velankaru - Tluruttutatpoondt -
Vedaranruyan MDR. But this does not bypass the ThlrutturlUpoondl town and as a result there
would be an extension of the same route further ahead.

An extenSIon of tlus hnk would allow traffic on the two study roads to bypass the town, with a
savmg 10 travel distance. The bypass starts at km 39.2 of Velankani - TIuruttutatpoondi -
Vedaranruyan MDR and JOlOS Km 72.4 on MayuaduturlU - Muthupet road (Fig. 5.19). The total
length of the bypass 1S 3.1 km.

   The ahgnment options considered are
           II    Southern Bypass

   Lo\v lYIng ground, urban development and WIde adal nvers preclude a southern bypass. Further
   envlronmental unplicauon 1.e proXlmately to Reserved Forest would have some adverse impact, So
   there IS a conSlderaaon of the northern bypass for the tow'n.

 66/0 of Than/avur- Pattukkowu- l\luthupet road on the north side of the ro\vn and follow the same
 ahgnmenr (Fig. 5.20). There are three pracnc:lbl~ alignments are:

       I.     Patrukocral-Muthuper Road to i\[nnnargudl - Muthuper Road onl\";
      u       l\Iartiadurhural-i\!uthupet Rond to Tlrutrunuppundl Road and then across the Kor:urur
              rl\'er to the i\[u(hupet-VedncannlYam Rond
     lll.     Maytladuthural-Muthupet Road co Ttruttur:uppundl Road
On the other side of the Kor:uyur River IS the adjOIning v-lilage of JambuvnnodaL A smgle lane
bridge across the Koralyur rlver connects the \Tillage. The bypass wul only be econorrucally viable If
a bus stand IS constrUcted on the north side of the town, near the bypass. Buses account for a thud
of fast movmg veludes. Jambuvanodal contams famous dargas (tombs of Musltm saints) which
have long attracted pugruns (Herrungway, 1906). There are mosques close to the Malor DIStriCt
Road to Vedaranruyam.

5.3.13.4                SelutlM oj Alignmtflt
Two alignment options consIdered for the northern route makes It more feasIble and logtcal. The
route stares at km 66/0 of ThanJavur- Pattukkpttal- Muthupet road and Joms at the
Mayuaduthurat--t\tluthupet road at km 92/6. The tppograprucal survey of the proposed route
revealed that the route would affect a large number of coconut trees and some huts. So there is an
alternatlve to trus 1S sruftlng the northern section of the bypass commenong at km 92/1 would
have fewer Impacts on huts and coconut trees. But the quesnon aClses IS SInce such an ahgnment
would not connect directly to the proposed southern leg of the bypass, tb..ts raises questlons as to
how unportant the southern leg actually 15. From a traffic poine of VIew, the southern leg 1S not
crmcal, but 1t does provIde addtnonal alleviation of congestion In the town centre, and shortens
some trip lengths for traffic travelling to or from the Jambuvanodal neIghbourhood.
On the other Side of the Koratyar rIver IS the adJolrung village of Jambuvanodal. A SIngle lane
bridge across the Koralyar rlver connects the VIllage. The pubhc meenngs strongly supported tbe
concept of the new badge over the Koralyur (lver. There are strong equ1ty arguments for InclUSIOn
of the brIdge because It provIdes a balance of benetits to the Muslim and HIndu commuruues In
[vIuthupet. So the northern bypass With bndge over Koralyur [1\rer IS consIdered. Table 5.23 shows
the alternatives selected for Muthupet bypass.

replacing bCldges, by wldenmg the coad, by planting trees further back from the road, and by
unprovmg the hydrauhc capaCIty of brIdges and culverts.

7.1.2         IMPACT ON PHYSIOGRAPHY

Smce most of the routes in TNRSP pass through predommancly plain terrain and no substantial
cut·and-fill operations are planned, the overall Impact on the phYSIography of the area would be
luruted. Though corridors ofTNRSP 01(N) pass through rolling terram (Refer Table 4.5), no
slgruficant unpact on phYSIography IS expected as no cwtIng IS proposed.

Amongst the maintenance corndors, the Gudalor - Mysore. CaIicut - Vythiri - Gudalor. Coonor
- Kundah and Coonor - Kattuberro Corndors 10 NIlgtrl District and the Hosur - Denkarukottah
Corndor In DharmapuI1 diswct pass through mountamous terrain. As no Wlderung IS proposed
as parr of the ma10tenance ·works, the unpacts on phySIography would be m.tn.tmal.

7.1.3         IMPACT ON TOPOGRAPHY
No rals10g of the road embankment heIght is suggested 10 the deSIgns along the upgradation
roads apart from the stretches IdentIfied as low-Iytng areas. A total of 27.1 Km of the
upgradatlon roads has been identIfied as low-Iymg areas (Refer Table 4.6). To ensure that
ralSlng of embankments does not aggra\"ate the flood SItuations along the surroundmgs, It has
been proposed to raIse the road no more than the depth of the structural overlay to permIt the
water flow Without talsmg the flood leveL At these locatIons, the deSIgn has focussed on the
Improvement of roadSIde dratnage condiuons elther through the tmprovement of eXIstmg
cross-dramage structures or prO\"ISlon of new cross-dramage struCtures. DeSign of the cross
dramage structures wIll follow IRC GUidelInes (IRC, 1995).

7.1.4        IMPACT ON GEOLOGY

The project routes along upgradauon as well as maIntenance corndors traverses through
SeISmIC zone II as defined by the vulnerabilIty zorung system, I.e., Low Damage Rlsk Zone (I,e,
areas wlth a probable Se.lSffilC mtensu:y of VI on the ModIfied Mercalll IntenSIty Scale). Thus the
project does not have any sIgruficant ImpaCt on the selSffilC stabilIty of the area.

,-\ total, of 13 bypasses for a length of 95 ~ km and 80 realIgnments for a length of 3~ Km are
proposed Most of these sections pass through productive agnculrurallands, thereby tnggenng
the loss of productlve tOpSOIl. Apart from these fresh land acqwsltlons, there are stretches
along the corndors where acqulSlClon of agnculrural lands has been unaVOIdable due to non
availability of sufficient road Width to accommodate the proposed cross-sections The
agnculturallands to be acqUired for the project IS presented                   10   the Table 7.1.

Elevated secuons of road 111 all sectlons, parncularly all rugh embankments along the budges
and the bndge approaches would be vulnerable to erOSIon. Constructlon of ne\v brIdges
Involves excavatIon of nverbed and banks for the constroCtlon of the foundatlons and pIers. If
the resIdual spod 15 not properly dIsposed off, Increased sedimentation downstream of the
bodge is hkely.
As both aorthern and the eastern corridors experIence prolonged monsoons WIth heavy rams
(twIce a year), there IS a potenual for sedunentauon of waterways and water bowes.

No soli erosion is envisaged dunng the operation stage as all the slopes and embankments of
the proJect road would have been stabilized through sound engineering techniques. The Issue
has been addressed at the deSign stage Itself and all slopes have been designed for at lea.st 1:2

7.1.5.3            Compaction   of loii
Compactlon of sou wtli occur, partlcularly dunng site clearance stage due to movement of
heavy macrunery and vehicles and durIng secang up of constroctlon camps and stockyards.
Dunng constructlon, there is a llkelihood of compaction beyond the carnageway wttlun the
Col, due to the· movement of verucles and heavy machinery. Though this IS a short duration
unpact, It is a permanent unpact and needs to be mltlgated.
7.1.5.4            Contammation of rod
Construction Stage
ContaOllnatlOn of sou may take place due to sohd waste generated from the labour camps set
up for the proJect. Trus unpact IS also stgruficant at locatlons of stockyards and hot ffilX plants.
Durtng constructlon, contarrunation of SOlI w1l1 be prunanly due to constrUctlon and alhed
actlvmes. The Sttes where constructlon verucles are parked and serviced are hkely to be
contaOllnated because of leakage or spulage of fuel and lubncants. Pollutlon of 5011 can also
occur 10 hot·rrux planes from leakage or spIllage of asphalt or bItumen. ContaOllnatlOn of sou

7.1.6           IMPACT OF BORROW AREAS AND QUARRY SITES

The excavatlon of quarries and borrow pHS used for obtaInlOg rocks, sod and aggregate
materIals for road COnstructlon cause rurect and Indirect long-term adverse IIDpacts on the
enVIronment. The proposed up-gradauon works envisage use of slgruficanr quanrmes of earrh,
stone and gnt and sand along With bitumen. The prInCipal constructlon materIals requtred for
the upgradatIon of the TNRSP COrrIdors Include:                         ·

·  Quarry matenals, used                tn   asphalt and aggregate for upper pavement layers
·      Sand, gravel, latente, clay and other matenals for fill and lowe~ pavement layers

A maJor source of dust durmg the construction stage 1S from stone crusrung operations from
the crusher and the Vibrating screen. The dust, In addwon to belng an eyesore, reduces
vlSlb1lu:y thereby lOcreaslng safety concerns. Dust IS generated due to procurement and
transport of raw matenals from quarnes and borrows sltes to the construction site. These
Impacts will persist tt.ll the aCtiVIty ceases. The regtons espeCIally downwind to the
quarnes/borrow areas are more vulnerable to au pollution. The Issue of dust generation along
the haul roads needs to be addressed through stnct enforcement of dust suppression measures.
Table 7.4 presents the maXlmum, ml.(umum and average (weighed) lead i.e. haulage distance for
each package for construction matenals such as aggregates, gravel and sand. It indicates the
maXlmum, m.munum and the average dtstance that his to be travelled with respect to each
package for procunng the particular construction material. From the Table lt can be observed
that the quarry materials have to be transported over conSiderable dtstances, 10 case ofTNRSP
01 (S) & (E), TNRSP 02, TNRSP 03 and TNRSP 04. However almost all the quarnes idenufied
have black topped access roads, and transportation 10 covered haulage trucks wIll ensure that
no m.ajor tmpacts occur.

 7.1.7.5        Increased sJl1a..e nill-off
 One of the una,'oldable aftermaths of road consrructIon                   15   the Increased surface run off. The
 addmon of hard paved shoulders, whIch essennally Increase paved ImpervlOus surface, \vtIl
 cause Increased surface runoff along the roadSIdes. Increase In surface run-off IS due to the
 creauon of ImpervIous surfaces that pre\'enr [he tlow of \vater IntO the ground. The Increased
 runoff from [he project has been worked out as follO\vs:

 Increase In runoff (cum.) = Increase In runoff co-effiCIent due to constructlon .. annual r:lInfall
 In the area (m) * area of the newly constructed surface.

 The Increase of the black top WIdth has been conSIdered accordIng to the type of cross sectIon
 proposed (For detalls Refer Appendix 7.2.) The runoff coeffiCIent used for the calculatIons
 are 0.2 for red sandy and reddIsh brown loam, 0.15 for recent sandy and 0.55 for black cotton
 SOIL The black top has a run-off coeffioent of 0.95. Increase In the runoff co-effioenr has been
 worked out as the dIfference between the runoff co-effiCIent of black tOP surface and dIfferent
 sou types. The lflcreased run-offs along varIOUS packages are presented In Table 7.9.

and consequent Increase III sotl eroston. Sod types along the corrIdors conSISt of predominantly
red sandy and reddIsh brown loam along [he Northern CorrIdor and black cotton soIl along the
Eastern COrrIdor. Impacts due to the tncreased sedimentatlon IS ltkely to be more pronounced
along the Northern Comdor as red sandy and reddIsh brown loamy SOli has hlgher erOSIon
potentIal than black cotton soIl.

The unpacts of lOcreased run-off laden wuh fine sediment wtll make the water more turbId.
Thts is a sigruficant unpact along the water bodIes supporting fishes. If the concentratIons are

 Operation Stage

 The major Impact on the au quality dUrIng the opera non stage wrll be due to plYlOg of vehicles.
 The Impact on air quality depends upon traffic \'olume/ rate of vehICular effilSSlon withm a
 glyen stretch and prenlhng meteorological condltlons Excess dIScharge of exhaust gases can
 occur due to (I) madequate vehicle mamtenance, (11) use of adulterated fuel In yehlcles and/or
 (III) poor road condmon5
 Modeling oC Air Impacts
 To assess the hkely operauonal Impacts on the Ambient AIr Quahty due to the proposed
 prolect, predlcllon of the pollutant concentrations has been cacned out uSing CALINE-4, a
 model based on GaussIan equaaon.

 C-\LJNE 4 IS based on the Gaussian equallon and employs a ffilXlng zone concept to
 charactenze pollutant disperSion over the hIghway. The model can be used to predict the
 pollutant concenttallons for receptors located upto 500 m from the roadway for the vanous
 pollutants Wlth reasonable accuracy

 The input parameters for the modelmg have been taken up from the folloWlng sources:
                                                                   I
 ·  The volume of traffic, proposed geometrtcs, deSign speeds proposed for the vanous
    packages have been taken from the FeaSibility Report and deSign drawmgs of the individual
                                                       \   .
    packages;                                        ,
·  The effilSSlon factors for the velucle types have been obtamed from the Inwan Institute of
   Petroleum (lIP), Dehra Dun.
·  Ambient atr quality from base hne morutorlOg results carned out by LASA during May
   2002.
·  Meteorologtcal condmons mdudtng wmd, stability class etc, from the IMD data of the
   vaclOUS locanons along the corridor.
Concentranons of au pollutants such as SPM, CO & NOx have been predicted for the year
2017 3 at locallons along the Inruvlduallmks. At each locanon the predtcnons have been made at
dtstances of Sm, 9m and 13 m from the centre hne of the road. The results are presented 10
Table 7.11. From the table It IS observed that the predicted concentraaon for 2017 at all
locatlons are well below the Natlonal AmbIent AlC Quahry Standards speCified by CPCB for
Rural & ResidentIal Areas The maXImum predlcted concentratIons are found along TNRSP
01(N) along Arcot Arant road (Km O.SOO). The companson between the predIcted values for
mdtvldual packages IndIcates that concentratIOnS are comparatIvely higher for TNRSP 01 than
for the other packages.

So from the above dlScuSSlon It can be Inferred that the air quahty unpacts ditecdy attnbutable
to dus proJect are not likely to alter drasucally the present scenario. Morutortng of the ambient
aI! quality at vartous locations along the Corndors have revealed a relatively unpolluted
scenano. At all locacions the concentrauons of vanous au pollutant parameters were found to
be lower than the National AmbIent Au Qua1.tty Standards supulated by the Cenual Polluuon
Control Board for rural and resldenual areas (Refer Secuon 4.1.8 of Chaprer 4).
rmplementauon of the proJect will cause a ceWl1n tncrease m the pollutants' concentratiOns due
to the Incremental traffic "'olume as shown In Table 7.11. But on the other hand Improved road
surface condmons and traffic capacity of the corrtdor wtll remove the local congesuon and
facl1.ttate smooth traffic flow, wruch would reduce sigruficandy the pollutant levels especially in
the lOhablted areas. Moreover the construcuon of the 13 bypasses and 34 k:m of other loca1.tzed
devIauons has been proposed. ThiS Will contnbute slgruficandy In ImprOVtng the ambient air
quality by chverung the road away from bwlt-up areas that mclude resldenual development and
commuruty factliues located very close to the eXlsung corridor. So tn total.tty the Impacts are
expected to be benefiCIal or at least neutral.

  Addltlonal measures bemg Implemented by the Central Government could further reduce air
  pollution related to velucle enusslons (MoEF, 1997) These measures mclude:
  ·  the Introductlon of catalytlc converters
  ·  malang low-lead petrol and unleaded petrol a\rallable throughout the countrv
  ·  more stnngenc emisSion norm, for "ehides at the manufactunng stage
  ·   the nouficatlOn of emiSSion st:lndards for 1-stroke englOes. 

 The overall conciUSlOn of the :\u: Qunhty Study conducted as part of thiS em'lronmentaI Impact 

 assessment IS that the operational Impact of the upgraded road on urban, nIl age and rural alr
 pollutIon would be neghgtble.

 7,1.9         IMPACT ON NOISE LEVELS

 EXistIng nOise levels In urban areas along the Project Roads are generally                           In   excess of relevant
 standards (Refer Section 4.1.9 of Chapter 4).
 Construction stage
 NOise Impacts dunng the constructIon stage wIll be associated with heavy velude movements
 and mechanical eqwpment used for earthworks, pavement laYIng, and bndge construction.
 People Ltvmg in close proxunity to the work sltes WIll pbnclpally expenence these unpacts. The
 nature and duration of these Impacts will vary depending on the type of work to be undertaken.
                                                         II   ,
 For example. nOIse associated With the construction of malor bndges will Involve penods of
 pue dnving which generates intermittent, Iugh level nOIse and Vlbratlon, whereas areas of
 straIghtforward road widerung may be completed relatively qwckly and with lower nOise levels.
 The nOise levels associated with the various construction activities and the ~arious construct:lon
 eqwpments should not exceed 75 dB(A) as per the Envlronmental Protection Act of India.

 Though the nOise levels for the va nous constructIo~ actIvltles exceed the permiSSible standards,
 it IS Important to note that the construcoon nOlse is generally lOterrruttent and depends on the
 type of operaoon, locaoon and funcoon of the eqUipment. Mmganon measures as to regulate
 the tIrrungs of construction, emplOying nOise protectIon measures etc. need to be worked out.
 Operation stage
 To assess the Impact of lncreased traffic on nOIse levels at vanous Iocauons along the corridor,
 predIction of !101Se levels~ has been done USlOg the FH\V'A Transport NOise Model. The model

       ·  The Impact on the eXlsung rural aCOllstlc ennronment ,vould be neghglble because of the
          high disperSIOn of nOise In open rural areas and the Impro\'ed road and traffic condltlons
              that tend to reduce nOise
       ·  The Impact on \'IHage nOise po\lutlon \vould be slgmficant because a large percentage of
          Village nOIse IS caused by through traffic and any IOcrease In through traffic ,vIll exacerbate
          thiS situatlon Therefore, measures are reqUired to reduce nOise from traffic passtng
          through vulages
       As the lffipact on vtllage nOise pollution IS recogmzed to be slgmficant, It IS necessary to
       Idenufy the nOise sensitive zones. So based on the field momtonng and ocher reconnaissance
       surveys a ltst of cntlcallocauons ha\-e been prepared wluch are Itkely to be adversely affected as
       a result of the unplementauon of the proJect. Pnmary Health Centres and other medIcal
       facumes that do not have beddtng factlmes have been excluded as the unpact at these locatlons
       IS of tnterrruttent nature, At such locauons the necessity of proViding certam mmgatlon
       measures foe the attenuation of nOise levels IS called for,

The prmclpal Impact on flora mvohres the removal of trees for the creatIon of a clear zone
WithIn the Corodor of Impact. Reason for clearmg trees IS threefold:
o  To prevent slogle-vehicle coillsion with the roadSIde trees, trees very close to the road need
   to be cleared. RoadSide trees \vlth strong and rt~d stems can pose safety hazard. Some
   trees preclude clear Sight distances. Others (such as Tamanndllf llIdua) have a propeoslty to
   overturn when old and are potennal safety hazards depending upon age and decay
   condmon. All such reees that are safety hazards need to be cleared.
o  To ease constructIon of the embankment for the widened road formaClon and, to perrrut
   construction of adequate roadSide dramage structure, trees located Within the clear zone
   need to be removed.

 At certaIn places along the upgradatlon corndors Social Foresery areas are observed The Forest
 Department has carned out the plantations of Acacla. Prosopls and Eucal~'ptu~ tn most places.
 The ecologtcal setup of such areas IS presented In Secuon ~.2 ~ of Chapter ~. The only area On
 \vluch the road upgrade can have some ad,rerse lmpaCt IS Pena Odal (Km -U .. 5 0) along
 Vndhachallam Jayamkondam road along the Northern Coendor. Major disturbance to the area
 15 due to overgrazing by cattle (about 1000). Dumplng of soLtd wastes 15 also occurnng. The

 only potenaal Impact 15 on monkeys crossmg the road In tlllS area. No trees planted under the
 social forestry schemes wtll be cut due to the road upgradauon.

 7.2.5       OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS

An ecolOgically sensltlve area of lugh floral dLvermy IS observed close to the nver Kollidam at
Anatkarat along Jayamkondam Kumbakonam road along the Northern Corndor (Refer Secaon
4.2.5.1). The threatened repulian speCIes, Crocodilus porosus, IS reported near thts area. They
have been spotted next to the Analkaul regulator. Regarding presence of crocodiles on the
nver bank at Aaatkaral, It is uncommon to observe crocodile In terrestnal enVlConment [Refer
Appendix 6.2 (iv)]. As the bridge across Kolltdam is not to be reconstructed, the Impacts are
not likely to be sigruficant. Therefore, no mitigation measures are enVIsaged. Among the other
sensltlve areas, the Anyalur foss.u beds he at a rustance of about 4 km from the project comdor
and hence no Impacts are expected due to the road upgiadatIon.

The project roads along the Eastern Comdor pass near areas With mangrove vegetauon. The
deta.us of such areas have been deuneated In Secaon 4.2.6.5 of Chapter 4 of chis report.
However none of these areas are Significantly dose to the road to be lmpacted or wltrun the
RLght-of-\Vay of the road to warrant removal. Hence Implementaaon of the project w.ul not
cause any removal or degradaaon of mangrove speCIes. SettLng up of labour camps
I construction sites near such areas and movement of any constructIon maclunery I veludes
close to such area will Lmpact the ecosystem. Though the Impact IS reverSible WIth appropClate
remedIal measures, It IS a long term ImpaCt.

 7.3.1       IMPACT ON RELIGIOUS AND HISTORIC SITES

 The conservauon of mes of culrural, hcnrage and relIgious significance tn Tamd Nadu depends
 on \'ISltS by pilgrIms and tOUClSts to provide the necessary funds The upgradtng of Corndors
 \VIIl be beneficial to conser:aUon of the many hlstonc and rehglous SHes on or near the
 COrrIdors by Impro\'mg accesslbtllt\' and therefore the number of nSHors.

 Construction stage

 Potenual unpacts on rehglOus and hlstonc SHes dunng the construction stage relate to the
 posslblilty for phySical damage to occur to structures located close to the road works, However,
 It 15 requIred to relocate some cultural propcrues that are within the CoL A total of 279 culrural
 properues (places of worshIp) are affected and structures completely affected Will be relocated
 for whIch genenc deSigns have been prepared (Refer Table 7.19).

Operation stage
In the longer term, the construcnon of the ten bypasses along the Northern Comdor and three
bypasses along the Eastern Corndor will make a dlr~ct contnbunon to the conservanon of
monuments 10 congested towns such as Tiruvannamallu, Chidambaram etc. by diverSIon of

7.3.2        IMPACT ON SACRED GROVES

The detaus of sacred groves along upgradation and mruntenance corndors IS presented 10
Secnon 4.3.4 of Chapter 4.The sigruficance of these sites In religtous, aesthetic as well as
ecologtcal terms has been taken lOto account in the design of the road upgrade. The Sadakattt
sacred grove (Km 11.0-12.0) along TlfUvannamalaI TlfUkkovilur road will get partially affected
due to the proposed road upgrade. The sacred puththu (temute mount), worsrupped by the
local people, located off the shoulder of the road needs to be removed. No other slgruficant
Impact IS expected on the sacred groves due to the road wlderung acnv1t1es.

7.3.3       VISUAL AND AESTHETIC IMPACT

In the past, TamIl Nadu's highway engIneers have, of necesslty, concentrated on the e::<:tenSlon
of road mtleage to meet baSIC needs, and prud httle attennon to aesthetic considerations
(Government of Madras 1960) The upgrading of the TNRSP Corndors wtll prOVide an
opportunlty to redress the balance between addltional tree plannng. the easmg of curves, the
standardlzanon of the road\vay cross-sectJon, and the rrusmg of landscaped embankments.

Construction stage
Ducmg construcuon, the mltlal vlsual Impacts wtll be assOCIated With the removal of
encroachments from the tlght-of-war and structures on land acqwred for deViations, as well as
the clearmg of mature trees and other \'egetanon. These actlV1t1es \VlII create slgruficant
dlfferences 10 the local aesthencs; some neganve such as the loss of marure trees that
conttlbute so much to the landscape character of rural areas and Villages; and some posltlve

 TNRSP has the potenual for changes           In   the demographIc structure to both the short and longer
 terms.

 Construction stage
 ,'"'-!though the construction contractors are lIkely to use unskt!led labour drawn from local
 communmes, use of spewtlIzed road buIldIng eqwpment w1ll requ1re trained personnel not
 lxkely to be found locally. Sudden and relatively short-lxved IOfluxes of constructIon workers to
 commuruues along the Corndors wlll ha\-e the potentIal to 'skew' CertaIn demographIc vanables
 such as the ratIo of males to females and the tradmonal soc1al coherence of towns and VIllages
 not used to sudden changes 1n the populatIon S1ze or composltlon.

 It 1S antIcIpated chat the constructIon labour Inputs for the TNRSP Comdor works WIll be in
the order of 6100 person-years, WIth a peak total labour force of about 9200. However, trus
number WIll fluctuate, and the number 10 any parucular distnct will be lower (Refer Table

Construction stage

The relatlVe1y shorr-llved econorruc Impacts of the construction stage are hkely to be
experIenced 10 local communlUes for the duration of construction as workers make everyday
purchases from local traders. ThIS 15 hkely [0 gtve a shan-lived stimulus to rhese traders that
Will dtsappear as soon as the construction IS complete \"'Ider, flow-on econonuc Impacts Will
be expenenced 10 other sectors of the Tamtl Nadu economy as a result of purchase of
construction matenals and the payment of wages and salaries.

Operation stage

Once the upgradIng IS complete. there IS llke1y to be some long-term changes In the econOffilC
structures of the urban and rural areas served by the road. For example, tmproved accesslblitcy
to larger markets may sumulate the pcoductlon of 'cash' crops relative to staple food crops.

. .\ s a result of this major resettlement programme, there are hkely to be longer-term ImpactS
that will take ume to mamfest consIderIng all soclal and propeny adjustments that are                                                                          to   be
made In VarIOUS commuruues

Occupants of encroachments generally come from vulnerable groups dISprOpOrtIonately to the
general populauon. In rural Tarrul Nadu, there IS a strong correlaaon between low caste. land
less-ness, and extreme poverry (KapadIa, 1996). The nghts of peasants are protected, but the
nghts and lnterests of land less labourers who depend on casual wage-labour, and who are the
most vulnerable group, are largely unprotected. However, the purpose of the Re.rtttiement A,·tion
Plan IS to ensure that nobody 1S worse off as a consequence of the proposed upgrading of
TNRSP Corndors. The process for the resettlement wtll be based on the agreed enutlemem
framework.

Construction stage
Adverse tmpact on safety of pedestnans and passage of traffic approaclung or passmg through
the sectlon of the road under tmprovement are likely 1f constructlon works are not managed
properly. It IS essenual that all works should be planned before hand by the Contractor With

warnmg SignS, barncades etc to mform the toad users ace essentlal In tlus regard.
Operation stage
Once the upgrading work 1S complete, the safety aspec:ts wLlI mdude both adverse and
benefic1al impacts. Improvement of roads as part of the TNRSP wdl entad double lane road
WIth Improved road condmon. Wah the proposed project, the traffic volumes and speeds are
ltkely to increase, wluch would have a direct beanng on the nsk exposure to aCC:ldencs There
Will be the potenual for mcreased colllslOns between vehicular traffic traveillng at lugher speeds
than preViously and lower speed velucles as well as pedes mans usmg the roads. Although the
deSign speeds ha\'e been kept lower In the major settlement areas, some amount of severance 1S
expected In the !Ural areas. Road safety was a major concern at the vanous communtty
consultauon sesSions earned out along the corr1dor. There was a strong representauon pOlntlng
out the need to mtroduce effective measures to ensure safetY of pedestnans. school chddren
and other road users.

7.52          IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH

Construction stage
DUrIng the conStructIOn stage, dlsmanthng of [he structures for Col clearance and other road
constructlon acovmes may result 10 the followmg health hazards:
Breaking and dtsmanthng of propertles has psychologtcal unpacts on [herr owners and others
associated with them. Debns generated on account of these actIvItIes If not properly dIsposed
rrught gtve rlse to health problems 10 the area. However, the structures [0 be dIsmantled wllJ
maInly be of semI-permanent and temporary nature and much of the waste shall be salvageable,

In case of non-local labour (If so IS arranged by the conr:ractor), labour camps are set up at one
or more SHes adjacent to the ahgnmenr, and at some ancillary sites, like aggregate quarnes.
These labourers hIred from oumde can have clashes wlth the local populatIon on account of
cultural and rehgtous dtfferences, The Influx of a large work force to an area can unpose
addtoonal stress on these faciliues (medlcal services, pO\,'-er, water supply, etc.)

Unsarutary condlOons In the labour camps rrught also result In lmpact on health of labourers as
well as the local populanon. TransmIsSlon of dIseases lS also facllltated by the rrugraoon of
people Dunng the constructiOn stage work, crews and theLrdependenrs may bong With them a
multitude of commUnIcable dIseases IncludlOg sexually transrrutted dlseases (STDs) like AIDS
ThiS IS more so If the nature of rhe project reqUItes more male-workers, who have mIgrated
from orher parts of the state or country

DUring road constructIon allted acovltles lIke quarrytng and CrushlOg operaoons, traffic
diverSIOns, etc, may cause dlsruptlOn of SOCIal and econOmIC !.tEe of the local populatIon Dust
and nOise generated 10 crushmg and blastIng operaoons may cause nUisance to rhe nearby
communmes Other problems perceived IS loss of access and other road aCCIdent rIsks, as a

 Health tmpat·tf due to vehuular polluttOll: Healrh Impacts associated wlth road projects   In

 mllJor cause of the mfecnons and allergIes They enter human bod}' through mhalanon These
 pamculates are more m the effi1SSlOnS of heavy dIesel \'ehIcles. Hence, hIgher volumes of heavy
 "ehldes mcrease the pollunon load and consequent health Impacts.

 Prolonged exposure to exhaust effi1SS10nS of petrol engtnes would cause lead p01so01ng. The
 source bemg, lead used as ann-knockmg agent m petrol. Since lead accumulates m human body,
 If cumulanve concentranons exceed the tolerance level, 1t causes pOlsomng and bram damage at
 rugher concentranons. Hydrocarbons from exhaust effi1SS10nS are carclnogemc at high
 concentranons. Though unpacts due to higher effi1SSlOnS e:ust, such severe Impacts shall be at
 concentranons h1gher than those generated by the proJect. However, there wdl be the potennal
 for ad'lierse ttnpacts on publIc health related to mcreases 1n nOise, especially as traffic volumes
 mcrellse Impacts assOCiated w1th n01se are also long term and restrIcted to the dIrect area of
 mfluence.
Hlalth Impat:tf dill to Wattr loggzllg. Water 10gg1Og can result If the borrow pus and any other
depressions created by the contractor durmg the consrr,ucnon process 15 not surfaced and filled
up adequately. Such pItS if not surfaced can act as breeding ground for mosqwtoes (carrier for
Malana) and other vectors espeoally after torrennal sh9V1ers. The unpact 15 more pronounced If
the pm are located WIthin a kilometer of habltanons as the' gravid, blood-laden mosquitoes
cannot fly very far, so [hey generally bue WlthIn a ktlometer of thel!' breeding place. So adequate
meaSUres are necessary durtng constrllcnon to prevent the spread of Malana and other
\vaterborne and vector borne ruseases.
Health tmpa~tf Dllt to Wattr t:OIIlamillatzo!r. Water contammanon IS lJ.kely lf the sa01tary and other
constrllcnon effluents are ruscharged uno the nearby wat~r bodies WIthout proper treatment. It

needs. They can get affucted with a number of gastro1ntesnnal and other water borne diseases.
So proper precautions on the part of the contractor are necessary.

7.6      INDUCED DEVELOPMENT ALONG EASTERN CORRIDOR

1.6.1         THE ISSUE

The 332 km long Eastern Comdor between Nagapatnnam and TUtlCOrln runs for a major
length w1trun 3-4 km of the coast. The corrtdor cuts across 5 distrlcts (Nagapatnnam,
Thanlavur, T1!Uvarur, Pudukkotcal, Ramanathapuram and Tunconn). The GoTN has declared
most of the caluks along the comdor (espeCIally along the southern stretch of the corndor) as
soc1ally and economlcally backward due ro [he low level of mfrastructure facIDnes and resource
avauability. The project has been conce1ved With an objecave of connecnng these backward
coastal Villages \vlth a better road and thereby enabling an tmprovement 10 the SOC10-eCOnOmlC
profUe of the coastal populatton. As has been confirmed from the vanous ruscusslOns wuh the
road users, the development of th1s road \Vul not change the preference of the long dlstance

7.6.3       ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS & POTENTIALS FOR DEVELOPMENT

The evaluation of the environmental components along the cOIndor revealed that water
avatlabtltty IS the dererrrurung factor for the sustenance of any particular de. .· elopment along the
coast. To assess the water sltuaoon along the coast and to understand the Implications of the
deyelopments thar can be induced due to the project on the eXlsong water SICUatlOn, extenSl\'e
data collectlon on the ground water resources, (of about 100 wells WlthlO 30km from (he coast)
was earned out The envIronmental components analyzed Included,

o  Geomorphologlcal charaCtensClcs,
o  Soll types and characcenstlcs

o   Wacer resources wdudlng,
o   \'{'ater potentlal of nver basins
o   CategonZ3tlOn of blocks based on ground water potential and degree of exploitanon
o  Ground water table
o  Total DIssolved Solids (TDS) and Saltnity levels of the wells wlthln 30km from the coast
   and,
o  Forests and other protected areas

The themattc maps prepared for these components .are presented in Figures 1.3 through
Figure 1.9. The themanc map preparanon also involved the plorung of the TDS and salinity
contours within a band of 30km from the coast using SURFER 32.

The thematic maps were oyerlald to IdentIfy and delineate areas chat are sUl[able for
de\-elopment. This also enabled the IdentIficatIon of areas not suitable for resldennal,
commercial and mdustnal uses, through exclUSion. Such a sUltabllJty analYSIS was done for all
land uses Identlfied. These mdtvldual SUitability maps were overI:ud to work out a compOSite
overlay The composite sUltablhty IdentIfymg areas sUltable! unsuitable for the dtfferenc land
uses IS presented In Figure 7.10.


Based on the overlays and the compOSite sUltablllty exerCise, the followmg tnferences have been
arrived at:

o  78 km of the corodor falls 10 the sallne blocks and hence 00 reSidentIal and commerCIal
   landuses can occur. However, low-denSity commer~lallanduses can occur.
o  Degraded forests are present along 34 kms of the corndor between Ramanathapuram and
   TutIcorin and anocher 1 km of the corridor is c1o!l~ to the mangroves between Muthupet
   and Manora. No aCt1vlOes are to be allowed in these areas:
o  51.5 km of the corndor IS m areas of htgh saluucy content (>5 ppc) and therefore, no
   reSIdentIal or commercial acovmes can take place 10 thts regtoo.
o  Development controls to be exercIsed for a stretch of 164.5 km (inclUSive of the saline
   blocks, degraded forests and mangroves) to regulate land use proliferatIon.
o  In areas other than the mangroves, forests and htgh saliruty zones, whtch includes a
   corrIdor stretch of 170 Km, aon-water tntens1ve mdustnes, low-denSity reSidential and
   commerCIal uses wtll be suttable.

o    Accurate grachng of drains and correct baner slopes to reduce erOSlOn
o    Arrangements for trawmg and supervision of contractor personnel
o  Muldung, nerung and seedmg of batters & drams Immediately on compleuon of earthwork
o    Ensuring runoff control structures are in place before earthworks are started
o    Designs to cope WIth higher levels of runoff at urnes of rugh ramfall

To check sOll erosion on coucal stretches some special measures needs to be employed. They include
rutting on crlClcal road embankment slopes With grass sods, in accordance With the recommended
pracoce for treatment of embankment slopes for erOSlOn control, IRC: 56-1974. The work shall be taken
up as soon as possible provided the season is favourable for the establtshment of sods. Other measures
of slope stabwzauon will mclude mulchmg, netting and seeding of batters and drains tmmedlately on
complenon of earthworks. Dry stone pltchmg for apron and revetment will be provided for bridges and
cross dram age structures. Table 8.3 presents the variOus eroston control measures proposed along the
different packages. Adequate proviSions have been made In the En~neering budget for implementanon
of such measures. Locanons where such measures are to be tmplemented will be tdennfied during

sou quality shall be assessed at productive agnculturallands abutting major traffic intersections, oear
traffic detours and traffic ruversIOOS.                   \I

(u)       Operation Stage

During the operanon stage, the pr!,bability of contaaunacion of soil is only from the road runoff. The
deSign of the road has been worked Out such that the runoff 15 directed 10£0 nearest water bodies
through well-designed drains. Impacts are annClpated only 10 case of aCCIdents InvolVing large spillover
of hazardous matenals or' petroleum products. Morutonng shall be 90ne at the locauons where these
have occurred and further course of action to reduce the polluuon shall be worked out. Therefore, no
contarrunacion of the sou durtng operation stage except in case of aCCIdents 1S annclpated.

The contractor wlil arrange for water requtred for construcoon In such a way chat the water avatlabilicy
and supply to nearby commuruues remain unaffected. The tocal reqwrement of water has been worked
                                                          ,
out as 1280 mJ/day for Northern Corndor and 910 mJ/daV'.for Eastern Corndor (Refer Table 7,10 of
Chapter 7). MaXlmum reqUIrement of water at a parocular place \vorks out to approXlmately 20 to 25
m3 /day at a parucular locauon.

There are several surface water sources as ponds, tanks etc III almost every village [he corrtdors pass
through. In the absence of potable water supply, these ponds rraci.lt1onally have been the source of
dnnklng water and lrngaoon to the commUCllues.·\long both the upgradaoon roads, most of the
settlements have access to potable water through plpehnes. ThIS has reduced the dependence on the
surface water bodtes, especlallr along the settlements Inter:lcoons wuh the communiues espectally
along the Muthupet - Tondi · Ramanathapuram stretch revealed that the surface water, though not
brackish. was not preferred due to the anliabthty of a better sourCe. However. these water bodIes are
used for Irrigation and for other domesllC uses by the commuruty At locauons where the surface \Varer
sources are not avadable, espeCIally along Ramanachapuram to Tutlconn stretch, water from
desallmzaoon plant IS transported through plpeltnes to the nelghborlng Villages. each of wruch has a
pumptng staoon for lnterna! dtsmbuuon One such desal1mzauon plant eXlSts along the corndor at
Nartpatvur (Km 6 0-7 0).

The Northern corndor has far lesser ponds (l pond for e\'erv 83 Km) as compared co the eastern
corndor (1 ponds for e\-en' 38 km) [Refer Appendix 4.71 Howe\'er. there are mllor m'ers along the

     IS available in the Immediate area for the project IS a pre·requlsIte pnor to extractIOn of ground
     ,vater. The contractor shall need ro comply With the requirements of the state ground water
     department and seek their approval for dOing so.
 o   To a,"old disruptIOn/disturbance        [0   other water users, the conrractor wtll extract water from fixed
     locanons
 o   Ground \'rater Board, P\,(D, GoTN has categorIzed blocks based on ground water extract10n as
     o'-er exploited and dark (8S-100 0/0) and grey (65·85°0) The conrractor Will not be allowed to
     extract any ground water from such o,-er explOIted and dark blocks and grer blocks.
 o   _\Iong the eastern corndor, the surface water bodies get replemshed from the aqUifers. Any
     exrracnon of ground warer, beyond the natural recharge ffilght lead to degradanon of water quality
     of these surface water bodies. Therefore, extracnon of ground water IS to be restClcted along the
     eastern corndor.
 o   The TDS concentranons 10 the ground water were found exceeding 2000 mg/l for distances uptO
     20km from the coast, With the exception of the surface water bodies, whIch get recharged from the
     aqwfers. The ground water will not be extracted by the contractor from over exploited, dark blocks
     and grey blocks. In the wlute blocks, the contractor IS perrrutted to extract ground water at locanons
     where the TDS IS less than 1500 ppm. Through out the period of extraction the contractor will
     penodically morutor the TDS content (every season) to ensure that the IDS does not exceed 2000
     ppm levels.
o    Along TNRSP 04, twO road stretches have been idenafied between Vembar and Kulattur and
     Kulattur and Tuaconn that are bereft of any roadside surface water bodies (Refer Appendix 4.7)_
     Hence for these stretches alternate sources have been Idenofied. They lOclude:

          o   For the stretch between Vembar and Kulattur, water for construction will be purchases
              from Naapalyur Desalmation Plant's spare capaclty_ The plant IS nlOcaonaJ at present.

          o   For the stretch between Kulattur and Tuticoan the reqUIred water will be sourced from the
              Man)aneer Kayal water treaement plant at Tuticonn. The plant treats 45000 KL/day wlth
              1800'KL/day of filter backwash water being dralOed. The water reqwrement for dus stretch
              is about 75 KL/day, which can be met from the filter backwash water, which will be
              separately treated and transported by trucks to dus stretch.

o    Wastage of water durlOg the consrrucaon Will be mirunuzed. \Vhlle worklOg across or close to
     perenruaJ water bodies, the Contractor WIll not Impede or block any flow of water. If for any
     badgework, containment of flow IS reqwred, the Contractor will seek approval of the Engtneer. The
     Engineer wllJ have the aght to ask the Contractor to serve aoace on all downstream users In
     advance of any closure.
o    Construction over and close to any non.perenrual streams shall be carned out In the dry season.
     Construcaon over lCrlgaaon canals WIll be undertaken WIth perrrussion WIth the Department of
     Irngaaon. Care should be taken to ffilnlrtUSe any dlsrupaon to the flows and to ensure that a Iugh
     quahty of water 15 malOtatned.
o    The Contractor may use che natural sources of water subJect co the prOVision that any claim anslOg
     out of confucts Wlth other users of the satd natural sources wtll be hIS responSIbility.

    Introducuon of an obstructlon between source and receptor.

.As the modification of the characterIStlcs of the velucles / vehicle components etc, does not fall under
the purvle,v of tlus proJect, the second option of the Introducuon of an obstructton In the form of a
nOIse barrIer between the source of nOise and the receptor along tpe road Will be adopted. The different

 Mitigation / Enhancement Measures within the Reserve Forests

 The upgradauon roads traverse about 13 kID along Reserve Forests .-\!ong certain secuons as presented
 In Table 8.10, crossmg of wlldltfe IS an Impacr that needs to be addressed. The a01mals cross the road

 for dClnkmg water (Refer Secuon 721.1 of Chapter 7). The increase In traffic and higher speeds along
 rhe upgraded corndors ffilght ad\-ersely affect such antmals Hence ffiltlgatlon measures are necessary to
 abate the Impacrs.

E:nensIve consulcaaons were held at each of the Reserve Forest locations wuh the forest department
officials and the local commUOlaes [Refer Appendix 6.2 (i) & (iv)]. The frequency of arumal crossings.
paracular crOSSing routes and the reasons for crossmg etc were discussed. It was found In most of the
cases that the deer cross the roads In search of drtnktng water and monkeys go out of the forests tn
search of food, usually from agnculrural fields or habltaaons nearby. Tlus Issue is more pronounced
dUring the summers. This has been largely due to the non-avatlability of a drinking source wltlun the
forests. It was felt prudent that provIsIOn of a drlnktng source wItlun the foresrs would be a moce
Iasang solution than provldtng safe passages for arumal crossmgs. Also, the effecuveness and uultty of
such crossIngs tn ffilturnIZlOg colliSIon WIth vehicles IS not very encouragtng
To ffilnuruze the movement of the monkeys along the corndor, planang frult species that prOVide frutts
at dIfferent seasons of rhe year as well as tender shoots are suggested at locations spec1fied 10 Table

    ProvIsion of water sources within the forests: The eXisting source of water In some forest areas such
    as Mudanal forests IS the percolatIon ponds dug by the forest department These are ral!1 fed and do not
    sef'-e the purpose dUring summers when It IS most needed. Therefore, Instead of percolauon ponds It IS
    suggested to ha\-e small ponds of size 1m x 10m x 03m \VHh cement concrete se:I1lOg (co pre\-enr

    (B)        WILD LIFE SANCTUARY
Udayamarthandapuram BU"d Sanctuary IS located at a distance of about 300 m from the project road.
The sanctuary attracts about 30.000 buds between October and January. The Impact anttcipated due to
the project IS the lflcreased nOise levels dUring constructton. The constructton work should be scheduled
for penods outslde October to January ame frame at th1s srtetch to ffilntrruze the Impacts on ffilgratocy
    speCIes.

the contractor shall ensure that the mo,-emenr of constructIOn egwpments and machlOery, IOcludlOg the
mOt'ement of consrructton crew should be resrncted co ae least a dtseance of 300m from the wetland
portlon of the sanctuary to aVOid any Impacts to the a\flfauna.

(II)           Operation .ftag'
Dunng the operatton of the road, no Impacts are expected because most of the speCIes of ffilgratory
birds are high tlylOg and are not vulnerable to coll..tston. Signboards lOforffilng the road-users about. the

 (D)       LANDSCAPING STRATEGY FOR PROJECT CORRIDOR

To rrumrruze the felling of trees, the deSigns have been worked out such that only trees wlthm 1.5 m of
the carnageway 1n urban sectIons and crees wahin 1.5 m from the edge of the shoulder wtll be felled for
the proJect. Dunng the consrructlon stage, the concractor shall ensure that no trees outSide the Color
those not: marked are felled· due to the project. To compensate for the CUt crees, for every cree cut: as
parr of the proJect, four crees shall be planted. Also add1t1onal cree planung along all bypasses has also
been proposed. Detalls are provided 10 Table 8.11.

 The Eastern corridor tuns parallel to the coast wichm 2km from the sea for a majO!: length. Given the
 sandy soil and the sahne groWld water cond.!tioQS e:t1st1Og, limned species can grow in such areas. Based
 on a study of the local £10[2 and Interactlons wtth bocarucal experts, the folloWUlg speoes were found
 sUltable for avenue plantanons: Thespma popllbrta, A"an'a allrim/oJormi.r, A'lllia IIIl1ngilllll and P,/fophof1lm
fiTTllgineNm.
In coastal areas the trees are faced with scrong winds and stand a nsk of getting uprooted. Thespesia
populnea, though can sustain in h.tghlr saliae conditions is not a very sturdy tree. Therefore, Tbespesia
15 not suggested along stre[ches directly exposed to the sea. Along scretches directly facing the sea, the
spacing of the inner row of crees wIll be reduced [0 3m on the seaward SIde so that It will serve as a
Windbreak. The speCIes swtable for plaonog 00 the Inner row of trees xnclude Polyalthla IOllgift/ia and

  8.2.11     LAND USE MANAGEMENT ALONG THE EASTERN CORRIDOR

 The Issue of Induced De\Oelopmem along the Eastern Corridor has already been dIscussed In the
 relevant secoons 10 Chapter -+ (Section .j..j. 3 2) and Chapter 7 (Section 7 6). The comprehensive
 coverage of the tOpIC covenng pollcy, 1OstHutlona! setting, ImpaCts, analyses of possible mmganon and
 momtorlng measures and Implemematlon arrangements ha\'e been presented In a separate AppendiX
 oded "Land use r.(anagemenr along the Eastero Comdor" (Appendix 4.9) The measures proposed
 for management of land use ha\'e been presented In tlus SecClon

  8,2,11.!
 The find10gs of the SUitabIlIty exercise and the Induced de\'elopment Issues related [0 the land use
 changes were presented to the various goveromental agencIes:: The land use workshop pro\'lded a
 forum for assessing the SIcuaoon and arrive at an ImplementatIon mecharusm that would address the
 core Issue of Induced development by planrung and for regulatIng land uscs. There was an overall
 consensus amongst the workshop pamclpants that there was no necesslty for modIfy109 the eXlsong
 legislatIons, as they had 10 them In-bwlt all necessary safeguards for regulating and planrung land uses.
 Though these legtslauons have been amended penodlcally by the respectlve Government agencIes to
 SWt the growing reqwrements, the change 10 the eXIsting process for thIs projeCt was not discussed at

 length, as It was found not necessary.

 The various InstItutional mechanisms that were discussed in~lude:
                                                                        I   ,
 o      Notlficatlon of the coastal stretch as a planrung area,
 o      Estabhshment of a separate planmng authority for monitoring land uses along the COaSt
 o      Morutonng by the State and DistrIct Level Commmees for TNRSP
 o      Formation of a rugh level committee comprlsmg heads of departments of hoe agencies for
        accordtng land use approvals, supported ac the dtStrIct levels
 o      IncorporatIon of the TNRSP development controls Wltrun the gutdelines for clearance of the village
        and town Panchayats and educating the offiCials of the local bodies on the clearance procedures.
The evaluatlon of each of these institutional mecharusms, as dIscussed dUring the workshop and the
subsequem dlscusSlOns with the stakeholders IS presented In the followmg sub-sections.
(A)         Notification of the Entire Coastal Stretch as a Planning Area
The Tarrnl Nadu T&CP Act, 1971, (pronslOn 10 1) states "the Government may by notification 10 TN
Govt. Gazette, from tIme to orne, declare thel! Intention to speCify any area 10 the state to be a planmng
area" Once notified as a planmng area, a land use plan for the area notified can be prepared and the
development comrols Implemented 10 accordance wah the plan pronslOns.
The notification IS generally done for a defirute geograprucal or adlll1rustratlve boundarr The
deilOeatIOn of a StrlP of land along the road Will cur across dIfferent adlll1mstratlve boundaries. Also,
deilOeatIng such a planrung area would lOvolve depnvlng the local aUthOCltIeS of theu es.tstIng powers.




! .\   land use workshop was conducted by the "hghwtln Department on thl! 25 th of S.:p!cmbcr 2002 to work out   mech~l\Isms
for    m~n~gtng land use:; along the COrridor.



                                                               8'41
T~mtl N~Ju   Road SeClor ProlCCI



As n result, the operauonahzatlon of thIs opaon was not conSidered prac[1cal Also, the nme taken for
noufica[1on and preparation of the development plans IS enormous.

Therefore, this option IS not taken up for subsequent consIderatIon.
(B)     Establishment of a Separate Authority for Monitoring Land Uses along the Coast
.\Jl the eXlstmg dep:mments, local authormes and regulnmrr nuthormes do hn,-e thelf own rules,
regul:tuons, laws, by-laws etc and are suffiCIent to take care of concrolhng and mOnltormg the
de\-elopn.;:..u acnntles Therefore no changes are reCfUlred Further. no guarancee I:> the · .: co the effect
that such re\'lsed statutes will meet the reCfulremenrs In full and \vlthour legal problems
To address the weak lmk of effectlve enforcement mechanisms, an option can be to bnng IntO being an
msutU!:1onal mecharusm, :vruch wul oversee the deliverles of the local bodies and sratutory authormes
perrammg [0 thIS proJect. The secretanat of such an IflSntutlOn shall be a full time office headed by an
semor revenue officer delegated WIth powers to take deCISions on all land use perlIlJSSlon related Issues
along the corndor He wul be supported 111 hIS acovltles by the Heads of such Local Bodies, the Heads
of concerned Government departments, the Dlstrlct collectors and other dtStrlct level offiCIals of the
departments. Tlus DistriCt level commmee Will morutor the functlorung of the agenCIes under dus
proJect and remedy the SItuatiOnS wherever called for. BeSides, there shall anse a smgle POInt momtonng
of the project to ensure course-correC!:1ons as needed and completion on ume.
The authoncy at present hes WIth several heads of department as the Department of Town and Country
Planrung, Depa.ctment of Town Panchayats, Department lof Env1.Conment etc. Setung up such an
authoncy for the prOJect was not found acceptable to the partlclpants. Therefore tlus optlon IS 1lQ..t
further elaborated.
(C)    Monitoring by the State and District Level Committees for TNRSP

As pan of the project implementacon mecharusms, state and distnct level commIttees have
been consn.tuted. The state level comnuttees comprIse apart from the Project Director, the
heads of departments of other agencies as the FInance, Revenue, HIghways etc. At the d!stncts,
District Level Comrruttees have been formed WIth the Distoct Collector as the Chairperson and
the dtsmct heads of the varIOUS Government Departments Includmg the RegIOnal Deputy
Dtrector of T&CP. These comnuttees have been consotuted to address the grlevance redressal
of the PAPs and the various resetrlement and rehabilitaoon Issues In the proJect, The gnevances
are referred to the apex comrruttee at the state level, only If the gne\rances are not resolved at
the level of the DIstrIct Collector.


On sunIlar hnes, It       15   suggested tha t corruruttees are set up along the coastal dtsmcts for
regulan.ng and planrung the land uses along the corndor Based on the sultablllty of the land
stretches, pernusslons can be accorded. The comnurcee at the dtsmct leyel shall be chaIred by
the Dlsmct Collector, \v'1.th the dJstnct heads of the departmenrs of town and country planrung,
town panchayats, enVlronmenr, ground water board etc ad"l.'1Slng rum on the techrucal aspects

 The difficulty assocIated wIth trus mecharusm is that these comnuttees are purely temporary and
 are set only to address the Issues raised dunng the project Implementanon. To address trus, It
 has been recommended that the comnuttee connnue throughout the project implementanon
 period rill one year after the complenon of the proJect.·\fter trus period, the Government \v"lll
 re\'lew the need for extendmg the tenure of crus comrruttee

 (0)       Capacity building of the local bodies
 Incorporatlon of the TNRSP de,'elopment controls wIthin [he gUldehnes for clearance of the nil age and
 town panchayats As part of TNRSP, tnumng programs \'!jl11 be conducted for educating the offiCials of
 the local bodies on the clearance procedures.

 Suggested set-lip
 The formanon of distrlct level commlttees for approval of land uses chaued br the District Collector
 and represented by the variOUS government agencies has been suggested. Only 10 cases ,vhere the Issue
 is not resolved at the rus[nct level, the Issue will be referred to the State level commItted where all heads
 of departments w1l1 be members. To educate the members of the local muructpal bodies, It IS proposed
 that trauung on the controls and regulaoons wdl be provided as part of the proJect.

 FIITthe,. Deliberations on the iSSlle of Landllse Management
The issue of landuse management along the Eastern Corl'ldor was further discussed wlth vanous levels
of stakeholders) to ascertaln thelt Vlews. A separate sessIon, 10 the workshop was set aside to exclUSively
                                                               \

ruscuss the Issues related to landuse management. After adequate dehberarions on the issue it was
deCided by all participants to 10sntute a study on the Chennal Cuddalore section of the East Coast Road.
The study would focus on the tmplementatlon process, the ffilstakes commttted theretn, the lessons
learnt and the present day sItuation.. It would provide cnocaltnputs to formulate measures to control
induced development along the project road.

It was deCided that an external agency would be responsible for formulanng the Terms of Reference
(foR) of the study, wluch would be sent to the HD for tncorporaong their suggestions. The HD IS now
under the process of ftnahztng the TOR for the study. Adequate COst prOViSIons has been incorporated
10 the EnVironmental Budget to lrutl3te the study.


Trawing i\-todllies
DetaIled tralmng modules for landuse management along the Eastern Comdor would be developed
based on the results of study on lOduced development to be carned out subsequently However, a
tent:lC1ve rralrung schedule has been prepared and budgetary prov'tslons are made for the same. The
traamng IS enVlsaged to be carned out at State and dlstnct le'-els. Two state level tralmng sessions and
three diStriCt level tratntng sessIons (for each of the dIst.r1cts selected) are proposed. Each wumng
seSSIon wtll be of 3 days. The agency selected for carrying out the study on [he Chennal Cuddalore

 o  To generate goodwdl amongst the local commumcy (Q\\rards the project, by the enhancement of
     common propercy resources.

 The enhancement measures have been suggested for the followmg ennronmemal componems

 o   Enhancement of surface water bodIes
 o   Enhancement of Cultural properties
 o   Enhancemen. of lnctdencal spaces
8.3.1      SURFACE WATER BODIES

 8.3.1.1            en/eno for Sele,'fton

The cntena for selecnon of a surface water body (pond/tank) as an enhancemem candidate is:

o  The sites directly impacted by the project and are in acnve use of the community. These
   should essentIally be a community property, and not under pnvate ownership
o    The sites not dIrecdy Impacted (upto 100m and dIrecdy opens Onto the htghway), bemg a part of a
     relIgIOUS structure or any other property, but sall can be of vIsual as well as soclaltmportance

Propel: edge prPtecnons, walkways, plantation of shade and ornamental trees are tntegral part of
the enhancement.


All the enhancement concept aims at Impr01,-lllg the present status of water body, which can be
of more use to the local community. The enhancement includes general landscaping, proper
access to the water edge and other measures as per the site requirernents.

8.3.1.2            Dmgn com'epts .. OueNliew

The concept for enhancements 15 based on the data collected from the local people through commuruty
consultatlOn. The lOformatlOn collected mcludes name, dIstance of nearest setdement, the age of the
structure, local 1mportance, rehgtous or hlsroncal slgmficance, tJ'Pe and frequency of use e.g.
drinkmg/washtng/etc. The slte observanon also proVided vltalmputs 1n concept formulatlon.


The water body lymg Just at the edge of the carriageway will haye an lIIlpact on the water qua.uty
as well as quannty. For such commuruty ponds proper edge protection should be gn-en 10 rhe
form of bnck pltcblng or stone pucblng The deSign concept includes pronSlOn of phYSical
access only to the eXlSong steps but mamraming "'1sual accesslbllny throughout the length as
well as the surrouniling area.


Other parameters taken Into conslderanon are whether water pollutIon is bemg caused by
aco"'lt1es of the settlement, eXlsting ero:>lon/ slope condition, catchment area detalls by \"lsual
lnspecnon, presence of .-\quanc hfe, detalls of seasonal farr/ fesnval/ congregaoon held, If any.

 the water body for washmg or badl.lng purposes Canopy IS pco\-ided wherever need               1S     felt for a
 covered or a shaded sating area due to the lack of e:asnng trees.

 8.3.2    CULTURAL PROPERTIES


The sites IdentIfied as sUItable for enhancements along the TNRSP corndors can be claSSified Inw (hree
broad categones on the baSIS of nlues attached With them. These Include the cLlIrural SHes hanng only
rcltglOus ,'alue, those hanng both the reltglOus as well as histoncal \'alue and those hanng only histoncal
I:nlues. Of the abo\-e-menuoned three categones the second one has been gI\"en pnme Importance 10 the
enhancement proposals.

8.32.1           Cntend jor SdtnltOn

The cntenon for the selecuon of SItes sUItable for enhancemem was based on four factors. FIrstly their
Importance for the local people secondly the rellgtous s'lgruficance, thIrdly, the 'hIsconcallmportance and
fourthly the scope for enhancements. The Importance of the site for the local people as well as the
hlstoncal slgmficance was Idenufied through extensive dtscussions wtth the local commuruty and general
observatlons of the sues and structures, The scope for enhancemem mcluded the pOSSIbility of any
further Improvemem, availabIlIty of space for enhancements and the ltkely benefits for the local
community as well as the road users. Poor condtuonof some hIstorical structures was a cOnstraim 10
selecung SItes for enhancement. Such sItes tough havmg'lugh lustoncal values e:ust in a very bad
phYSIcal condltlon . .At such places enhancement measures have no mearung WIthout restonng the malO
structure, wluch IS beyond the scope of the enhancement works.

8.3.2.2         Dmgn Concepts - OverVIew
The concept for enhancements IS based on the suggesuons given by the people. ExtenSive commumty
consultluons were carrIed out on each of the enhancement sItes. The InformatlC?n gathered Included the
age of the structure, Importance for the local people, rellgtous sIgmficance, hIstorIcal Importance, the
SIze of the populaaon USIng 1(, suggesuons for enhancements, wll11ngness of people to paracIpate, etc.
The site observaaon also prOVided vlcal lOputS In concept formulaaon. It provJded the general
Informaaon about the condwon of the malO structure and the surrounding, vISlblltry of the
enhancement SHe from the prolect road. the sceruc beauty of the SIte as well as the surroundlOg area etc

In case rellg:tous places, enhancements are suggested on the baSIS of the usage. For example pavlOg 15
suggested around the temple 10 most of the cases as people mo\'e around the temple ThiS rttual known
as prt.ldakIhtna IS a common pracnce In most of the temples In Taffill Nadu.Slffillarly In mosques pa\"1Og
IS proposed 10 front Side \..here people pray on Fndays.



The type of pa""lng proposed vanes at different places withIn a site accord1Og to the use of spaces and
theIr relauve Importance. For example the paving proposed In front of temple IS different than chat for
approach pavement, which 1S agatn different from the p:w1Og for pradtlkJ'htna. Such dt,"erslty 10 the
paYing pattern IS malOtruned 10 all the enhancement proposals.

 In [he reuglOus places hke temples mosque, dargah and church where large number of people gathers
 weekly or annually, measures are taken for the safety of the people, as they tend to spill o,"er on road.
 Compound wall and fencmg IS suggested as safety measures at such places

 In many cases the local people were concerned about the safety of the propem' Compound wall wah
 gate and fencmg are proposed for such sites.

 There are mam' Important rehglOus and hlsron('al centers that are accessible from the project road
 .-\pproach enhancement IS proposed at the pbce \vhere the approach meets the project road The
 enhancement measures are suggested to emphaSize the presence of such rehglOus or histOrical place.
 The measures Include provlSlon of arch or columns with decoranve and VISible signage These measures
 are conceived In such a way so as to reflect the architectural charactenstlcs and the reltglous or rustonc
 slgOlficance of the place.

There are sites along the prOject comdor, wruch have rugh rustoncal slgruficance, but are neglected. The
lack of awareness among the people and negligence on the part of authontles IS eVident form the very
state of these structures. Enhancement measures for these sites are proposed 111 such a way as to
mcrease pubhc awareness, which may in turn lead to conservation of these structures, by the concerned
authorities.

The sltes haVlJ1g good scemc beauty and ample space for p.arktng and sitting are conCeived as potennal
                                                             , .
stopovers. Shading and pleasanr VIews are considered Important in such places. The presence of pond
near stopover is considered preferable as It not only gIves a pleasant view but also provides refreshing
cool breeze. The 111cidental spaces resulnng by the realignmenr of the road IS proposed to be developed
as landscaped green areas to Improve the visual quality of the road. Tree plantations are suggested only
at those places where the local people are wIllmg to take care of the trees, as mamtenance of trees is a
major Issue.

8.3.3     COMMUNITY SPACE
Any other type of space idenufied along the proJect corndor rendered Important for the local
commumtles are enhanced on sun.t1ar gUlde1lOes. These are posslbdltles of a COmb1OatlOn of different
type of cultural properues, for e.g. a temple With 10cldental space 10 f!Ont of It, any me forms an
1nterestlng combmaaon OWlOg fO the road realtgnment at the spot.

8.3.3.1           en/eno for seiutiOl1
The aim of enhancement on the InCIdental space would be to create a spot of usual re1axatlon for the
onlookers 10 the locahey and the travehng motomts. Consultanon \vith pubuc at some of the locations
revealed that they are wtlllng to participate 10 the enhancement programme though cher may noc be able
