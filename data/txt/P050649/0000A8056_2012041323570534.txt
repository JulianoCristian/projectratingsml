                         The project development objective is to improve the quality and sustainability of the state's core road network. The core road network refers to the state highways and
                         the major district roads being managed by the Highways Department of Tamil Nadu. This objective is to be achieved through the following four outputs (i) capacity and
                         quality enhancement of about 750 km of state roads in the core network with proper management of environment and social impacts; (ii) major maintenance of about
                         2000 km and accident black-spot improvements at a number of critical locations; (iii) improvements to the management of the state road network through institutional
                         strengthening and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); and (iv) enhanced funding and improved allocation procedures for the road sector.

                         commenced about 8 months back for improvement of about 300 km of roads on performance-based maintenance contract (five-year duration). With these, periodic maintenance of a
                         total of about 1330 km of roads is being implemented under the project as against 2000 km originally envisaged.

                         Department has planned for improvement of 307 black-spots and, of these, 282 black-spots have been improved and the rest are in progress.
