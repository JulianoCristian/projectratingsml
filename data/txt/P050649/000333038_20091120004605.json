Among them are\n            the following: The microclimate is likely to be modified\n            slightly due to removal of roadside trees and the addition\n            of increased pavement surface. Avoidance measures, such as\n            reducing the number of trees to be cut have been worked out\n            as part of the project design. Avenue plantations along the\n            upgradation roads, proposed as part of the landscaping\n            strategy, will compensate for lost trees. Locating borrow\n            pits, construction camp locations, and traffic detours on\n            productive lands will be avoided. Topsoil stripped off will\n            be stockpiled and used for redevelopment of borrow areas,\n            top dressing of road embankments, and for filling slopes and\n            tree pits. Flatter slopes have been worked out to ensure\n            stability and reduce the chances of slope failures, and\n            turfing, dry stone pitching, accurate grading of drains, and\n            runoff control structures will prevent soil erosion.\n            Transport vehicles and movement of equipment will be\n            restricted to prevent soil compaction. Measures will be\n            taken to minimize waste generation. Monitoring will be done\n            at spill locations to reduce pollution. Licensed quarries\n            will be identified. Impacts on water bodies are mostly\n            limited to cutting of the embankments and do not involve\n            reduction of storage capacity. Ensure that no permanent\n            damage is caused to religious and historic sites. Remove\n            sacred groves if needed to prevent damage. Changes in the\n            cross section and in the curve radius will help lessen\n            impacts on other cultural properties. Plant different fruits\n            at different seasons to avoid degrading mangrove trees. To\n            prevent forest animals from coming in the road, and to\n            protect grazing cattle entering the road, install a thick\n            barrier of non-palatable vegetation. Set up safety measures\n            to prevent occupational accidents. Declare quiet zones to\n            reduce traffic noise, use signs to curb vehicle speeds,\n            schedule construction, and prevent noise-generating\n            machinery and vehicles from operating in the area. Plant\n            pollution resistant species, reduce vehicle emissions,\n            ensure maintenance and repair, and educate drivers to reduce\n            risks to air quality. Cover vehicles, spray water on\n            earthworks to reduce dust and scrubbers to reduce exhaust\n            gases. Install drainage system to dispose of runoff and\n            encourage recharging of underground water resources.\n            Construct replacement ponds and embankments to help conserve\n            water level."}, "docdt": "2009-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
