                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve the quality and sustainability of the state's core road network. The core road network refers to the state
                         highways and the major district roads being managed by the Highways Department of Tamil Nadu. This objective is to be achieved through the following four
                         outputs (i) capacity and quality enhancement of about 750 km of state roads in the core network with proper management of environment and social impacts; (ii)
                         major maintenance of about 2000 km and accident black-spot improvements at a number of critical locations; (iii) improvements to the management of the state
                         road network through institutional strengthening and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); and (iv) enhanced funding and improved allocation procedures for the
                         road sector.

                         quality are being experienced by the road users. The institutional strengthening component also is progressing well with reorganization of the Highways Department and Road
                         Management System and Road Accident Database Management System made operational. Timely completion of the Project and Financial Management System, which is in
                         progress and procurement of Geographic Information system and Advanced Road Data Collection System, would significantly enhance the planning and operational capacity of the
