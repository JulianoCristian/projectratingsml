Paper (I-PRSP). The project will\n            promote faster growth, and poverty reduction by improving\n            private sector development, thereby generating jobs, and\n            higher wages. Restrictions shall be removed on private entry\n            in remaining sub-sectors; the legal framework shall be\n            unified for enterprises; and, access to, and private\n            transactions in land-use rights will be facilitated.\n            Moreover, state enterprises reform will improve the\n            efficiency, and free-up fiscal resources for the poverty\n            reduction program, by accelerating equity, and by amending\n            the legal framework to improve transparency. Additionally,\n            social safety nets will be expanded for state-owned\n            enterprises workers displaced by reform. Restructuring the\n            banking system should reduce the risk of financial crisis,\n            which could otherwise undermine poverty reduction efforts,\n            through improved legal, regulatory, and supervisory\n            framework, promoting prudent banking. The expansion of\n            labor-intensive exports should integrate the country with\n            the world economy, by removing restrictions, and reducing\n            tariffs. Nonetheless, resistance to reform, higher than\n            estimated reform costs, and, weak human capacity, are risks\n            to be considered."}, "docdt": "2001-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
