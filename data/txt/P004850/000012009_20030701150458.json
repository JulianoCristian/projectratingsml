substantial. Lessons\n            primarily suggest that a stable political environment is\n            helpful for successful implementation of macroeconomic, and\n            structural reforms - given the risk of erosion of political\n            support was minimal, and reversals due to political changes\n            were unlikely. Second, the broad-based consensus, and strong\n            government commitment permitted a timely implementation,\n            while the presence of capable, and committed officials, was\n            key to overcoming some of the emerging difficulties in\n            implementation, especially in state-owned enterprises (SOE),\n            and trade reform, as well as in the Joint-Stock Bank\n            restructuring. Third, the availability of technical\n            assistance grants from donors, and strong Bank team support\n            were extremely useful, particularly true of process reforms\n            of the sort undertaken in SOE and banking reforms, which\n            need a lot of handholding within institutions. Fourth,\n            effective donor coordination is crucial in a transitional\n            economy: capacity to implement structural reforms can easily\n            be overwhelmed by the relatively large number of donors,\n            therefore, it is critical that donors coordinate their\n            activities closely, and minimize duplication of efforts, an\n            aspect well handled, both in the design, and implementation\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
