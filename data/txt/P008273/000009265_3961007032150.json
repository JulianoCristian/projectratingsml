Project are to: promote small farm and off-farm activities\n            and help restart a rural market economy; to repair basic\n            rural infrastructure; and to create employment for the rural\n            population and inject cash resources into rural households.\n            The project components are: 1) rural works to rehabilitate\n            small infrastructure, such as ex-cooperative dirt roads,\n            village water supply or irrigation systems, schools and\n            health care centers, and market facilities; 2) small-scale\n            credit to extend the existing village credit fund network\n            and provide small loans to farmers and other rural\n            microentrepreneurs for all types of income-generating\n            activity; 3) promotion of rural activities by providing\n            business and technical advice, and promoting and supporting\n            the creation of village animal health associations to\n            improve prophylaxis; and 4) studies and local government training."}, "docdt": "1995-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
