Lessons convey that success was driven\n            primarily by highly committed staff, from both the Bank, and\n            Albania, who ensured flexibility in project design,\n            emphasized the necessary institutional framework, and\n            carried out intensive supervision. However, minor\n            shortcomings suggest that rapid institutional change, may\n            divert attention from other objectives, unless key\n            performance indicators have been clearly defined, and are\n            being monitored. This means that further attention could\n            have been given to potential synergies, such as addressing\n            explicit trade-offs, namely, the shift from rural poverty\n            reduction, that is, channeling resources to poor rural\n            households, into rapid institutional development, that is,\n            developing financial institutions in the economically most\n            viable villages, and could thus have served better, if\n            addressed at project preparation, and during implementation.\n            The success of the rural micro-credit program, stems from an\n            early village level involvement in the design of the\n            participatory delivery mechanism, which was piloted and\n            adjusted to local conditions, and where loan decisions were\n            made at the village level. It proves that even under extreme\n            conditions of institutional weakness, and civil instability,\n            such programs can sustain repayment performance, if\n            ownership is rooted at the community level."}, "docdt": "2000-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
