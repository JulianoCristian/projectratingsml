This\n            operation is the first of a new series of three PRSCs to be\n            disbursed as single tranche operations. It is consistent\n            with the Bank's new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)\n            discussed at the Board of Executive Directors on April 3,\n            2007, to support the implementation of the Government's\n            poverty reduction strategy as laid out in the Madagascar\n            Action Plan (MAP). The objective of the MAP is to promote\n            rapid and sustainable development over the next five years\n            in line with the Government's national vision document\n            (Madagascar Naturally) and the UN Millennium Development\n            Goals (MDGs). To attain this objective, the MAP presents\n            eight key commitments: (i) responsible governance; (ii)\n            connected infrastructure; (iii) educational transformation;\n            (iv) rural development and a green revolution; (v) health,\n            family planning and the fight against HIV/AIDS; (vi) high\n            growth economy; (vii) cherish the environment; and (viii)\n            national solidarity. The new PRSC series will continue to\n            support the Government to implement its comprehensive\n            governance reform program. A key priority will be the\n            consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC\n            series (PRSC 1, 2 and 3), mainly to further refine the\n            regulatory and institutional governance framework which has\n            been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to\n            improve impact of governance related activities. Additional\n            support will be given to governance reforms, in particular\n            governance challenges in selected entities such as the\n            revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the\n            forestry and the mining sectors."}, "docdt": "2007-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
