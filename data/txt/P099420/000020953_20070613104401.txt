Development        Inline withthe new CountryAssistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series o f
Objectives and     single tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided inthe
Description        form o f budget support, is envisagedto support implementation o f key
                   components o fthe new Madagascar PRSP called the Madagascar Action Plan
                   (MAP). The focus o fthe series is centered on: (i)   governance and budget
                   management reform and (ii)    improved systems for service delivery in education,
                   health, nutrition, water and sanitation.

                   The new PRSC series will continue to support the Government to implement its
                   comprehensive governance reform program. A key priority will be the
                   consolidation o f the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC 1,2
                   and 3), mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance
                   framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existinggaps, and to
                   improve impact o f governance related activities. Additional support will be
                   given to governance reforms, inparticular governance challenges in selected
                   entities such as the revenue agencies and insensitive sectors such as the forestry
                   and the miningsectors. Reforms inthese areas will provide an important test
                   for the efficiency and effectiveness ofthe existinggovernance framework.
                   Regarding basic service delivery, the objective o fthe series is to accompany the
                   process o f institutionalstrengthening and quality improvements underway in
                   the sectors. More specifically, the PRSCs will complement the Bank's existing
                   investment portfolio by reinforcinginstitutionalrationalization and
                   strengthening innutrition and by supporting the implementation o f sector-wide
                   approaches inhealth, education and water supply.

                   The Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA, 2003), the Country
                   Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2003), and the 2005 and 2007 Public
                   Expenditure Review (PER) provide the analytical underpinnings for the public
                   sector reform agenda o fthe PRSC series. Updatedannual analysis for the
                   Education For All underpins the education reforms. Ongoing work insupport o f
                   the nascent health SWAP provides the foundations for the interventions inthis
                   sector.

                  The proposedoperation is the first PRSC o fthe second series (PRSC 4,5 and 6)
                  and will continue to contribute to Madagascar reaching its development goals as
                  now reaffirmed in its MAP. The reforms supported will strengthenthe
                  institutional infrastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to
                  carry out its role more effectively. Improved delivery o f public services is
                  essential ifthe Government is to reach its goals for poverty reduction and
                  improve the quality o f life in Madagascar.
                   The implementationo fthis operation continues to be exposedto risks, many o f
                   which were already identified inprevious PRSC operations and inthe CAS.
                   The main risks include: (i)   vulnerability to external shocks, particularly
                   cyclones and changes inglobal commodity prices, such as oil and rice; (ii)
                   political risk which poses a continued threat inMadagascar given its history o f
                   instability; (iii)
                                    maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, which is
                   critical to the successful implementationo fthe PRSC and is a core area o f
                   focus o fthe MAP; (iv) the implementationo fpublic finance reforms poses
                   challenges and risks which could negatively impact service delivery; and (v)
                   capacity constraints present significant risks to effective implementationo f
                   reforms.

                   The Government and the Bank are undertaking several measures to mitigate
                   these risks. The Bank has supported the Government to finalize a Risk
                   Management and Social Protection Reviewto assess risk preventionand
                   mitigation strategies, and it has modifiedthe procedures for the IDA-supported
                   Community Development Project to allow it to respond more rapidly to
                   emergencies such as cyclones. Further analytical work is on-going to
                   strengthen Government capacity to respondto weather related shocks. On
                   political issues, the aftermath o fthe transparent and peacefully-conducted
                   December 2006 Presidential elections underscores the relatively stable political
                   situation. On the macroeconomic environment and overall governance, the
                   Bank is continuing to support reforms inthe areas o fpublic financial
                   management and capacity buildingthrough ongoing investment operations
                   such as the Governance and Institutional Development project, the PRSC
                   series, the AAA program and WBI capacity buildingsupport. The Bank will
                   also continue to coordinate its support inthese areas with the IMF inthe
                   framework o fthe PRGFprogram. On capacity constraints, the donor
                   community has intensifiedefforts at coordinating assistance programs,
                   harmonizing disbursement and procurement procedures and developing
                   common programmatic approaches around the MAP. The donor community is
                   also increasing its level o f technical assistance and support for capacity
                   building. Overall, the Bank programcontinues to focus ontransparency and
                   anti-corruption issues, with the PRSC and the Governance and Institutional
                   Development Project beingthe main instruments.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This ProgramDocumentproposesa fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for
Madagascarinthe amount US$40 million. This operation is the first o fa new series o fthree PRSCs o f
US$40 million each to be disbursed as single tranche operations. It is consistent with the Bank's new
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed at the Board o f Executive Directors on April 3,2007, to
support the implementation o fthe Government's poverty reductionstrategy as laid out inthe Madagascar
Action Plan (MAP). The objective o fthe MAP is to promote rapid and sustainable development over the
nextfive years in line with the Government's nationalvision document (MadagascarNaturally) and the
UNMillenniumDevelopmentGoals (MDGs). To attainthis objective, the MAPpresents eight key
commitments: (i)   responsible governance; (ii)connected infrastructure; (iii)
                                                                             educational transformation;
(iv) rural development and a green revolution; (v) health, family planning and the fight against
HIV/AIDS; (vi) high growth economy; (vii) cherish the environment; and (viii) national solidarity.

2.      The PRSC programfor this series focuses explicitly on improvinggovernance, budget
managementand servicedelivery, and includesspecific policyactionsinthese areas. Inparallel,
Bank support directly enhancing Madagascar's growth potentialis concentrated inits significant portfolio
o f ongoing IDA investment projects in infrastructure, environment, mining, rural development, the
Integrated Growth Poles project, the Irrigation and Watershed Management project, and the Regional
Telecommunications Project. Overall, the new CAS devotes a considerable amount o f IDA resources
available for Madagascar to operations designed to continue investment and policy dialogue inthe growth
agenda.

3.        The implementation of the indicative triggers for PRSC4 is satisfactory. The program
document reviews the progress made inthe implementation o fthe first PRSC series and outlines the
lessons learnedthat were incorporated inthe design o fthe new series. It devotes particular emphasis to
the areas o f focus o fPRSC support (governance, budget management and service delivery). The reform
program supported under PRSC 4 continues to assist the consolidation o freforms first commenced with
PRSC 1 inimproving public expenditure management fostering decentralization, fighting corruption, and
implementingthe Educationfor All and nutritionprograms. Support to reformsto expand accessto safe
drinkingwater andto accompany improvements inthe health sector is also envisioned.

4.        Budgetsupport inMadagascar continuesto advance inclose collaborationwith the other
partners. Donors are collaborating to support Madagascar in implementingthe MAPby providing
financial and technical support in a coordinated way. A partnership agreement (Cadrede Partenariat)
was signed between the Government and the key budget support donors -European Union (EU), France
(AgenceFranpise de De`veloppementand the FrenchCo-operation), the African Development Bank and
the World Bankto provide a framework andto lay out procedures and modalities for a multi-donor
approachto budgetary support. This Budget Group initiatedjoint-donor missions inOctober 2004 to
review the implementation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)iMAP and supervise their
respective budget support operations.

5.       Followingthe presidentialelections of December2006 the politicalsituation remains
stable. Fair andtransparent elections were held inDecember withthe incumbentPresident beingre-
elected with 55 percent o fthe vote. A national referendumwas held inApril 2007 to amend the
Constitutionand change the administrative structure (amongst other changes, the provinces were
eliminated in favor o f regions). This amendment was presented as necessary for MAP implementation
and, despite a low participationrate, more than 75 percent approved the proposed changes. By September
2007, National Assembly elections will be held, followed by local Government elections. Onthe whole,
these major political developments have beenpositive and have not underminedthe functioning o f the
public sector. More recently, however, there have been public demonstrations in a few o f the main cities
to protest the continuing crisis inthe energy sector which has caused frequent black-outs incertain areas
o fthe country.


                                    11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

               1.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSINMADAGASCAR

6.        After the 2002 crisis GDP growth rebounded to 9.8 percentin 2003 from a 12.7 percent
plunge a year before and continued to grow at an average rate of about 5 percentperyear. Growth
came largely through higher tourism receipts (tourism arrivals in2005 were 21 percent higher than in
2004), improved performance inagriculture, especially higher rice production (rice productivity increased
from 2.3 tons per hectare in2003 to 2.6 in2005), and continued public investments. In2005 the economy
grew at 4.6 percent despite a sharp increase inworld petroleumprices, and a financial crisis at the state-
owned electricity and water utility enterprise JIRAMA that disrupted economic activity through power
cuts and tariff increases.

7.        Economicgrowth in2006 estimated at 4.9 percent,was driven by strong tertiary sector
growthbut agricultural growthwas disappointing. Agricultural growth in2006 was lower than in
2005, with production impacted negatively by shortfalls inrain and low world prices for key export
commodities such as vanilla. The tertiary sector grew strongly by 7 percent, with public works, tourism
transport, banking and the telecommunications sectors as the key growth sectors. The telecommunications
sector has seen significant acceleration in2005-6 through strong growth o f basic services subscribers and
network expansion. Increased investments by the telecoms operators are linked to investments inthe basic
national backbone, enhanced certainty for mobile operators with the renewalo ftheir licenses, and
increased competition. The sector is expectedto continue to grow with the expansion o fthe national
backbone and the installationo fthe East African submarine cable. The tourism sector saw an increase o f
 14 percent intourism arrivals. The secondary sector grew at under 4 percent, with strong growth inthe

8.        Madagascar'svulnerabilityto natural disasterswas nevermore evident than in 2007, when
itwas hit by six tropicalstorms/cyclones in the first four monthsof the year leadingto exceptional
rainsin most parts ofthe country,while a droughtcontinued to affect the south of the country.
These storms contributed to heavy flooding inpopulated and cultivated areas throughout the country,
including the capital region, the northwest, west and southeast regions. Over 300,000 people were
affected, the food security situation deteriorated, health risks to the population increased, and public
infrastructure was damaged. Early estimates o fthe damage to the standing vanilla crop inthe Sava region
due to the cyclone Jaya have ledto downwardrevisions from 1,600 tons ofvanilla exports to 1,000 tons
this year, andthere is a likely impact onthe rice harvest inthe region as well.

9.        Despite the adverse natural climatic conditions,the growth projectionfor 2007 has been
revised upward from 5.6 percentto 6.5 percent due to the recentlyconfirmednickelmining
investment of around US$2.5 billion(or around45 percentof GDP) over the nextthree years by
Dynatech. This major investment has changed the medium-term macroeconomic framework (see next
section). A key policy concern is the impact o fthe significant foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows on
                                                      2

the exchange rate, and the policy responses to preserve competitiveness while maintainingmacro-
economic stability. The Government believes that the economy i s undergoinga permanent structural
change, and intends to maintain their exchange rate regime o f a managed float with no predetermined
path and allow the exchange rate to move to its new equilibrium. Intheir view, the exchange rate should
stabilize, and the ongoing structural measures would help preserve competitiveness. The Government
plans to monitor the situation closely and adjust their policy response ifthe economic circumstances
warrant it.

10.       Followinga year of relativestabilityofthe exchangeratein2005, the ariary started
appreciatingsince the last quarterof2006 and this has continuedintothe early part of2007 with an
appreciation o f around 10 percent against the U S dollar since the middle o fJanuary 2007. This is linked
to improved export performance (especially from the export processing zones and tourism) and greater
investments linkedto the mininginvestments noted above. FDIas a share o f GDP increased from 1.7
percent in2005 to 4.0 percent in2006. Stronger exports, the greater FDIinflows, combined with decline
inthe worldpetroleum prices contributedto an improvement inthe balance o fpayments, withthe overall
current account balance (including grants) improving from -10.9 percent o f GDP in2005 to -8.8 percent
o f GDP in2006. Foreignreserves increased to 3.0 months o f imports at year end in2006. The guidelines
adopted by the Central Bank (BCM) for interventioninthe foreign exchange market, aimed at achieving
its foreign assets objectives and dampening sharp swings that would create uncertainty, were broadly
followed. The BCMhas also received further technical assistance inexchange rate management from the
International Monetary Fund(IMF) in 2006. The continuous inter-bank foreign exchange market with an
electronic trading system is functioning well, but, as noted above, the bigmininginvestments will
continue to put pressure on the exchange rate and the Government will needto pay particular attention to
managing the macroeconomic effects to avoid Dutch disease.

11.       Inflation continuedto decline, reaching 10.9 percent at the end of 2006 comparedto 11.4
percentat year end in 2005. Rice prices have stabilized at around 900-1000 Ariarykilo for localrice
between March and December 2006. World petroleum prices started to decrease duringthe last quarter o f
2006 leading to a decline inthe domestic price o f gasoline, and the recent appreciation o fthe nominal
exchange rate also helped. The Government decreased the base rate from 16 percent to 12 percent in
August 2006 and broad money increased by 25.6 percent year-on-year inDecember 2006. Year-on-year
inflation at end-February 2007 was at 13.6 percent, due to a 13 percent increase inrice prices linkedto a

temporary shortfall o f rice on the market, but rice prices have declined subsequently and inflation is
expected to be around 7.9 percent for the year 2007 (at year end).


                              Box 1:ProgressinKey Socio-EconomicIndicators.


  Since 2002, Madagascar's basic social indicators have improved dramatically albeit from a low base. Net
  primary enrollment rates are now above 90 percent, up from 70 percent in2002. The country increasedits
  literacy rateto 70 percentin2005, above the 61 percent average for Sub-SaharanAfrica, but only 60 percentof
  children complete primary school, 15 percentcomplete lower secondary school, and only 5 percentcomplete
  upper secondary school. As more children complete primary education, the country will needto respondto the
  growing demand for secondary education, which is alreadypressuringexisting capacity. Moreover, major
  inequalitiesexist by region and incomegroups, and the quality of instruction is poor at all levels.

  Child mortality rates have declined significantly, from 164deaths per 1,000 live births in 1997to 123 in2004,
  and morewomen give birth inhealthcenters than before.Immunization rates improved from 62 percent in2002
  to 87 percentin2005, and chronic malnutrition rates decreasedfrom 43 percentin 1997to 35 percent in2005.
  Rural access to safe drinking water also improved from 12percent in2003 to 16percent in2005. Madagascar's
  health indicatorsare betterthan other African countriesof a similar incomelevel, but they remain low,
  particularly amongthe rural population and the urbanpoor. For example, the 2004 maternalmortalityratio was
  below the Sub-SaharanAfrica average of 830 deaths per 100,000 live births, but it is still very high at 469 (per
   100,000 live births).

  Poverty inMadagascar is widespread.According to the 2005 householdsurvey, more thantwo-thirds ofthe
  population (68.7 percent) live below the poverty line. The poverty rate inrural areas is significantly higher than
  inurbanareas:while almostthree-quarters(73.5 percent)ofthe ruralpopulation is poor,just over half(52
  percent) ofthe urbanpopulation is poor. Poverty rates also differ by region, with the highestrates inthe coastal
  regions ofthe east and south, where over 80 percentofthe population is poor. Poverty is lowest aroundthe
  capital Antananarivo. Between2001 and 2005 poverty declined more rapidly inrural areas than inurban areas,
  inmarkedcontrastto the 1997-2001 period, whenthe small declineinpoverty was largelythe resultof
  declining urbanpoverty. Growth in 1997-2001 was driven largely by the export processingzone sector, based in
  Antananarivo/Antsirabe,which improvedjob opportunities and reducedpoverty inurban areas. The decline in
  poverty inrural areas between2001 and 2005 is linked to greater emphasis on rural development, accelerated
  implementationofthe roads program, andhigher rice priceswhich gave incentivesto ruralfarmers. Also, the
  economic shocks in2004/05 (strongdepreciation, high international oil and rice prices) may have affectedthe
  richer segments ofsocietymore adversely.




 12.       The electricityparastatal's (JIRAMA) structuraland financialdifficultiescontinue to
impactthe investmentclimate. A recovery planis being implemented,butthe transitionto a longer-
term concession arrangement hasbeendelayed. JIRAMA presented its financial recovery plan in
January 2006 and received donor support for its implementation. As part o fthe plan, JIRAMA had
implemented significant tariff increases for electricity to bringtariffs more inline with productioncosts,
but it is still operating at a loss. Measuresto improve the efficiency o fJIRAMA and to reduce the
dependence on diesel generated electricity are also under implementation but progress has been slow.
The Government is committedto a longer-term public-privatepartnership solution inthe form o f a
concession for JIRAMA, for which IFC is providing technical assistance, but a one-year track record o f
no operating losses is considered to be a pre-requisite for this longer term private management
concession. This has delayed the launch o fthe call for bidsto 2009. Delays in implementing the recovery
plan for JIRAMA will continue to pose a riskto growth and to the Government budget.

13.        Tax revenuein2006was 10.7 percentof GDP butweaknesses inadministrationcontinueto
hamperthe Government's ability to implementits budget smoothly.In2006 the tax revenueto GDP
ratio was 10.7 percent, a partial recovery from the decline to 10.1 percent in2005 but down from the level
o f 10.9 percent in2004. Exonerations, exemptions and special regimes have continued to plague the tax
and customs systems. The persistent problems inrevenue mobilizationhave hindered the Government's
                                                          4

abilityto implement its ambitious poverty reductionstrategy, with mid-yearexpenditure cuts
implementedin2006to maintainoverallfiscal discipline. The Government is also implementinga
customsreformprogramand, withthe support ofthe IMFandthe WorldBank, is designing a
comprehensivereformoftax administration which is expectedto befinalizedintime to bereflected inthe
2008 FinanceLaw.

14.       Overall,the macroeconomicsituation remainsstable. Lookingforward, managingthe
macro-economicimpactsofthe largeinvestment flows,sustainableprogressin restructuring
JIRAMA and revenue mobilizationremainkey priorities. The Government is committedto tackling
these problems, andis implementinga programunderthe Poverty ReductionandGrowthFacilitywith
the IMF sinceJuly 2006. The FirstReview ofthe programwas successfully concludedinDecember
2006, andthe SecondReview is expectedto be completed later this year.


            2. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.       The post-2002recovery has shownthat the economyhasdiversifiedits sources of growth
and is more resilientto shocks, havinggrown at around 5 percentperyear. Madagascaris investing
inupgradingits infrastructurenetwork, particularlyroads. It is encouraginggreater public-private
partnershipsin infrastructureprovision(energy, airports, ports, railwaysetc) and is investingineducating
itsyoung, thereby solidifyingfurther the foundations for growth. The new nickelmininginvestment
project with itslarge upfrontinvestments andsubsequentexport ofrefinedproducts,provideamajor
motor o fgrowth.

16.       The recently updated base case macroeconomicprojectionsforecastan average growth
rateof about 8.0 percentover 2007-11 with mining, tourism, construction, and mostimportantfor
the poor improved prospectsinagriculture(Table 1). These growthprojections are inlinewiththe
          -                                                                          -

MAPgoals of attaining 7-10 percentgrowthinthe mediumterm. Tourism is expectedto continueto
grow, giventhe ongoinginvestmentsunderthe IntegratedGrowthPoles Project, privateinvestmentin
hotels, andthe increasingnumber o ftourists. Improvingthe backwardlinkages inthe tourism sector, such
as sourcingproductsfromthe local economyby hotels, is a key aspect inthe strategy for the sector. In
mining, the ilmeniteproject financed by Rio Tinto inthe FortDauphinregionis under way andthe
US$2.5 billionAmbatovy nickelminingproject by Dynatechwill be implementedstarting inJuly 2007.
Agriculture will continuebenefitingfrom a rangeof investmentsby Government anddonors including
improvingthe irrigationsystems andthe surroundingwatersheds infour mostpromisingsites andfrom
additionalsupport for agri-business development in five regions inthe country with support fromthe
MillenniumChallenge Corporation.At the same time, the export processingzone sector is goingthrough
a consolidationphaseandis not expectedto grow inthe short term. However, a hopefulsign that the
sector can remaina source of growthis that textile exportshavebeenstronger than expectedbecausethe
industry is diversifyingandmovingtowardhighervalue-addedproducts. Butthe future ofthe export
processingzones, inparticular, is linkedto its abilityto stay competitive, giventhe risksposedby the
current trend of appreciationofthe exchangerate.

17.       Investment neededto generate this growthwill average 28.6 percentof GDP, driven
mainly by an increase in privateinvestment,which is expectedto be over 19percentof GDP during
2007-2011 (see Table 2). Investment levels in2007-2009 average over 30 percent due to the nickel
mininginvestment, but subsequent levels o finvestment slow down to around 24 percent. Exports are
projectedto increase by 19 percent a year over the same period, but increase at rates o f over 25 percent
once the nickel exports commence in2010. The overall investmentclimate is expected to be facilitated
by the new investment code and the newly established Economic DevelopmentBoard o f Madagascar.
Emphasis on governance through more transparent issuance o f licenses, the creation o f a fair playing
field-free   o f political interference-and     accessto land should facilitate further investments inmining,
tourism, manufacturing, and ago-industry. Continued investments in rural transport and irrigation
infrastructure by Government and donors should increase rural incomes. Tax reform is also planned for
the next year, including simplifyingthe tax system and administration and raising revenues while

facilitating investment. Overall, these reforms are expectedto lay the foundations to improve the
investment climate, attract investment more generally, and contribute to diversifying exports, and
achieving broad based growththat translates into poverty reduction.

18.       The extent to which growthtranslatesintopovertyreduction, will dependcriticallyon the
success ofthe Government's efforts to implementits overallMAP strategyand inparticularrural
development. Giventhat over 7 in 10Malagasy live inrural areas and 74 percentofthe rural population
is poor, improving agricultural productivity remains vital. Inaddition, the extentto which the expected
high growth inmining will translate into poverty reduction will depend inter alia on the degree of
backward linkages to the local economy associatedwith mining activities and on the ability ofthe
Government to use the additional revenues generatedby the sector to effectively deliver services and
additional investmentsthat improve the living conditions ofthe population. Another key challenge will
be the Government's ability to mobilize resources (both revenues and development assistance).

Debt Sustainability

19.      Madagascar's outstandingexternaldebt has beenreducedsignificantly-from               about
US$4.8 billionat end-2003, to about US$3.5 billionat end-2005 and furtherto about US$1.6billion
at end-2006. Two major initiatives contributed to this result: the EnhancedHeavily IndebtedPoor
Country (HIPC) Debt Initiative concluded in October 2004 and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI), supported bythe International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, and IDA.

20.     Madagascar is ratedas a medium performerwith regardto its policiesand institutions
according to the Bank's Country and Policy InstitutionalAssessment (CPIA) Index. As a medium
performer, the thresholds applied to Madagascar are: (i)150 percent for Net Present Value (NPV) o f debt-
to-exports, (ii)40 percent for the NPV o f debt-to-GDP and (iii) percent for the NPV o f debt to fiscal
                                                                 250
revenues. The relevant debt service thresholds are (i)  20 percent o f exports and (ii) percent o f
                                                                                      30
revenues. The sustainability o f Madagascar's debt is analyzed inrelationto these thresholds.

21.     The joint Bank-Funddebt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the improvedprospects
for growthand exports,linkedto the new miningprojects,have further improvedthe sustainability
of Madagascar's debt outlook. The DSA shows that the key debt indicators fell sharply in2006, with
the MDRIdebt relief(see Table 4). Under the baseline scenario, Madagascar's external debt indicators
remain well below the thresholds throughout the projection period. The baseline scenario is built on the
key medium-term macroeconomic assumptions outlined inthe previous section, the implementationo f
sound macroeconomic and structural policies and external financing through grants and concessional
loans. Under the updated macro-economic scenario o f higher growth, led by miningsector exports, the
                                                        8

debt sustainability improves significantly. The NPV o f debt to GDP ratio and the NPV o f debt-to-exports
stay well below the threshold over the projectionperiod.

22.      The sensitivityanalysisshows that the externaldebt remains belowthe thresholds under
alternativescenarios and even under the most extremestress tests. Thus, Madagascar's riskof
debt distress is low. Evenunder extreme stress tests, the external debt indicators remainbelow the
threshold with the high levels o f growth and the miningexports generated after 2010 (see Annex 6). The
current efforts to diversify the export base will help this even further. The financing scenario shows that
Madagascar's external debt indicators are sensitive to the terms o fthe borrowing. The N P V o f debt-to-
GDPandNPV o f debt-to-exports ratios increase steadily but remain below the threshold. This could lead
to risks from new borrowing at less favorable terms than assumed inthe baseline scenario. Overall,
foreign assistance is expected to remain important inmacroeconomic management and poverty reduction
inMadagascar. This includes assistance underthe enhancedHIPC DebtInitiative andthe Multilateral
DebtReliefInitiative.

23.       DebtDataManagement. The authorities have undertaken steps to improve debt data
management. All the loans for which the Central Bank and the Ministry o f Finance were responsible
have beenentered into the new United Nation's standard database system, and an integrated data
management systemwill be established between the Central Bank and the Ministry o f Finance. In
addition, the authorities have contacted relevant international agencies to build capacity on debt analysis.


     111.       THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

24.       The MadagascarAction Plan(MAP), the Government'ssecond-generationPRSPthat lays
out an ambitious development planfor 2007-2012, was launchedinNovember2006. Itoutlines the
commitments, strategies and actions that are expected to ignite rapid growth and lead to the reduction o f
poverty inline with the Government's national vision document (MadagascarNaturally) and the MDGs.
The M A P builds on the first PRSP prepared in2003 and was elaborated ina participatory manner that
included broad consultations in all 22 regions o f Madagascar involving local and national Government
representatives, private sector, NGOs, church groups, development partners and civil society. Key
monitoring indicators, most with baselines for 2005 and targets for 2012, have been selected to measure
progress toward achieving the MAP'Sidentifiedchallenges. Inthis respect, the MAP is more results-
oriented and prioritizedthan the PRSP.

privatesector driven by local andinternationalinvestmentandtrade. This challengenaturallycovers many activities focusedon
the following: (i) astable macroeconomicenvironment; (ii) increase foreign directinvestment; (iii)
                    ensure                                                                                      promote full

Cherish the Environment-this commitmentlaysout the goal for Madagascar to becomeaworld leaderinthe development and
implementationo f environmentalbestpractice, to becomeagreen islandandto cherishandprotectits extraordinary
environment. Local communities will be active participantsand industriessuch as eco-tourism andorganic agri-businesswill
developto minimizebiodiversitydamage and maximizebenefitsto the countryand people. The activities focus on: (i) increasing
the protectedareas for the conservationof land, lake, marineandcoastalbiodiversity;(ii)        reducingthe naturalresource
degradationprocess; (iii) developing the environmental reflex at all levels; and(iv) strengtheningthe effectivenessof forest
management.

National Solidarity-the goal isto continue to forge astrongandunifiednationalidentitythat promotesparticipationand
partnership,allowspeopleto beproudandto take full andsharedresponsibilityfor guidingthenationinto the future. The
specific challengesare to: (i)celebrateculturaldiversity, understandingandrespect; (ii)      build socialtrust andpromote civic
participation;(iii)  promote solidarity andpride; (iv) improvesupport for the very poor andvulnerablepopulations; and(v)
promotegender equality andempowermentofwomen.




                                                                  10

25.       The MAP outlineseight strategic commitments:(i)          responsible governance; (ii) connected
infrastructure; (iii)educational transformation; (iv) rural development and a green revolution; (v) health,
family planning and the fight against HIV/AIDS; (vi) high growth economy; (vii) cherish the
environment; and (viii) nationalsolidarity (see Box 2). For each commitment, the Government has
 identifiedkey challenges, goals and strategies, priority projects and activities. The M A P also identifies
six "breakthrough initiatives" or priority areasthat require immediate attention: public finance reform;
 significant increase in investment to promote highgrowth; sowing the seeds o f a green revolution;
transformingpublic security; implementingbold new measures for health and family planning; and
transformingthejudiciary. Annex 2 presents the detailed MAP matrix for the areas directly supported by
this operation: responsible governance, educational transformation, and health, family planningandthe
 fight against HIV/AIDS.

26.       The preparationofthe MAP during2006was spearheaded by a steeringcommittee,which
 includedrepresentativesfrom the Presidency,the Prime Minister'soffice, and the Ministryof
Economy,Financeand Budget. The MAP was discussed inParliament alongwith the draft 2007
Finance Law which aligns the budget with the MAP commitments andpresents medium-term expenditure
projections for 2007-11. This link between the M A P andthe national budget is relatively strong although
the MediumTerm Expenditure Framework that underpinsthe MAP needs to be further substantiated.
 Consequently, the MAP places appropriate emphasis onthe needto improve public financial
management. As the JSAN (Joint Staff Advisory Note o f the MAP, discussed at Board on March 6,2007
 - ReportNo.   38469-MG) noted, the priorities inthis respect should include: (i)  strengthening o f internal
 control mechanisms, in particular with regard to expenditure commitments; (ii)    usingthe public finance
 integrated management informationsystem (SIGFP) to monitor budget execution; (iii)       simplifyingthe
budget classification and the expenditure management framework; (iv) further strengthening capacity to
prepare and execute the budget inpriority ministries (education, health, infrastructure); (v) improve cash
planningand management; and (vi) implementingthe new Procurement Code.

27.       The institutionalstructure for managingthe overallimplementationofthe MAP is
currentlybeing strengthened. This involves developing actionplans for key sectors that linkthe
activities to the MAP goals, strengthening capacity to implement these plans and identifying intermediate
 indicators to monitor progress toward these goals. The costing o fthe various components o fthe MAP is
also underway, but the quality varies by sector. Insome, such as education (inparticular, primary
education), environment, roads, governance and rural water, detailed costing exists. For other key
programs, such as health, this costing is beingfinalized as part o fthe preparation o fthe health sector plan.
Incertainother sectors, suchasruraldevelopment, thecostingneedsfurtherwork whichwillbedone in
the context o frefiningthe sector strategies and programs. Two key new institutions have also beenput in
place to support MAP implementation -the Economic DevelopmentBoard o fMadagascar to facilitate
and promote domestic and foreign investment and the National Leadership Institute o f Madagascarto
buildcapacity in Government and other sectors o fsociety. Finally, a new monitoring and evaluation
institutionalsystem i s being developed to ensure a timely assessment o f progress in implementation.

28.       The MAP'Swide scope and ambitious goals will necessitatefar greaterresourcesthan the
country has available. To deal with this, the M A P places greater emphasis on donor coordination and
proposes an annual Donors' Conference and sector meetings to strengthen donor co-ordination and to
better align assistance to the MAP goals. The critical elements o fmeetingthe resource challenge will
include: (i) sustaining progress on domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management
reforms; (ii) improving the investment climate, principally with regard to the legal, regulatory, and
judicial system; and (iii) improving transparency and governance.

                                          1. LINKTO THE CAS

29.       The Bank's support to the implementationofthe MAPis detailedinthe FY07-11CASthat
was discussed by the BoardonApril 3,2007 (Report No. 38135MG). The new CAS buildson a solid
base o f a well-performing IDA portfolio and an extensive body o f knowledge developed by the World
Bank Group. The CAS is designedto help achieve the MAP objectives and is organized around two
pillars:the first pillar concentrates on activities that will helpremovebottlenecks to investment and
growth inrural andurban areas; the second pillar brings together activities gearedtoward improving
access to, and quality o f services. Inaddition, a critical crosscutting element is improving governance and
reducing corruption. The CAS consolidates the ongoing efforts in support o f the Government's far-
reaching programto improve governance. It seeks to extend progress in improving the legal and
regulatory framework and focuses on critical implementation aspects o fthe governance agenda in: (i)
resource mobilization; (ii) expenditure management; (iii)
                             public                                   management o f natural and mineral
resources; and (iv) decentralization. Table 1 inAnnex 4 provides an overview ofthe mix o f operations
and AAA envisaged in support of each o fthe eight MAP commitments.

30.       In linewith the Government's requestand consistentwith the ParisDeclarationon
harmonization,Bankassistanceto Madagascar is aligned with that of other donorsto provide a
package o f coordinated support around the Government's MAP. The CAS preparation was closely
coordinated with other partners to facilitate maximum harmonization, such as the European Union,
1'Agence Frangaise de Dbveloppement, the African DevelopmentBank, and the Millennium Challenge
Corporation.

31.        The new PRSCseries is fully consistentwith the CAS. The lendingprogram envisaged inthe
CAS encompasses the new PRSC series to provide US$40 million a year inbudget support for the next
three years, inline with the distribution o f available financing between budget support and investment
operations and consistent with the experience inthe implementationo fthe first PRSC series, described in
detail below, and the fragile macroeconomic environment. The new PRSC series will focus on selected
critical issues inline with the second pillar o fthe CAS, improving access and quality o f services, and the
cross cutting theme o f improving governance. The CAS proposes that budget support be scaled up
gradually to encompass other sectors intandem with improvements inthe public finance system. The
PRSC series i s also well aligned with the Bank's good practice principles on conditionality: (i)
ownership; (ii)  harmonization; (iii) customization to country circumstances; (iv) criticality o f actions; and
(v) transparency and predictability(see Box 3).


               2. COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

Coordinationwith the IMF

32.        The Bankcloselycollaboratesand coordinatesactivitieswith the IMF. The staffs o fthe two
institutions conduct regularjoint assessments o fthe PRSP (now MAP) implementation and also work
closely together on: (i)  analysis and reforms inpublic financial management; (ii) governance
                                                                                        other
reforms, including customs and tax reform; (iii)     trade and (iv) financial sector reform. Joint policy advice
is given on budgetary procedures, including expenditure execution, and the functioning o f internal and
external budget controls. Inaddition, IDA and the IMFwill continue to help the Government better align
the allocationo f resources with M A P priorities, improve budget execution, implement new procurement
legislation, and measure the impact o f public resource use. Periodic PEFA assessments will monitor
progress. The Bank and the Fundare supporting implementation o fthe recommendations o f the 2005
FSAP. The dialogue focuses on supporting the financial sector strategy framework and helping scale up
and expand support to the financial sector by preparing a sector-wide approach with other donors.

                               Box 3: Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The proposedoperationis an integralpart ofthe new Bank CASto supportthe MAP. The MAP is an
unprecedentedeffortfrom Governmentto show commitment andownershipto a clear set ofreformswhich was
developedina highlyconsultative fashionand presentedto parliamentalongwiththe 2007budget.Accordingly, the
2007 budgetlaw is alreadystartingto alignthe budgetto the MAP objectives. The policyactionssupportedbythis
PRSCseries are consistentwiththe MAP matrix. This operation, as well as the overallGovernmentprogram, has
beeninformedby an extensivebodyo f analyticalwork. Keyoutputs includethe two PERs(FY05 andFY07), the
procurementaudits (FY07), the PEFAreport(FY06) a corruption survey(FY06) the CFAA (FY03) and CPAR
(FY03) Overallbackgroundis providedby one DPR(FY05) andan on-goingCEMplus a continuedeffort on
povertyanalysiseither bythe Bank or bythe authoritiesthemselves. The variouspieces have either beenproduced
with Government(as inthe case ofthe latestPER) or extensively discussedwith stakeholdersandpartnersto feed in
the policydebate.


Principle2: Agree upfront with the Governmentand otherfinancialpartners on a coordinatedaccountability
framework
The overallMAP matrix has beenendorsedby all donorsinMadagascarandrepresentsthe framework ofreference
for all future donor support. Accordingly the PRSC matrix has beendevelopedwith Governmentinline with the
overall MAP matrix and it will berevisedonce Governmentcompletesthe elaborationof its moredetailedresults
framework for MAP implementationwhich donors have inprinciple agreedto follow. Budgetsupportis highly
coordinatedamongdonors with a partnershipagreement (Cadre de Partenariat) signed betweenthe Government
andthe keybudgetsupport donors: -EuropeanUnion(EU), France(Agence Franpise de Dkveloppement, andthe
FrenchCo-operation),the AfricanDevelopmentBank andthe WorldBank-to providea framework andto lay out
proceduresandmodalitiesfor a multi-donor approachto budgetarysupport.


Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
Consistentwiththe new CAS, the matrix for the proposedoperationfocuses on a subset ofthe MAP strategieson
public finance reform, decentralization,the fight againstcorruptionand enhanceddelivery ofbasic services
(education, health, nutritionandaccess to water and sanitation). Learningfrom prior experience, the choiceof
actions is consistentwith a morefocused prioritizationo f activities anda moregradualpaceofreform. Consistent
with county circumstances,the CAS presentsa new balancebetweenbudgetsupport and investmentoperations.
Budgetsupportwill be graduallyincreasedonce Governmentsystemsare adequatelystrengthened. All the reform
areasare an integralpartofthe Governmentprogramand are inlinewiththe overallperceptionofprioritiesfor the
success ofthe MAP.


Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
Consistentwiththe practicealreadydevelopedinthe first PRSCseries, prior actionsand conditionshavebeenfirst
proposedby Governmentandthen finalized througha processof extensiveconsultationswiththe Ministryo f
Financeandrelevant sector ministries.For this operationandthe whole secondPRSC series the chosenactions are
consistentwiththe MAP matrixandhavebeenchosenpreciselyfor their criticalityto the success o fthe MAP
objectives. The policymatrix for PRSC4 consistsof 10prior actions andno benchmarks; 19benchmarksand 10
indicativetriggers havebeendevelopedfor PRSC5 and 18benchmarks and 10indicativetriggers are envisionedfor
PRSC6.


Principle5: Conducttransparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable andperformance-basedfinancial
support
The supervisionofthe PRSCis conductedwithinthe context ofjoint donor budget support reviews agreedwith
Governmenttwice a year. Donorshave already agreedto tailorjoint reviewsconsistentwith the MAPresults
framework oncethis will be completedby Government.Bankbudgetsupport is not yet fully alignedwith the budget
cycle. Starting from the nextoperation(PRSC 5) additionalefforts will be madeto meetthe request o fthe
Governmentand deliver budgetsupport inthe secondquarter o fthe calendar year (April-June 2008). The amounts
for the whole PRSCseries (US$40million for eachoperation) havebeenclearly specifiedinthe CAS and
communicatedto Governmentand are reconfirmedpriorto the elaborationo feach annualbudgetlaw.

33.        The IMFpresentedits new PovertyReduction and GrowthFacility(PRGF) arrangement
with Madagascarto its BoardinJuly 2006. With the support o fthe PRGF,the Government is
implementingmeasures to continue to adequately manage a fragile macroeconomic environment. The
staffs o f IDA and IMF will continue to coordinate the content o fthe PRSC and PRGFto ensure that the
instrumentscomplement one another. Ingeneral, the structural andsocial benchmarks will be covered by
the PRSC, while the PRGF will cover macroeconomic issues.

Collaborationwith other Multilateraland BilateralDonors

34.        The donors are collaboratingto support Madagascar inimplementingthe MAP, by
providingfinancialand technicalsupport ina coordinatedway. A partnership agreement (Cadre de
Partenariat) was signedbetween the Government and the key budget support donors -European Union
(EU), France (Agence Franqaise de De`veloppement,andthe FrenchCo-operation), the African
Development Bank andthe World Bank        - toprovide a framework and to lay out procedures and
modalities for a multi-donor approach to budgetary support. This Budget Support Group initiatedjoint-
donor missions inOctober 2004 to review the implementationo fthe PRSP and supervise their respective
budget support operations. This is part o fthe overall effort to harmonize assistance and reduce transaction
costs for the Government. Since then,joint donor missions have beenheld twice a year      - inApril and
September/October o f each year.

35.        Inthe joint supervision missions,commonareas of support with the EU's programof
budget support (Programme d'Appui Budgitaire h la Reduction de la Pauvrett!, PAW) includethe
public sector reformagenda, educationand health. The support to the public expenditure reform
agenda is coordinated inline with the Government's Priority Action Plan. The Government has convened
meetings periodically with the main donors to inform them o f progress on implementation. Key reforms
inpublic financial management and fighting corruption are beingsupported by financing from IDA
together with technical assistance from the EC, German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) and the
FrenchCooperation. Donor coordination around implementing customs reforms has also improved.

36.        The Ministry ofEducation(MENRS)has continuedto leadthe dialoguewith donors inthe
educationsector. The Fast Track Initiative (FTI)process with the EducationFor All (EFA) National plan
has strengthenedthe Ministry further inthis role and has given a focus to the Donor Group which
includes UNICEF,French Co-operation, AfDB, AFD, Japan, USAID and the World Bank (see Annex 5).
Regular donor meetings are organized and through this, a deeper sharing o f information on appraisal
missions, technical assistance and studies. Whilst there are diverse support mechanisms, donors take a
holistic approach and are concerned about the progress o fthe EFA Plan overall as well as individual
projects.

37.        The MinistryofHealthis initiatinga sectorwide approach. The recently completed sector
development strategy is the first buildingblock o f a Sector Wide Approach Project (SWAP) inthe health
sector and constitutes the organizing principle for donor coordination and harmonization(see Annex 5).
Inaddition, supportforHIV/AIDS isalreadystructuredaroundasector wide approachwithalldonors'
programs aligned with the Government strategy.

38.        In other sectors, the levelof cooperationvaries dependingonthe sector and the donors
involved. There is strong coordination o f donor support inthe transport, water and environmental sectors
with the programo freforms and investment addressedjointly by donors. There is still a way to go to
improve coordination inagricultural and rural development but the MAP is helpingto organize donor
interventions ina more effective way.

39.        Capacityconstraintshamper Madagascar's abilityto achieve its development objectives.
The donor community is supportingMadagascar instrengtheningcapacity,through a range o f
technical assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance the implementationo fthe MAP
(the key donors involved include the World Bank, European Union, UNDP, French Co-operation, the

                                                      14

African Development Bank, GTZ, and USAID). Donor coordination to support capacity buildingefforts,
is also beingenhanced through the round table for public expenditure management reforms, and through
the Budget Support Group.



                     3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

40.       As articulatedinthe CAS, developmentpolicylendingwill be complemented by investment
lending,AAA and technicalassistance. To support the implementationo fthe MAP, the CAS proposes
a new balance o f investment operations and budget support along with technical assistance to strengthen
Government systems and capacity. Overall, the CAS devotes a considerable amount o f IDA resources
available for Madagascar to operations designed to continue investment and policy dialogue inthe growth
agenda. The PRSC series remains focused on key reforms inpublic finance management, governance
and increased service delivery thus complementing a large portfolio ininfrastructure, private sector
development, rural development and environment. Consistent with county circumstances, budget support
will be gradually increased once Government systems are adequately strengthened. Annex 4 reviews in
greater detail the on-going operations and those planned over the CAS cycle that support Madagascar's
efforts to foster higher investment and remove bottlenecks to growth. Key projects include: the Integrated
Growth Poles Project; the Transport Infrastructure Project; the Rural Transport Project; the Rural
Development Support Project; the Irrigation and Watershed Project, the Regional Telecommunications
Project and the EnvironmentProject. Ofparticular relevance, also inlight o fthe recent economic
developments, are the Power and Water Sector restructuring Project, which devotes specific attention to
support Government in addressingthe JIRAMA persistent crisis, and the MineralResource Governance
Project, dedicatedto strengthening the institutionalframework o fthe miningand extractive industries
sector. The specific objectives o fthe planned portfolio can be summarized as follows: (i)   eliminate
barriers to access domestic and international markets; (ii) improve access to finance and factor markets;
(iii) regulatoryburdenandfostercompetitionand(iv)achievesustainabledevelopmentand
     reduce
minimize the impact o f shocks.

41.       Overall,the PRSCcontinuesto serve as avehicle for policydialoguein key priority reform
areas. Since the inceptiono fbudget support in2003 the PRSC has beeninstrumental to enhancedpolicy
dialogue inpriority areas. This dialogue has beeninstitutionalized throughjoint reviewswith the
Government and other donors and has centered on strengthening public sector capacity and accountability
with a strong emphasis on improving financial management, transparency andexpanding service delivery.
Technical assistance is providedthrough separate projects, most notably the Governance and Institutional
Development Project. The Bank also has a significant program o f support inthe human development
sectors which supports improved service delivery through investment projects inhealth, nutrition,
HIV/AIDS and throughthe engagement inthe EFA.

42.       Investmentlendingoperationsin health, nutritionand the EFA initiativeare also
harmonizedwith the PRSC focus onimproved service delivery. The recently approved Sustainable
Health System Development Project -May 2007-and the additionalfinancing for the Nutrition Project,
approved inNovember 2006, have beendeveloped inclose coordinationwith the design o fthe new PRSC
series. Inaddition, the PRSC is also coordinated with the EFA initiative and the Catalytic Fundfor
education managedby the World Bank. Inall these areas the PRSC reinforces the emphasis that these
operations have on the reform o f Government financial and institutional systems.

43.       The increasedrelevanceofthe miningsector for the growthagendais supportedby the
PRSCinclose coordinationwith the on-going IDA-supportedMineral ResourcesGovernance
Project.The project, which benefited from additional financing o fUS$8m inMay 2007, covers the
following five areas o f focus: (i)
                                  policy, legal and regulatory framework; (ii)  institutionalrestructuring
and strengthening o fthe extractive industries public sector structure, particularly under the Ministry o f
Mines; (iii) support to integration o f large-scale miningprojects to regional development; (iv)
                                                      15

management o f potential conflicts between environmental protection and large-scale/small-scale mining;
and (v) improved Government andmanagement capacity o f small-scale miningactivities. This project is
developed incoordination with the Norwegian Government's Oil for Development program, which
supports the establishment o f a legal and regulatory framework and the institutional strengthening for the
development o fthe country's petroleum resources.

44.       Strongcomplementaritiesexist betweenthe PRSCseries and the Governance and
InstitutionalDevelopmentProject. Since 2003 this project has been successfully assisting Government
in:(i) rationalizingand modernizingbudget and public expenditure management; (ii)        improving
accountability and transparency o f Government operations; and by (iii)   strengtheningthe capacity o f
public institutions to deal with complex change processes. These activities are clearly intertwinedwith
the reform agenda set forward by the past and current PRSC series. Consequently the two operations are
implemented in close coordination, with PGDIsupporting specific activities inthe areas o f focus o fthe
PRSC. Examples o f such activities include: the deployment o f an integrated financial management
system to improve transparency and accountability o fGovernment operations, the strengthening o f
internal and external controls, the design o f a new procedural and institutional framework for public
procurement, comprehensive training and capacity building activities inthe areas o f development
planning, public financial management and procurement; as well as the development o fthe regulatory and
institutionalframework to improve governance and to fight corruption. PGDIhas been recently
restructured and additional financing provided to the project to assist Government to develop a consistent
monitoring & evaluation framework to support the MAP. Regardinggovernance issues and improving
transparency and accountability inthe miningsector, the PRSC series is also aligned with the strategic
focus o fthe new MineralResources Governance Project, presentedto the Board for additionalfinancing
inMay 2007.

45.       Revenuemobilizationis supportedbyvarious IDA projectsand is coordinatedwith the
IMFprogram. Along withthe activities supportedbythis operation for the reformofthe customs
administration, other projects support Government in improving revenue mobilization. Inparticular, the
PGDI is currently assisting inthe strengthening o ftax administrationby supporting the simplification o f
administrative procedures, financing the modernization o ftax offices, and improving the implementation
o f capacity buildingactivities. New AAA activities are beingdeveloped incoordination with the IMF to
elaborate a comprehensive tax policy reform that would be supported by the second-phase PGDIproject
planned for FY09. Finally, the Mineral Resources Governance Project supports the development o f a
new fiscal framework for the miningsector, including large scale investments to include adjustments to
optimize fiscal revenues.


                    4. LESSONSLEARNEDAND THE FIRST PRSC SERIES

46.       This PRSCseries drawsfrom lessonslearnedfrom the first PRSCseries and the overall
evaluation of the Bank's programinthe CAS CompletionReport(for the FY04-06period) and the
Independent EvaluationGroup(IEG) CountryAssistanceEvaluationReport (for the 1995-2005
period --IEG reportNo. 38213). A full ImplementationCompletion Report for the first PRSC series is
scheduled to be completed inFY08. Consistent with the previous PRSP, the program for the first three
PRSCs (2004-2006) focused explicitly on the strategic axes o f governance and human development, and
included specific policy actions inthese areas. The objective o fthe first three PRSCs was to consolidate
reforms underway inthe public sector, fight corruption, improve public financial management,
transparency and accountability, and improve service delivery ineducation, health, water supply and
nutrition.

47.       A preliminaryassessment of the first PRSCseries shows that while overallprogram
implementationis satisfactory there areareaswhere progresshas beenmixed. Annex 3 provides an
overview o f the current status o fthe key expected results as envisioned at the time o fthe first PRSC inthe
areas o f governance, the fight against corruptionand human and maternal security. Overall, the
                                                      16

implementation o fthe first two PRSCs took place duringyears o f unanticipated adverse macroeconomic
shocks: 2004 was markedby a sharp depreciation o fthe exchange rate and two back-to-back cyclones,
which ledto unforeseen expenditures and sharp inflation. 2005 was marked by high international oil
prices, and a structural and financial crisis inthe energy parastatalJIRAMA, which ledto unprogrammed
budgetary outlays. The resultingpressures onthe budget inboth 2004 and 2005 had a clear adverse
impact onthe implementation o fthe two PRSCs as Government was faced with the management o f
difficult events. Onthe resource side, the revenue collection was below expectation and donor aid flows
were delayed. The Government hadto adjust through a curtailment o f expenditures, including a freeze o f
commitments inMarch 2005, a reduction inexpenditures, and a shortened expenditure cycle. Inaddition
to this overall budgetary constraint, limited capacity for budget execution within the sector ministries was
manifest and contributed to the execution delays observed inmost sectors. Budget execution was further
complicated with the transition in2005 to the program budgets without adequate preparation or training
o f ministry staff. More recently, the implementation o f PRSC 3 shows encouraging signs o f improvement
inthe budgetprocess. The 2007 budgetlaw is morerealistic andis anchoredina soundmacroeconomic
framework for the base case scenario. Procedures have been put inplace for the 2007 budget to be
executed starting January 1'' as opposed to March for 2006. Concomitantly, the Ministryo f Finance and
Budget is taking a more active role inseeking proper implementationo fkey reforms. For example,
budget reports are to be produced ina timely fashion and discussed with line ministries,and additional
training has beenorganized for the implementation o f the new procurement code.

48.       Publicfinance reformshaveyielded a numberof importantresults. Basedonthe policy
dialogue under the first series o f PRSCs, the Government has improved overall coordination and
harmonization o f public finance reforms, inparticular through the development o f an annual action plan
agreed upon with all relevant development partners and through the establishment o f a reform
coordination unit. This process has also greatly increaseddialogue and interaction on goals, objectives
and implementation challenges between the Ministryo f Finance and the sector ministries. Monthly
meetingsare presently organizedtojointly review budget execution issues andto discuss technical
assistance needs.

49.       Significant progresshas also been made to improvethe regulatoryand institutional
frameworkthat governs public financialmanagement. Modern public finance regulations have been
put inplace and a strong linkbetweenthe development strategy and the budgethas beenestablished. The
budget preparation process was revamped to allow for more time to discuss the budget and its strategic
priorities. A Medium-Term Expenditure Framework was introduced to provide a forward vision o fthe
budget. Budget execution was streamlined based onthe introductiono f a moderncomputerized
integrated financial management system. The new system has been deployed to all six maintreasuries and
to key sector ministries. It allows for more transparent and accurate execution o fthe budget and more
timely budgetary reporting. Inthe context o fthe introduction o fthe new system, the Treasury
Department has been significantly strengthened based on an organizational restructuring. An internal
control service is now operational inthe Treasury Department (Brigade de TrCsor). Inaddition, the
operational effectiveness o f other internal and external control mechanisms such as the General
Inspection Directorate (Inspection GCnCrale de l'Etat), the Auditor General's Ofice, andthe Finance
Commissions o f Parliament have been strengthened.

50.       To improvethe revenuegenerationat the levelof the customs directorateand to reduce
endemic corruption,a comprehensivecustomsreform action planis now under implementation.
The implementation has made good progress: customs operations inkey customs offices (e.g. Tamatave
and Antananarivo) have beenfundamentally reorganized and modernized based on the deployment o f an
automated data processing system (SYDONIA++). Pre-shipment inspections by a private company have
beenintroduced to improve transparency and reduce discretionary authority. The introduction o fthe
internationally recognized customs management system TRADENET is imminent. The customs
regulations have been modernized and the tariff structure has been simplified. Inaddition, the
Government has embarked on a tax reform program. With assistance from the IMF, the Government is


                                                      17

working on simplifyingand rationalizing the tax system and minimizing tax exemptions. Inparallel, tax
administration reforms have been initiated to improve operational efficiency o fthe tax directorate.



                                    Box 4: PublicFinanceReformsin Madagascar


The strengthand weaknesses ofMadagascar's budgetand expenditure management system havebeen subject to
numerousstudies over the last years. Initial reforms focusedprimarily on streamlining and rationalizing the rules
and regulationsgoverning public expenditure management, on capacitybuilding andtraining and on integrating
various administrative functions to improve efficiency and effectiveness.These reforms havebeensupportedby the
World Bank Public ManagementCapacityBuildingProject (PAIGEP I) closed inDecember2002. Some
                                                                           which
progresswas madeto simplify the expenditureprocessand computerizekey elements ofthe budgetexecution
system. Basedon a comprehensivereformofthe budgetclassification system and the introduction of anew chart of
accounts the quality, frequency, availability and timeliness ofbudgetaryand accounting information somewhat
improved.

Whenthe GovernmentofPresidentMarc Ravolamananacame into power in2002 it inherited a largely unfinished
and non-prioritized agenda.While previousreforms had some impact, overall efficiency, transparencyand
accountability ofthe public finance systemremainedlow. The new Governmentidentified public finance reforms
as one of its key priorities and provided new impetusto the agenda. Incollaboration with the World Bank and other
developmentpartnersthe Government initially identified the following key priority areas: (i)   the development and
introduction of an integratedfinancial managementsystem for the central governmentto improve operational
efficiency of budgetand expendituremanagement. (ii)the strengtheningof internal and external control mechanisms
to improve oversightand enforce compliance, and (iii)the reform ofthe public procurementsystemto ensure its
conformity with international standards.

It soonbecameapparentthatthis agendawould not besufficient to bringMadagascar'spublic finance systemto
international standards; additional reforms would be requiredto ensure that the public finance system could
effectively support implementationofthe Government's developmentprogram. These additional reforms included:
(i)afundamentalrevisionofthebudgetpreparationprocesstoimprovequalityoftheannualbudgetandits
consistencywith the developmentstrategy, (ii) simplification ofthe budgetexecutionprocessesto reduce
                                                  a
transactioncosts, (iii)significant investmentsintraining, capacity building and institutional developmentto enable
sector ministries to institutionalize the reforms, and (iv) reforms ofthe revenue agencies (customs, tax
administration) to increaseGovernmentrevenues and reduce barriersfor private sector development.

While supportto the public finance agendaunder the old regime was largely uncoordinated, the new Government
emphasized the needto harmonizethe inputsfrom developmentpartners. As the main instrumentto achievethis, it
developedan actionplan for public finance reforms that is agreed upon with all principal donors, and updatedon an
annualbasis. The olan orovides the framework for all assistanceto oublic finance reforms inMadagascar.



5 1.       Inthe area of public procurement, new procurementregulations includingimplementing
decreesand standard biddingdocuments have beendevelopedwhich are in linewith international
standards. The institutionalframework for public procurement has also beenmodernized, and a new
procurement oversight authority (Autorite'de Re'gulationdes Marche's Publics, ARIMP), including a new
appeals system, was set up.

52.      Significant investmentsintrainingand capacity buildingimproved executionrates at the
levelof the sector ministries. Training andcapacity buildingactivities for the Ministryo fFinance and
the sector ministries have focused on institutionalizingpublic finance and procurement reforms. The
Ministryo fBudgetandFinance which is leading the comprehensivereformprogramhas developed
annual work plans which are agreed upon with all relevant development partners. A reform coordination
unithas beenestablished to monitor implementation o fthe reform process. At the sector level greater
attention is now givento capacity needs, especially infinancial management and procurement, and longer
term vision for technical assistance for priority ministries. Ineducation, for example, a two year technical

from the PGDI, to provide assistance inbudget formulation, execution and policy advice. A similar plan
has also beendeveloped for nutrition and health. These activities have yielded positive results as
evidenced by the 2006 Public Expenditure and Accountability Assessment (PEFA) which confirmed an
improvement over the 2005 PEFA assessment.

53.       To reducecorruption,the Governmentinitiateda comprehensivegovernance reform
programwhichwent through numerous refinements. The first phase o fthe program (untilearly
2006) focused on establishing an effective regulatory and institutional framework to fight corruption and
improve governance. Inthis context, an independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ConseilSupe`rieur
Lutte Contrela Corruption, CSLCC,later renamed Comite`pourla Sauvegarde de l'lntbgritb, CSI)and an
independentAnti-Corruption Bureau(BureauIndbpendentAnti-Corruption, BIANCO) were set up and
made operational. The Commission subsequently put forward a comprehensive anti-corruption
legislation which includes a declaration o f assets o f public and elected officials, and regulations to
improve both investigation and prosecution o f corruption cases. Additional activities o fthe Commission
focused on regulating the recruitment into the public sector which, under the previous regime, was a key
source for corruption and conflict o f interest. The Commissionalso organized, with assistance from WBI,
an anti-corruption survey to establish baseline data and to raise public awareness about the incidence o f
corruption. Inparallel, BIANCO investigateda significant number o f corruption cases and organized
independent reviews or procurement audits insensitive areas such as audits o fthe land titling and customs
agencies as well as procurement audits o f the transport and the education programs. Second generation
governance reforms are ongoing. They focus on addressing conflict-of-interest o fpublic and elected
officials, on further strengthening the regulatory framework, inparticular whistleblower protectionand
the acknowledgement o fthe watchdog function on non-Governmental organizations. The Government's
efforts to establish a comprehensive framework o f checks and balances that is aimed at improving
transparency and reducing the opportunities for corruption and conflict-of-interest, has paid o f f as
evidenced by a continuous improvement ingovernance indicators since 2003.

54.       Despitethe persistentchallengefor the public sector to mainstream efficientdelivery
systems, severalofthe key indicators for basic service delivery show significant improvements. In
education, most o fthe established targets have been achieved. The Ministry o f Educationhas increased
its management capacity and has made progress in budget preparation and execution as well as
implementingthe new procurement code. Disparities,however, are still present across districts and
overall quality improvement is still an important challenge. Inthe health sector, infant and child mortality
have improved partly due to better delivery o f basic packages (vaccinations, vitamin A etc.). Maternal
mortality, however, is still progressingvery slowly, and the whole health system still needs strengthening
with respect to budget preparationand execution, implementation o fHR policy, procurement and revision
o f its hospital strategy. Innutrition, the available evidence points to a continued improvement o fthe
situation on the ground andprogress is also registered inthe institutionalset up with the recent
rationalization o fthe NationalNutrition Office (ONN). Finally, inrural water the Government continues
to make significant progress in setting upthe necessary buildingblocks to move to a programmatic
approach and enhanced budget support for the sector. The overall implementationo f the nationalwater
supply and sanitation program(PNAEPA) has been satisfactory and has ledto an improvedavailability o f
water and sanitation services particularly inrural areas. Nevertheless, much higher volumes o f
investmentwill be necessary to achieve the M A P and MDGobjectives. Trends inkey human
development indicators are presented in Table 5.

55.           At the same time, reforms initiatedinseveralareas need more time to consolidatethan
originallyenvisioned. Followinginitial progress, advances inlegal andjudicial reforms have been
slowing down. Similarly, some anti-corruption activities are proceeding slower than expected, in
particular those that are focused on addressing 'grand' corruption and conflict o f interest. Moreover, in
public expenditure management significant challenges still persist, particularly inrevenue management,
budgetary reporting, control and execution. The main reasons include over-optimism at the design stage,
insufficient prioritizationo f actions, andunder-estimation o fthe capacity constraints and implementation
leadtimes. This was particularly true for measures aimed at strengthening the procurement framework
and the accountability and transparency o f budget execution. As additional issues and weaknesses
surfaced over the course o fthe implementation o fthe first series o f PRSCs, the governance and public
finance reform agendas have evolved accordingly. This has been particularly true for the significant
training and capacity buildingneeds inthe area o f public financial management and procurement at the
level o fthe sector ministries which were seriously underestimated and required significant
complementary investments incapacity buildingandtechnical assistance. Finally, all these issues have
been further exacerbated by the initial lack o f understanding o fthe PRSC instrument insectors
accustomed to investmentprojects. For example, as o fthe PRSC 1, the nutrition programtransitioned to
budget support, but although it has now resumeda good level o fservice delivery, a credible institutional
settingis onlyjust now beginningto materialize.

56.           Usefullessons havealso beendrawn from the CountryAssistanceEvaluationcompleted by
the IndependentEvaluationGroupinJuly 2006. This evaluation providedrelevant insightswhich
have beentaken into account inthe design o fthe second PRSC series insofar as they recommend: (i)
limitingthe role o fbudget support untilthere is a sustained improvement incollecting and managing
public resources; and (ii)            focusing governance interventions on a few critical areas.

57.           Movingforward, the experiencewith the first PRSCseries has providedkey lessonsthat
have beenretainedindesigningthe new series. These can be summarizedas follows:

0     Budget support remains central to the Bank's assistance inMadagascar as it has proved an effective
      instrument infostering a much more concerted focus on key issues such as public expenditure
      management and institutional capacity building;


                                                                              20

    Given the fragile macroeconomic environment and limited implementation capacity, the volume o f
    budget support in the overall Bank portfolio will be modest until sustained improvements in these
    areas can be ascertained;
    Focus on fewer critical reforms particularly inthe area o f public finance and governance. The
    Ministryo fFinance's reformagenda is wide-ranging, andthe challenge remains greater prioritization
    and staying the course on implementingthe reform program. While fine-tuning and adjusting are
    critical elements o f a successful program, this needs to be balanced with the needto have stable
    procedures (changes each year complicate implementation);
    Allow for a more reasonable pace o freform particularly in sensitive and difficult areas and tailor the
    expected results accordingly;
    Accompany key reforms with continued technical support to priority ministries and agencies (e.g.
    Education, Health, Transport, DEA -Directorate o f Water and Sanitation     - and ONN)



                                 5. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

58.       An extensive program of analyticaland advisory activities(AAA) underpinsthe Bank's
policydialogue and programmaticlending. Furthermore, analyticaland advisory work has been
conducted or is planned beyond what was envisioned inthe previous CAS to respond to Government
needs. Recent key analytical reports completed include: the PEFA report, the new Public Expenditure
review, which focuses inter alia on health, nutrition and water and sanitation sectors and a study analyzing
the prospects for Madagascarto attain the MDGs. Procurement audits inkey sectors (health, education,
and transport), along with an institutionalassessment innutrition, were part o f the Government activities
connectedto PRSC 4, and they inform the reform agenda. PRSC 4 also continues to benefit from the
integrative Development Policy Reviewon Sustaining Growth for Enhanced Poverty Reduction(FY05)
which is now beingrevised by the work underpinningthe new C E M scheduled for early FY08. The
previous Public Expenditure Review (FY05), which provides recommendations on the public expenditure
reform agenda and specific recommendations for the transport, education and environment sectors, also
helped underpinthe key reforms. The findings o fthe Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA, FY03) and the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR, FY03), have also been critical
indefiningthe reformprogramo fthe Government. Inaddition, a large body o fanalytical work
contributes to informthe overall Government reform agenda. This includes the Investment Climate
Assessment, the Financial Sector Assessment Programand the landtenure review -all completed in
FY06, as well as the Local Development Fund(FDL) feasibility study ledby the Government and on-
going work on poverty analysis, labor markets and weather risk management.

59.       To ensure adequate analyticalinput for the publicfinance and procurementreforms,the
Government has agreedto a regularPEFA assessment. An initial pilot assessmentwas conducted in
2005 by the Government incollaboration with the PEFA Secretariat. In2006, an independent PEFA
assessmentwas organized, which confirmed a slight improvement o fthe performance o f the public
finance and procurement systems. Intotal, 9 out o f 28 indicators were ratedto be at an acceptable level.
A new assessment is scheduled for January 2008 and will be repeated every two years. Additional
analytical support is beingprovidedby a series o f programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews which are
conductedjointly with the Government. These PERs build on the collaborative work under the 2005
Public Expenditure Review, which generated comprehensive discussions about the scope, focus and
priorities o f public finance reforms. The PER 2006-7 is the first exercise which is organizedjointly
between the World Bank and the Government, and it focuses on health, nutrition and rural water.

60.       To assess the status of the applicationof, and compliancewith, the new procurement
regulations the Governmenthas agreed to organize regular(annual) procurementreviews. A first
series o freviews hasjust been completed for the Ministries o f health, education and transport. The
findings o fthese reviews are beingusedto identify reform bottlenecks and to adjust the ongoingtraining
and capacity buildingprogram.

61.        Sector specificstudiesineducationand healthunderpinthe reformagenda. Inaddition to
the work on public expenditure and procurement mentionedabove, several sector studies informthe
reform agenda ineducation and health. Ineducation, the implementation o f the EFA plan has been
supported by several analytical studies on primary education issues. A study on Language Policy has
been completed by the Bank and the Norwegian cooperation to provide the Government with options for
improving the language o f instruction. A study on school construction has been conducted to provide
inputsfor a nationalstrategy and for the harmonization o f donors' construction projects. UNICEF
completed the first phase o fthe study on gender parity within the frame o fthe UnitedNation Girls'
Initiative Education. The Bank and the GTZ undertook a study on the drop out at primary level and the
potential for introducing conditional cash transfers. An analysis o f school nutrition has been
commissioned by the World Food Programto support the development o f a national strategy on school
nutrition. Preliminaryresults are also available from the expenditure tracking survey, identifying the
scale o f leakages inthe provision o f goods and financial resources from the center to districts and schools.
Inhealth, thecompletionoftheNationalHealthAccounts exercise, the efficiencyandequity surveyalong
with the recent finalization o fthe quantitative HR plan, provide key analytical inputsto the Government
sector program and to this operation. Preliminary results are also available from the analysis o f drug
delivery to decentralized entities which identify leakages and delays inthe distribution system. A new
Anthropometric Survey, currently inprocess, and a Demographic Health Survey, plannedfor early 2008,
will provide an updatedbaseline for monitoring progress inthe sector.

62.        PSIA on healthcare and the poor. A poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) carried out in
2006 highlighted the absence o f citizen involvement inmonitoring service quality in health, as well as a
lack o f empowerment o f local health committees, which represent a key focus o f community level
involvement inthe health system. Moreover, Madagascar's numerous remote or difficult-to-access areas
make it almost impossible to rely solely on top-down supervision to monitor the quality and performance
o fthe 2,240 health posts (Centresde Santd deBase - CSB). The PSIA found that poor quality o f services
was one o fthe two key factors limitinguse o fpublic CSBs, the other being financial. Inthis context,
health service quality could be improved ifthere were support for engaging local communities inthe
monitoring o fhealthquality, and ifthe accountability andtransparency o fthe relationship between the
service providers andusers was strengthened at the local level. A pilot study is currently testing and
adapting a community score card to the health sector and is expectedto provide valuable lessons on how
such mechanisms could be adapted and more systematically integrated into the health sector.

63.        Nutritioninstitutionalassessment. With the creation o fthe NationalNutritionOffice (ONN)
in2004, a new institutionalframework has beenset upto mainstream nutrition activities inthe
Government program. Following the formulation o fthe National Nutrition Policy (PNN) at the request o f
parliament, the nutrition action plan for 2005-2009 (PNAN) was formulated by Government to
operationalize the policy throughthe simultaneous implementationo f fourteen strategies. The MAP has
now reprioritized and integrated the P N A N within its framework. ONNwas established under the
responsibilityo fthe Prime Ministry office to implement this planincollaboration with other sector
ministries such as health and education. The approach i s a fundamental change innutrition policy as it
transitions Government interventions from a classic project-type approach to an institutionalized
framework for interventions. Following the first phase o f implementation, an institutional assessment
was performedto further clarify and strengthen roles and competences. The results have been used by
Government to clarify the institutionalstructure o f ONN and are beingformalized ina new decree.

                      V. THE PROPOSEDNEWPRSCSERIES:PRSC4-PRSC6

                                  A.        OVERALL DESCRIPTION

64.       The mainobjective ofthe new PRSCseries is to support the implementationofthe MAP.
Consistent with the MAP, this PRSC cycle will provide Government with an opportunity to consolidate
reforms under way inthe areas o f public finance, governance and basic service delivery. It will support
efforts towards increased fiscal discipline, streamline and consolidate Government budget practices and
improve transparency. It will also continue to sustain efforts to improve the overall institutional setting
for improved service delivery ineducation, health, nutrition, water and sanitation. These reforms are
expectedto be conducive to higher growth rates and faster poverty reduction. The second PRSC series
will be preparedand delivered more inline with the Government's budget cycle, which runs from January
l-December 31. As requested by the Minstero f Finance, the preferred timetable for approval o f the
PRSC is the second quarter o f the calendar year. While PRSC 4 is scheduled for early inthe third quarter,
efforts will be made to further align PRSC 5 and PRSC 6 with the desired timetable. Indicative triggers
for future budget support have been selected accordingly.

65.        This PRSCseries aims at supportingthe MAP on a strategic subsetof objectivesdefined in
the MAP under the followingthree commitments: (i)responsiblegovernance; (ii)educational
transformationand (iii)health, family planningand the fight against HIV/AIDS. An additionalarea
o f focus i s also rural water supply, presented inthe M A P under the commitment o f connected
infrastructure. Capitalizingon the experience to date with the implementationofthe first PRSC series,
the new one has beendesigned with Government to focus on a smaller set o fpriority activities and to
continue to support the implementation o f key reforms. Consequently, the new PRSC series will continue
to support the Government to implement its comprehensive governance reform program. A key priority
is the consolidation o f the reforms initiated under the first series, i.e. to further refine the regulatory and
institutional governance framework, to close existing gaps, and to improve the impact o f governance-
related activities. Additional attention i s givento governance reforms, inparticular governance
challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and inspecific sensitive sectors such as
forestry and mining. The recent economic developments, with an increased relevance o fthe extractive
sector (see section II),  have given even more prominence to governance issues inextractive industries and
promptedan additional focus on strengthening the efficiency and transparency inthis area. The PRSC
series will complement the governance activities supported by the Mineral Resources Governance Project
to strengthen the policy legal and regulatory framework o fthe sector. Onrevenue mobilization issues, the
series will continue to support reforms inthe customs administration. Dedicated AAA will complement
the dialogue currently ledby the IMFon overalltax policy reform andwill leadto concrete actions to
improve tax policy for the end o fthe series.

66.        Regardingbasicservice delivery,the objective ofthe series is to accompanythe processof
institutionalstrengtheningand qualityimprovementsunderway inthe sectors. More specifically,
the PRSCs will complement the Bank's existinginvestment portfolio by reinforcingthe institutional
rationalization process innutrition and by supporting the implementation o f sector wide approaches in
health, education and water supply currently under way.

67.        The programmatrix and results framework for the PRSCseries presentedinAnnex 1are
fully alignedwith the MAP matrix. Prior actions for PRSC 4 and benchmarks and indicativetriggers
for PRSCs 5 and 6 have been selected with the Government on the basis o f (i)         their importance in
contributing a key constraint to the implementation o fthe intended reform and (ii) alignment with
                                                                                           their
the MAPobjectives. Indicators are also consistent with those presented inthe MAP. However, for the
time being the PRSC series foresees outcomes that are more conservative as the M A P presents a very
ambitious progression path, predicated on a highincrease o f external financing which has yet to fully
materialize. The Policy Matrix may be updatedas necessary once the Government completes its detailed
results framework o fthe MAP inthe second halfo f 2007.

                                                       24

68.       The expected results at the end of the series include the following: inthe area o f public
financial management a substantial improvement o fthe whole budget process as measured by the newly
established PEFA indicator system is expected. The reform program would lead to an increase o f PEFA
indictors rated `B" or above inall the key areas: budget preparation and execution, budget reportingand
internal and external controls. Inaddition, key expected results include: (i)    improved alignment o fthe
budget with the MAPpriorities; (ii) public institutions (ministries at central government level) execute
                                        all
their annual budgets through the integrated financial management system (SIGFP); (iii)          at least 80 percent
o f reviewed procurement processes inselected public institutions are assessedas conformingto the new
procurement regulations (iv) reduced transaction time of commitment control accelerates budget
execution and (v) the Tax Directorate focuses onthe collection of fewer taxes under a streamlined tax
regime and the customs directorate increases its efficiency. Inthe area o f decentralizationthe reform
program is expected to leadto a higher share o fresources available to local governments (at least 22
percent o fthe budget). Regardingthe fight against corruptionthe reform program i s expected to produce
(i) improvementoftheperceptionofcorruptionamongstthepopulationandcivilservantsand(ii)
    an
reduced opportunities for corruption inextractive and natural resource industries.Inthe domain o f service
deliverythe results expected are in line with the sector wide programs supported by the series. Education
results include continued improvements inprimary school completion rates and repetitionrates with
particular attention to vulnerable districts. Inadditionthe Ministry o f Education is expected to continue to
reinforce its capacity and quality in financial management and procurement services and sustain budget
execution rates o f above 90 percent. Inhealth, skilledattendance at birth and basic consultation rates are
expected to increase while the Ministry starts to implement a new HR policy, increases its budget
allocation to districts, and maintains an execution rate o f above 90 percent. For nutrition, the series would
leadto a full operationalization o f the institutionalchanges under way along with a continued reductiono f
malnutrition rates. Finally, for water and sanitation, the increase inaccess to rural water and sanitation
will be accompaniedby a strengthening o fpublic sector capacity at the regional level and an increased
role ofthe private sector inmanaging services.

Governance
>    PUBLICEXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT

69.       The institutionalizationof the budgetaryreforms introduced in2005 continuedto be the
key focus of the Government's public finance reforms over the year 2006. In2005, the Government
introduced simultaneously a MediumTerm ExpenditureFramework (MTEF) and a ProgramBudgeting
system. The new framework is meant to improve transparency, predictability and efficient use o f public
resources. As mentioned before, the Government faced significant challenges inoperationalizing these
reforms at the sector ministry level. Inaddition, work on other reform areas such as public procurement
and the modernization o fthe customs directorate has been continuing. The reforms andtheir
implementation status are summarized inTable 8 below.

70.       While overallimplementationprogressof the reformprogramhasbeensatisfactory, a
numberof challenges remain:
0    The fiscal framework for 2006 hadto be revised because o f lower-than-expected revenues. Revenue
performance in2005 was only 88 percent o f programmed levels, significantly below target. Revenue
performance improved for the year 2006 to 95 percent with fiscal revenue growing by 23.5 percent. The
revenue to GDP ratio remains relatively low at 10.7 percent in2006 (up from 10.1 percent in2005). The
realism o fthe fiscal framework was further undermined by delays inthe release o f budget support by
development partners, mainly because o f uncertainties ifthe Government was able to meet the
prerequisites and structural benchmarks for a new IMF program. Furthermore, significant in-year
budgetary adjustment had to be made infavor o fthe state energy company JIRAMA which further
reduced the flexibility o fthe Government.


0    Overall budget execution rates have increasedfrom 65 percent in2005 to over 90 percent in2006.
The increase is mainly due to the impressive implementation performance inthe last trimester o f the
budget year. Despite the high2006 execution rate, some systemic issues still remain inensuringthe same
level o f execution for the following years: Prior to 2006, the main reason for the low execution rate was
difficulties at the level o f the sector ministriesto operationalize the new budgetary framework (program
budgets). This reform was hastily prepared with only limited preparationtime for the sector ministries.
Over the course o f 2005 and 2006 the Government tried to address these issues through significant
investments intraining and capacity buildingas well as technical assistance curtailedto the specific needs
o fthe various sectors. Delays inthe implementationo fthe annual budget also contribute to lower
execution rates. In2005 and 2006 the budget execution startedonly in late March, which did not leave
sufficient time to adequately execute the annual budget. However, for the budget year 2007 the
investments intraining andcapacity buildingseem to pay o f f as execution has started earlier.
Nevertheless, consolidation o f recent efforts inimproving the budget execution calendar and training o f
sector ministries remains necessary for the 2006 execution levels to be retained inthe future.


0    Capacity to adequately prepare and execute the budget at the national and sub-national levels remains
weak. The far-reaching changes inthe budgetary framework continue to pose significant implementation
difficulties for the administration. This situation is further exacerbated by the parallel introduction o f
other importantreforms, inparticular o f the public procurement system. To address existing deficits in
conceptualizing and institutionalizingthe various reforms, the Government has developed inclose
collaboration with localtraining institutions a comprehensive training and capacity buildingprogram.
While this program seems to have generated positive results in some sectors it will take more time than
initially anticipated to bringthe entire administration up to an adequate level.

                     to simplify and modernizetax administration have been initiated.



71.        PRSC 4 continuesto support the far-reachingreformprogramas identifiedinthe annual
work planfor the years 2006 and 2007. The plansreflect the finding o fthe PEFA assessment which
was conducted in2006. Main focus o fthe program will be the further consolidation o f the new budgetary
framework. To improve the quality o f budget preparation, the Government has advanced the preparation
process to the month o fMarch (from July inprevious years). The preparation will be based on a more
realistic fiscal framework agreed upon with the IMF andpresented to Cabinet ina budget framework
paper. Comprehensive training and capacity buildingactivities have already been launched to address
difficulties with the budgetary framework at the level o f the sector ministries. These activities will
continue over the course o fthe year and also assist the ministries, departments and agencies to improve
budget execution. To improve budget execution a program o f targeted technical assistance for priority
sectors has been developed that is aimed to address existingprocedural and institutional bottlenecks.
Other reform activities focus on improvingthe system o f internal controls. To this end, the internal
control cadre o fthe Treasury will be further strengthened. Inaddition, a reform o fthe commitment
control cadre has beeninitiated based on an independent audit. The recommendations o fthis audit which
was finalized inFebruary 2007 will be usedto improve operational performance and quality o fthe
commitment control function. The operational efficiency of the Auditor General's Office will be further
upgraded. It is presently anticipated that the draft budget execution law for 2006 will be for the first time
submitted within the statutory framework to Parliament. To improve budget transparency the existing
reporting system is presently under review. The main objective is to consolidate and to harmonize the
various execution reports produced by the Ministryo f Finance and Budget and by the sector ministries to
create a transparent framework o f budgetary reportingthat corresponds to the needs o fthe various actors
(Cabinet, Ministry o f Finance and Budget, sector ministries). A key instrument inthis context will be the
new integrated financial management system which has been deployed to the central Government and to
the provincialtreasuries. This systemcaptures about 80 percent o fall Government expenditures.


                                                        28

72.       Followingthe recommendationsof the PER 2006-7, the PRSC4will support the
Governmentinupdatingthe Medium-TermExpenditureFramework(MTEF) that underpins the
implementationof the MAP. To achieve this a consistent methodology for the costing o fthe MAP and
the related sectoral strategies will needto be developed. This would pave the way for an improved
prioritization o f public expenditures under the MTEF.

73.       The consolidationof procurementreforms is another key element of the reform agendaof
the Government. The work onthe regulatoryframeworkhas beencompletedwith the adoption of
the decreesand StandardBiddingDocumentsto implementthe new procurementcode. The new
Procurement Oversight Authority (Autoritd de Rdgulation des Marchds Publics -ARMP) became
operational inJune 2006; it subsequently worked on the development o f a comprehensive training and
capacity buildingprogram to institutionalize the new regulations at the level o fthe public administration.
Two independentreviews o f the ministries o f education, healthand transport, conducted inearly 2007,
confirmed that there is still a lot to be done to ensure the adequate applicationo fthe new regulations. To
address existingbottlenecks a workshop was organized inFebruary 2007 to discuss implementation
issues and experience and develop an appropriate action plan. To improve transparency o f the public
procurement process the ARMP is setting up a website which will provide relevant informationabout
open tenders and about the results o fthe tendering process. This website is expected to be operational
before July 2007.

74.       To improverevenueperformancethe Government continuesto implement the customs
reformaction planwhich was adopted inJune 2005. This action plan, aimed at improvingthe
quality of customsservices, generating revenueand reducingcorruptionis beginningto deliver
results. In2006 revenue performance has beenclose to the projections, at about 96 percent. Customs
regulations have been further simplified, includingrevision o fthe customs code and the elimination o f
exemptions and exonerations. The modernization o fthe customs administration has continued: the
automated data processing system (SYDONIA++) has been deployed to 9 offices including the most
important ones inTamatave and inAntananarivo. Pre-shipment inspections continue to be conducted by a
private operator. To facilitate controls new scanners have been installed inthe customs offices in
Tamatave and inAntanarivo. The Government will also introduce a comprehensive high-quality customs
management system(TRADENET); a pilot installation o fthe new system is planned inTamatave for
2007. To reduce corruption a mandatory regular rotation o f customs agents has been initiated since 2006.
The customs directorate is supported by the independent Anti-corruption Bureau (BIANCO)which
continues to provide advice and organize workshops to sensitize customs officials and private sector
operators. Inaddition, the Government has embarked on a tax reform program. With IMF assistance, the
Government is working on simplifyingand rationalizingthe tax system and on minimizing tax
exemptions. A revised tax code is expected to be implemented with the Finance Law 2008. World Bank
assistance has been requested to modernize the procedural and institutional framework under which the
tax administration operates.

75.       The proposedtriggers for PRSC5 include:
    Satisfactory implementation o fPriority Action Planfor 2007.
    Budget for 2008 allocates adequate resources to MAPpriority sectors -this trigger is meant to
    monitor consistency between the development strategy o f the Government and its annual budget.
    Reconciliationo f budget execution status o fkey sector ministries with the Ministryo f Finance -this
    trigger intends to improve consistency o fexecution data inline ministrieswhich continues to pose
    significant challenges. This is also in line with the recommendations o fthe PERs2005 and 2006-7. It
    is envisaged that such reconciliationwill be done every two months between the Ministry o f Finance
    and the ministries o f health, education, public works, environment and agriculture.
    Publicationo f the results o fthe public tendering processes -this trigger aims at improving
    transparency o fthe public procurement process. Inline with international best practice it is proposed
    to publishonthe website o fthe ARMP contracts with a value above US$50,000.
    Implementation o fthe recommendations o f the independentaudit o f the commitment control (CDE) -
    this trigger focuses on anelement o fthe public finance system that has been identifiedas a bottleneck
                                                      29

    by various studies andreviews. Itwould require Government to fully integrate the CDE into the
    computerized financial management system, mainly to improve transparency and predictability o f
    CDE operations, as well as to establish and enforce service standards for the CDE.

The proposedtriggers for PRSC 5 buildon parallelanalytical work inthe context o fthe PERand focus
on key priority areas that are considered critical to further deepen ongoing public finance reforms. Of
particular importance inthis context are: (i) needto address the consistency o fbudget execution data,
                                               the
which continues to negatively impact the implementation and monitoring o fthe budget, and (ii)           the
operational efficiency o fthe commitment control (CDE) which is considered one o fthe weaknesses of the
public finance system.

76.        PRSC 4 continuesto supportthe implementationofgovernance reforms,with specialfocus
on the areas of decentralizationand reductionof corruption. With regard to decentralization the
Government has continued to strengthen the role o fthe regions by progressively integrating
deconcentrated services o f the public administration under the authority o fthe regional Chiefs. The
objective is to harmonize all sectoral activities ina specific region andto establish integrated regional
development plans. To improve the delivery o f public services the Government also intends to strengthen
the role o fthe villages (fokotuny) by formally recognizingtheir important administrative role inthe
context o f the constitutional amendment which was approved inApril 2007. This amendment also
abolishes the autonomous provinces. To improve the availability o f financial resources at the level o fthe
local Government, the Government has increased the share o f certain taxes (impbt synthdtique, impbt
foncier) infavor o fthe communes onthe basis o fthe Finance Law 2007. At the same time, the
implementation of the Local Development Fund(FDL)has been delayed; it is presently expected that the
FDLwill be fully operational only in2008. The fund intends to integrate financial support to the local
Government levels both by the Government and by the donor community under a single mechanism with
harmonized procedural and institutionalarrangements.

77.        As regards reducingcorruption,PSRC 4 will buildonthe significant achievements o fthe first
series o f PRSCs (see paras. 43-46 and Annex 2) and assist the Government inconsolidating the regulatory
framework. Key actions include: (i)    the declaration o fassetsfor public andelected officials, which is in
effect since 2005, will be complemented by a declaration o f "economic interests" which intends to lay
open the private sector linkages o f public and elected officials. The new declaration will be required for
the first time in2007; (ii) to address conflict-of-interest issues at the level o f elected officials a revision o f
the immunities o f elected officials guaranteed by the Constitutionhas beenprepared. The revision aims
at facilitating both investigation and prosecution o f corruption and conflict-of interest cases by the
relevant authorities. The revision was part o f the recently completed referendumwhich approved some
constitutional amendments; (iii)   the regulations inthe civil service law that deal with conflict-of-interest
issues will be amended and broughtto international standards. The revision o fthe regulations, which is
planned for June 2007, will also include the establishment o f disciplinary commissions inevery sector
ministryto monitor and enforce conflict-of-interest regulations. The new regulations will be piloted in
four sector ministriesin 2007 before its application for the entire public service which is planned for
2008; (iv) the Government will continue to support the development o f self-regulating mechanisms such
as codes o f conduct or similar instrumentsthat are aimed at usingpeer pressure to address corrupt
behavior or misuse o f power. Such a new code o f conduct was developed in2005 for the magistrates
together with a public campaign to sensitize boththe target audience and the general public. It is
envisagedto develop similar code-of-conducts for all public services and to establish instruments to
monitor the effective application o fthese obligations. This activity is explicitly mentioned inthe
Madagascar Action Plan (MAP); (v) the Anti-corruption Commission is also inthe process o fpreparing
regulations to strengthen the watchdog functions o f non-Government entities andto protect
whistleblowers; an activity which is also explicitly mentioned inthe MAP. It is envisaged to submit these
regulations for Parliamentary approval inthe second half o f 2007; (vi) the Government has agreed to use
independent audits andprocurement reviews as instrumentsto address corruption insensitive areas and to

                                      Box 5: Conflict of Interest in Madagascar


Improvedgovernanceandthe fight againstcorruptionhas beena keyelement o fthe policy agenda ofthe
Governmentof PresidentMarcRavolamananasince hetook power in2002. Inthis context, the Governmenthas
facedconsiderablechallenges, inparticularto reduceendemiccorruption and high-levelconflicto finterestwhich
was a maincharacteristicofthe previousregime.

The internationalcommunitycontinuesto expressconcernaboutpotentialconflictof interestofpublicand elected
officials. The center stage o fthe discussionquicklybecamethe role o fthe President as an electedofficial and as the
headofa conglomerateofprivatefirms which havea significantmarketpresenceand influence. The discussions
with the Presidentfocusedinitially on howto organize an arms-lengthmanagementofhis firms and assets. Various
options were discussedbetween2004 and2005 to separatepublicandprivate functions. The Governmentwantedto
avoid a "lex Ravolamanana",mainlybecauseofthe political implications of suchregulations. It confirmed,
however,its intentionto addressthe conflict-of-interestissuesin a broader context for all relevantpublicand elected
officials.

The Governmentdevelopeda comprehensivegovernancereformprogramwhichfocusedon increasing
transparency, inparticularthroughthe declarationo fassets ofpublicand electedofficials, throughthe publicationof
contract awardsand exemptions, andthrough independentaudits in areas which are potentiallyvulnerableto the
misuseofpower (e.g. biginvestmentprojects). The effectivenessofthe regulatoryand institutionalframework has
beenevaluatedon a regularbasis;the findings ofthe evaluationsconfirmthe overall good qualityandhighimpact
o f the Government'sreformactivities.

Whilethere are no activities specifically targetedat separatingthe publicandprivatefunctions ofthe President,the
Governmentis establishinga comprehensiveframework of checks and balancesthat is aimedat improving
transparencyandreducingthe opportunitiesfor corruptionandconflict-of-interest.This framework has already
yielded some positiveresultsas evidencedbythe fact that Madagascaris well aboveother low Incomecountrieson
all key governanceindicators(TheWorld Bank Institute's governanceindicatorsplaceMadagascaraheadofmost
low-incomecountries, especiallyoncontrollingcorruption.It is amongvery few low-incomecountriesto be inthe
50th-75th percentileof CompositeGovernanceIndicator,alongwith Ghana andMongolia, up from the 48th
percentilerank in2003.) At the sametime, progressis slower thanexpectedand it seemsthat the ambitious
governancereformprogramneedstime to consolidatedespitehighexpectationsbythe citizenryandthe
developmentpartners.

The Governmentis aware ofthe reputationalrisksthat are linkedto the perceptionofpotentialconflict-of-interests
at the highestlevels o fthe State. It hastherefore emphasizedits continuingcommitmentto greatertransparency,to
higher integrityandto decisive actions againstthe misuseofpower in its new developmentstrategy, the MAP. As a
consequence,the first commitmentofthe MAP confirms the overarchingimportanceofthe reformto strengthen
governanceandto reducecorruptionfor the socio-economicdevelopmento fthe country andfor the international
reputationofMadagascar.




78.        New regulations on fiscal decentralizationto be reflectedby the BudgetLaw have been
adopted but they are less ambitiousthan originally anticipated. The objective ofthe envisaged
reformwas the development of a consistentregulatory framework for fiscal decentralization. The
Governmenthas initiated this process and inthe Budget Law 2007 increasedthe share of certain taxes
(impdt synthe`tique,imp& foncier) infavor ofthe communes. A more fundamentalreformwill, however,
take longer than initially anticipated, mainly because of ongoing parallel changesto the institutional
framework (abolishment ofthe autonomousprovinces and strengtheningofthe roles andresponsibilities
ofregional and localgovernments). A new fiscal decentralizationframework will alsorequire deeper
analysis ofthe impact of intendedchangesto the fiscal framework. The Bank will supportthis analysis
through an update of a fiscal decentralizationstudy which was first completedin2003.
                                                          31

79.        Government has initiatedthe processto develop a comprehensiveset of conflict of interest
regulations for the civilservice. This work took longer than expectedbecause o f difficulties in
determiningthe scope and focus o f conflict-of-interest regulations which have now been clarified. A
draft decree o fthe new regulations to be piloted in4 ministries has been prepared. Following the results
o f the pilot it is expected that regulations will be mainstreamed to all public sector entities by 2008. The
final prior action for PRSC4 hasbeenadjustedto reflectthe delay inthe adoption ofthe
regulations. Inparallel, as described inBox 5 and paragraph 77 above, the Government continues to
implementits broader reform agenda o fthe regulatory framework for anti-corruption.

80.        The indicativetrigger proposedfor PRSC5 is that a draft hydrocarbonlaw be prepared which
includes the separation o f the National Office on Mines and Strategic Industries (0MNIS)'s regulatory
function from its commercial one. The law will be submitted to Parliament in2008.
This reform focuses on further deepening governance activities insectors that are considered critical for
the success o f the development program o f the Government. Inthis context the extractive industries sector
is o fparticular strategic importance, inview o f the potentially significant miningand oil resources. The
new law will address the necessary improvements inthe institutional structure and eliminating potential
conflict o f interest andregulatory gaps. A key player inthis sector is the parastatal entity OMNIS. The
trigger follows, inter alia, the findings o f a recently completed audit o f OMNIS that recommended the
separation o fthe regulatory function o fthe office from its commercial activities to avoid a potential
conflict-of-interest. The trigger i s also harmonized with the broader institutional agenda fostered by the
Mineral Resources Governance Project.


Education

81.        Followingthe launchof the Government's Educationfor All initiativein2003, Madagascar
hascommencedan impressivereformprograminprimary educationthat has ledto significant
improvementsinservice delivery. Since the eliminationo f school fees in2002, the Net Enrollment
Rate registered a significant increase shiftingfrom 82 percent to 98 percent between 2002/2003 to
2005/2006. Efforts have been developed inorder to reduce the repetitionrate from 30 percent in2002 to
19 percent in2006 and positive impacts are expected on the student retention rate. The Primary
Completion Rate (PCR) improved significantly from about 30 percent in2002 to 60 percent in2006 but is
still low when compared to international standards. In 2005, the country joined the EFA-Fast Track
Initiative global partnership. The Ministry updated its EFA Plan inearly 2005 inorder to focus on
strategies to improve primary completion and raise quality. The planwas endorsed by local donors and
led to additional grant fundingfrom the FTICataltyic Fund. The Ministryhas put inplace mechanisms
for taking leadership indonor coordination and alignment. Annex 5 describes indetail the EFA process.

82.        Issueshoweverstill remainwith regardto the qualityof primary education and thiswill
take concertedaction on a numberof fronts over severalyears to show results. According to the
results from an international learningachievement survey (PASEC) o f grades 2 and 5, conducted in
2003/04, students inMadagascar registered lower scores incomparison to 1997/98, inparticular inFrench
and, ingeneral, for grade 5. The decline inthe repetition rate from 30 percent in2003-4 to 18 percent in
2006-7, is largely the resulto f administrative measures on the suppression o frepetition ingrades 1and 4.
The pupil-teacher still remains highat about 51, although recruitment o fnew teachers (about 2,000 per
year) has reduced the level from 60 in2005-6. Nonetheless, recruitments in remote areas remain a
challenge. There are still delays inthe provision o f school grants, books and student learningmaterials
due to difficulties inbudget execution. Further, distributionproblems meanthat the objective o fone
textbook per student per subject is not fully met at the classroom level. The construction o f classrooms
has also experienced delays leading to overcrowded classrooms.

83.        PRSC4 continuesto support the implementationofthe nationalEFA program. This
operation will maintain support to Government efforts for the EFA program to (i)       improve financial
management and procurement services; (ii)        rationalize teacher management and staff/teacher salary
                                                         32

administration; (iii) reorganize and strengthen management structures for improved cost-efficiency and
accountability at all levels and (iv) increase efforts to implement quality enhancing measures (e.g. teacher
hiringandtraining, curriculum update, timely delivery ofbooks, school kits, and school grants).

84.        Followingthe October 2006joint donor review and an assessment of the March2007
ministryreport,the implementationof the NationalEducationfor All is on track. During2006, key
actions to increase access and foster free primary education include: (i)a vast teacher recruitment effort
coupled with improved selection criteria; about 1,900 new Government teachers and more than 7,800 new
community teachers have been recruited and redeployedto schools inzone 3 (those with difficult access).
Moreover, Government teachers are recruited against a contract linked to a specific school to ensure their
retention inremote areas. (ii)  an increase intotal public contributions to community teachers' salary (from
MGA3,900 million in2005 to MGA14,415 million) to alleviate the costs o fprimary education for
families as well as to close the salary gap between Government and community teachers; payments were,
however, delayed for several months; (iii)    continued support for free primary education (with worrisome
delays however), with grants distributed to all 16,917 public schools and pedagogical kitsto about 1
million new students in grade 1; over 3.7 million bilingualtextbooks for grade 3 have also been
distributed to comply with the objective o f 1textbook per subject per student, but also to gradually
introduce Malagasy language as a means o f instruction.

85.        The indicativetrigger for PRSC 5 is that the implementation o fthe National Educationfor All
(EFA)be ontrack. PRSC 5 continues to support the implementation o fEFA. This includes, interalia,
raising enrollment and completion rates, as well as reducing the repetitionrates inthe lagging school
districts to improve the national indicators and reduce disparities. Inthe coming 12 months, it is expected
that (i) a draft policy for community teachers will be elaborated for discussion and put inplace and that
the pupil-teacher ratio will continue to decline on average, (ii)new procedures will be adopted for the
construction o f classrooms; (iii) school inputs/supplies, such as grants, school kits and books, will be
deliveredina timely fashion at the beginningo fthe school year, and that Government contributionto
community teachers will be made ina timely fashion, through improvements inbudget execution,
procurement, distribution, monitoring and reporting; (iv) the Ministrywill begin to update the curricula,
books and teacher training; and (iv) the management capacity o f the central Ministry,regional and district
offices and schools will be reinforced inkey areas to improve service delivery.




86.        Despite progressacross a numberof key indicators,Madagascarcontinues to face serious
challenges in the production,financing, and delivery of healthservices as well as inthe healthstatus
of its people. Onthe positive side, there has been a marked improvement inchild health over the last
decade, with infant and child mortality falling by 43 percent and 41 percent respectively between 1997
and 2004. Although some issues have been raised regarding the reliability o f these marked drops in
mortality, other determinants o f child survival -such as morbidity and coverage o f important health
interventions -have also improved. For instance, the prevalence o f diarrhea inchildren decreased about
63 percent and the proportion o f anemic children fell about 31percent between 1997 and 2004. Further,
vaccination, vitamin A supplementation, and exclusive breastfeeding have increased. However, many
other indicators have remained unchanged or worsened duringthe last decade. Maternal mortality has
remained highand unchanged at 469 per 100,000 live birthssince 1997, jeopardizing the likelihood that
Madagascar will reachthis MDG by 2015. While antenatal care has increased to 80 percent, the presence
o f skilledstaff at birthhas increasedonly from 47 percent to 54 percent. The prevalence o f HIV/AIDS in
the country remains low, but it has rapidly increased amonghighrisk groups and there are an estimated
180,000 persons livingwith HIV inthe country. Bilharziosis (affecting about two and a halfmillion
people inMadagascar), lymphatic filariosis (prevalence thought to be over 50 percent), tuberculosis
(20,000 new cases every year), leprosy (prevalence o f2.5 per 10,000, which is the highest inthe world),
and malaria continue to represent a large health burden to the population. Overall, despite some
impressive gains, the health sector inMadagascar continues to face many challenges, relatingespecially
to the level o f overall financing, utilization o fhealth services, distribution of health personnel, availability
                                                        33

o f drugs and medical supplies inhealth facilities, and internal administration o fthe health system, and in
particular, budget execution. Ifnot addressed, these challenges may significantly hamper Madagascar's
ambitions to reach its goals as expressed inthe MAP.

87.       PRSC 4 and subsequent operations will support Government effort to meet these
challenges. To implementthe objectives set out inthe MAP, the Government is puttinginplace a SWAP
for the health sector (see Annex 5). The primary focus o fthe SWAP is to strengthenthe health system
and increase its capacity to provide the necessary production, financing, delivery and management
support for delivery o f services necessary to meet the eventual objectives o f reducingchild andmaternal
mortality, controlling illnesses due to malaria, sexually transmitteddiseases, and HIV-AIDS. In
conjunctionwith the health sector investment operation recently approved by the Board inMay 2007, in
line with the other portfolio activities inthe sector (Multisectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Project US$20m,
                                                                                              -
closingdate: December 2007; Second Multisectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Project             - US$30m, closing date:
December 2009; Community DevelopmentFund              - US$176m,   closing date: June 2008; and Second
Community Nutrition Project       - US$47.6m7closing    date: December ZOOS), the PRSC 4 and subsequent
operations will assist Government efforts to set up an integrated approach to the sector and improve the
quality and availability o f health services. Inparticular, it will support the improvements infinancial
management, includingbudget preparation and execution, implementationo f the new procurement code,
improvements inhuman resource policy and decentralization o f service delivery.

88.       The Government has completed its Health Sector Development Program (PDSS). This
activity is a crucial first step insettingupthe institutionalinfrastructure for a SWAP in health. Following
the MAP, the PDSS identifies a number o fkey bottlenecks to increased access and use o fhealth services
and improvements inhealth indicators inMadagascar. Four critical areas o f weakness are highlighted: (i)
poorly equipped health centers and low levels o f capacity to produce and deliver health services,
especially inrural and remote areas (managerial capacity at the level o f communes is weak); (ii)      uneven
staffing o f health facilities, especially inrural andremote areas (a large number o f health centers,
particularly inrural and remote areas, do not have adequate number o f qualified staff); (iii)   low levels o f
health financing and inefficiencies inresource allocation (Madagascar spent around US$6 per capita on
health care in2005, significantly lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa,
o f US$15.4 per capita); and (iv) inadequate demand for health services and low levels o f utilization (only
10percent o fthe populationreports an illness annually, and o fthis, only 40 percent seeks care from
qualified medical personnel). The PDSS details a series o f interventions to address these weaknesses and
presents a logical prioritizationo f activities and supporting budgets to be implemented over the next five
years. These interventions are expected to result insignificant improvements across a range o f demand-
side, supply-side and institutional aspects o fthe health system, especially inthe production and delivery
o f quality services in rural and remote areas. Visible results are expected inthe deployment, effectiveness
and morale o f health teams at service delivery points, particularly inremote areas. Utilization o f health
services is expected to increase significantly, as a result o f which marked and sustained improvements in
health status and outcomes are expected to occur.

89.       The indicative trigger for PRSC 5 is that a health mapping be elaborated and validated at all
levels o fthe health system. The overall goal o fthe health mapping is to strengthenthe capacities o f
infectious diseases and public health programs at all levels o f health care delivery through the use o f
mappingtechnologies, andwill include, at a minimum, information on (i)          humanresource availability,
especially inrural and remote areas; (ii)    utilizationrates for curative services; (iii)
                                                                                        populations served by
preventive services; and (iv) budgetresources received. The health mappingwill facilitate the
visualization o f disease foci, the monitoring o f newly infectedor re-infected villages, the identification o f
at-risk populations, and the highlytargeted, cost-effective distribution o f interventions, with a view to
boost efforts to eradicate diseases which affect the isolated, rural poor. This trigger is critical for the
health sector insofar as health mapping-through the delivery o f user-friendly data collection,
management and mapping applications -will be central in increasing the efficiency o f national
surveillance, preventionand control activities as well as in strengthening the management, analysis and
monitoring o f priority infectious diseases at all levels. The health map will complement the efforts

outlined inthe PDSS to meet the MAP objectives o f eradication o fmajor diseases, reduction in infant and
child mortality, reduction inmaternal mortality, and provision o f quality services, especially inremote
areas.


Nutrition

90.       Madagascar has devotedconsiderable efforts to nutritioninterventionsthat haveled to a
successfulreduction of malnutritionrates amongyoung children.An impact-evaluation o fthe
community-based nutrition program, which i s implemented in 62 districts, demonstrates a 10 percentage-
point reductioninunderweight malnutrition inthe poorest areas o f Madagascar where the program
intervenes for at least two years. Despite this reduction, national level malnutritionrates remain highand
more is needed, especially to reduce chronic malnutritionrates, or stunting. Decreasingstuntingtakes
long-term commitment and intensifiedattention toward pregnant women inorder to reduce low birth
weight. Impressive improvements have beenmade concerning exclusive breastfeedingo f childrenunder
six months (from 43 percent in 1997to 67 percent in2003/04 based on the DHS) and Vitamin A
supplementation among children under five (from 4 percent to 76 percent over the same period).
However, iron-deficiency anemia among young children remains very high, with more than two-thirds o f
children under the age o f five suffering from anemia. Inaddition, seasonal short-term hunger among
school-age children has been highlightedas a major impediment to learning.

91.       PRSC 4 supportsthe programof institutionalizationof nutritionservices initiatedby the
Governmentsince2004. The reversal o fthe negative trends andimprovements inthe nutrition situation
inMadagascar are the resultso fyears ofGovernment investmentincommunity basednutrition activities,
improved quality o f nutrition services, and more recently the strengthened capacity to develop policies as
well as increased attention to institutionalization o f nutrition and allocation o fbudget for nutrition
services. However, further progress is needed to consolidate the institutionalset up, improve capacity and
coordinate within the key-sectors, such as health and agriculture. The ONN should take onthese extra
efforts and should be encouraged to continue the use o f existing implementation capacity inMadagascar,
particularlythe executing unit SEECALINE, the implementing agency o fthe community based nutrition
programs.

92.       The Government has issueda formal decreethat implementsthe recommendationsof the
institutionalassessmentit has carried out. Following the analysis o fthe institutionalsystem for the
delivery o f nutrition services, the Government has issued a decree that implements the institutional set up
initially set forward by the decree that created ONN in2004. The new decree specifies the legal status
and managerial structure o f ONN, provides the necessary minimumstandards o ffinancial transparency
and accountability and clarifies the previously outstanding issues in humanresource management o f its
staff.

93.       The indicative trigger for PRSC5 is that, inaccordance with the ONN implementation decree:

validated by the Permanent Office o f the CNN. PRSC 5 continues to support the institutional
strengthening o f ONN and, following the 2007 implementationdecree, supports activities critical for
improving the accountability and financial management o fthe institution.


Water and Sanitation

94.       The Governmentobjective aims at providingimprovedwater supply to 53 percentof the
rural populationby 2012, against 31percentin2005. According to the new database, the access rate to
safe water increased from 27.2 percent in2003 to 31percent in 2005. This progress however is not
sufficient for Madagascar to reach the objective o f servicing 53 percent o fthe rural population by 2012.
As o f2006, about 10millionout o f 14.2 million rural residents do not have accessto potable water. In
2006 the Government program inrural water and sanitation (RWS) provided 110,000 rural people with
access to potable water whereas the rural population increases by about 400,000 people per year.

95.       PRSC 4 supports Governmentto continueto buildadequate capacity within the
DirectorateofWater and Sanitation (DEA) at the centraland regionallevel. These efforts aim to
ensure increased ability to plan, execute and monitor the RWS national program and significantly
increase the current level o f financing. Inrecent years, the Government has considerably strengthenedthe
institutional system for water and sanitation service delivery and donors are fully aligned behindthe
Government strategy and policy (see Annex 5). However, further consolidation is still necessary on the
institutional setting and lack o f public resources undermines the potential for reaching the MAP
objectives. Total budget for the DEAMEMhas continued to increase substantially over the past years,
butremains insufficient. Expenditures increasedfrom US$10.6 million in2004 to US$13 million in
2005. 87 percent o fthe budget was dedicated to rural water, 11percent to urban water and 2 percent to
rural sanitation. The DEAMEM2006 budget was set at US$18 million, representing an additional
increase o f 33 percent. Allocations for 2007 have however been reducedto US$14 million.
Nevertheless, it is estimatedthat about US$34 million would be needed annually to reach the MDGtarget
for rural water supply and sanitation.

96.       Overall, the recommendationsissuedduringthe joint Government/donorsannualreview

sanitation strategy and policy document was validated by the Government inApril 2007; (vii) the creation
o f the Regulatory Body (SOREA) is taking longer than originally anticipated and the need for additional
time has been acknowledged by the 2007 review. The impact o fthe delay inimplementationon the sector
development is, however, considered minimal.

97.       The indicativetrigger for PRSC5 is that the decree for the creation o fthe Directorate General
o f Water and Sanitation (DGWS) be issued, and the recruitment o f at least 30 ofthe 60 new staff be
initiated. PRSC 5 continues to sustain Government reform to strengthen its institutionalframework in
water and sanitation service delivery, including increased human resources at both central and regional
level to better assist the 22 regions and 1,557 communes to plan, execute, co-finance their program as
well as manage water supply and sanitation systems.

                            VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                               1. POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

98.      The proposedPRSC4 does notsupport any reforms that are expectedto havesignificant
distributionalimpacts. The focus o fthe operation is centeredon reforms aimed at improvedpublic
financial management, decentralization, anticorruption and institutional strengthening for enhanced
service delivery. As such, none o fthe reforms supported by the operation has distributional implications
that would warrant a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA). The Government however remains
committedto understandthe distributional impact o f key policy reforms and economic events. PSIA has
been undertaken inthe past or is planned inthe coming months to inform critical policy issues. Inrecent
years distributional analyses have been conducted to understandthe impact o fthe reduction inrice tariffs
o f 2005 andthe implementation o f landtenure securitization. More recently completed PSIAs include: (i)
the poverty and social impact o f health care and the poor by investigatingGovernment efforts to meet the
health care needs o f the poor inthe context o fthe reinstatement o fthe 2003 cost recovery for drugs and
(ii) impactofoilpriceincreasesfollowingthe2004fuelpriceliberalizationandthesubsequentsharp
    the
increase inworld oil prices in2005.


                                  2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

99.       The PRSC4 programdoes not pose any significant environmentaleffects. The proposed
PRSC 4 is a development policy credit in support o f a broadprogram o f policy and institutional reforms,
for which the environmental requirements o f OP/BP 8.60 apply. However, none o fthe activities
supported by the PRSC 4 program pose any likely and significant effects on the environment, natural
resources and forests. Overall, the envisaged areas o f focus for the operation, governance and improved
service delivery, emphasize reforms in public financial management, decentralization, corruption, and
strengthened institutions for service delivery. Consequently, they do not encompass any activity that has
significant environmental impacts. Furthermore, the Bank's overall strategy has focused on hrther
strengthening o f the Government's legislative and institutionalcapacity to address environment and
naturalresource managementthrough its environment project.


                3. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

100.      The responsibilityfor implementingthe PRSCprograminGovernment restswith the
Ministry ofFinance and Budget. As for the previous PRSC series, the Government continues to take
the lead inmonitoring progress inimplementation and inupdating the programpolicy matrix. The
Ministryo fFinance andBudget is coordinating inputs from allthe relevant ministries. The Bankwill
also continue to maintain a dialog with the relevant sector ministries and conduct periodic reviews with
the other partners inthe context o fthejoint missions on budget support and relevant sector programs.

101.      The monitoringand evaluation ofthis PRSCwill be adaptedto the new monitoringsystem
of the MAP currentlyunder development. The Government is developing a detailed results framework
for the M A P and designing the proper institutional settingto monitor its implementation. Once the new
system is inplace the monitoring o fthe PRSC series will be adapted accordingly. Monitoring systems
however are weak and require considerable strengthening-with the support o f donors to improve data
                                                                                        -
quality and institutional capacity. The Bank is supportingthese efforts through an Institutional
Development Fund grant on statistical capacity buildingand through a PRSP Trust Fundfor M&Eo f the
MAP. The Bank is also providing support throughthe PGDIproject which supports improvements o f
monitoring systemat ministry level, support to the national statistics institute (INSTAT) and contributing


                                                     38

to the financing needs o f a new Census. The Bank's on-going investment projects each have an M&E
component that supports both the project and the sectoral ministry.


                                      4. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

102.      Foreign exchangesystem: an IMFsafeguards assessmentwas completed inMarch2006 and
identified continued weaknesses inthe BCM's system o f internal controls, financial reporting, and legal
framework. The assessment made recommendations to address the observed vulnerabilities, which
included(i)  an annual external audit report on the BCM's transactions with the Government andtheir
compliance with the central bank law; (ii)  quarterly reviews by the BCM's internal audit function o f
monetary program data reported to the Fund; (iii)  adoption o f InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards
as the BCM's accounting framework; and (iv) measures to strengthen the quality o f the BCM's external
audit. An agreed action planwith the Central Bank authorities has been developed by the IMF to ensure
adequate and timely implementation o fthese recommendations. A previous assessmentwas completed in
November 2001. While some recommendations to strengthen the safeguards framework o fthe B C M have
beenput inplace, others required more time and are now beingaddressed inthe context o fthe new
assessment and included inthe above mentioned action plan monitored by the IMF. Since most o fthe
safeguards recommendations have been implemented or are underway, no additionalfiduciary
arrangements are needed.

103.      PublicFinance Management System: the World Bank's CFMCPAR, was completed in
2003. Other diagnostics carried out over the last three years by the Bank and other donors identified a
range o f issues hamperingthe performance o f Madagascar's budget and expenditure management system.
The mainchallenges faced include the following: (i)    simplificatiodrationalization o fthe expenditure
management process; (ii)   making functional the General Inspectorate for Finance (IGF); (iii) making
operational thejurisdictional function o fthe Auditor General by strengthening the number and capacity o f
financial auditors and improving their working conditions; (iv) making operational the budgetary and
financial Disciplinary Board by appointing its members and strengtheningtheir capacity; (v)
improvement o fthe integrated financial management system inplace to allow the productiono f periodic
reports on budget execution; (vi) reinforcement o fthe capacity o fthe line ministries inpublic financial
management, especially inthe implementation o fthe new program budget structure. To address these
issues, the Government has developed, since 2004, an annual priority action plan for public finance
reform which has been successfully implemented. Details o f implementationfor 2006 and challenges
ahead are provided insection V.B. above.


                               5. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

104.      The proposedcreditwill follow the Bank's disbursementproceduresfor development
policy support. Credit proceeds will be disbursedagainst satisfactory implementation o fthe development
policy program and not tied to any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once
the credit is approved by the Boardand becomes effective, the proceeds o fthe credit will be disbursed in
compliance with the stipulated single tranche release conditions. Once the Bank`s Board approves the
credit and at the request o fthe Borrower, IDA will disburse the proceeds o fthe credit into an account
designated by the Borrower that is part o fthe country foreign exchange reserves account at the Central
Bank o f Madagascar. The Borrower shall ensure that uponthe deposit o fthe Credit into said account, an
equivalent amount is credited inthe Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to
the Bank. Based on previous experience, the execution o f such transaction from the Central Bank to the
Treasury (Ministryo f Finance) doesn't require more than four days. The Borrower will report to the
Bank on the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account and credited inlocal currency to the
budget management system. While no external audit will be required it is expected that this written
confirmation will be signedo f f by both the Accountant General and the Auditor General, and will be
supported by a credit note from the Central Bank. Ifthe proceeds o fthe credit are used for ineligible
                                                     39

purposes (Le. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as defined inthe Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to promptly upon notice from IDA, refundan amount equal to
the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.
The administration ofthis credit will be the responsibility o fthe Ministryo fFinance. As required by law,
the Auditor General will carry the audit o f public accounts and submit the annual report to the Parliament
prior to the date o f its first session following the year o fthe review o fthese accounts by the General Audit
Office. IDA will have access to this report. IDA will also receive a copy o fthe annual financial
statements o f the Central Bank audited by an international audit firm in accordance with International
Auditing Standards, within six months after the endo feachfiscal year.


                                    6. RISKS AND R I S K MITIGATION

105.      The implementation o fthe poverty reductionstrategy inMadagascar continues to be exposed to
risks, many o f which were already identified in previous PRSC operations andthe CAS. The main risks
include:


 (a)     Politicalissues present a risk. The political situationinMadagascar is stable, solidified further
         by the transparent and peaceful Presidentialelections o fDecember 2006. Nevertheless, the
         possibility o fpolitical instability should not be discounted, especially given some o f the more
         difficult challenges that the country faces. The recent public demonstrations ina few o f the main
         cities to protest the continuing crisis inthe energy sector raise cause for concern and underscore
         the urgency with which some critical service delivery reforms needto be carried out.
         Furthermore, there are concerns that the Government's ambitious and initially fast-moving efforts
         on fighting corruption have stagnated recently. The aftermath o fthe elections present an
         opportunity to the populationto place extra pressure on the Government to deliver results which
         could ensure renewed vigor inimplementingreforms and poverty-reduction programs. The
         political leadership has a clear vision o f reform and is strongly committed to movingthe MAP
         agenda forward. The Bank's focus inthis regard continues to be on issues o ftransparency and
         anti-corruption, with the PRSC and the Governance and Institutional DevelopmentProject being
         the main instruments o f IDA support, and WBI playing a key role through various governance
         and capacity programs.
(b)       Reachingand maintainingthe economic growth targets laid out inthe MAP-while
         feasible will be difficult. Sustainable poverty reductiondepends on maintaininggrowth at high
                   -
         levels, attracting private investmentinto the labor-intensive manufacturingsector and into agro-
         businesses. The erosion o ftrade preferences and the expiration o f the MFA have already
         impactedthe growth o fthe textile sector inthe EPZ. Providing a favorable investment climate is
         crucial inthis regard inorder to attract higher levels o f FDI. The Investment Climate Assessment
         (ICA) outlines a set o f recommendations for mitigating this risk including accelerating reforms to
         improve competitiveness and attract private sector development. The recent establishment o fthe
         EDBMwill play a vital role infacilitating andpromotingdomestic and foreign investment. The
         Bank's Growth Poles Project is supporting some o f the ICA-recommendedreforms as well as the
         initial operation o fthe EDBM. IDA'SAAA program -- includingthe ICA, the 2005
         DevelopmentPolicy Review and the up-coming C E M -- focuses specifically on growth issues to
         assist the Government to prioritize and implement reforms.
(c)      Madagascarremainsvulnerable to externalshocks, particularly cyclones and increasesin
         globalcommodity prices,such as oil and rice. As detailed earlier, these shocks impact
         negatively on growth and poverty reduction. The Bank has supported the Government to finalize
         a Risk and Social Protection Review to assess risk prevention and mitigation strategies. Initial
         steps have beentaken to investigate the feasibility o f specific options for risk mitigation to the
         external shocks faced by Madagascar (e.g. weather risk insurance schemes). The Bank has also
         modified procedures for its Community DevelopmentProject (FID IV) to allow it to respond
         more rapidly to emergencies such as cyclones; the FY05 supplemental IDA credit for the FID
         project was delivered inresponse to the two cyclones o f 2004. Inaddition, new schools are being
                                                        40

     builtbetter and reconstruction o f damaged infrastructure is beingimproveduponto withstandthe
     effects o f cyclones. The Bureau National de Gestiondes Risques et des Catastropheshad its role
     andcompetencies formalized inDecember 2006 and is chargedwith managing programs to
     prevent crises and mitigatetheir impacts when they occur. Finally, the Government has made
     rice an important policy focus, with an emphasis on the entire rice value chain (production,
     distribution, marketing), and is also looking at policy options to better stabilize prices.
(d)  Maintaininga stable macroeconomicenvironment remains criticalto the successful
     implementationofthe MAP and the PRSCseries. The Government made significant progress
     in2005 and 2006 inmanagingthe highinflation inthe face o fcontinued highinternational prices.
     Nevertheless, further inflationary pressures caused by world price volatility will continue to
     present a challenge. Furthermore, the recent strong appreciation o fthe exchange rate and the
     continued pressure that will derive from the large mininginvestments, poses additional
     challenges for the Government as it will needto pay close attention to managing the
     macroeconomic effects o f this appreciation to avoid Dutch disease. The July 2006 agreement
     with the IMF on a new PRGFprogram is a key aspect inmanaging this risk. Inaddition, the
     Bank's investment portfolio supports Government to focus their efforts on dealing with
     improving the competitiveness o f the economy by adopting measures that increase productivity
     through buildingroads and other infrastructure, improving governance, health, education, and
     PFM, facilitating private sector development andthereby counterbalancing the potential negative
     impact o fthe appreciation on productive activities. Critical to these efforts is the successful
     completiono fthe restructuring plan o fthe electric and water power utility, JIRAMA, which is a
     fundamental element for the maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic environment given the
     negative repercussions onthe whole economy o f the persistent crisis. InJuly 2006, the Bank
     provided a first phase o ffinancing to support the JIRAMA restructuring and is working in
     collaboration with the IFCto find a suitable private sector concession arrangement (affermage).
(e)  Potentialdelaysinthe implementationof public finance reforms pose challengesand risks
     for improvedbasic service delivery. As detailed earlier, Madagascar has carried out an
     ambitious set o f budgetary reforms that are already yielding results. Nevertheless, a number o f
     key issues are worrisome such as a weak fiscal framework that overestimated revenues,
     unpredictable budget execution, capacity weaknesses in applying the new program budget
     structure, and poor reform coordination and M&E. The Government has recognized these issues
     and has laid out a priority action planfor 2007 that continues and deepens the reform program.
     Successful implementation o f this priority action plan will be critical to ensure real impact on
     service delivery and poverty reduction. The Bank continues to support the reforms proposed in
     the areas o f public finance, budget programming, procurement, institutional development and
     capacity buildingthroughthe PRSC and the Governance and Institutional DevelopmentProject.
     The Bank's on-going investment portfolio also focuses on institutionalstrengthening, training and
     capacity buildingat the sector level.

                         Annex 4: The World Banksupport to the GrowthAgenda.

1.        The Bank portfolioin support of the MAP growth agenda includes a significant number of
investment lendingoperations which encompass policy dialogue for reforms. As noted earlier, given
the breath and coverage of these activities, this PRSC series supports to the growth agenda by improving
the budget process, the overall governance environment and the human capital and general living standards
o f the population but does not include any specific policy actions directly related to growth. This annex
provides an overview o f the Bank's investment program; it reviews recent accomplishments and
summarizes the strategy set out in the new CAS for future support. The current and planned portfolio o f
Bank activities in support o f removing bottlenecks to investment and growth is presented in Table 1 below
where the overall Bank portfolio and AAA activities are portrayed against each o fthe M A P commitments.

2.         The existingBankportfoliocomprisesa series of projectsthat support progressinthree key
areas for growth: private sector development, transport and rural development and environment.
These projects contribute to the investment needs o f Madagascar and foster key sector reforms. The main
accomplishments o fthe last few years are summarized inTable 2.

PrivateSector Development.

3.         In recent years, steps havebeentakento improve the investment climate, implementpublic-
privatepartnerships(PPP), improveco-ordination of policiesand givevoice to the privatesector and
civilsociety, more broadly. GUIDE, the one-stop shop for enterprise creation, is being revamped and
placed under the newly established Economic Development Board o f Madagascar (EDBM) which itself is
being supported under the IDA-financed Growth Poles Project. The Second Private Sector Development
Project has supported the privatizationprocess although there have beenno new privatization transactions
since the sale o f H A S Y M A inJuly 2004. Management contracts for the public enterprises JIRAMA
(energy) and SIRAMA (sugar) are now inplace.

4.        However,reforminthe energy sector is stillslow and the JIRAMA situationremains
critical. InApril 2005, a two-year, IDA-fundedmanagementcontract took over responsibility for
JIRAMA. The Government implemented tariff increases in2006 and twice in2005 after tariffs remained
frozen from 2001 even though this was a period o f high inflation, sharp devaluation o f the local currency
and risingworld oil prices. After a history o f very limitednew investmentto increase power supply, while
demand has increased substantially, the Government is addressing JIRAMA's unsatisfactory operational
performance (i.e. highlosses and poor maintenance). A donor conference was held inParis inJanuary 2006
to secure financing for JIRAMA and the Government is now implementing a restructuring plan.

5.        The newly establishedEDBM,an investmentpromotionand businessfacilitationagency,
will function as an apex bodyfor privatesector development. The EDBMis being financed by the
Bank's IntegratedGrowthPolesProject(IG2P) which is in its second year of implementationand is
expected to increase private investments inthe three geographical growth poles (Nosy Be, Antananarivo-
Antsirabe, and Fort Dauphin) inthe key sectors o fthe economy. Along with infrastructure investments, the
IG2P provides support to improving the policy and regulatory regime and strengthening institutional
capacity to leverage private investments. A new Investment Law is being finalized and the existingZone
Franche legislation is beingimproved. The EDBMis also spearheading the investment climate reform
program and has successfully simplifiedthe business registration process reducing the number o f
procedures to register a businessfrom 10to 2 and the number o f days requiredfrom 21 to 5. Other reforms
are envisioned to improve Madagascar's ranking inthe Doing Business Indicators.

  Transport.

  6.         The transport sector, particularlythe roads program, plays a key role in Madagascar's
 growth and poverty alleviation strategy and is beingstrongly supported by the Bank's Transport
  SectorAPL 1-2-3 (the first phase ofwhich has already closed). InMadagascar, remoteness is associated
 with poverty, and improving access is critical for enhancing productivity inrural areas, improving access to
 social services and expanding accessto markets. InApril 2000, after almost ten years o f sector dialogue
  and very little investment, the country adopted a comprehensive transport sector policy which aims at: (i)
  focusing the Government's role on strategic planning, sector oversight and coordination; (ii)         creating
  agencies for sub-sector management and regulatory functions that are jointly controlledby the public and
 private sectors and gradually user-financed; (iii)    divesting operational activities to the private sector,
 through privatization and concessioning arrangements; (iv) developingthe local private sector for works
 design and execution; and (v) rehabilitating transport infrastructure to appropriate levels and ensuringtheir
 maintenance thereafter. This new sector policy allowed the Bank to more forward in 2000 with new
 transport lending-the 3 phase APL includingthe APL 2 Rural Transport and APL 3 Transport
 Infrastructure Projects which are still active.

                                                           71

7.          In recentyears the Governmentlaunchedan ambitious road rehabilitationand
maintenanceprogram(2003 -2008) with the objective to rehabilitateor provideperiodic
maintenancefor approximately2,000 km peryear. The roadnetwork consists o f about 25,100 kmo f
national and provincial roads o fwhich 5,600 kmare paved and 19,500 kmunpaved. Overall 32% o f the
network is ingood or fair condition and 66% o fthe paved roads are ingood condition. Since 2003, nearly
3,660 kmo f national and provincial roads have been improved. For rural roads, between 2003 and 2006,
about 3,386 kmwere improved. Regardingthe program financed by the Bank's RuralTransport APL2,
1,300km have been rehabilitated so far. To rationalize the management o fthe rural roads, Government has
created a rural roads unit which is part o fthe well-functioning Large Works Unit.Between2003 and 2006,
the Road Maintenance Fund(RMF) contracted for the maintenance o f an average o f 7,400 kmo f roads
annually, o f which 600km o frural roads. The organizational effectiveness o fthe RMF however needs to be
strengthened and its resource base needs to be enhanced. Currently the RMF collects about 30-40 percent
o f its financial needs andthese are increasing with the continuing improvement o fthe network.

8.          Institutionallythere has beenprogressinsetting up the autonomoussub-sector agencies
(the Maritime, PortsandRiverAgency (APMF) and The CivilAviation Agency (ACM); moreover
laws creatingthe RoadsAuthority(AR) and the Land TransportAgency (ATT) were ratifiedin2006,
and both entities are expectedto be operationalby mid-2007.Finally inFebruary2007 the Transport
sector was separated from the Public Woks, and two separate ministries are now incharge o f the two
sectors: the Ministry o f Transport and Tourism, and the Ministry o f Public Works and Meteorology: The
Ministryo fPublic Works is expected to focus onthe supervision o fthe huge roadprogram, while the
Ministryo fTransport oversees allother transport subsectors and allthe regulatory issues. The Government
is usingpublic-private partnerships for managing the transport infrastructure. Air Madagascar is operating
under a management contract. The Government liberalizedthe air transport access to the country, but the
impacts o f such policy have to be consolidated. The Transport Infrastructure Investment Project (APL3) has
been restructured to finance the investment program o f the Northern Railway which was concessioned in
2002 to Madarail. The main port o fToamasina, which handles more that 80 percent o fthe total traffic, has
beenrestructured with its container terminal concessioned. The operations o fthe secondary ports TulBar,
Mahajanga, and Antsiranana/Nosy Be/Ankify will be concessioned by mid-2007


RuralDevelopmentand Environment.

9.          The strategy laidout inthe MAP has a strong focus on environment and rural development.
Itenvisions Madagascar as a world leader inenvironmental best-practices andto become a green island
again, protecting its extraordinary environment. It commits to developing eco-tourism, agri-business,
sustainable farmingpractices, and industries based on organic and natural products which minimize
biodiversity damage and maximize benefits around the environment, on behalf o fthe nation and its people.

10.         To date several reforms have beenimplementedto foster this vision. The implementationo f
the Government's institutionalreform program for the Ministryo f Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries is
underway, aimed at supporting the decentralization process and improving the quality o f services. Re-
assignment o f staff and budget towards the regions continues to progress, with deconcentration o f
responsibilities to the RegionalDirectors for RegionalDevelopment(DRDR). Decentralization efforts are
also underway: the Ministry aims to establish district-level Agriculture Service Centers (CSAs) as a
consultative and service platform between farmers, private sector, NGOs and the Government. Two CSAs
have been piloted inItasy and Ambohimahasoa, and five more have started inother regions. The
Government has developed its Land Policy Letter which was validated by a wide range o f stakeholders in
February2005 and adopted on May 3,2005. Under the NationalLandProgram the Government has put in
place a land rights registration system based on the principles of: (i)
                                                                      decentralization o f the land
administration to the lowest level o f local government; (ii)improvement o f land tenure information; (iii)
simplifiedlandtenure legislation; and (iv) capacity building,through a learning-by-doing approach.
Activities had started in 5 communal guichetfonciers by end-2006, and 188 are envisaged in2007. The

Bank has completed a AAA on Land and Property RightsReviewwhich served as an inputto the National
Land Tenure Program.

11.         Foodsecurity and agricultureproductivityare beingstrengthenedthroughseveral means.
The Bank approved the Irrigation and Watershed Management APL inOctober 2006 to support the
implementation o fthe National Programo f Watershed Management and IrrigatedPerimeters Policy Letter.
Itis expected that this project will contribute significantly to the goal inthe MAPo fdoubling rice
production. The project also supports the promotion o f agriculture diversification and growth centers inthe
four sites where it is active (Alaotra, Itasy, Andapa, and Marovoay). The Bank's Rural Development
Support Project (PSDR) is a nation-wide project supporting farmers' associations through a small-grants
facility, technical assistance and market information systems. The project also supports improved planning
o f infrastructure in enclaved areas, a new rice observatory, a newly completed agriculture census and
diffusion o f agriculture price statistics. The Bank's AAA work has helped to define the new National
Strategy for Reduction o f Risks and Catastrophes. Market development is being promoted through public-
private partnerships (PPPs), the strengthening o f professional organizations such as the recently created
Rice Platform (PC Riz) and Fertilizer Platform, the Seeds Task Force and Dairy Board, adoption o f a new
Fertilizer Policy, promotiono f agriculture growth centers inmajor potentialareas and reinforcement o f
quality standards (namely through the Aquatic Surveillance Agency, ASH).

12.         The Governmenthas continuedto expand its nationalSystemof ProtectedAreas (SAPM),
now at 3,850,000 ha. The SAPM is expected to attain 6 million haby 2012 (about 10% o fthe national
territory). The Foundation for Protected Areas was established inJanuary 2006 to help finance the SAPM.
The NationalEnvironmental Program-supported by the Bank's ThirdEnvironment Project - is now inits
thirdphase. Thisprogram focuses on strengthenedforestry and environmental governance. The
Government has strengthenedits forest exploitation adjudication system, by publishingthe status o f forest
exploitationpermits innewspapers. A Forestry Observatory and a mobile control unit are now operational.
Miningand forest concessions have beenfrozen inthe new systemo fProtected Areas o fMadagascar. Fire
monitoring committees have beencreated and are beingstrengthened at commune level. The decree
making the Ofice Nationalpour I 'Environnement (ONE) the one-stop shop for enforcing the MECIE
(National EnvironmentalImpact) law passed inFebruary 2005. The Ministrywill also be realigning
forestry and environmental regionalunits with each o fthe 22 regions, to help mainstream environmental
concerns with regional plans and strengthenthe efficiency o f forestry operations

BankProgramfor NextFiveYears

13.         Lookingforward, the CAS presentsthe mix of investmentinstrumentsaimed at the
removalof bottlenecksto investmentand growth inboth ruraland urbanareas. The specific
objectives o fthe planned portfolio can be summarized as follows: (i)    eliminate barriers to access domestic
and international markets; (ii)  improve access to finance and factor markets; (iii) regulatory burden
                                                                                     reduce
and foster competitionand (iv) achieve sustainable development and minimize the impact o f shocks. A
substantial program o f AAA activities provides the necessary analytical underpinnings.

     Eliminate the barriers to access domestic and international markets. To achieve this objective, the
     Bank's programwill complement existing projects - Growth Poles Project (FY06), Watershed and
     Irrigation APL (FY07), andthe two transport operations -with: (i)     technical assistance to build
     Government capacity and to helpproducers adopt improved quality standards under the ongoing Trade
     IntegratedFramework Program; (ii)      new investments in irrigation infrastructure, marketing support and
     other services to increase agriculturalproductivity and diversification; and (iii)support to policy
     reforms and investments intransportation -roads, railways, ports, etc. Indoing so, it will place special
     emphasis on the sustainability o fthe investments (for example, roadmaintenance rather than road
     construction) and on involving the private sector through public-privatepartnerships. Finally, the
     programwill continue to emphasize lowering air transport and telecommunication costs and improving
     accessibility through an open sky policy and upgrades to the telecommunications sector. Key projects


                                                       73

include new planned transport and growth operations and the recently approved regional
communication infrastructure (EASSY) project.

Improve access tofinance andfactor markets. IDA, incollaboration with other donors, will increase its
support to the financial sector, addressing bottlenecks that are preventing the emergence o f a financial
services industry that meets the needs o f all market segments, from microfinance to large enterprises.
This will include (i) provision o ftechnical assistance to improve the supervision and regulatory
                      the
framework, payment and credit information systems, and the institutional capacity o f the sector; (ii)
continue to facilitate access to credit and other financial services including such emerging areas as
guarantees and leasing; and (iii) continue assistingthe Government to develop the strategy and
programs for scaling up and expanding coverage o fthe financial sector interventions usinga sector
wide approach with other donors. The microfinanceproject recently benefitedfrom 45 million in
additional financing to provide bridge financing untilthe multi-donor financial sector wide support is in
place. The Bank Group will continue its efforts at improving the situation inthe energy sector with
other partnersand will work together with the Government on a concession arrangement for the power
company JIRAMA and on attracting private agents to generate and sell electricity. Key projects
include: the Energy and Water Adaptable ProgramLoan 1&2 and an IFC-IDA Partial Risk Guarantee
for public-private partnership investments in hydropower. Additionally, MIGA intends to support its
second guarantee inthe energy sector inFY08.

Reduce regulatory burden andfoster competition. The new Bank program will continue to assist the
Government's efforts to improve its business climate andbringinhigher levels o f FDI.This will
include continued assistance to the Economic Development Board and other agencies to improve the
regulatory environment, achieve greater transparency inissuinglicenses and concessions (especially in
mining,fishing, tourism, and forestry), and improve the quality o fgovernance inextractive industries,
includingthe country's joining o fthe Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiative (EITI). A key
objective is to balance the economic potential inthese sectors with sustainable development. The
instruments will include the ongoing and new Growth Poles projects, the Mineral Resources
Governance Project, and the Governance and InstitutionalDevelopmentprojects.

Achieve sustainable development and minimize the impact of shocks. IDA will buildon the progress
made so far to preserve Madagascar's unique natural environment by supportingthe expansion o f the
System o f Protected Areas o f Madagascar to 6 millionhectares. It will encourage development o f a
concession policy to engage the private sector in managing the protected areas. Inaddition, the Bank
will helpthe Government develop nationalcapacity to increase the country's resilience to frequent
natural calamities. Duringthe CAS period, implementation o fthe Government's strategy inthis area
will beginon a pilot basis. The Bank Group will start with reinforcingclimate modeling, developing
climate-proofstandards and adhering to them in its own projects. It will also help the Government
assess the feasibility o f a RiskInsurance Scheme and its piloting. The ongoing as well as a follow-on
project inthe environment sector, together with Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects and
analytical and advisory activities, will support these efforts.

                  Annex 5: The Sector Wide Approach in Education, Healthand Water.

1.       This Annex provides background informationon the Sector Wide Approaches (SWAP) currently
under implementationinMadagascar and supported by this PRSC operation inthe Education, Health, and
Water and Sanitation sectors.

Education

2.       Donorsupport to the primary educationsector inMadagascaris formalizedaround the
Educationfor AWFast Track Initiative. In2003, the Government prepared a Strategic Planfor the
Reform and Development o f the EducationSector along with a detailed plan o f action for Educationfor All
(EFA),which covers the first nine grades o fschool (called "Education Fondamentale"),with concrete
proposals for achievingthe target o f universal completion o fthe primary cycle (grades 1-5). Following
local donors' endorsement o fthe updated EFA National Action Plan inApril 2005, the Steering Committee
o f the EFA-Fast Track Initiative (FTI) secretariat agreed to provide interim grants from the Catalytic Fund
to bridgethe financing gaps for three years for Madagascar (US$lO million for 2005, US$25 million for
2006 and US$25 million for 2007). These additional grants are provided on the understanding that
Government will continue to increase its budgetary allocations to primary education (usingown resources
and aid from budgetary support programs/HIPC funds) and are not meant to substitute for them. The World
Bank has provided continued support for initiating and sustaining these processes, including the supervision
o fthe Catalytic Fundgrant. A new planwill be submitted to the EFA secretariat by March 2008 to obtain a
new release o f funds for the period 2008-2010.

3.       A joint review mechanism,led by the Ministry, has beenset up for monitoringthe
implementationof the EFA plan.Twice a year, ajoint mission o fthe Ministry and the donors is organized
leading to a Joint Donor Report (JDR). The report is an essential requirement for disbursement o fthe
Catalytic Funds as well as additional bilateralfunds. The two joint donor missions are the only formal
process o f review and supervision o f Government activities.

4.       Government and donors have agreedona specific processfor the preparationofthese
reviews. One month before the mission, the Ministryo fEducationprovides a reportthat reviewsprogress
inprimary education and meets the essential informationrequirements o fall partners. The report covers the
following areas: (i) overall progress inthe EFA implementation with an analysis o fthe agreed performance
indicators, (ii)financial analysis o f the EFA plan including specific information on the use o f both domestic
and external resources; (iii)progress inimplementation o f activities to improve access (e.g. construction,
teachers recruitment) and quality (e.g. training, learningheaching methods, student learningoutcomes,
textbooks), (iv) the management system(budget management, school management, decentralization) and
(v) follow up on the recommendations o fthe previous review. A separate section investigates a specific
topic chosen inthe course o fthe previousjoint donor review. The Joint Donor Report provides an
assessment o f implementation progress and constraints, based on the Ministry's report, interactions with
senior managers and technical staff o fthe Ministry and field visits to districts and schools.

5.       Inaddition,coordinatedtechnical assistanceis provided by the partnerson issues such as
budget management (budget preparation and execution), policy changes (conditional cash transfer
feasibility analysis and school nutrition program design) and impact assessments o f recent reforms.

6.       Overall,this processhas strengthened the Ministry of Educationinits role of donors'
coordinator. For the implementation o fthe EFA Plan, the "Unit6 d 'Appui Technique- UAT' has been
created inside the Ministryo f Education and it manages additional external funds for the EFA plan,
excluding project funding. Thejoint reviews are also the occasion for reaching agreements among the
partners on greater harmonisation and alignment.

Health

7.       The MAP setsvery ambitioustargets inthe areas of maternaland childmortalityand fertility
rate, malaria,tuberculosis, sexually transmitteddiseases and HIV/AIDS control; and reduction of
malnutritioninchildrenunder the age offive. To achieve these objectives, it proposes a multisectoral
approach and recognizes the importance o f system and institutionstrengthening.

8.       The Ministry ofHealthand FamilyPlanninghasstartedto putin placethe necessary
elementsfor an integratedapproach to meet the challengesinthe sector and has completed the
elaboration o f its PDSS, which represents the cornerstone o fthe whole SWAP it intends to achieve. The
Health SWAP seeks to improve healthfinancing, delivery and management through a programmatic
approach.

9.       The MOHPF has establishedand agreed uponan AnnualWork Programincooperationwith
financing and implementingpartners,consistent with the policy framework outlined inthe PDSS and an
estimated resource envelope for the following year. The Annual Programalso foresees appropriate technical
assistance, training and institution strengthening measures to support the full integration o f planningand
managerial functions into the existingcore Government agencies. A Memorandum o f Understanding signed
by the Government and its development partnerspoolingtheir resources outlines organizational,
institutional and coordination arrangements for implementationand the roles and responsibilities o f each
partner.

10.      Bi-annualhealthsummitswill be held and led by the Ministry of Healthwith the
participationof all stakeholders and developmentpartnersaswell as representativesfrom civil
society, privatesector and other relevant ministries.Progress onthe nationalprogramwill be reviewed
duringthese summits andwill provide input into the Annual Work Programfor the Ministry.These
Summits will also allow evaluation o f progress towards achievingthe development objectives and the
MDGs.Moreover, these discussions will be usedto fine-tune the project andthe programto changes that
mightoccur inthe sector andto coordinate, at atechnical level, with all partners. Donors will adjust their
actual allocations based on the bi-annualjoint reviews by Government and its development partners inthe
health sector and based on the Government's Annual Work Program.

11.      The Madagascar HealthSWAP hasa strong focus on strengthening all aspects of health
systems, includingproduction, financing, delivery, stewardship and governance.The achievement o f
the goals o fthe sector wide programwill, inter alia, include reduction inmaternal, child and infant
mortality, fertility rate, chronic malnutrition inchildren under the age o fthree, HIV prevalence, and
prevalence o f syphilis inpregnant women. The successful adoption o fthe SWAP is expected to yield a
number o fother development benefits as well, includingstronger country ownership and leadership, and
greater focus on results. In addition, the SWAP process will encourage and foster coordinated and open
policy dialogue, guide allocationo f resources based on priorities, and facilitate scaling-up o f benefits to the
entire sector. It will also enhance sector-wide accountability with common fiduciary standards, and
strengthenthe country's capacity, systems and institutions.

Water and Sanitation

12.      Since 1999,the Governmenthas successfully developedthe legal, institutionaland policy
frameworkto support its ruralwater supply and sanitation sector (RWSS). The RWSS sector is
moving progressively towards a sector wide approach. A series o f actions were undertaken by the
Government as buildingblocks for the SWAP.

13.      The Water Law was promulgatedinJanuary 1999 and bylawsand decrees approved in2003,
a remarkableachievementina four-year period.As part o fthe implementation o fthe Water Law,
ANDEA (the nationalwater resource agency) and SOREA (the water regulatory agency) have beencreated.
They are attachedto the Prime Minister's office, but operate underthe auspices o fMEM. The Government

                                                      76

has successfully tested with the support o f communities, private sector and NGOs, the service delivery
arrangements to expand sustainable and cost effective water supply, inparticular with the Bank financed
RWSS pilot project (closed in2005).

14.      The WSS sector policy and implementationstrategy was formulatedafter involvingall major
stakeholders.Itbecame in2005 the "Euu Pour Tous" (Water for All) policy paper usedto marketthe
sector's best practices along with a Water for All documentary financed by UNICEF. That ledto the
national WSS program (PNAEPA) aimed at reaching the MDGfor the water and sanitation sector which
was endorsed by the Government inJune 2005. This document now forms the basis for the urban and rural
WSS sectors action plans that the Government envisages to finance by a mix o f external financing and
internalresources. The Government has drafted and disseminated a manual o f procedures for implementing
and managing o f rural WSS projects to be usedby all stakeholders inorder to improve quality o f
construction and sustainability o fthe service. A sound monitoring and evaluation system i s under
development and will be usedto measure sector progress.

15.      The overallimplementationof the PNAEPA continuessatisfactorily. DEA/MEMcontinues to
lead the work o f the sector wide approach inclose collaboration with other donors (AfDB, EU, JICA,
WaterAid, UNICEF, USAID) to increase its absorptive execution capacity. More specifically, on-going
activities support the sector: 1) strengtheningthe medium term results oriented program budget planning
process inorder to increase sector execution capacity, public expendituresefficiency, and monitoring and
evaluation; 2) harmonizingstakeholders' approaches; 3) increasingresponsibility and resources to
deconcentratedlevels as well as to regions and communes indecision making for programming and
supervising o f service delivery; 4) increasing support to sanitation and hygiene promotion to maximize
health benefitsfor the populationand 5) promoting innovative water service delivery mechanism using
local Public Private Partnership, where halfo f the capital investment is provided to local governments
(mostly by supplyingpipes, equipment and meters) and where private operators and community/local
government provide the remaining 50 percent and sign a medium term management contract for the service

16.      Stakeholderscoordinationhas reallyimprovedover the past2-3 years. First, through the
activities o fthe WASH committee (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) which includes all sector donors and
stakeholders as well as the Ministry o f Health, the Ministryo f Educationand other multi-sector projects or
organisms, such as FID and ACORDS. And second through the directorate o f water/donors regular
meetings to discuss the budget process and the sector's Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
Joint Government/donors reviews are held every year to formulate an action plan for the coming year and
assess progress on the actions agreed onthe previous review. The annual water and sanitation review has
been institutionalized in 2005 to offer the opportunity to review, through a participative approach, sector
performance, past DEA program budget execution and address key sector issue and make recommendations
to remediate sector weaknesses. About one hundredpeople participated inthis event, from the Government,
donors' community, NGOs, private sector, mayors, and heads o f region. The first one was organized in
June 2005, the second one inApril 2006 and the third inMarch 2007.

             Annex 6: MadagascarJoint World BankIMFDebt SustainabilityAnalysis

Madagascar'srisk of debt distress is low. The upgrading of Madagascar's risk of debt distress rating
comparedto theprevious debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is on account of the improvedgrowth
and exportprospects linked to the big miningprojects under construction.Madagascar's external
debt burden indicators under the baselinescenarioremain below the relevantpolicy-dependent
indicative thresholds.Thestress tests do not result in indicators breaching the thresholds although
they reveal that external debt sustainability is sensitiveto export shocks, which are likely given the
concentrationof Madagascar exports. The inclusion in the analysis of the small domestic debt does
not change the assessment of countryS. risk of debt distress.

A. Introduction

1.       This DSA has beenpreparedjointly by IMFand World Bankstaff. It is based on the
framework for low-income countries approved by the respective Executive Boards. The framework
takes into account indicativethresholds for debt burden indicators determined by the quality of the
country's policies and institutions.' It comprises o f a baseline scenario (which assumes, among
others, full delivery o f HIPC Initiative debt relief by external creditors) and a set o f alternative
scenarios.

B. RecentDevelopmentsand Current Debt Situation

2.       Madagascar reachedits completion pointunder the EnhancedHIPC Initiativein
October2004. The resultingdebt relief, including additionalbilateraldebt relieffrom most Paris
Clubcreditors, reduced the end-2003 NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio to an estimated 137 per~ent.~              4At
that time, the ratio was projected to increase to 154 percent in2004 and decline thereafter.

     of end-2006, Madagascarhas estimatedUS$595 million inarrearstowards non-ParisClub and private
creditorsthat are not delivering HIPC debt relief(Algeria, Libya, and Iraq are the largest accountingfor 92
percent ofthe total). Madagascar continuesto make efforts to contactthese creditors, regularize the payments,
and obtain full.debtreliefunderthe HIPC Initiative.

  Total debt reliefto Madagascar underthe Initiative amounts to US$836 million inNPV terms.

  Most ParisClub creditorshave written-off their outstanding claims after full delivery o fHIPC debt relief,
reducingclaims on Madagascar by further US$466million inNPV terms. In2006, Swedenand Israel canceled
100percentofthe Malagasydebt. Inaddition an agreementwas finalized with Japan and an agreement is under
discussionwith the FederationofRussia. Regardingnon-ParisClub creditors, cancellation agreementsshould
be finalized soon with Abu Dhabiand the People's Republic of China.

3.      Madagascar's externalpublic debt declinedsignificantly from US$3.5 billionat end
2005 (including arrears) to US$1.6 billionat end 2006 on the account of the debt relief under
MDRI.The IMF's debt reliefunder the MDRIbecame effective inJanuary 2006 and amounts to
US$197 milli~n.~    MDRIdebt relieffrom IDA was implemented starting inJuly 2006 throughthe 100
percent reductiono fthe debt disbursed as o f end-2003 that was still outstanding at the
implementation date. Total MDRIdebt service relief from IDA is estimated at SDRl.2 billion
(equivalent to about US$1,780.1 million).6 As for the ADF, the delivery o f debt reliefunder the
MDRIthoughawrite-off ofthe outstanding obligations as ofend-December 2004 became effective
inSeptember 2006 (withretroactive application to January 2006). Estimated MDRIdebt relieffrom
the ADF amounts to US$393 million. This has beenpartly offset by new borrowings as well as
exchange rate developments7, and the actual outstanding stock o f debt has declined by 55 percent in
2006.

4.      The MDRI debt relief hastriggered a drastic changeinthe creditor composition. The
share o f multilateral creditors has decreased from more than 75 percent at end-2005 to 53 percent at
end-2006. Conversely, bilateral and commercialcreditors represented 47 percent o ftotal outstanding
obligations (with Paris Club creditors accounting for 7 percent), compared to about 23 percent by
end-2005. The bilateralParis Club debt that remains is mainly to Russia. The current creditor
composition is broadly similar to the one prevailing at end-2003, i.e. prior to the debt write-offs
granted by most Paris Club and the MDRIdebt relief.




 See www.imf.org for detailsonthe implementationo f the MDRIby the IMF. The amount o f relief includes
undisbursedHIPCassistance from theFund, previouslyexpectedto bedeliveredover time, andMDRI
assistance.Excludingthe HIPCshare, the MDRIdebtreliefamountsto US$ 186 million.
 For details onthe implementationofthe MDRIby IDA, see IDNSecM2005andIDNSecM2006-0131.

C.BaselineMedium- and Long-Term Scenario

5.      The baselinescenario is substantially differentto the one describedinthe previousDSA
due to the impactof two largeminingprojects.Constructionof a US$650million (12 percent o f
GDP) ilmenite mine began inmid-2006 and a US$2.5 billion (45 percent of GDP) nickel and cobalt
mine and processingfacility commenced in2007 and will be completedover the next 3 years. Such a
large inflow of capital is leadingto an appreciationofthe currency andthe project will result in
higher growthand starting in2009/10 inhigher exports (Box 1) than inthe previous DSA.

6.      The baselinescenario is builton a numberof key macroeconomicassumptions,the
implementationof sound macroeconomicand structuralpoliciesand externalfinancing that is
through grants and highly concessionalloans.Key macroeconomicassumptions are indicatedin
Box 1.With respect to externalfinancing, new borrowing is projectedto remain largely at highly
concessionalterms. External assistance as a share of GDP, which hadclimbed very rapidly to close to
14percentin2004 due to large inflows o f externalaid andborrowing to finance recovery after the
2002 political crisis, will remainrelatively high inthe short term (increasingfrom 8 percentofGDP
in2005 to 11percent ofGDP in2006, inpart dueto externalfinancing ofthe presidentialelection,
and 9 percent in2007 basedon recent information from donors) and gradually decreaseto about 6
percentof GDP by the end of the projectionperiod. The borrowing is largely for financing
infrastructureprojectsaimedat lowering costs and enhancingcompetitiveness, andto help
Madagascar attainthe objectivesofthe Madagascar Action Plan(MAP) andthe Millennium
DevelopmentGoals (MDGs).

7.      Underthe baselinescenario, Madagascar'sexternaldebt indicatorsremainwell below
the thresholds throughout the projectionperiod (Figure l a and Table la). The debt indicators
droppedsharply in2006 as a result ofthe MDRI(Table la). The NPV ofdebt-to-GDPratio which
was at about 36 percent in20058(a level alreadybelow the thresholdfor mediumperformers)
droppedto below 12percentin2006 (Figure 1a andTable la); it increases subsequently to peak at 16
percentin2017 anddrops after to about 13 percent inthe outer years. The NPV of debt-to-revenue
ratios(Tables2a) exhibit a similar profile. The increase inthese ratios inthe initialyears (from the
low post-MDRI levels) reflects relatively high new borrowing albeit at concessionalterms to finance
neededinvestment expenditures.The NPV o f debt-to-exportsis driven by the impact of the big
mining projects. Beforethey start their exports, these projects are expected to leadto an appreciation
ofthe exchange rate that will negativelyimpact competitivenessof exports. This inconjunctionwith
the weak performance of agricultural prices of key exports, such as vanilla, leads to a deteriorationof
debt indicatorsbasedon exports upto 2009. The miningprojects are expected to start exporting in
end-2009or in2010. The value ofthese exportsis so largethat the NPV of debt-to-exportratio is
projectedto drop from 61 percent in2009 to 38 percent in2010 and grow throughthe projected
period (but remainingwell below the threshold) due to new borrowing. The debt service-to-exports
ratio exhibits a similar pattern. Moreover, giventhe highly concessionalnature ofthe existing debt
andnew borrowing, the debt serviceratiosare well below the indicative thresholdsthroughout the
projection period but show a risingtrend due to the accumulationof new debt.

8.       Madagascar's total public debt ratios, includingdomesticdebt, alsostaywell below the
externaldebt sustainability thresholds under the basecase scenario (Figure 2a and Table 2a). The
domestic debt is projectedto remainunder 10percentof GDP throughthe projection period, as total
expenditure is assumedto be broadly kept incheck with available financing from tax revenue and

external assistance, and the fiscal deficit is projected to remainpredominantly financed by external
assistance on concessionalterms.

D.SensitivityAnalysis

Externalpublic debt indicators

9.       The sensitivity analysissuggests that the externaldebt indicators are low butcould
deterioratewith inappropriatepolicies, and/or ifconfrontedby adverse shocks. They would
however remainbelowthe threshold?

0   The debt indicators inthe historicalscenario (Scenario A1 inFigure 1A and Table l b based on
the average o fthe years 1999-2006) follow a lower trajectory than under the baseline. It should be
noted, however, that the years leading upto 2006 include years o f political turmoil, large terms o f
trade shocks, cyclones, and natural disasters. Duringthat period, although real growth averaged only
about 3.5 percent, the current account deficit was also low as the Export Processing Zone sector (put
inplace in1989) was growing at very highrates. This factor explains the relatively benigntrajectory
o fthe debt indicators under the historic scenario. Ifthe years o f the political crisis (GDP decline o f
12.7 percent in2002) and the recovery from this (growth o f 9.8 percent in2003) are excluded, the
average growth is significantly higher at 5 percent, which remains below the baseline scenario but
close to it ifthe impact o fthe bigminingprojects is excluded.

0   The financingscenario (Scenario A2) reveals that Madagascar's external debt indicators are
sensitive to the terms o f new borrowing. Under this scenario, the N P V o f debt-to-GDP remains below
the threshold but would more than double inthe next decade (from 11percent in2007 to 23 percent
in2017), andremains at about that levelthrough2021before decreasing slightly.The NPV o fdebt-
to-exports ratio would increase steadily from 46 percent in2007 to 101 percent in2027. This increase
is substantial although the ratio would remain below the threshold. The projected path o f these two
ratios, together with the risingtrendo f the debt service ratio from 2 to 6 percent duringthe projection
period, points to risks from new borrowing at less favorable terms than assumed inthe baseline
scenario."

0   The boundtests do not revealmajor underlyingvulnerabilities.The most extreme stress tests
shows the impact o fthe combined FDIand growth shock on the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio (Scenario
BS), and exports shock (Scenario B2)onthe NPV o fdebt-to exports ratio do not result inindicators
significantly breaching thresholds. These scenarios show that debt sustainability i s most vulnerable to
changes inthe inflows o f FDIand to the impact o fthese projects on growth and exports. The NPV o f
debt-to-GDP increases significantly (to 26 percent in2027) but remains comfortably below the
threshold level. Onthe other hand, the export based indicator-the NPV o f debt to exports, crosses the
threshold in2009 only but falls back below the threshold as soon as the exports o fthe two bigmining
projects materialize. The shock to exports is somewhat extreme (the standard deviation i s about 33


9The stress tests performedunderthe sensitivity scenario assumed permanentmodifications of key baseline
assumptions ("alternative scenarios") as well as temporary deviations ("bound tests"). The "alternative
scenarios" include a "historical scenario", underwhich the mainvariablesthat determinethe debt dynamics are
assumed to remain at their historical average, and a"financing scenario" that depictsthe impact of lower
concessionality in new borrowing. The "bound tests" are designed to examinethe impact on debt and debt
serviceindicators of shocks, basedon the country's historical volatility, to key variables.
loThis scenario is similar to asharp decline ingrant financing, comparedto the baseline, compensated by loans.

percent) as it is influencedby the rapid increase in exports inthe historical period from textiles
exports, andthe largedecline inexportsthat took placeduring the political crises andthe subsequent
rapidrecovery. The implications of export concentrationfor vulnerability are nevertheless to be
noted, as they illustratethe impact of shocks to certain export commodities (such as textiles), which
have become large as a share of total exports inMadagascar (about 40 percent in2005 and 2006), as
well as the exportsof only two mining projectsthat are expectedto accountfor over 50 percentof
exports of goods and services over 2011-2017.However, the vulnerabilities associated with the big
mining projectsappear limited: even ifthe exports ofthe bigminingprojects are only 1/3 of their
baseline level (due either to a lower volume andor to lower export prices) the NPV ofdebt-to-exports
would remainbelow the threshold(scenarioB7)peakingat 71 percentin2022 (61 percent inthe
baseline).

Total public debt indicators

10.      Total public debt indicators are mostsensitiveto economic growthshocks.A temporary
or permanent deviationfrom the baselinereal GDP growth pathwould bring the total public debt
beyondthe externaldebt sustainability thresholds beginningin2015, if spendingplans were kept
unchanged, which is unlikely inview of past experience (Table 2b, ScenariosA3 and Bl).

E.DebtDistressClassificationand Conclusions

11.      Madagascar's riskof debt distressis low followingthe debt reliefunder the HIPC
Initiativeand the MDRIand due to the impacton exportsand GDP of bigminingprojects.In
the baselinescenario Madagascar's debt indicators are belowthe thresholds.The debt situationdoes
not appear to be significantly vulnerableto shocks. Debt sustainability appears somewhat vulnerable
iflargeexportshocksmaterialize.This is ariskinthemediumtermgiventhe highconcentrationin
exports intextiles inthe shortrunandtwo mining productswhose prices are volatile.

12.      In conclusion,the debt situation seems under control and not subjectto major risks.
Sensitivity analysisnonethelesspoints to the neednot only for implementingthe policies
underpinningthe baseline scenario, but also for careful monitoring of borrowingpolicies and, more
importantly, export performance.The latter is critical giventhe concentrationof exports intextiles
and clothing inthe short runand intwo mining projectsstartingin2010. Borrowingat non-
concessionalterms as well new borrowingbeyondthe levelsassumedunderthe baselinecould also
raiseMadagascar's riskof debt distress.

                            Box 1.Baseline MacroeconomicAssumptions

RealGDP growthis projected at 7 percent over 2007-2027. This growth rate is higherthan the
historical average (5 percent over 1999-2006 ifthe impact o f the political turmoil o f 2002 is
excluded) due to the impact o f two large miningprojects that started at the end o f 2006. Without
these projects, the real growth rates would have beena little under 6 percent on average i.e. higher
but close to the historicalrate.

Inflationas measured by the GDP deflator indollar terms is projected to average about 3.7
percent, with higher rates o f 20 percent in2007 and decelerating to 2 percent subsequently.
However, reflectingthe impact o fthe large inflows o f FDIon the exchange rate,which inturn
will depend crucially o fthe monetary policy undertaken, the increase inthe GDP deflator inlocal
currency is expected to decelerate from 9.5 percent in2007 to 5 percent beginning in2010.

Exportvolumes grow at 11percent on average and support GDP growth. The growth rates are
relatively modest inthe initial years reflectingthe impact o fthe exchange rate appreciation on
some vulnerable export industries such as textiles and shrimp but willjump as soon as the exports
o f the bigminingprojects start.

Import volumes average about 7 percent for the period. Import volumes are expectedto grow
significantly due to the highimport content (estimated at about 80 percent) o fthe miningprojects
duringtheir construction phase andwill then slow down to about 6.5 percent i.e. at about the pace
o f real GDP growth.

The current account deficitis projectedto increase significantly duringthe initial years o fthe
projections due to the large increase in imports relatedto the bigminingprojects. However as
exports o f these projects start, the current account deficit would gradually shrink from about 20
percent o f GDP in2008 to 9 percent by 2010 and 5 percent by the end o fthe projection period.

Tax revenuesare projectedto increase from 10.7 percent o fGDP in2006 to about 15.5 percent o f
GDP in2027, owing to the termination o f ad hoc tax and import duty exemptions, tax policy
reforms aimed at simplifyingthe corporate and personal income tax regimes, and steadfast
improvements intax and custom administration.

Totalexpendituresare broadly kept incheck with available financing from tax revenue and
external assistance, resulting in a roughly constant share o f GDP over the projection period.

Externalassistanceprogressively unwindsfrom the exceptionally highlevel o fabout
11percent o fGDPreachedduringthe period 2004 to 2006 (financing o frecovery after the 2002
political crisis and o f the 2006 presidential elections) to over 7 percent o f GDP over 2007-201 1
(which is slightly higher than the 6 percent o f GDP observed duringthe late 1990s because o f
donor financing o fthe MAP) and to 5 percent o f GDP inouter years. The share o f grants
gradually increases from half inthe initial years to more than halfinthe later years.

         Monsieur le President,


1.       L a Republique de Madagascar a lance depuis le dCbut de cette annde 2007 la mise en ceuvre du
Madagascar Actions Plan (MAP), la seconde gCnBration de sa stratCgie de lutte contre la pauvrete.
Prenant la relbve du Document de StratCgie de RCduction de la PauvretC (DSRP), le MAP est la
diclinaison de la vision    Madagascar Naturellement >> pour les cinq annBes ivenir. L e MAP traduit
aussi la concretisation par le Gouvermement malgache des Objectifs du Millhaire pour le
DCveloppement. Capitalisant les acquis du DRSP, le MAP a CtC Clabore selon un processus largement
participatif. Sa mise en ceuvre connait aussi le mdme processus au niveau de regions et des districts. Les
objectifs fixes par le MAP sont tres ambitieux et le gouvernement entend mettre en ceuvre des reformes
en profondeur pour les atteindre.

2.       L'achevement du DSRP, mis en ceuvre de 2003 a 2006, a permis a Madagascar de jeter les bases
d'une Bconomie a croissance solide et rapide. Avec les reformes entreprises durant cette periode,
Madagascar a pu atteindre un niveau de croissance et de developpement nettement supCrieur a la
moyenne des annees passees. En effet, sans compter l'effet de la reprise en 2003, le taux de croissance
Bconomique a atteint une moyenne annuelle de 5,0% pendant les trois ans. Cette performance
Cconomique, combin6e aux rkalisations des finances publiques, dCcrites dans le paragraphe suivant, a
permis de diminuer le taux de pauvretC de 72,O % en 2002 a 67,0% en 2006.

3.       Avec une croissance moyenne de 7,5 % par an, le secteur tertiaire a BtB le principal moteur de la
croissance. L e secteur secondaire quijouait un r61e important jusqu'en 2004, a connu un ralentissement
relatif (6,0% de croissance moyenne annuelle). L a performance du secteur tertiaire a et6 dopCe par la
rdalisation de diverses infrastructures financde par les investissements publics, la croissance de la branche
((Biitiment et Travaux publics >> a cru en moyenne de 23,0% par an pendant les quatre dernieres annCes.
L e secteur primaire reste unDelmajeur car la branche Agriculture D, qui fait vivre une grande partie de
                                                          ((
la population, n'a connu qu'une croissance moyenne de 3,3% sur les quatre dernieres annCes.

4.       MalgrC la volatilitC de la conjoncture internationale marquee par la hausse du prix du parole et 1'
effondrement des prix de produits de base, les grands Bquilibres internes et externes ont pu Btre


                                                      90

maintenus. Ainsi, les recettes fiscales ont subi une diminution durant les deux dernibres anndes a cause de
la baisse des importations, le deficit budgktaire a Btk contenu a moins de 4,O % du PIJ3 grdce a une gestion
rigoureuse des dkpenses publiques. MalgrB une politique d'encadrement monetaire trbs stricte, la
progression de la masse monktaire globale a BtB de 25% en 2006. Et le dkficit de la balance commerciale
s'est stabilise grdce a une politique de change visant la promotion de l'exportation. L a maitrise de
l'inflation a et6 cependant marquke par quelques ddfaillances a cause de l'insufisance de l'offre int6rieure
due aux cataclysmes naturels notamment en 2004 (cyclones) et en2006 (skcheresse dans le sud dupays).

5.       Les rkalisations les plus importantes du DRSP concernent la mise en place &infrastructures de
base qui va permettre de jeter une croissance plus rapide dans le proche futur. L'infrastructure routibre
praticable du pays a ktk multiplike au moins par quatre. L a rehabilitation de l'infrastructure routibre
concerne aussi bien la consolidation des grands axes structurant tels que les routes nationales No1, 1 bis,
4, 5, 6, 7 et 44 que les pistes des zones males. Une augmentation importante des Cchanges intkrieurs du
pays qui entrainera en consequence une augmentation de la production surtout dans le milieu rural est
attendue de cette extension du rkseau routier. D'un autre cote, la gestion du premier port international du
pays a et6 profondkment restructurke de manibre a repondre aux exigences de standard international et
ameliorer son efficacitk. L a rkussite du redressement de la compagnie adrienne Air Madagascar permettra
d'envisager la restructuration prochaine du secteur de transport aerien pour y introduire davantage de
concurrence et augmenter la capacitk afin de rkpondre aux besoins grandissants du secteur tourisme.

6.       L'amklioration de la qualitk du capital humain a BtC aussi rune des realisations du DSRP. L a mise
en ceuvre du programme EducationPour Tous a permis d'atteindre untaux de scolarisation presque 100,O
YOa la fin de l'annke 2006. L'objectif en matibre de taux de d'achbvement du primaire n'a pas kte atteint
mais le taux a kt6 substantiellement amkliore. Pour la sante, une nette amklioration a atte constatde avec
la rkduction de 43,0% du taux de mortalitk infantile et de 41,0% du taux de mortalite juvenile. Cette
amelioration a kt6 atteinte grdce a une extension de la couverture vaccindtes et au programme prkventif de
la malnutrition.
7.       Une grande partie de ces resultats a Ctk realiske grdce a la gestion judicieuse des finances
publiques, objet d'importantes reformes commenckes en 2004 a travers des Plans &Actions Prioritaires
successifs. L a realisation substantielle du PAP 2006 a ktC determinante dans cette performance. Cette
rkalisation est notamment marquee par : 1) le renforcement du processus de preparation budgktaire avec
l'elaboration de la lettre de cadrage budgktaire discute en Conseil de Gouvernement, 2) le renforcement
de la capacit6 des ministbres pilotes (kducation, sante, eau et assainissement) pour amkliorer l'exkcution
budgktaire, 3) la mise en axvre des textes d'application du nouveau code de marche public Blabore en
Juillet 2004 et 4) l'accroissement des performances des administrations fiscales et douanibres. L e taux
d'exkcution du budget a connu une nette amklioration. Ainsi, malgrd les difficultks au niveau des recettes,
le budget 2006 a et6 exkcute a plus de 94,O % s i elle n'ktait que de 89,O % en 2005.
8.       Toujours dans le cadre d'une meilleure gestion des finances publiques, le gouvernement a mis en
place un outil pour le suivi de l'ex6cution du Budget par l'intermediaire de la publication d'un rapport
d'exdcution quadrimestres auquel sont soumis tous les ministbres. L e souci de l'efficacitk des depenses a
amen a aussi le gouvernement a conduire un audit pour Bvaluer l'application de nouvelles rbgles de
passation de marches publics dans les ministbres de l'kducation de la sante de l'agriculture et des
transports. Les conclusions de cet audit permettront a 1'administration d'affiner 1' application du nouveau
code de marches publics publie en 2004.

9.       L a periode de mise en ceuvre du DRSP a aussi permis le lancement d'unvaste programme pour la
bonne souvenance, garantie d'une meilleure efficacitk de faction de 1'Etat et de 1'Etat de droit. Ce
programme a notamment permis la mise en place de plusieurs agences pour la prkservation de l'intkgritd
de 1'Etat (Comite pour la Sauvegarde de 1'IntkgritB de 1'Etat et la lutte contre la corruption (Bureau
Independant pour la Lutte conte la corruption). L e cadre ldgislatif et rkglementaire a Ctk aussi renove et
renforce notamment par la mise en place de loi sur la corruption (loi No 2004-030 du 09 septembre 2004)
et de decret obligeant les Blus et les hauts fonctionnaires ideclarer leur patrimoine. L e CSI a termine la
preparation d'un projet de texte sur le conflit d'int6r8ts qui sera prochainement soumis a l'approbation du

conseil de ministres

10.      Grace a ces risultats, le MAP a pu se fixer des objectifs ambitieux, en rupture avec les tendances
du passe. Le plan vise d'atteindre une croissance kconomique entre 8 et 10 % par anjusqu'en 2012. Cette
croissance s'appuiera particulibrement sur le secteur prive et notamment par une augmentation du taux
d'investissement a plus de 24% du PIB. L e rythme de la croissance iconomique devrait permettre a
Madagascar d'atteindre un PIB habitant de 467 dollars et de reduire ainsi le taux de pauvreti a 50%. Les
anses 2007 et 2008 sont cruciales pour l'atteinte de ces objectifs car elles constituent la pkriode pour la
rialisation des(( sauts qualitatifs > nicessaires pour ce faire. Les(( sauts qualitatifs >> sont les rksultats
escomptes des reformes en profondeur qui donneront les conditions de croissance accklerke.

11.      Leo saut qualitatif)) le plus important que Madagascar se doit de rialiser rapidement est
d'augmenter les investissements prives. Ainsi, l e gouvernement escompterait 1'effet d'importants
investissements directs stringers dans le secteur minier, notamment le nickel, d'un montant de 3 millions
de dollars. D'autre part, le gouvernement est en train de priparer un nouveau texte pour skcuriser et
encourager les investissements prives y compris les investissements stringers. Ce nouveau texte sera
soumis au vote du parlement avant la fin de cette annee. L'Economico Dkveloppent Bocard of
Madagascar (EDBM) est mis en place afin d'assurer l'exicution de cette loi. L e gouvernement
entreprendra aussi durant cette annie et l'annie 2008 la revision du code des impbts pour favoriser les
investissements prives. Par la mise en ceuvre d'une politique adiquate de change et de gestion monktaire,
le gouvernement dkveloppera tous les efforts nkcessaires pour que les chocs positifs, consiquences de
l'afflux des investissements stringers ne soient pas un facteur de perte de compititivitk pour nos
exportations.

12.      L e secteur financier sera aussi l'objet de restructuration pour instaurer une plus grande
compitition dans le secteur et mettre en place des infrastructures et instruments rkpondant aux besoins de
la population et du pays. Par ailleurs, le gouvernement mettra en place pendant les deux annkes a venir les
conditions nicessaires pour lancer la rivolution verte, le saut qualitatif)) pour faire decoller
kconomiquement le monde rural ou rkside la majoritk des pauvres. Outre un vaste programme de
facilitation de l'accbs a la terre et de sicurisation foncibre, la reforme comprendra notamment le
renforcement des institutions et des instruments financiers de microcrkdit.

13. Comme les ressources publiques seront fortement sollicitkes dans le cadre de la mise en ceuvre du
MAP, le gouvernement poursuivra la restructuration de la gestion des finances publiques entreprises
depuis 2004. L a reforme de la politique fiscale sera la priorit6 absolue. Cette reforme portera notamment
sur la mise en ceuvre d'un plan d'actions pour augmenter et rationaliser les recettes intirieures. Ce plan
tient compte a la fois de la nicessite d'encourager I'investissement citke plus haut et du besoin
d'augmenter de substantielles ressources publiques exigies par le MAP. L a douane pour sa part
continuera de mettre en ceuvre sa stratkgie de reforme pour un renforcement de l'efficaciti des
procidures douanikres (achbvement du dkploiement de SYDONIA            ++ dans   12 bureaux de Douanes) et
par la mise en service des contrbles renforces et efficaces (optimisation de l'utilisation des outils de
contrble moderne lors du didouanement (Scanners, Profilers, Valunet, Resus) et 1'amilioration de la lutte
contre la fraude par un ktouffement des unites de Brigade Mobile de Surveillance. Ces reformes
intkgreront, d'autre part, le diclin attendu des recettes provenant du commerce international du fait des
programmes d'intigration rigionale.

14. L a reforme des finances publiques continuera la rationalisation des dipenses. Cependant, sans
attendre cette reforme, le mouvement a dija pris des mesures pour aligner des 2007 le budget avec les
prioritks du MAP. Ainsi, les quatre secteurs prioritaires du M A P ont r e c u des allocations importantes
par rapport au montant total du budget. L'allocation pour le secteur de l'iducation a atteint plus de 18%
du total du budget et celui de la sante 9%. L a part du secteur transport et de l'agriculture a connu une
augmentation remarquie. L e transport qui ne recevait en moyenne que 14 % du total du budget pour la
pkriode 2003-2006, a eu 16,2% en 2007 et la part de l'agriculture passe de 5 a 8 % dutotal du budget.


                                                     92

15. Un effort particulier est mis en ceuvre pour rendre opkrationnel l'application de la loi organique des
lois des finances de juillet 2004 instaurant le budget de programme. L'application effective du budget de
programme permettra d'amkliorer et de rationaliser l'allocation des ressources dans le cadre la mise en
ceuvre du MAP, et permettra son suivi efficace. En parallble, la mise en place rkcente d'un calendrier de
preparation budgktaire qui instaurera une plus grande concertation entre les acteurs du budget, aidera le
gouvermement et 1'administration a renforcer la rationalisation des allocations.

16. L'exkcution des dkpenses sera poursuivie et ameliorke pour obtenir de meilleurs rksultats sur le
terrain. L a reforme dans ce domaine sera entreprise par la rkvision en profondeur de la chaine de la
dkpense et la consolidation du Systbme Intbgre de Gestion de finances Publiques (SIGFP). L a
consolidation du SIGFP amdliorera aussi le suivi de 1'exkcution des dkpenses publiques. Enconskquence,
tous les ministirres soumettront dksormais un rapport de suivi quadrimestre de l'exkcution budgktaire sur
la base de la classification kconomique, un mois &pres la clbture des kcritures. L a mise en ceuvre des
recommandations de 1'audit organisationnel et analytique du Contrble des Dkpenses Engagkes (CDE)
permettra de mieuxmaitriser l'exkcution des dkpenses budgktaires et de rdflkchir sur le nouveau rble que
doit revdtir le CDE dans le contrble budgktaire.

17. Afin d'amkliorer les rksultats sur le terrain et la qualitk ainsi que le niveau de services fourmis a la
population, le gouvernement mettra en ceuvre le plan d'actions pour affiner
l'application du nouveau code des marches publics. Un plan de travail annuel a et6 klabore pour rendre
professionnel les fonctions de la Personne Responsable des Marches Publics et de 1'Unitk de Gestion des
Marches Publics et de renforcer les capacitks professionnelles des ministirres et institutions en matibre
d'exkcution des marches publics.

18. Dans le mGme objectif, le gouvernement affinera le processus de dkcentralisation. I1s'agit d'abord de
mettre en place une nouvelle lkgislation sur les ressources des collectivitks. En effet, selon les disposition
de la Loi No 2006-034 du 19 dkcembre 2006 portant Loi de Finances 2007: 1'Impbt Synthktique, impbt
libkratoire de la Taxe Professionnelle, de la Taxe sur les Chiffres d'Affaires et de 1'Impbt sur les Revenus
comportera des modifications d'une part, sur le seuil d'application, 6.000.000 d'Ariary relirve a 20.000.000
d'Ariary de chiffre d'affaires annuel, revenu brut ou gain hors taxe et d'autre part, sur la rkpartition du
produit de l'impbt entre le Budget General (25%), les Communes (25%) et les Rkgions (50%). L e
gouvernement a aussi mis en place un nouveau systbme de suivi des finances des communes pour
rationaliser leur gestion.

19. L e gouvermement attend renforcer les rbles des rkgions. Les ressources propres des regions seront
augmentkes par le transfert des ressources dkvolues aux ex-provinces autonomes. 11 sera ensuite procbde
au transfert progressif des budgets d'investissements nkcessaires a la mise en place des infrastructures
structurantes et des Bquipements les plus utiles a la population. I1 s'agit notamment des infrastructures
routibres rkgionales et des pistes rurales, des amknagements hydro-agricoles et des infrastructures
d'adduction d'eau potable. Dans un premier temps, le gouvermement transfkrera la gestion des crkdits
budgktaires pour ces dBpenses aux responsables techniques des services rkgionaux qui executeront les
dkpenses sous la supervision des autoritks des rkgions.

20. L e renforcement des rbles kconomiques des regions ne sera pas un obstacle au dkveloppement des
communes qui continueront a dtre le fer de lance du dkveloppement a la base et de proximitk. Les
ressources des communes seront en effet confortees avec le transfert direct provenant du Fonds de
DBveloppement Local (FDL) actuellement en cours de mise en place avec un credit de 4 milliards Ariary
en 2006 et 4,5 milliards Ariary en 2007. L e FDL financera directement des investissements nkcessaires
au dkveloppement kconomique et social des communes. D'autre part, l'amklioration des ressources
propres des communes est aussi en cours par le recouvrement effective des ressources prkvues par les
dispositions fiscales existantes, notamment les impbts fonciers. Avec ces mesures, le gouvemement
compte augmenter le pourcentage de transfert aux collectivitksdkcentraliskes plus de 25 % des ressources
publiques d'ici 2012.

                                                    93

21. L'effort de moralisation du secteur public et de la lutte contre la corruption connaitra une nouvelle
dimension. Pour completer les diverses dispositions mises en place pour Bradiquer la corruption, le
gouvernement mettra en place une nouvelle ligislation pour Bviter les conflits d'intirets.L'objectif est de
privenir que la detention de poste de responsabilite dans le secteur public ne soit pas utilisie comme
source d'accumulation de richesse injustifiie ou pour introduire de distorsions dans le fonctionnement des
rbgles de la concurrence et de la compitition qui caracterise l'iconomie de marche.

22. Sur le plan social, la realisation des Objectifs du Millhaire pour le DBveloppement (OMD) intkgres
dans le MAP nicessite aussi la mise en euvre de reformes pour la realisation des       ((sauts qualitatifs D.
Apres le lancement du programme G Education pour Tous            ))ily aplusdetroismsetdontlesactions
seront poursuivies dans les deux annies a venir, le gouvernement s'attachera a mettre un nouveau
programme d'bducation post Primaire. L e programme EPT a presque atteint son objectif en matiere de
taux de scolarisation et ils'agit maintenant d'assurer la capitalisation et la consolidation des ces acquis
pour renforcer la qualite des ressources humaines. Ce programme sera oriente d'une part sur la formation
professionnelle dont 1'Etat s'est engage a fournir a la population dans le cadre mCme de la constitution. L e
programme portera ensuite sur l'am6lioration a l'accbs et la qualite de 1'iducation secondaire.

23.    Pour la sante, le gouvernement a adopte en avril 2007, le nouveau Plan de DBveloppement du
Secteur Sante, declinaison sectorielle de la mise en ceuvre du P. Ce programme mettra l'accent sur les
points suivants : (i)l'amelioration de l'accbs de la population aux services de qualite par la construction
et la rehabilitation des CSB (Centres de Sante de Base) et l'amelioration du plateau technique des
h6pitaux de reference par la rehabilitation et la dotation en Bquipements et materiels techniques, (ii)le
diveloppement des ressources humaines par le recrutement de personnel medical, paramidical, personnel
d'appui et des specialistes, (iii)
                                 la hierarchisation des nouvelles structures et des zones enclavies dans les
postes budgitaires ainsi que (iv) 1'6tude d'un systbme de motivation des midecins dans les zones
enclavkes, (v) les mesures visant a promouvoir la sante de la mbre et de l'enfant, a lutter contre la
malnutrition et les maladies (vi) la prevention et le traitement du SIDA, de la tuberculose et de la malaria;
et (vii) 1'amelioration de l'accbs a l'eau potable et l'assainissement.

24.    Complement indispensable des soins sanitaires, l'amelioration de l'approvisionnement en eau
potable sera poursuivi et amplifie. L'objectif du gouvernement sur ce domaine est d'atteindre un taux de
couverture en eau potable de 65% d'ici l'annie 2012. Pour ce faire ila deploy6 un effort particulier pour
rationaliser les ddpenses dans le secteur notamment par la prise en compte les recommandations des
partenaires financiers lors de la revue conjointe du secteur en 2006 dans l'ilaboration du budget
programme 2007-2009. Par ailleurs, le programme priventif de lutte contre la malnutrition sera l'objet
d'une nouvelle dynamisation par la mise en Eure d'unnouveau plan a la suite des recommandations d'une
evaluation institutionnelledu secteur de la nutrition.

25.    Avec toutes ces actions, le gouvernement compte obtenir des resultats tangibles d'ici la fin 2008
notamment un taux de croissance atteignant plus de 7% proche des objectifs affiches du MAP, et une
maitrise de l'inflation. Comme les ressources du pays sont limitees, Madagascar a encore besoin du
soutien financier et technique de la communautk internationale dans les efforts a entreprendre pour
l'atteinte de ces objectifs.

Mister President,

1.       Inearly 2007, the Republic o f Madagascar began the implementation o f the Madagascar Action
Plan (MAP), the second generation poverty reduction strategy. Taking over the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), the M A P is the articulation o f the "Madagascar Naturally" vision for the next
five years. The MAP also conveys the concretization by the Malagasy Government o f the Millennium
Development Goals. By integrating the positive experience from the PRSP, the MAP has been developed
through a largely participatory process. Its implementation will also be participatory at the level o f the
regions and the districts. The objectives set inthe MAP are very ambitious and the Government intends to
undertake in-depth reforms to achieve them.

2.       The PRSP, implemented from 2003 to 2006, set the basis for a strong and quickly growing
economy. The reforms undertaken during that period, helped Madagascar reach a level o f growth and
development well above those o f the previous years. Indeed, without even taking account o f the 2003
recovery, the economic growth rate reached an average o f 5.0% duringthose three years. This economic
performance, combined with the achievements in the area o f public finances described in the following
paragraph, resultedina reduced poverty incidence rate: from 72.0% in2002 to 67.0% in2006.

3.       With an average growth rate o f 7.5% each year, the tertiary sector has been the main growth
engine. The secondary sector, which played an important role until 2004, has experienced a relative
decrease o f activity (6.0% o f annual growth rate). The performance o f the tertiary sector was boosted by
the various new infrastructures, funded by public investments; the "Construction Industry and Public
Works" has grown at an average rate o f 23% over the last four years. The primary sector continues to
offer major challenges, as the "Agriculture" branch, which provides a living for a great part o f the
population, only achieved an average growth o f 3.3% over the last four years.

4.       Despite the volatility o f the international market, marked by the rise o f oil prices and the decline
o f the costs o f basic products, the domestic and external balances could be maintained. Thus, although tax
revenues decreased over the last two years due to the decrease o f imports, the budget deficit has been
contained at less than 4.0% o f GDP, thanks to the rigorous management o f public expenditures. Despite a
very strict monetary control policy, the progression o fthe overall monetary supply was 25% in2006. The


                                                      95

commercial deficit was stabilized due to a foreign exchange policy which promoted exports. Inflation
control was, however, impacted by the shortage o f domestic supplies due to natural disasters in both 2004
(cyclones) and 2006 (drought inthe South o fthe country).

5.       The most important achievements o f the PRSP was the establishment o f basic infrastructures that
will allow Madagascar to have a better growth in the near future. The number o f passable roads in the
country has been multiplied four-fold, and the overall roads systems have been improved through the
reinforcement o f the major axes, such as the national highways #1, 1-bis, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 44, as well as the
rural roads. A significant increase o f domestic transactions is expected from this extension o f the road
network, leading to an increase inproduction, mainly inrural areas. On another front, the management o f
the country's first international port has been restructured in-depthbringing it into compliance with the
international standards and improving its efficiency.      Finally, the successful recovery o f the airline
company, Air Madagascar, will allow the country to consider the restructuring o f the air transport
industry to introduce more competitionand to increase its capacity and fulfill the increasing needs o f the
tourism sector.

6.       The improvement o f the quality o f our human capital has also been one o f the achievements o f
the PRSP. The implementation o f the Education for All program allowed us to achieve a 100% school
enrollment rate at the end o f 2006. Although the hoped-for achievement rate for the primary level has not
been reached, the rate has substantially improved. The health system has improved, with a reduction o f
infant mortality by 43% and o fjuvenile mortality by 41%. Such improvements could be continued with
an extension o fthe immunization coverage and the malnutrition prevention program.

7.       A major part o f these results has been achieved thanks to the judicious management o f public
finances, which underwent important reforms starting from 2004 through successive Priority Action
Plans (PAP). The substantial implementation o f the PAP 2006 has been a determining factor in this
performance. This achievement is notably marked by: 1) the strengthening o f the budget preparation
process with the budget framework paper discussed duringthe Cabinet meeting, 2) the capacity building
o f pilot ministries (Education, Health, Water and Sanitation) to improve the execution o f the budget, 3)
the application and enforcement o f texts o f the new public procurement code developed inJuly 2004, and
4) the improvement o f the performance o f tax and customs services. The budget execution rate has
noticeably improved. So, despite difficulties at the level o f revenues, the 2006 budget has been executed
at more than 94%, while the rate was 89% in2005.

8.        Still, in the context o f a continued improvement in the management o f public finances, the
Government has set up a tool to monitor the execution o f the budget through the publication by all
ministries o f a four-monthly execution report. Furthermore, concerns about expense efficiency also led
the Government to audit and assess the application o f new rules governing the public procurements inthe
ministries o f Education, Health, Agriculture, and Transport. The conclusions o f the audit will allow the
Government to refine the application o fthe new public procurement code that was published in2004.

9.       The PRSP implementation period also allowed the launching o f a large program for good
governance, guaranteeing a better efficiency o f the Government's actions, as well as the rule o f law. This
program allowed, among other things, the establishment o f several agencies to preserve the Government's
integrity (Committee for the safeguard o f the State's Integrity - CSI) and to fight against corruption
(Independent Bureau for the fight against corruption). The legal and regulatory framework has also been
renewed and strengthened, by the enforcement o f the anti-corruption act (Act # 2004-030, on September
9, 2004) and the decree obliging the elected people and the high-ranked civil servants to declare their
wealth. The CSI has finished developing a bill on the conflicts o f interests that will soon be presented to
the Cabinet for approval.

10.      Thanks to these results, the M A P was developed with ambitious objectives, different from the
trends o fthe past. The plan aims at achieving a yearly growth rate between 8 and 10% up until2012. This
growth rate will mainly rely upon the private sector and on an increase o f the investment rate up to 24%


                                                     96

o f GDP. The growth rhythm should allow Madagascar to reach a GDP per capita o f US$467 and to
reduce the poverty rate by 50%. The years 2007 and 2008 will be critical to reach these objectives, as
they represent the period for the achievement o fthe required"qualitative jumps" to reachthese goals. The
"qualitative jumps" are the results expected from the deep reforms that are to provide the conditions for
an accelerated growth.

11.     The most important qualitative jump that Madagascar has to quickly achieve is the increase of
private investments. Thus, the Government is expecting the effect o f FDI in the mining sector,
particularly the nickel extraction amounting US$3 billion. Moreover, the Government i s preparing a new
investment law to conserve and encourage private investments, including foreign investments. This new
law will be submitted to Parliament before the end o f this year. The Economic Development Board of
Muduguscur (EDBM) was set up to ensure the enforcement o f that law. This year and in the course o f
2008, the Government will also undertake the revision o f the tax code in order to encourage private
investments. By the implementation o f relevant currency exchange and monetary management policies,
the Government will provide any required effort so that the positive shocks, consequences and inflow o f
foreign investmentswould not be a factor leading to the loss o f competitiveness for our exports.

12.      The financial sector will also be restructured to initiate more competition in the sector and to
establish infrastructure and instruments fulfilling the needs o f the population, and o f the country.
Moreover, the Government will set - within the next two years - the required conditions to start the
"green revolution", the "qualitative jump" that will boost the economy o f the rural areas, where the
majority o f the poor are located. Apart from the land access facilitation and conservation program, the
reforms will include the strengthening o f institutions, as well as o f microcredit financial instruments.

13.      As public resources will be very much in demand in the implementation o f the MAP, the
Government will continue the restructuring o f the management o f public finances that we have started
since 2004. The reform o f the tax policy will be an absolute priority. This reform will aim at
implementingan action plan to increase and rationalize domestic resources. This plan considers the
necessity to encourage investment, as mentioned above, as well as the need to substantially increase
public resources, as required by the MAP. As for the customs, they will continue to implement their
reform strategy in order to reinforce the efficiency o f customs procedures (completion o f the distribution
of ASYCODA++ in 12 customs offices) and by the establishment o f efficient and strengthened control
services (optimal use o f modern control tools for customs clearance: scanners, profilers, Valunet, Resus)
and the improvement o f the prevention o f fraud by strengthening the mobile monitoring brigade. In
addition, these reforms will integrate the expected decline o f revenues from internationaltrade, which is
due to regionalintegration programs.

14.      The reform o f public finances will include the continuation o f the rationalization o f the
expenditures. Inthe meantime, however, starting from 2007, the Government has already taken measures
to align the budget with the MAP priorities. Thus, the four priority sectors o f the MAP have received
important allocations, in comparison to the total amount o f the budget. The allocation for the education
sector has reached more than 18% o f the total budget, and the share for the health sector is 9%. The
shares for transportation and agriculture have noticeably increased. Transportation, only receiving on
average a share o f 14% o f the total budget for the 2003-2006 period, has received 16.2% in 2007, and
agriculture increases from 5 to 8% o fthe total budget.

15.     A particular effort is being made to enforce the law in the finance act o f 2004 initiating budget
programs. The effective application o f budget programs will result in the improvement and in the
rationalization o f the allocation o f resources within the implementation o f the MAP and will allow an
efficient monitoring system. At the same time, the recent establishment o f a budget preparation schedule,
which will initiate a greater dialogue between the actors o f the budget, will help the Government and the
public service to reinforce the rationalization o f the allocations.




                                                       97

16.      The execution o f expenditures will continue and will be improved inorder to get better results in
the field. The reform o f this area will be undertaken by deeply reviewing the expenditure chain, and by
consolidating the Integrated Public Finances Management System (IPFMS). The consolidation o f the
IPFMS will, as well, improve the monitoring o f the execution o f public expenditures. As a consequence,
all ministries will henceforth submit a four-monthly budget execution monitoring report based on
economic classification, one month after the closing o f accounts. The implementation o f the
recommendations from the organizational and analytic audit o f the Control o f Committed Expenditures
(CCE) will allow to better control the execution o f budget expenditures, and to think about the new role
that the CCE has to play inbudget control.

 17.     In order to improve field results, as well as the quality and the level o f service provision, the
Government will implement the action plan to refine the enforcement o f the new public procurement
code. An annual action plan has been developed to make the Public Procurement Officer and the Public
Procurement Management Unit more professional and to build the professional capacities of ministries
and other institutions regardingprocurement execution.

 18.     Inthe same objective, the Government will refine the decentralization process. First, we have to
set up a new legislation on the collectivities' resources. Indeed, according to the provisions o f the Act #
2006-034, on December 19, 2006, impacting the 2007 Finance Act: the synthetic (all-encompassing) tax,
full discharge tax for the professional tax, the tax on turnovers and the income tax will be modified
resulting in an increase from the current 6 million Ariary annual turnover threshold to 20 million Ariary.
Inaddition, therepartitionofthetax commodity betweenthe generalbudget (25%), thecommunes (25%)
and the regions (50%) will be rationalized. The Government has also established a new financial
monitoring system for communes, inorder to rationalize their management.

 19.     The Government plans to strengthen the role o f the regions. First, the capital resources o f the
regions will be increased by transferring the resources previously allocated to the former autonomous
provinces. Then, investment budgets required for the establishment o f infrastructure and equipment
needed by the population will be progressively transferred to the regions. Important needs, among others,
include regional roads, rural roads, and hydro agricultural and drinkingwater conveyance infrastructures.
Inthe beginning, the Government will transfer the management of credit budgets for these expenditures
to the technical officers o f the regional services, and they will execute the expenditures under the
supervision o fthe regionalauthorities.

20.      The strengthening o f the economic roles o f the regions will not be an obstacle to the development
o f communes that will continue to be the flagship o f development at the basis and proximity levels. The
resources o f the communes will indeed be consolidated with the direct transfer from the Local
Development funds (FDL), which is currently being established with a 4 billion Ariary credit in2006 and
4.5 billion Ariary in 2007. The FDL will directly fund the investments required by the communes'
economic and social development. Moreover, the increase o f the capital resources o f the communes is
also underway by the effective recovery o f the resources that were mentioned in the existing tax
provisions, among them the real estate taxes. With such measures, the Government plans to increase the
transfer rate to decentralized collectivities by 25% o fthe public resources by the year 2012.

21.      The efforts for the moralization o fthe public service and for the preventiono f corruption will be
made in a new dimension. To complete the different dispositions that were put in place to eradicate
corruption, the Government will set up a new legislation to avoid conflicts o f interests. The objective i s to
prevent the abuse o f a high public service rank and use the influence o f such rank as a source for the
accumulation o f an unjustified wealth, or to introduce distortions in the functioning o f the rules of
competition, which is characteristic to a market economy.

22.      Inthe social area, the achievement o f the MDGs that are included inthe MAP also requires the
implementation o f reforms in order to complete the "qualitative jumps". After the start o f the Education
for All (EFA) program more than three years ago, the actions o f which will be continued inthe next two

years, the Government will have a task to develop a new post-primary education program. The EFA
programhas nearly achieved its objective as regards the enrollment rate, and now is the time to ensure the
accumulation and the consolidation o f the results to improve the quality o f the human resources. This
program will be aiming at vocational training that the Government has committed to provide to the
population, in the very provisions o f the Constitution. The program will then aim at the improvement o f
the accessto and o fthe quality o f secondary education.

23.      As regards health, in April 2007 the Government adopted the new Health Sector Development
Plan, a sector-oriented plan derived from the M A P implementation. This program will emphasize the
following points: (i)the improvement o f the access o f the population to quality services through the
building and the rehabilitation o f basic health centers (CSB) and the improvement o f technical needs o f
reference hospitals by providing and rehabilitating technical materials and equipment, (ii)the
development o f human resources by recruiting medical, paramedical, and supporting staffs, as well as
specialists, (iii)
                 the establishment of a hierarchy inthe new structures and in the remote areas in the civil
service, as well as (iv) the assessment o f an incentive system for physicians inremote areas, (v) measures
aiming at promoting mother and child's health and at the prevention o f diseases and malnutrition, (vi)
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria prevention and care; and (vii) the improvement o f access to drinking
water and sanitation.

24.      As a vital complement to health care, the improvement o f drinking water supply will be
continued andreinforced. The objective o fthe government inthis area is to reach a drinkingwater supply
rate o f 65% by the year 2012. To do so, we have made a particular effort to rationalize the expenses inthe
sector, by considering the recommendations o f our financial partners duringthejoint review o f this sector
in2006 when we developedthe 2007-2009 programbudget. Moreover, the programfor the preventiono f
malnutrition will be boosted with the implementation o f a new plan following the recommendations o f an
institutionalassessmento fthe nutrition sector.

25.      With all these actions, the Government hopes to get tangible results by the end o f the year 2008,
with a growth rate o f more than 7%, which is close to the MAP objectives, as well as a control over
inflation. As the country's resources are limited, Madagascar still needs financial and technical support
from the International Community inits efforts to achieve these goals.
