                         policies, specifically in relation to the role, availability (magnitude and recharge) and supply potential of groundwater resources.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Delays in procurement of the main consultant contracts have been overcome and all four are now under implementation. However, there is increasing pressure on the overall
                         implementation schedule. A second extension of ten months has been granted to allow completion of ongoing consultancies and implementation of interventions in pilot areas of the
                         Limpopo River basin. The project is now scheduled to close on October 31, 2011 and this should allow for satisfactory completion of all activities as originally envisaged.

                         The project continues to contribute to strengthening capacity within the SADC region to address the challenges of groundwater and drought management. The Project Steering
                         Committee representing the SADC Member States continues to play a critical role in ensuring completion of the main activities guiding development of the Decision Support

                         Formalization of the Groundwater Management Institute remains a critical issue. The GMI is considered central to long-term applied research, information and knowledge
                         management, coordination, awareness and capacity building in the SADC region.
