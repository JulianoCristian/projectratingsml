There are\n            four components. The first, Program Strategy and Management,\n            lays the foundation for the COREMAP program. It produces the\n            policy, strategic, and legal framework; project management\n            and assessment of lessons learned; and an independent\n            evaluation of COREMAP I and preparation for COREMAP II. The\n            second component  provides services, workshops,\n            publications, awareness materials, surveys, and awards to\n            support a national multi-media campaign; regional campaigns\n            in COREMAP I pilot provinces; and public relations and\n            dissemination of program guidelines. The third component\n            funds specialized technical assistance, surveillance\n            equipment, studies, surveillance operations, workshops, and\n            incremental staff costs to support a national surveillance\n            and enforcement (S&E) unit; operations at target project\n            sites; and surveillance training. The fourth component,\n            community-based management, improves the condition of coral\n            reef ecosystems in two pilot sites through reef management\n            plans designed, implemented, and monitored by local\n            communities. This component also provides technical\n            assistance, community support services, workshops, training,\n            and village grants."}, "docdt": "1998-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
