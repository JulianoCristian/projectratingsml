The institutional development impact of the\n            project was substantial. The project supported the\n            Government of Indonesia (GOI's) decision to designate\n            the newly created Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries\n            (DKP) as the agency responsible for the equitable and\n            sustainable management of coral reef resources, here there\n            had been none before. The sustainability of the project is\n            not evaluable at this time. Overall, while the economic\n            justification for Coral Reef Management Program (COREMAP) is\n            robust, not only because of the local benefits but also\n            because of the high global benefits of protecting\n            Indonesia's coral reef diversity, insufficient\n            information is available to judge the resilience to risk of\n            the other major factors that need to be considered. The\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. The preparation of\n            the project was underpinned by extensive analytical papers\n            and surveys, and GOI ownership was strong. The design of the\n            project was unusually complex, but responded to the needs of\n            the proposed strategy and the lack of a robust institutional\n            counterpart. Supervision focused on development impact and\n            responded flexibly to drastic changes in institutional and\n            country conditions, although donor coordination could have\n            been better."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
