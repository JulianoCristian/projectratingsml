The lessons learned indicate that projects\n            should adopt a broad ecosystem-based approach in addressing\n            coral reef conservation, focusing on fisheries. Communities\n            should be the focus of coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management activities. Coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management is a time-consuming process of consensus-building\n            among resource users and stakeholders. Coral reef ecosystem\n            and fisheries management will benefit from decentralization.\n            Communities and local government need central government or\n            other external partners to manage coral reef ecosystems and\n            fisheries. Coral reef MCS and enforcement measures must be\n            cost-effective and sustainable. In dealing with diverse and\n            dynamic communities, flexibility must be incorporated into\n            the design of all coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management activities. Fully-protected marine reserves\n            should be selected based on some fisheries criteria. Marine\n            protected areas require long-term funding and institutional\n            commitments from both donors and governments. It is vital to\n            incorporate specific provisions for coordination among\n            components. It is important to begin working early with a\n            borrower on the preparation for the next Adaptable Program\n            Loan (APL) phase, most likely from the time of the mid-term\n            review, in order to avoid financing gaps and ensure\n            continuity between phases. Project designs should provide\n            for information exchange within the relevant scientific and\n            development agency communities."}, "docdt": "2005-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
