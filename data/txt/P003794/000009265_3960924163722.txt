PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
i.       This is the Project Comapletion Report (PCR) for Indonesia's
National Agricultural Extension II Project (NAEPII), for which a credit of
US$42 million (Cr. 996-IND) was signed in 1980. The project was
essentially completed in March 1987 and the Bank loan was closed on January
20, 1988.
ii.      The Borrower's PCR was prepared by the Government's National
Coordination Center based on- the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2711a-IND);
Development Credit Agreement dated April 3, 1980; the Bank's supervision
correspondence; working papers; and project files. The Overview was
prepared by the Bank, on the basis of the aforementioned documents, as well
as Bank supervision reports, field reviews and internal memoranda, and the
Project Completion Report prepared by the Borrower.
iii.     The draft report was sent to the Borrower on March 3, 1989 for
comments. AcknowledRements were received from the Ministry of Agriculture.

SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(CREDIT 926-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The Secord National Agricultural Extension Project was the fourth
m&,or extension oriented activity since the late 1960s when a version of
the training and visit system of extension was introduced in some
irrigation command areas. The first effort to improve agricultural
extension was part of an education project (Credit 288-IND) approved in
1972. During the period 1975 to 1982, the Government strengthened research
capacity and established 10 agricultural information centers utilizing Loan
1179-IND (Agricultural Research and Extension Project) and in 1976 to 1982
to improve agricultural extension developed a National Food Crops Extension
Project (NFCEP) Loan 1267-TND. On April 3, 1980, Credit 996-'ND, National
Agricultural Extension II (NAEP II) expanding the support of extension
services to livestock, estate crops, and fisheries in the amount of US$42.0
million was signed. The final disoursement was made on January 20, 1988.
Obiectives
The main objectives of NAEP II were to (a) provide food crop
extension to provinces not covered by NFCEP; (b) establish extension
service in transmigration areas; and (c) incorporate smallholder estate
crops, livestock and fisheries extension within a unified system. The
credit provided for (a) establishment of Rural Extension Centers (REC) and
housing; (b) procurement of extension materials, equipment and vehicles;
(c) training; and (d) technical assistance.
Implementation Experience and Results
Management of NAEP II was initially provided by the Directorate
General of Food Cropst and in 1984 shifted to the Agency for Agricultural
Education Training and Extension (AAETE). Utilizing the base developed by
NFCEP food crop activities developed satisfactorily, but participation of
the provincial governments and Directorates General of Estate Crops, Live-
stock and Fisheries was weak. The participation of the Directorate General
of Food Crops was also diminished due in part to the lack of funds ear-
marked for Directorate activities. Under NAEP II, 1,400 RECs were acti-
vated; equipment and training was provided mainly in lowland rice areas and
in some transmigration areas. Various shortcomings ins (a) organization
and management; (b) technical support by the participating directorates and



research institutions; and (c) availability and timely release of funds
were noted and attempts made to correct them during implementation and for
a follow-on NAEP III project (Loan 2748-IND).
Findings and Lessons
The Region considers the project objectives were met in providing
extension advice to farmers and in building up the capability to provide
services to transmigration areas and to those engaged in livestock, estate
crops and fish production as well as to food crop faivers. However,
failure to provide direct funding to the Directorates General restricted
their ability to support project activities. Improvement of agricultural
extension in Indonesia involving sever major organizations; 29,248 field
agents, scattered throughout 3,500 islands with primitive communication
links was a tremendous undertaking. Results were most satisfactory in the
developed areas of Java, but other areas will require additional time to
gain consensus and to apply additional improvements. The main improvements
still required involve: (a) developing a line of responsibility for
management; (b) strengthening staff abilities to identify constraints and
technical competency; and (c) provide adequate and timely financial
support.
Although at appraisal, on the basis of expected farmer
participation, the Bank estimated the project ERR to be 35%, it is now
considered that calculation of an ERR for this project would not be
meaningful since production increases could have been caused by inputs of
several supporting services, i.e. irrigation, improved seed, agricultural
credits and markets, all in addition to extension. Although 93,000 new
farmer groups were formed, the number of farmers applying recommendations
is not quantified. During the implementation period, Indonesia obtained
self sufficiency in rice.

SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(CREDIT 996-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Regional Overview of the Proiect Completion Report
A. Introduction - Background
1.       The attached Project Completion Report (PCR) with annexes was
translated from the Indonesian text prepared by the National Coordination
Center. This Overview, prepared by staff of Asia Region based on the
Borrower's PCR and a review of Bank files summarizes and highlights aspects
of project implementation, expands on a number of follow-on issues and
assesses GOI and Bank performance.
2.       The Bank's assistance in the improvement of extension services
began with extension components in irrigation projects in the late 1960s,
whereby a version of the training and visit system of extension 1 was
introduced in irrigation command areas. In view of the large role that
agriculture plays in the Indonesian economy and the relatively low produc-
tivity of food crops, tree crops,  qiqaaculture, and animal husbandry, GOI
sought the Bank's assistance in 1972 to expand and improve its extension
services. There were two alternatives: either to have separate extension
projects under each Directorate General, or to unify the extension services
under the Agency for Agricultural Education, Training and Extension
(AAETE). After considerable deliberation, GOI d-cided in 1975 that, while
creation of a unified extension service under AAETE was a desirable goal, a
major reorganization would seriously disrupt the BIMAS 2 program for
increasing rice production. Consequently, the Government chose to first
strengthen the research-extension information linkage by the development of
10 agricultural information centers under the Agricultural Research nmd
Extension Project (Loan 1179-IND) signed December 19, 1975 and by develop-
ing extension services under the Directorate General for Food Crops Agri-
culture (DGFCA). The National Food Crop Extension Project (NFCEP) (Loan
1267-INND) was signed on June 4, 1976.
3.       NFCEP provided: (a) extension services to all farmers in she 13
targetted provinces; (b) agricultural extension programers (PPUPs) based at
Rural Extension Centers to sunervise field level extension workers were created
1 This system is described in detail in a Bank publication entitled
"Agricultural Extension: The Training and Visit System," by Daniel Benor,
James Q. Harrison, and M. Baxter (1984).
2 BIMAS, Bimbingan Nassal - a mass guidance system for organizing
extension, production inputs, credit and marketing.
3 Prior to 1987, PPUPs were known as PPMs.



and additional subject matter specialists (PPS) based at District and Provincial
level were recruited; (c) Rural Extension Centers were created: each REC serviced
15,000-25,000 farm families and was staffed with 2 PPUPs and 10-12 field
extension workers (PPL); and (d) the training and visit system of agricul-
tural extension was expanded. NFCEP originally covered nine provinces and

4.       Second National Agricultural Extension Project.  In  1976,
NFCEP was operating in the 13 project provinces and parts of Lampung
province; these areas included nearly 80% of the farm population of
Indonesia, and demand grew for other provinces to be covered. Moreover, it
was felt that the time had arrived to introduce, selectively and in phases,
extension information for nonfood crops, smallholder estate crops,
livestock and fisheries, in areas where those activities provide major
contribution to farmers' incomes. This step was considered important to
effectively utilize the information delivery system already developed for
food crops. The Bank approved the Second National Agricultural Extension
Project (Cr. 996-IND) for US$42.0 million in 1980 with the principal objec-
tives of (a) strengthening food crop extension services in the country's
remaining 13 provinces not covered by NFCEP; (b) establishing an integrated
extension service for transmigration areas; and (c) incorporating extension
activities for smallholder estate crops, animal husbandry, and inland fish
culture into the basic extension program and delivery system heretofore
exclusively utilized for food crops, thereby deveioping a unified extension
service at the field level.
C. Design. Organization and Managemnent
5.       At the central level, the project was under the control of the
Ministry of Agriculture initially represented by the Director General of
Food Crops who was aided by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by
the Project Manager assisted by a treasurer, auditor and various technical
officers. In 1984, the Director General AAETE was assigned control (para.
12). PIUs were also provided at provincial and district levels to provide
advice, monitor implementation and administer procurement and financial
matters. The PIU lacked the authority to command and the responsibility of
assuring cooperation with other organizations and technical supervision.
6.       An extensive system of management forums, committees and working
groups was placed at all levels to control and oversee extension
activities. As is typical in Indonesia, these forums formulated policies
and recommendations by consensus - the discussion of which was often pro-
longed. Responsibility for project implementation rested with these
committees rather than with individuals. The lack of clear lines of
responsibility was a shortcoming of this project (para. 11-12).
D. Imglementation and Performance
7.       The project started July 30, 1980; implementation was completed
March 31, 1987, and the project closed on January 20, 1988. Utilizing the
base established by NFCEP, food crop extension activities developed satis-
factorily. However, estate crops, livestock and fisheries extension



- 3 -
activities did not progress as well (para. 9). Total project costs
amounted to US$87.5 and US$36.5 million of the Bank loan of US$42 million
was disbtursed.
8.      -Sffing and Infrastructure.  Compared to 3,960 PPL, no PPUP, and
179 PPS at the beginning of NFCEP (early 1976), the number of staff has
increased to 27,746 PPLs (including PPUP) and 1,502 PPS at the beginning of
1987.  There are now on average two PPUPs in each Rural Extension Centers
and two PPSs in each district. Under NAEP II, 560 RECs were constructed or
rehabilitated mainly in lowland rice areas and in some transmigration
areas. The Borrower reported difficulties in recruiting staff willing to
be posted to outer islands. Rapid expansion of staff and weak supervision
as well as in many cases isolation from families and frequent transfers
resu.lted in less than desirable effectiveness. The project has actempted
to overcome these constraints by providing housing, transport,
opportunities for training and other prerequisites.  All 1,402 RECs have
been provided with furniture and equipment and vehicles have been
purchased.
9.       Although one of the objectives of NAEP II was to strengthen exten-
sion services for estate crops, livestock, and fisheries, these services
still remain weak mainly because they were unable to recruit sufficient PPS
to carry out the training. At the beginning of 1986, there were 6,075 PPLs
+ PPUPs and 29 PPS in estate crops, 2,170 PPLs + PPUPs and 153 PPSs in
l1-Pestock, and 1,698 PPLs + PPUPs and 193 PPSs in fisheries extension
services. The DGs other than DG Food Crops could not create additional
positions for extension officers out of BIMAS funds as there was no
national policy to that effect, and therefore had to remain content with
the few positions they could create out of specific project funds related
to other projects.
10.      Partly as a result of the above shortcomings, considerable discus-
sion took place over the past years regarding appropriate measures to unify
the extension services. In a national workshop on the subject in 1982, at
which all DGs and AAETE participated, two important decisions were taken as
steps toward unification: (a) the name of the RECs was changed to refer to
the Ministry of Agriculture (rather than DG Food Crops), and RECs were
offered to all DGs to be used as focal points for extension; and (b) DGs
were requested to use, as far as possible, the nationwide network of farmer
groups organized by the food crop extension service. However, the DGs of
Estate Crops, Livestoc--, and Fisheries showed little inclination to use the
existing network of RECs as bases for their respecti-7e extersion services
for three main reasons. First, most of the .1ECs were managed and
controllee Jy DGFCA and were thus not perceived as a joint facility.
Second, there were few RECs in those geographical areas where estate crops,
livestock, and fishery activities were heavily concentrated. Third, as
discussed in Para. 9 above, they had neither sufficient PPS or funds to
carry out their role effectively.
11.      Organizatio.  Government recognized that structural and
functional divisions in the extension organization, as they existed until
1983, were causing operational inefficiencies. At the field level it was
difficult to integrate extension functions for all crops in a system domin-
ated by the food crops extension infrastructure. There was also a mismatch



between demand for training of extension staff under the DGs and AAETE's
capability to meet that demand. The effectiveness of the Agricultural
Information Centers, under AAETE was impaired by the structural separation
of producers/disseminators and users of information. The linkage between
research and extension was also weakened by the splintered extension
apparatus (para. 18).
12.      To address these institutional weaknesses, the Government made the
following changes in late 1983 and early 1984:
(a) AAET. By a Ministerial Decree issued in 1984, AAETE was given
overall responsibility for coordinating extension at the national
level and formulating extension policies and m^thodology.  Conse-
quently, management of NAEP II, was transferred from the DGFCA to
AAETE on April 16, 1984. New coordination forums at the national,
provincial, and district levels were established July 3, 1985.
(bj Directorates General. Realizing the contribution of the food crop
extension service to rice production and the intimate relation
between extension and production, GOI created Directorates of
Extension under all four Directorates General. At the same time,
AAETE retained its Bureau of Extension. The Directorates of
Extension are responsible for providing technical support for the
extension staff and formulating extension programs to fit the
needs of specific commodity production programs, while the Bureau
of Extension of MAETE is responsible for carrying out studies for
improving the extension methods and formulation of extension
policy.
(c) BINAS Directing Board. The BIMAS Directing Board Secretariat was
responsible for administering agricultural extension personnel of
all subsectors and also for synchronizing provision of inputs,
credit, marketing, and cooperative development. In pursuance of
the Minister of Agriculture Decree, handover of the extension
personnel from DGs and AAETE to BIMAS was completed by March 31,
1986.
13.      The transfer of NAEP II from DGFCA to MAETE caused some problems
in implementation. Between December 1983 and April 1984, all project
activities were practically at a standstill.  The Project Director, five
out of six Assistant Directors, and several junior officers of the project
unit transferred to the offices of the Directors General and BIMAS. MAETE
appointed a new Project Director and filled some of the vacancies, but it
took the niew project management some time to come to grips with the
situation. The new management of NAEP II had to evolve different
procedures for implementation of civil works to fulfill the requirement of
new decrees. Some additional RECs in nonfood crop areas were constructed
in line with the new policy of strengthening extension services of other
subsectors. However, when in April 1986 all PPS, PPUP and PPL were put
tsnder the administrative charge of BIMAS, which was then separated from
DGFCA, these staff were no longer directly under the control of the
provincial services (Dinas) of the four Directorates. As recurrent
operating funds were severely cut at that time, there was a tendency for
the Estate Crop, Livestock and Fishery services to favor extension staff in



J -
projects under their direct control rather than to assist staff now
stationed at RECs. This started to undermine the whole concept of a
unified service. All funds for extension activities were controlled by
AAETE or BIMAS and none came directly to the Dinas of the four DGs. The
three DGs (other than DGFCA) were in effect operating outside the purview
of the new national extension system being assisted by NAEP II; which was
the opposite of what had been intended by trying to unite the extension
service at the REC level. The project financed a study of the organization
and management of the Agricultural Extension Service which was conducted it.
late 1986 and early 1987, and the recommendations were utilized in the
reformulation of NAEP III, but were not unfortunately available for the
preparation atid appraisal of the NAEP III Project (para. 25).
14.      Training.  Extensive modifications were made in the SAR training
targets. Among the more important were: (a) expansion of orientation
training; (b) accommodation of urgent technical training for PPS, PPL (e.g.
Brown Plant Hlopper); (c) the addition of special skills training for
farm/fishermen leaders; and (d) additional training for provincial and
district staff. Training programs have usually emphasized theory rather
than developing on-job skills. However, an effort was made to introduce
needs-competency based approach to increase the effectiveness of in-service
and special course training. Training facilities available to the project
were in large measure under-utilized due to weak linkage with field units
and delays in release of funds.
15.      Dezree Training and Short-Term Training.  Domestic participation
in degree training met targets while overseas training fell somewhat short
of target because of language deficiencies. About 340 people partic'.pated
in short-term (3 months) overseas tours or workshops. Overall, the
training program met targets, quality improved, but additional improvements
in needs assessment, developing and executing unit and individual training
plans is required.
16.      Technical Assistance - Training.  Development Training and
Communications Planning (DTCP) was commissioned to developed a needs-
competency approach to training. The study was completed after the close
of the project and hopefully will be utilized during the implementation of
NAEP III. Organization and Management Study. The study was executed by an
Indonesian firm and consultants with the assistance of two outsiders. The
major suggestions involved more local control, use of groups, emphasis on
extension participatory education (decreasing use of set targets) and
development of individual responsibilities (line of command). Some of O&M
recommendations are being incorporated in NAEP III. Other studies included
administrative, financial procedures and an inventory of REC planning were
satisfactorily completed.
17.      Consultants.  In addition to the consultants carrying out the
studies, twelve months of advisory services were utilized compared to 112
suggested by the SAR. It is the Region's opinion that the project might
have proceeded much more rapidly had additional consultants been brought on
board, and had more attention been given to simplification and follow-up on
organization and management.
18.      Research Extension Linkage.  While considerable effort was made to



involve research staff in the forum committee system at provincial and
district level, the very organization of research into a series of national
mandated stations in a limited number of provirces has mitigated against
the success of this strategy except on an ad-h-c basis in a few localities.
New mechanisms are needed to improve feedback to research, and to involve
researchers in problem identification, joint conduct of location specific
adaptive trials, the training of subject matter specialists, and the
planning of localized research programs with the associated development of
relevant impact points.
19.      Target Beneficiaries.  Indonesia has a well developed system of
farmer groups, which the improved extension service was able to use to good
advantage. However, it is noticeable that farmer leaders are almost always
drawn from the traditional leadership or acknowledged progressive farmers,
and that the main beneficiaries have been the more important farm families
in the community, or those with more resources. The management study drew
attention to the need to stratify farmers into subgroups, and to
specifically address resource poor farmers. A strategy for dealing with
this problem has been developed during reformulation of NAEP III.
20.      Financial Support.  GOI funding of operational monies for MAETE
and BIMAS and the Directorates of Extension were reduced during the period
1984/85 to 87/88 when they were less than half of those monies available
the first year. Financial constraints restricted travel, educational
activities, operations and maintenance of extension buildings, vehicles and
equipment. As discussed in para. 13, this was especially serious in
undermining more participation by the Estate Crop, Livestock and Fishery
DGs in the new unified service causing them to concentrate on project
activities for which they had funds and full control of staff. The
reformulated NAEP III will be adjusted to the availability of Government
funds and assurances requested for support of at least minimum levels for
effective operation of the service. Specific funds will also be earmarked
for the four DGs to ensure their active participation.
21.      Reoorting and Status of Legal Covenants.  GOI reporting was
generally satisfactory and audit reports although delayed were submitted by
the State Auditor. Compliance with covenant requirements was satisfactory,
although procurement of vehicles and PIU staff appointments were greatly
delayed.
22.      All physical activities were completed by June 1987, about 15
months behind schedule. An additional component of Integrated Pest
Management Training for staff and farmers in all provinces to combat
increased threat from brown plant hopper was carried out between January
and June 1987. The credit closed on January 20, 1988, and US$2.5 million
credit was cancelled (in addition to USS$3.0 million cancelled 1/5/85).
E. Agricultural Impact
23.      Because of the nature of the project, it is difficult to quantify
the benefits for several reasons. First the project activities were spread
throughout the 27 provinces and initiated at different times with different
audiences. Second, other variables such as appropriate new technology,
availability of inputs, credit, markets, transporation, incentives and



farmers acceptance and management abilities affect the estimation of
benefits.
24.      Increased Crop Production.  To date the main impact has been to
mainly extend information on rice, with limited attention paid to fruit,
vegetables, and secondary crops. The major agricultural impact of the
agricultural extension of NFCEP was Its success in combating the severe
attacks of brown plant hopper in the main rice areas during 1976-77. In
the years following the outbreak, the expanded corps of NAEP II field
workers promoted a shift by hundreds of thousands of small farmers to
recently released resistant rice varieties and increased usage of
fertilizers and effective insecticides.   This was followed up in 1987 by
another effective integrated pest control campaign, building on the
technical expertise and master training carried out by an FAO Project
assisting the Plant Protection Division of DGFCA. The momentum of this
program however will caly be maintained with follow-up training refresher
courses under succeeeLng years of the NAEP III Proj act. Although the
extension service alone cannot claim all the credit, it has contributed
significantly to the increase in rice production fx%m about 13 million tons
in 1976 to about 27 million tons in 1987. The Borrower reported
production of maize, cassava and groundnuts increased about 2.7% per year.
The value of agricultural products exported increased from US$2,043 million
in 1983 to US$2,527 million in 1986.
25.      Follow-on Project.  National Agricultural Extension III (Loan
2748-IND) was designed to strengthen estate crop, livestock and fishery
activities, in addition to food crops in all provinces. The project was
prepared in 1984, appraised in 1985, and went to the Board in early 1986,
which in retrospect was premature. It did not benefit from the management
study that was carried out in late 1986 and early 1987 under NAEP II, which
highlighted the shortcomings of the new organizational structure, and was
appraised before the oil price fall and incluLded recurrent funding levels
that could not be sustained. It also failed to provide specific funds for
the four DGs, undermining the active participation of the three weaker
services in the unified service. Among the other weaknesses identified and
corrected in the reformulation of NAEP III in 1987-88 were the lack of a
single line of command and appointment of responsible officers at
provincial level, provision for improved technical recommendations and
field testing, greater emphasis on an educational approach and stratifica-
tion of farmers into subgroups. The reformulated NAEP III was approved by
the Board on June 24, 1988.
F. Bank Performance
26.      The Bank played an important role, in assisting the Borrower in
the evolutionary changes of four projects from simple project to establish
research-extension and informational linkages (Agricultural Research and
Extension, Loan 1179-IND) to rice-oriented extension (NFCEP, Loan 1202-IND)
in support of the national priority efforts to increase rice production.
The NAEP II project was one of the Bank's first efforts to support an inte-
grated extension program representing four separate directorates general (Food
Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Estate Crops). The Borrower, various
consultants, and the Bank were able to identify some of the particular



- 8 -
constraints to the organization and management of very large and complex
extension programs of this sort. The newly reformulated NAEP III (Loan
2748-IND) will correct some of the earlier deficiencies.
G. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
27.      The Region considers that as a whole the project was successful in
providing the opportunities for farmers throughout the country to learn new
crop, livestock and fisheries techniques. While the nation has progressed
from being one of the world's largest importers of rice to being self-
sufficient and has made substantial increases in the production and yields
of other food crops, development of transmigration areas, estate crops,
livestock and fisheries, this is the result of mazky interactiag support
services and it is not possible to sort these out and identify the
contribution of agricultural extension. Although an Economic Rate of
Return was forecast at appraisal, in the absence of quantifiable results,
calculation of economic rate of return is not meaningful. The lessons
learned include:
(a) The agricultural extension program in Indonesia is a major
undertaking involving seven major organizations at the national
level, 27 provinces and 29,200 field agents scattered throughout
3,500 islands with primitive communication links. The evolution
of a more effective extension service is proceeding as well as
should be realistically expected.  A number of organizational
constraints have been reduced in the reformulation of NAEP III
Project. However, more time will be required to gain consensus
and application of additional improvements;
(b) The shift from a centrally directed commodity targetted production
program (rice) to multi-subsector but unified extension
educational program is a big leap dnd requires financial support
to assure the availability of Directorate (Food Crop-Livestock-
Fisheries and Estate Crop) resources, who must all have the
incentive to participate strongly in the unified extension
program;
(c) Minimum levels of operational funding are essential to maintain an
effective level of service. In the latter years of NAEP II,
insufficient funding and lack of specific allocation to the DGs
and their Dinas staff resulted in inadequate performance, and a
lack of commitment to the unified service. Sufficient annual
recurrent funding and allocation to give incentives to all
agencies involved have been agreed for the reformulated NAEP III
project;                                                I
(d) Central administration of a program of this complexity relying on
forums to implement the project without placing coordination
authority with a single person is unlikely to be successful. A
more promising approach would be a build up of provincial and
district leadership to customize extension programs to respond to
local needs, as has been recommended in the Management Study.
Under the reformulation of the NAEP III Project, one individual at
Provincial and District level is now giver the mandate to oversee



all extension activities in his region, and to see that programs
are properly prepared for forum review, and implemented when
approved;
(e) The need to stratify farmers into subgroups to better address the
needs of resource poor farmers has been a clear lesson of the
project; and mechanisms to do this under NAEP III have been
proposed; and
(f) The organization of research on a national commodity mandate basis
is hampering improved research extension linkages in most areas;
and a better structure is needed to ensure research and extension
can better collaborate to conduct adaptive trials, train subject
matter specialists, and develop more relevant seasonal research
and extension programs. Further work is required to agree an
appropriate mechanism for this, vAitch requires some restructuring
of research under the proposed Agricultural Research Management
Project now under consideration for Aank financing. The new
linkages proposed will need to be reviewed by the National
Agricultural Extension Commission for incorporation in their
seasonal extension programs.

As centained in Attachment 20, during the Ilnd
NAEP were trained 74,044 persons, namely 52,439 per-
sons, agricultural officers and 21,805 persona oont aot
farmers. If calculated in man-days, the training pro-
gram during the flnd NAEP has succeeded to achieve

Training for personnel (PPL,PPM,PPS and Exten -
gion staff) was conducted at BLPP/Agrioultural Exten-
sion Training Inatitutes, whereas training for farmers,
fisheriment contaots at BPPs/Agrioultural Extension
Istitutes.
One kind of activities whioh was very prominent
took place at the end of the lInd NAEP period, namely
the implementation of the training on Integrated Pest
Control for Brown Planthopper between February through
June 1987. In these activities have been trained 15,
707 agricultural offioers (PPL,PPM,PHP,PPS and  the
Food Crop Agricultural Service Officers) and 16,701

The adaptation training during 6 months, for   those
who have passed the Crash Program Training, also consti-
tutes a very meaningful/important training. With the im-
plementation of this program, 716 persons, who have passed
the Crash Program were appointed as PPL/Agricultural Pield
Extension Officers and had equal qualification to those who
have finished the SPP/Agricultural High School.
Besides the two kinds of training mentioned above ,
there bave also been made many revisions in the lInd NARP
conesrning the training type and duration. These revisions
had been made to meet the requirements of a trainin , name
ly in order that it would be in accordance with the devel-
opment of the agricultural technology and the agricultural
extension methodology.
b, Fellowships.
Attachment 21 also contains data concerning the fellow
ships program, implemented during the IInd NAEP, both for
in the home country as well as overseas fellowships. A
number of 686 persons have utilized this opportunity,among
which 371 persons abroad. If calculated in man/months, then
the fellowship program during the IInd NAEP have succeeded
to reach 7.582 man/months or 307% from the SAR target.

Bachelor, sucoe ded in obtaining a complete Sarjana degree
(3 persons failed), 50 PPSs obtained the degree of Master
of Science (S2), 50 persons have finished the Diploma IV
program, 25 persons have finished the Diploma III program,
and 90 persons have followed an English language   course
for three months. The study assignment in the home country
was conducted in cooperation with several State Universities
namely the IPB in Bogor, the UGH in Yogyakarta, the UNPAD
in Bandung, the UNIBRAW in Malang and the DIKLAT  AUP in
Jakarta.
Of the 371 persons assigned to a study abroad, 12 PPSs
have succeeded in obtaining their MSc degrees and  4 PPSs
have succeeded in obtaining their Ph.D degrees   whereas
the others have followed a short term program, namely 290
person for a 3 months term, 2 persons for a 7 months term,
50 persons for a 15 days term, and 13 persons participated
in various seminars in the periods of 7 - 14 days. The
SAR target of 133 persons for training within a 15 days
term, was realized for only 50 persons, because there is
a provision of Bappenas, which cannot Justify a training
abroad of less than 3 months, whereas the target of 20
persons for the MSc program, was only able to be realized
16 persons due to the lack of candidates meeting      the
language requirements (Toefl Score : 500).
c. Consultancy ...

a. Consultancy.
The kinds of activities , the findings    and   the
application of recommendation can be seen in Attachment
22. The experts who have participated in said activities
and their performance is presented in Attachment 23 ,
whereas the ratio between the plan and target in the SAR
and the revision and realization is contained in Attach-
ment 24.
The data on this consultancy  indicate   that many
revisions have occurred towards the plan in the SAR. This
was especially to adjust to the Government policy in con-
ducting agrlcultural extension which in the lInd   NAEP
period has experienced many changes.
Ik comparison with the SAR implementation schedule,
the implementation of the consultancy activities is much
delayed (the studies have only been carried out in the
last years). The causes were :
a) the changes in the NAEP managemnt and staff.

4. Additional Personnel.
1. Implementation Procedure.
The recruitment of food crop agricultural extension
officers was conducted in the Centre and in the district
by the B114S3/Mass Guidance. For non-food   crop exten-
sion officers this was conducted by the respective
Directorates General.
The PPL and PPS candidates, respectively with
the requirement of having finished/graduated from the
SPP -and Faculty of Agriculture or something equal with
in agriculture. The candidate meeting the requirements
was appointed as honorary officer and stationed in a
region which requires such an officer. The PPMs were
selected from the senior PPLs with a minimum 3-4 years
work experience. All PPLs, PPNs and PPSs should follow
an oriebtation training and basic training, a technical
training and special skill training.

The provision of funds originating from credits and
government contribution each year up to the budget year of
1983/1984 were budgetted through the NABP DIP ( Approved
Project List) allocated to the Centre and the regions.
Whereas, part of the incremental costs were also budgetted
in the DIP of the sub-sector within the Department of Agri
oulture, both in the Centre as well as in the regions.
Starting with the 1984/1985 budget year, all budgets were
included in the NAEP DIP of the Centre. The DIPs were valid
for 3 (three) years, but since the 1985/1986 budget year
for only I (one) year.. Effective from the 1986/1987 budget
year funds for direct payment to the supplier the detail
should be included in the DIPs and POn.
Because there was no SIAP anymore, the budget balance
of the temporary burden, which was not used up through Maroh
31 each year had to be re-deposited with the State Exohequer.
Whereas the fixed burden budget already oontracted but not
yet released through March 31, should be included to the
next budget year.
2. Implementation of fund provision.
The 1980/1981 budget only provided part of the funds
required, because the DIPs were prepared long before April
1, 1980, when the NAZP Agreement was signed. The funds
were provided in the following budget years.
Th delay in the release of funds for fixed and tempo-
rary burdens and for direct paymentu,caused the utilization o
the *....
160688



the budget for project activities was also delayed. There
fore the budget utilization were accumulated in the last
years of the project.
3. Fund utilization.
a. Buildings.
The fund for building procurement, namely for  the
construction, design  id supervision, was 100% from the
Bank. The cost utilized on the whole was US$ 13,678,000
(76.8%) from the original plan of US$ 17,800,000 (100%),
whereas the physical volume based on the unit reached
134.6%. Nevertheless, there was a  saving  of  cost of
US$ 4,122,000.
b. Extension Materials, Equipment and Vehicles.
The procurement cost for extension materials was
95% z 5%, equipment 95% : 5%.or 65% : 35% depending on
the origin of the equipment concerned, whereas for two-
wheel-and four-wheel vehioles 100% from the Indonesian
Government, except for the 1,020 two-wheel vehioles 100%
financed by the Bank. The utilization of costs from the
Bank was US$ 6,493,000 (88.9%)   from   the  planned
USO  7,300,000 in which a part of the procurement    was
completed, so that there was a cost saving of US$ 807,000.
On the other hand the government cost contribution   be-
came US$ 2,703,000 (207.99%)    from     the     planned
US$ 1,403,000. This was caused by the increase of   two-
wheel vehicles procurement.
On

WTWP



U'
On the whole the ut. zation of costs from the Bank
and the Government beoame US$ 9,196,000 (106,9%);  of the
planned US$ 8,600,000 an increase of US$ 596,000 due to an
increase in the volume of goods procurement.
o. Training, Fellowship, and Consultation.
The costs for training, fellowships and consultation
were 1009 from the Bank. The utilization of training costs
reached US$ 11,886,000 (239.1%) from the planned
US$- 4,970,000 so that there was an additional cost of US$
6,916,000 whereas the implementation of the training based
on man/days reached 184.6%. The additional coats were due
to the increase in the activity volume,
The utilization of costs for fellowship reached US$
3,370,000 (48.6%) compared with the planned US$ 6,930,000
a decrease in costs of US$ 3,560,000 but the physical plan
based on man/months reached 307.4%.
The utilization of fellowships costs reached US$
3,370,000 (48.6%) compared with the planned us$ 6,930,000
which made a decrease in costs of US$ 3,560,000 but the
physical plan reached based on man/months was 307.4%.
The consultation utilization cost of US$ 1,100,000
(110%) from the planned US$ 1,000,000 made a cost increase
of US$ 100,000, whereas the consultation activities based
on man/months reached 71.5% because of additional kinds of
activities.
The
160688
W-T



The utilization of government constribution   costs
for additional personnel was US$ 48,355,000 (143.574) of
the original pla}  of US3 33*700,000, in which the real -
ization of additional Personnel reached 245i%. -he  ad!i-
tion&1 costs were besides due wo the additional   volume
were also caused by tha addiwional value in   the   unit
costs for the payment of salaries, vehicle   operational
costs etc. due to the rupiah value devaluation.
As a consequence of the change in volume  and  kind
of activities which brought about a change in the fund
allocation for each category and the decrease in costs
caused by the value increase of the US$ towards  the Rp.
which was still lower than the price increase in Rp., so
the government contribution reached US$ 51,058,000
(127.99%) from the planned US$ 39,910,000,  whereas  the
Bank credit implemented was US$ 36,526,866.92 (87%),  so
that a saving occurred of US? 5,473,133.08 (13%),    see
attrehment 26.
With the above saving3, it means that' the unallocat
ad funds was practically not utilized. The credit savings
resulted in the occurrence of credit cancellations. The
credit cancellations occurred twice, namely on October 5,
1985 of US$ 3,OOO,OO0 and on January 22, 1988 of
US$ 2,473,133.08.

Ne. Withdrawal of the Credit Funds.
I* Implementation procedures of the withdrawal of funds.
The drawing of assistance funds fcir the financing
of the fixed and temporary burdens advanced by the gov-
erament, was carried out in accordanoe with the reim-
bursement procedures, and the   drawing of assistance
funds for diroot payments was carried out in accord-
ance with the disbursement procedures.
Starting with the budget year of 1986/1987, the
drawing of assistance funds for categories I and TI
expenditures was carried out by SXO*.E and for direct
payments through B.I (Bank Indonesia) without   going
through the Director General of Monetary Affairs any-
More.
2, implementation of the schedule for assistance   funds
drawing.
The delay of assistance funds drawing was oaused
by the delay in the implementation of the proceding
activties, nmely the provision of funds, the comple-
tion of the SPJs of the Regions, the forwarding of
fixed burden demand for payment, the issuance of SPPs/
SPNs and the forwarding of domenda for direct payment.
The speoified plan and implementation of the draw-
ing of foreign assistance is as oontained in attaoh-
ment 27. One matter has a considerable influence on
the .....
160688
WrUT



the implementation of the drawing of funds,  namely    the
difference in budget years, in wdhich the gover=ent's budt
et year started in April through March, waereas the 'World
Bank's budget sw:arted in 3anuary th-ough December.
The dra-wng of funds in the 1980/1931   budget  year
was not carried out, not only because the funds   provided
was in the small DIP, but also in December 1980, the SPM
was not yet issued so that it could not yet be applied.
Up to the 1983/1984 budget year, the cumulative dra-wr
ing of funds only reached 17.64, fro= the planned 64.3%.
This was due to the delaj in the co=mletion of the SPO and
the forwarding of demand for payment of the fixed   burden
from the regions.  Said delay was especially   due  to the
still lacking in capability in the financial administra
tive funds drawing sector,
Up to the 1984/1985 budget year the accumulative
funds-drawing reached 40.6% of the planned 92.8'. A  suf -
ficiently large decrease after all administrative affairs
of funds drawing was handled by the Centre. With the
credit cancellation on October 5, 1985 of Rp. 3,000,000,
the implementation of funds drawing cumulatively   reached
47.5% from the planned 100%, see Attachment no. 27. Fur  -
ther at the end of the conclusion of the financial adminia
tration on January 1988, the funds drawing reached 87j; and
the credit balance of US$ 2,473,133.08 was cancelled   for
the second time.

IV. PROJECT IMPLME1ENTATION DZSCRI?TION
A. Construction work.
1. Land preparation.
If there were delays in the procurement  of   a
building which often occurred, it was  because of the
factor of land provision and preparation. To overcome
this problem, the preparation in land provision   was
conducted earlier or the building allocation is moved
to another province where the land is already avail -
able, while continuing to observe the building re   -
quirements in accordance with the provisions and plan.
2. Building Procurement.
The provision of building land at the location
was generally timely in accordance with the work sche
dule, except in remote regions with    transportation
problems, in particular in the rainy season in which
delays often occured. Therefore, besides the building
materials which were already adjusted to a   suitable
design for the location area, the work  schedule   of
the construction was regulated in accordance with the
field and the local season. Only if compelled, then a
contract addendum for extension of the   construction
time was made.
B. Materials for extension, Preparation and Vehicles.

The log-books for extension officers, although they
are very useful to record the work plan, the work re -
suits end the problems encountered as well as the solu-
tiomns, however the major part of the procure=ent     is
transferredI to the development.budget by the Bappenas/
National Development Planning Board.
The utilization of the extension media  had   been
selected in accordance with the effectiveness,the level
of development of the farmers community and the exten -
sion apparatus as well as the demand as required,    so
that the procurement volume of the printed media con -
stituting brochures and extension magazines,  was  ver7
-uch increased. Likewise were the electronic media, name
ly films, video cassettes and colour slides,  developed
in connection with operational mobile extension   units
and farming courses at BPPs.
2. Equipment.
-- The basic extension equipment package was conduct-
ed in the regions. The change in technical,  kind   and
volume specifications often occurred due to the diffi -
culties in obtaining suitable goods.
This change was also caused by :
a) the occurrence of project management =atations,   so
that the procurement of equipment still not yet im -
plemented could not be accurately monitored.
160688                                           b) the
WINMT



WO -
b) the occurrence of mutations in personnel handling the
projects which was due to the shifting - within   the
project as well as outside the project.
c) the unit cos' prices which were too small so that the
procurement of said goods could not.be carried out in
several regions.
d) the inavailability of goods completely in one package
in the regions.
Although those changes had taken place,  the   equipment
package of each BPP was still met and in accordance with
the demand.
The special extension equipment paokage was   not
conducted in the regions, because it was difficult to ob-
tain, so that it was carried out in the Centre.       The
technical, kind and volume specifications were   changed
in accordance with the commodity production increase pro
gram development in each subsector.
3. Vehicles.
In accordance with the development in the fields
the transportation means for the extension. officers
which were not suitable any more because they were less
practical, such as borses, bicycles, and motor vehicles
of which the maintenance and operational cost was high
such as motor boats and 4 wheel rehicles, their procure-
ment was greatly decreased. Likewise, the Wkelotok" of
160688                                             which

which the procurement has not been included, was addi-.
tic.ally procured as an alternative motor vehicle for
river transportation for extension officers  in  the
A_D  man:an region, was not comtinued any more  because
it was not practical.
On the other hand, motorcycles which have a bigh
mobility, their procurement had been highly increaseds
in accordance with the increasing number of extension
officers involved in the agricultural commodity produc
tion increase program development for the domestic mar
ket, and moreover for the export. In this  case   were
included the motorcycles for pest observing   officers
in the framework of the eradication of the brown lo -
cust/hopper in accordance with Presidential Instruc  -
tion No. 3/1985.
C. Training, Study Assignment and Consultation.
1. Training.
Data on the implementation of Training are con -
tained :n Attach=ents 20 and 21. Said data    indicate
that in the implementation many revisions  have   been
made towards the plan in the SLR, concerning the kinds
of training, the duration as well as the   number   of
participants. These revisions were made to adjust to
the extension development method as well as to the pro
gress in technology as proposed by the   regions   and
160688                                         approved

approved by the Directorate General of the    respective
sub-sectors. Besides, there was the outbreak of the
brown locust pest which threatened the preservation   of
the rice self-sufficiency. The revisions were made early
in the budget year and shall obtain the  approval of the
3akarta R.S.I.
Among the revisions made, several of the   pro   -
minent/significant ones are as follows :
a) The Orientation Training was revised into Orientation
and Basic Training of which the duration of 21   days
became 30 days.
b) The tactical training for PPLs/PPSs was conducted to
accommodate various urgent technical requirements# a-
mong others for :
(1) The adjustment for 716 PPLs, graduates from the
crash program, for 6 months.
(2) The training in integrated posts/Brown Locust Con
trol (IPC), for 7 days.
c) The special skill training for the farmers/fishermen
contacts;
(1) The training for certain commodities skill for 7
days, 4,861 farmers/fishermen contacts have been
trained.
(2) The training for integrated pests/brown    locust
control for about 2 to 5 days, 17,977 farmers con
tacts have been trained.
160688                                             d) in



/I.
d) In view of the.already available adequate facilities,
the technical training for PPSs was sufficiently i=ple-
mented at the Ciawi IPLPP and several BLPPS (Ciheao 3a-
yu-ambon etc.) i't was not necessary to conduct   it  at
universities.
The extension officers training has developed in
kind as well as in volume. Because the facilities    at
BPLPs, IPLPPs and BKPIs were not capable to accommodate
the participants (the 1980-1981 budget year through the
1985/1986 budget year), so training facilities at State
SPPs, hotels and other places which met the reouire   -
ments were utilized for training.
The training curriculum in the 1980/1981 budget
year through the 1983/1984 budget year still used the
curriculum model oriented at theory and practice, since
the 1984/1985 budget year, the curriculum   utilization
based on work competency was started in accordance with
thieBPLPP. For this purpose, the trainers including the
FPSs had been given training on the composition of the
skill element and the application there-of during the
training. The need for equipment and training increased
for each type of skill given. The training praticipants
obtained skill materials in accordance with the require
ments connected with the task of his work.
The Farming Course started to be conducted    in
the budget year of 1985/1986 in accordance   with   the
160688                                          demand

- IL -
demand in connection with the production increase programs
for various subsectors' commodities, including the course for
the eradication of the brown plant hopper in the budget year
of 1986/1987. In these various courses had also been en-
deavoured the application of the curriculum based on the
work competency.
The personnel administration for extension officers,
could no longer be handled manually because the number and
data on the extension officers have already reached about
30,000 persons. The personnel administration system for
extension officers was further processed through  a  caom-
puter so that a computer training for the administrative
officers for extension personnel and operators originating
from the BP Bimas and SP Bimas was conducted.
2. Fellowships.
As the data presented in Attachment 21, in  its  im.
plementation, this fellowship plan underwent many revi-
sions, on the type as well as on the duration. Said revi-
sions were made to meet the demand in accordance with the
development of tchnology and extension methods as well as
to meet the provisions of the Bappenas. The following are
proinsnt cases in the implementation of the study Assign-
ments.
a) Short Term Study Assignments Abroad : Learning from ex-
perionce In the assignmet of the first two persons
(tbieh was necessarily extended from 6 to 7 months)
this ..
160688
vWm*



I ,J
this program was changed into 3 months, with this revisdion
it was possible to assign 292 persons of the planned 75
persons. The training curriculum followed was adjusted
with the demand for extension methodology in the specific
agricultural technology still rare in Indonesia.
b) Domestic Master Program ;
The target of 50 persons was reached, with the provision
that 5 are still in thr process of completion. To give
an appreciatioi/acknowledgement to the PPMs who already
were in possession of bachelor's degree and made a good
performance in the program, a program for   a  complete
Sarjana Degree (SI) was included for 100 PPMs (3 persons
of which dropped out).
a) Master Program Abroad ;
Due to the program in recruiting candidates meeting  the
English language requirement (TOEFL score 500) from the
planned_20 persons, only 16 were realized. Several candi-
dates who were approachlng the requirement were  tried to
continue the language course during 3 - 6 months  abroad
apparently succeeded in completing their study fairly well.
d) Short Term Training and Participation in Seminars ,
Workshops and Conferences ;
The short-term trainings were only realized for 50 per-
sons, whereas the participation in seminars, workshops
and
160688
WHVT



and conferences on extension, was only realized for 13
persons, which was caused by the provision of Bappenas
that loan funds should not be used for the purpose of
study assignments abroad with a duration of less than
3 months.
e) Completion of Diploma Program;
At the end of the lInd NAEP period some savings  were
made as a consequence of the government policy in the
monetary sector (rupiah devaluation). By the RSI., a
part of this fund was approved to be used to finance
the completion of two Diploma Program, namely the Fish
ery Undertaking Expert Diploma 4 Program (50 persons,
% months) and the Cattle reproduction Diploma 2 Program
.(25 persons, 3 months).
3. Consultancy.
The data on the realization of consultation oan be
seen in Attachment 24. The benefit of technical consulta-
tion for the non-food arops sub-sector was felt as insuffi
oient so that it was nullified. On the other hand, the
oonsultation which facilitated the project management and
the activities involved with the project were developed
such as the inventory taking at the BPPs and its develop-
ment plan, the training curriculum based on the work comP
petenoy as well as the personnel administration system
for extension officers.

While the contract period of consultants in the financial
report sector which had problem in the NAEP financial
data collection and prooessing, was extended without ad-
ditional costs.
Do. Additional Personnel.
I* Stationing/Placement of Extension Officers.
In the first year it was difficult to get PPL& and
PPSs who were willing to be stationed outside the islands
of Java and Bali, especially in remote regions. However,
with the further increase of the number of people who
had finished the SPP and the (S1) Sarjana Program, and
with the more and more limited employment opportunities,
those graduates were willing to work outside Java and
Bali. In particular for PPSs among others were occupied
by PPMs who have completed the Master's Program, which
is financed  by the NAEP numbering 100 persons (passed:
97 persons) as well as by PPMs/PPLs who had succeeded
in completing the Sarjana Program through their own
efforts.
2. Recruitment of Extension Officers.
The number of slots for extension officers was not
in line with the number of extension officers who were
still honorary, where most of tLem had already    been
honorary officers for almost 3 - 4 years. However,
with the managing of the administration of extension
personnel ...

personnel by the BP Bimas, which should be completed at
the latest on March 31, 1986, the slots for  extension
officers were increased in accordance with the  demand,,
and even exceeded the SAR plan.
E. Fulfillment of Guarantees.
1. Organization and Finance.
a); Organization and Project Personnel.
The stipulation of the organization   and  the
appointment of 100 full time project personnel   of
which was promised to be met on July 1, 1980   was
carried out in praotioal way in accordanoe with the
need and development.
b) Financial supervisor and auditor.
The funds had been provided each year through
DIPs at the Centre and Regions up to the 1983/1984
budget year and there after only at the Centre up to
the 1987/1988 budget year. In general the project
financial reports had already been well conducted.
The preparation was conducted simultaneously,
respectively from 1980 through 1982/1983 and from
1984 through 1986/1987 by 2 (two) different public
auditors. The financial audit was conducted by a
9PKP/Finanoe and Development Supervision Board Team
from .....

from the Ministry of Finance, although the said audit
was not conducted based on a fixed schedule. This was
due to the fact that at the time of the audit, the pro-
ject financial reports were in the completion process
stage.
2. Buildings.
a)l Land for Head Office.
The land for the construction of the project head
office in Pasar Minggu had been prepared adjacent to

VY. DESCRIPTION OF FINANCINf IHPILEENTATIOW
A. Financing.
1. Government Policy.
a. Production Increase Pro
In the framework of the  -forts for self-suffi-
cient in rice and to increase the production  of
agricultural export oommodity, the number of exten-
sion facilities and infra-structures have been
increased exceeding the SAR. Therefore  the 
sharing of the incremental costs increased to 143.5%,
the coat for the procur-ement of two-wbwel vehicles,
extension materials and equipment increased to 207.9%.
This was caused by the increase in unit cost   for
material, equipment and vehicle. Meanwhile the costs
for extension training which originated  from  the
World Bank also increased to 239.1%. This is in
view that extension workers as the motor of the
extension and the backbone of the production in-
crease program, their capability should be enhanced
in line with the growing demand, and provided with
appropriate extension facilities and infrastructures.
b- RUpiah Devaluation
During the progress  of the  project, 2 (two)
times rupiah devaluations towards the US$ ocourred,
namely
160688
WHWT



- au -
namely in 1983 and 1986. These caused :
a)' the value of the disbursement was decreased so that
there was a saving, o) the rupiah expenditures as counter.
part funds was increased.
2. Budget Provision
a. Unit Cost Stipulation
The influence of the inflation towards the provision
of funds was already contained in the unallocated funds
which constituted price contingencies. The unit costs
could be adjusted each year. There problem was in the
provision of funds, where the unit costs in the DIP each
year, for certain activities were not suitable anymore
with the prevailing standard price, so that  those  ac-
tivities could not be implemented. A DIP revision which
takes 2 - 3 months was required. The result was that the
budget release to carry-out the activities   and   to
accountability report were delayed. To shorten the revi-
sion time, a regulation was issued, so that the revi -
sion can be conducted by the Project Manager,   or  let
Echelon Level or Bappenas and Budget,  in  accordance
with the number of unit and the amount of funds to be
revised.
b. Pr11catAdministration
Only small part of the 1980 / 1981 budget provision
could ....
160688
rsWT



- ol -
could be included in the DIP, because the Loan Ap'ee-
ment was only signed on April 3, 1980, whereas the DIP
should be prepared  at the latest 3 months before. The
project activity schedule was revised, and the budget
was included in the DIP of the following year       in
accordance with the plan.
N. Withdrawal of the Assistance Funds.
1. Application Documents.
Through the 1983/1984 budget year, the application
supporting documents sent from the regions were often
incomplete, and causing the delayed of the submission
of the application documents, and the disbursement was
low. Starting from the 1984/1985 budget year, the sub-
mission of the disbursement application for the Cate-
gory r used the SOE/State of Expenditure as an effort
to increase the reimbursement submission to the World
Bankc.
2. Prooedure for claim for payment and SPJI.
The procedure for the submission of  claim   for
payment for the procurement of building and goods from
the Region to the Project and further to the Direa -
torate General of Budgets W2s already simplified /
shortened so that it required less time, whereas th*
submission of the SPJ from the Region was accelerated.
This 
160688
vmRW



- 82 -
This matter could be carried out because the executors
of the building and equipment procurement as well as
the PUNK were more skilled after they had been trained,
Therefore the volume disbursement application to the
World Bank was increased.
C. Financing Guarantee.
1. Finance.
The GOI had already conducted the financing in
accordance with the provisions of the SAR. Moreover
from the total contribution of US $ 39,9  million
(48.7%), US $ 51.06 million was expended or 58.3%  of
the SAR terget, whereas the World Bank's credit  oa
US $ 42 million (51.3%) only US $ 36.5 million  was
utilized or 41.7% of the SAR target, attachment 26.
2. Reporting and Finance.
The GOI has already carried out the bookkeeping
of_eaoh KEpenditure, contained in a financia.b report
simultaneously of the respective years of 1980/1981
through 1982/1983 and 1984/1985 through 1986/1987.
The preparation of the reports were carried out by 2
(two) different public accountants and was already
audited by the BPKP (State Auditor).
3. Financing from the World Bank.
The GOI has already submitted applications   to
the World Bank for each kind of expenditure based on
the .....
160688

the category and status of the origin of the goods in
accordance with the % as stipulated in the Disburse -

So. IUstitutional Development.
1. Meaning of Project Management Institute.
a. Directorate General er aslt.
This projeot has during the four budget year
of i980/1981 through 1983/1984 been managed by the
Direotorate General of Pood Crops Agriculture on
behalf or the AAEMT. While the NFCEP itself, which
was started in the 1976/1977 budget year was only
completed in the 1982/1983 budget year, i.e.   in
December 1982, so that in the three  first  years
NAST was managed jointly with the NFCEW by one pro-
ject implementing unit under the auspices or the
Direotorate General of Food Crops Agriculture.
b.  APPP   egfrx Aricultural Education  Traini
and Extension. AAETEN..
lh line with the development, on April 16,
1984, this project was transferred from the Direc-
torate General of Food Crops Agrioulture   to  the
AAZTL. The project was managed by the AAERT during
3 budget years; 1984/1985 through 1986/1987, after
the duration ot the projeot was extended for one
year.

The organization of the Project at central      level
constitutes a Project Directorate  which   besides    the
task to carry out the project activities,   shall    also
oonduct the function of a liaison and guidance of the Direc-
torate General of Food Crops for the food crop agricultural
extension staff in the provinces and regions.  This   was
possible because there was no Directorate of Food   Crops
Agricultural Extension which was really greatly required.
The appointment of full time officers for the project in-
cluding the Project M4anager's Assistants originating from
all subsectors, could only be met in accordance with the
Decision Letter of the Director General of Food Crops
Agricultural No. A5.81.61 dated October 3, 1981, as the
result of a consultation with the Head of the Agricultural
Education, Training and Extension Agency/BPLPP.
The coordinated extension at  the   national   level
obtains directives from the Agricultural Extension Advi -
sory Working Group, chaired by the  Head  of the   BPLPP
with the Director General of AgricuYwural F?od Crops  as
daily executor, in accordance with the Decree of the 1inis-
ter of Agriculture No. 664/1987.
In accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 20/

Agriculture* The extension in the tranamigration    area
which was originally handled by all subsectors through
projects within the Directorate General of TIansmigration
since the budget year 1980/1981, was hendled by NAEP.
b. The Project and AAEFT
The projects were transferred to AAETl in view that
since the issuance of the Deoree of the Minister of Agri-
culture No. OT.210/7D%/Kpts/9/1983, the Agency was given
the responsibility to organize the extension coordination
at central level, compose the extension policy and metho-
dology in Line with the Presidential Decree No. 24/1983.
As a Central PIU/Project Implementation Unit appoint.

through the end of the project, the e5tablia nt of BEC
in those areas were given priorit<.  The procurement of
special equipment for the extension in the subsectors of
Estates, livestock and fishery has been carried out in
Central PIU,3 Whereas special technical training for the
non-food crops subsectors, supporting   the   production
increase programs have been increased in their types and
number.
The project's Organisation and task at the central
level consisting of the Cental Project Implementation
Unit/CPIU which initially was established based on the
Decision Letter of the Project Manager. was only atipulat

by the Read of the Educetiou  Training and Mteonsion Agen-
cy, with the Secretary of the Bimas s/ass Guidance Control
as Deputy Chairman and the Read of the Agricultural Exten-
sion Centre as Secretary. The establishment of the KPPN
itself was based on the Decree of the Minister of Agri-

3. Development of other Extension Institution involved in
the Project.
a. B¢MASMhU88 Guldance, Control Unit.
in the establishment of the BIMAS  Control   Unit
based on the Presidential Decree No. 6/1979,      among
others its task is to recruit and manage the personnel
administration of the PPLs and PPSs for Food Crops.
The extension officers are administratively under the
Bimas Control Unit, however, teihnicall  they are under
the Directorate General of Food Crops   Agi oAulture ,
whereas the secretary of the Bimas Control Unit is also
the Director General of Food Crops Agriculture.
Based on the Presidential Deoree No. 62/1983 dated
December 8, 1983, the Bimas CQntrol Unit becomes the
Bimas Control Agency which task is not only implement-
ing the food orop production increase program, but also
that of horticulture, livestock, fishery and  estates,
through ....

through the basio effort of intensifioation. The seoretary
of the Bimas Control Agenoy was particularly appointed and
no longer the Director General of Food Crops Agriculture.
In the efforts to achieve an integrated extension system
(unified extension) based on the Decree of the Minister
of Agriculture 143/1985 dated March 11, 1985, all agri.
cultural extension officers managed by  the   Directorate
General and the AAETE were transferred to the Bimas Con-
trol Agenc7, and this transfer should be completed at the
latest by March 31, 1986.

concerning the credits on the function  of  agricultural
extensimi officer, so the job of agricultural  extension
officer is acknowledged as a funotional job. Therefore the
status,, appointment, hierarchy, salary and promotion  in
rank for the extension officer became clear.
b. Extension Directorate.
In accordance with the Presidential Decree No. 24
/ 1983, th Extension Directorates at the Directorate
General .....
160688
WHWT



Generals of all subseoctors within the Department of Agri-
culture were established. The extension Directorate    is
responsible for the achievement of the target   of    the
PrToduction increase program through the implementation of
extension among the subsectors at central level and sub-
sectors at provincial level handled by the Extension Sub-
Service ('sub-dinas).
The Extension Directors are members of  the    KPPN/
National Agricultural Extension Commision, who therefore
will strengthen and improve the implezentation   of   the
agricultural extension coordination.
a. Rural Extension Centre (REC).
The Rural Extension Centres established since the
NFCEP and NAEP II are 1,402 units. They are scattered all
over the Provinces, mostly in wet land areas,  others  in
tranamigration areas, dry land areas and coastal   areas.
Therefore, their role as extension infrastructures   in
fluencing the achievement of the extension objectives be-
came more important. In view of the implementation      of
agricultural extension function has been transferred   to
regional goverment affair and to increase the effective-
ness and the status of the REC, a joint decree was iasued
by the Minister of Rome Affairs and the Minister of Agri-
culture Number i
695/Kpts/LP.120/11/1986
concerning ...
160688
Nw,



concerning the guidelines for the implementation of agri-
cultural extension, In this way the REC becomes       an
organic unit within the lInd Level District Government
of which the management promotion is conducted by the
Regent/Municipality mayor, Head of the District and the
Governor, Head of the lst Level Region (Province)   with
the assistance of the Head of the Regional Office of the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Head of the Provincial Ser-
vice and the Technical Implementation Unit (such as BIP
and BLPP) within the Department of Agriculture.
For the RECs astablished by the Directorate General
of Food Crops Agriculture not yet transferred   to  the
regional government, the responsibility for the adminis-
trative control is entrusted to the Bimas ControlAgency.
d. Extension in connection with the conservation problem.
The extension in connection with the land conserva-
tion and-reafforestation problems was initially conduct-
ed in coordination with the NAEP project. However, since
the stipulation of the Direotorate General of  Forestry
to become the Ministry of Forestry, separated from the
Ministry of Agriculture based on the Presidential Decree
No. 24/1983, the coordination becomes the responsibility
of the Pusluhtan/Agricultural Extension Center of the BPLPP..
4. Recruitment of Staff and Training.
In the efforts to strengthen the project as a Projeot
Directorate  personnel   requirement  of about 100 persons
was .....
160688



was stipulated. To increase/improve the capabilities   in
OOMmunioation and management, part of the staff have  to
participate in English language course, management train-
ing and seminar, in the home country as well as abroad.
Further, as Projeot Implementation Unit, the number
of project personnel deoreased into about 60 person&. In
particular for the Project Manager's Proxies   and    the
Holders of the work advance money/PUNKs in the   regions,
part of them had paticipated in the project   management
training at the end of 1986 in the framework of accelerat-
ing the completion of the project.
In the management of the personnel administration
for the extension officers, a computer training       was
conducted for 76 officers in the centre and in the regions,
In accordance with the adinistration system to be applied.
B. Institutional Problems
1. Project Institutional Problems.
a. Project Dirootorate.
1. As a continuation of NFCEP, the project had beoome
more directed and established in the implementation
of its funotion, so that it was capable in establish-
ing a good cooperation with all subsectors      and
other agencies involved in the implementation   of
agricultural extension.
2. The ..
1hWT



2, The guidance of the implementation of the extension
activities conducted in a regular and continuous way,
had increased and developed the adoption of the LAKU/
Training and Visiting system in 13 Provinces of the
NFCEP and in 13 new provinces. Besides, the technical
impact points had been developed in connection with
the social and ecoromic impact points, therefore it
could give an alternative in solving the problems in
an integrated and systematic way.
3. The project budget was allocated in the DIPs  of  the
regions as part of the P2TP/Food Crop Production In-
crease Project. This had caused the lack of apeed in
the application and realization of reimbursements ,
although this was inseparable from the weakness   in
the financial management division, in particular the
reimbursement affairs section.
4. Up_to the first 2 (two) years of the project implementa
tion, the project axecutors in the 13 new provinces
did not know and had not yet mastered the financial
administration system and procedures well, so   that
they could not facilitate the smoothness    in   the
application and re-imbursement implementation.
5. The extension activities at provincial, district and
field levels, had been implemented intensively   and
dynamically in line with the agricultural development
dynamios, in particular the food crop subsector.
The *.g..
160688



The existenee of a gap in the extension betweer food
crops and nc,-food crops sub-sectors, was obvious at
field level.
b. Pr   ctImlamentation Unit.
1* As a PIU/Projeot Implementation Unit, the NAEP was as-
signed to assist in the implement.ation of the struc-
tural activities, in this case of the Education, Train-
ing and Extension Agency (AAETE) and the    functional
activities of the Extension Directorates  within   the
Ministry of Agriculture, its competency in the implemen-
tation of the extension is decreasing.
2. The project officer in the centre, who handled the im-
portant affairs were frequently changed so that   tbis
caused dlmdvantages in the implementation of the pro-
jeot, particularly in the first year of PIU,    where
most of the experined staff remained with the Director-
ate General of Food Crops Agriculture. This was   one
of the reason for the decrease of the project activiti-
e8s
3. The application and reimbursements could be conducted
more accurately and quiexly. This was among    others
due to the project budget, which was unified in one
DIP at the Centre.
4. The project acti-tties in the region were handled by the
Regional ...
160688
WMIT



Regional Office of the Ministry of Agriculture, a LPP
/SPP and BIP and did not sufficiently  involve   the
subsector, which had oaused lack of sense of belong-
ing of the sub-sector towards the NAEP.
2. Relation among Extension Institutions.
a. Extension Coordination.
1. The preparation of the integrated extension implemen-
tation program at Central, Provincial and    District
levels were not sufficiently conducted, whereas the
preparation of the integrated extension  program  at
EEC area level was generally been implanted, alttough
the operational implementation of the  program   was
not yet smooth.
2. Each subseotor and other extension agencies has a
tendency to carry out their own extension activities
separately in accordance with the budget   available
in-their respective projects.
b. The Assi m nt of Extension Officers.
The personnel administration management   of   the
extension officers by the Bimas Control Agency was di-
rected to an integrated per'sonnel management system. rt
was felt necessary that the assignment of extension of-
flcers be based on their capabilities, particularly for
area where the dominant undertakings were brackish water
fishery and fish catching. The assignments of  tha  ex-
tension officers should be emphasized on their function,
170688                                        because ...
wr



booause there were still many servioe and regulatory
works were assigned to them.
a. Farmers Gkoupw*
The integrated farmers groups development whicA
have sub-activities on common interested should still
be improved particularly those involving  mall far.
mers who are not yet reached by the extension.
G. Extension Organization and Management Consultancy.
The result of the Agricultural Ectension Organiza-
tion and Nanagement Corsultanoy recommended the need of
one-line of command in the efforts to apply a unified
extension services at Central, provincial, district and
field levels. Hbwever, the recommendation   should   be
further studied.
In the financial consultancy, a special  financial
administration system for the NAEP project was establish
ed, but could not be implemented because  it was   not
consistant with the existing Government Poflcy/r.gula -
tions. The personnel administration consultant ha& re-
commended a personnel administration system   for   the
extension officers and a personnel computerization
package program for agricultural extension officers.

VII. ECONOMIC ASPECT REVIEW
A. Production Increase.
one of the objectives of the agricultural sector de-
velopment is to increase agricultural yield prod.ction. o
meet the domestic demand as well as for export. These ob -
jectives were achieved through the production increase pro
grams of various commodities. Therefore,   all   elements,
whether extension, organization or services were simultane
ously involved to support said program. Various   policies
were composed and implemented, including the following mat
tars:
1. a flexible agricultural extension organization manage -
ment system was applied in accordance with the develop-
ment and in line with the research and development pol-
i' y of agricultural technology and the  expansion   and
improvement of the irrigation networ'.
2. an-independent and participative farmers  /   fishermen
group develkopment directed to become unified   into  an
undertaking vehicle, cooperative and bensficial in na -
ture for the farmers and fishermen.
3. the stipulation of stable prices, in harmony with con -
trolled modifications, connected with a selective sub -
sidy granting and a dynamic trade policy for production
facilities and agricultural yield comodities.
The regulated, orderly and continuous extension im-
plementation itself with the LAKU/Training  and   Visiting

System, had increased the capabilities of the farmers
and fishermen in the farming undertaking and had changed
the behaviour of the farmers/fishermen to become respon  -
sive towards changes. The increase of the productivity of
the farmers/fishermen accompanied with the capability to
utilize beneficial opportunities and to accait  and  adopt
new technologies, havo increased the productivity  of  the
farmers undertaking in various commodities as shown in At-
tachment 33. After the project was completed, in which the
extension was already regulated and implemented in a bet -
ter way, the production per hectare/per year of all com -
modities was evldently to increasing, exceeding the expec-
tations of the SAR, except for Soybean. In particular,the
increase of the rice production from 3.1 ton/ha  in   Java
and 2.4 ton/ha outside Java which had become 4.59   ton/ha
and 3.28 ton/ha had caused the rice self-sufficiency to be
achieved in 1984, so that the import rice is not necessary
any more. This constituted anundertaking result which was
long and time consuming for 32 years since the Easimo Wiel-
fare Plan which was started in 1952.

B. FarmeR  Participation.
The number of farmers groups had developed   reaidly,
in 1980, numbering 131,941 groups and in 1986 reaching
225,041 groups or increasing 70.6% (see Table 7). This mat-
ter indicated that the participation of farmers/fishermen
quantitatively in the development of the agricultural  sec-
tor was very substantial.

The participation level or the farmers / fishermen
participation qualitatively also significantly increased,
such as indicated by the results of the food-crop produc-
tion increase amounting to 18-54%, estates/plantation 28-
79%, cattle-breeding 50-67% and fishery 36%. The success
in this effort of increasing the fishermen participation
was inseparable from the effort of increasing the exten -
sion intensity which among others were caused by the in-
crease in the number of PPL from 13,182 persons in 1980
to 27,739 persons in 1986-1987 or increasing at 110.4%.
C. Work Opportunity
The agricultural extension work system had succeed
ed in farmers/fishermen productivity continuity in accord
ance with the level of development of various agricultur-
al tecbnology. Said productivity increase, in addition to
increasing the activity of the farmers' undertaking    so
that Cho pt'oduction of various commoditiesA increase, had

also expanded the work opportunity in the agriculture. see
tor. As in the case of rice self-support endeavour   which
had been achieved by the application of  various   advance
tecbnologies, not only had it saved foreign exchange, but
also added the manpower requirement, because the land in-
tensity had increased 2-3 times per annum. The total  work
force around 85% live in the rural areas and 65% obtained
their means of subsistence in the agricultural sector, so
many of them obtained their additional means of subsist -
ence originating from the activities in the non-agricultur
al field.*)
The absorption of manpower absolutely in the see -
tor of agriculture increased at a rate of 1.4% within the
period of 1971-1980, then 0.6% within the period of 1980 -
1985. **) On the other hand, the absorption of  the   work
--force in the agricultural sector was relatively (in per -
centage) always declined, in accordance with the  tendency
of ecodnomic structure shift leading to the non-agricultur-
al sector. During the period of 1971-1980, the absorption
of the work force decreased from 66.4% to 54.8%.
The relative decrease of the manpower in the non -
agricultural sector was constantly greater., especially in
the services, transportation, and construction seotor with
a higher wage rate and the change of the public perception
towards work in the agricultural sector which was consid -
ered less noble and boring.

However, the agricultural sector was absolutely capable
and was projected to absorb additional manpower in a large
number, especially if agroindustry was developed. In addi-.
tions ths enhancement of the farmers madertaking   in  the
rural areas had also enhanced other undertaking activities
connected with the effort of enhancing agricultural com -
modit±es production.
Employment opportunity means the creation of work
in the agricultural sector and simultaneously the increase
of the farmers/fishermen income. According to table 8. the
real wage3 in the sector of agriculture rose 3.5X per an -
num during the period 1980-1984**).
This indicatad that the economic development  pattern   in
said period had a rositive impact constituting the rise in
the employment opportunity and income for those already
married in the rural areas, in this case the farmers/fish-
ermen.

C. Assistance Fund Absorption
The procedure of assistance fund drewing iccor--ng
to the tlorld Bank regulations was not difficult and suf -
ficiently fast (+ 6 weeks), but there were cases    which
caused a low assistance fund absorption.
1. Several applications which had long been forwarded to
the 'World Bank evidently had not yet been reimbursed /
paid until' nearly the end of the project. The weak -
ness of the PIU was that it was too trusting the 'World
Bank would reimburse, so that it had a waiting nature,
whereas it should immediately be inquired, because
with the delay in payment, the rate of the dollar to
rupiah had increased which meant the decrease of the
assistance fund absorption.
2. The payments through the Banks which did not have  any
representative in Washington were conducted    through
170688                                                 the es*
IfHWT



- 104 -
the other Banks, so that much time was required result
Lug in delays.
In addition to cases which caused delays in the fund ab -
sorption, there were also other efforts frca the  'World
Bank to speed up the assistance fund absorption       inter
alis with the issuance of Statement of Expenditure regula
tions which fac1litate the forwarding of application   by
collecting the smell activities financing which were con-
ducted by way of self-management which later-on examined
by BPKP (Pinance and Development Supervision Agency).
In connection with the existence of saving at WAEP II,
the World Bank had approved several revision proposals and
project activities reallocation as follows :
1. The existence of the period of the project for one year.
2. The cancellation of the project costs amounting to US$
3,000,000 and US$ 2,473,133.08.
3. The addition of BPP construction and the procurement of
their equipment.
4. The addition of agricultural extension materials con -
stituting brochures, sound slidas and films.
5. The addition of various training both domestically and
abroad as long as its justification could be accepted,
including the brown locusts pest control training.
Mutual understanding and mutual appreaciation between
the Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture, especially with
PIU, could smoothen the implementation of NAEP II until
it could be completed properly.

VIIr.. SERVICE AND AID OF WORLD BANK
rh connection with the service and aid of the Word
Bank in the frameworii of smoothening the project implemen-
tation, It on be forwarded as follows :
A. The involvement of NAEP with Other Projects.
Other projects obtaining World Bank aid having a
cooneotion with NAEP II in the sense of mutually support
ing are s
l* The Agricultural Education Project (Ln 2341 - IND )
which among others has constructed ZT Agricultural
Staff Training Centers (BLPP), 30 Development Agri-
cultural Schools (SPP) and 28 Agricultural Thforma-
tion Centers (BIP) throughout Dndonesia.
The training of the agricultural extension offioers
and the agricultural officers can run smoothly due
to the existence of BLPP and SPP.. Whereas the agri-
ultural extension material production ( brochureD
slide,v film etc. ) is implemented due to the exist-
once or BIP which also supports the smoothness of
the farmers courses. All those matters are implement
ed in cooperation with the local agricultural ser-
vices.
2. The Irrigation Project (Irrigation SUb Sector Pro-
ject Loan No. 288011ND) which has cooperated in the
implementation of water management training for agri
oultural extension officers by involving local Agri-
cultural Services.

3. The Agricultural Research and Development   Project
(JARD Lu 1840 IND) of the Agricultural Research arnd
Development Agency (AARD) in the framework of techno-
logy transfer in the agricultural seotor by producing
agricultural extension material which becomes   re-
commendation material after having been  tried   and
demonstrated.
V. supervision.
During the NAEP II period, supervisions  had  been
implemented by the World Bank jointly with the Direotor-
ate Generals concerned and the Jakarta PIU staff to the
Provinces throughout Indonesia.
The result of the supervision in general is very useful
both for the policy maker as well as for the    project
exeoutor. The supervised objects are among       others
concerning the agricultural extension organization, BPP
looation, agricultural extension officers and the T & V
system. In connection with this supervision, it is con-
sidered as local cases which are not always occurred in
all regions.
0. Aid Fund Absorption.
The aid fund withdrawal prooedures based on the
World Bank regulations, are not difficult and adequate-
ly rapid (± 6 weeks), however, there are cases   which
cause the low absorption of the aid fund.
1. Several application which have been submitted a long
tim-e--.
170688



time ago to the World Bank, evidently have not yet
been reimbursed/paid untill the project was   almost
completed. The weaknees of PIU La that it believes too
much, that the World Bank will reimburse, so that it
practises a waiting nature, PIU should    immediately
ask the reimbursement, because with the payment delay,
the dollar rate in respect to rupiah already increases
which means the decrease of the aid fund absorption.
2. The payment through a bank which does not have a rep-
resentation in Washington, shall be conducted through
other Banks, so that it need muoh time, which causes
the delay.
Besides the cases which cause the delay of the fund
absorption, there are also other efforts from the World
Bank to acoelerate the aid fund absorption, among others
by issuing the SOE (Statement of Expenditure) regulation
which facilitates the submission of application by oombin-
ing the expenditures of small activities  conducted   by
force-account which later-on shall be audited by BPKP.
Ih connection with the savings of NAEP Ir, the World
Bank has approved several project activities    revision
and reallocation Dtoposals as follows :
1. The e"tension of the project period for one year
2. The caneellation of the project funds to the amount
of US $. 3,000,000, and US $. 2,473,133.08
30 The
170688



3. The addition of BPP construotion and their equipment
procurement.
4. The addition production of agricultural extension
material consisting of brochuros, sound slides   and
films.
5. The addition of various trainings, both domestically
as well as abroad an long as their justification can
be accepted, including the brown planthopper control
training.
Mutual understanding and mutual appreciation
between the Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture parti-
cularly with PIU can smoothen the NAEP II implententation
until its proper completion.

IX. CONCLUSION
1. The project has implemented the function to develop the
agricultural extension with Training and Visit   system
in 26 Provinces including the transmigration and critic-
al land areas, and to implement the procurement       of
facilities and infrastructures as well as other activi-
ties supporting extension implementation.
The result is that the implementation of the agricultur.
al extension coordination was carried out through the
extension institutions which is being continuously im -
proved. The SAR target was achieved, even exceeded.
This is due to the saving and devaluation,   where  the
savings was used for the implementation  of useful  and
accountable activities.
2. The saving of the credit fird is amounting   to   UB $
5,473,133.08 (13%), so the utilization of the credit
funds is amounting to US $ 36,526,866.92 (87%)    from
the SAR estimate of US $ 42,000,000.
Meanwhile the government's contribution amounted to US
$ 51,058,000 (127.9%) from the initial estimate of U
$ 39,910,000. 
3. As a whole the procurement of buildings on units basis
has reached 134.6%:compared with the SAR. The target of
441 units for the construotion of BPP 560 units or 126.9%
have been achieved.
The
170688
SNW



The construction of BPP which are initially planned for
wet land and tranamigration areas have been       widely
distributed in the areas of wet land (377 units), coas-
tal area (69 units), dry land (65 units) and transmigra-
tion area (49 units),
The site development of BPP was planned for 532 units,
and acbieved 1,139 units or 214.1 %.
The PPL/PPM houses in the transmigration area and PPS
houses in the non-transmigration area from 485 units,
479 units have been achieved or 98.8%.
The expansion and rehabilitation of BPP from 604 units,
584 units have been achieved or 96.7% and for the 1,230
m2 PIU office, after the construction was completed ,
they were immediately utilized by the project.
4. The procurement of basic equipment for 560 BPP has been
achieved although there are differences in the types of
equipment. The special equipment of the extension sub-
sector including land conservation, has been procured
as required. The equipment of the Food Crops Agrioult'ar-
al Services at the Provincial and District level   has
been fulfilled for 100%.
Vehicles whioh is considered unsuitable or the exploita-
tion costs are high, were not procured, such as :
motorcycles, from 2,600 units, 3,584 units  have   been
abhieved or 138 % from 70 units trailers, 70 units
have
200688
SNWT



have been achieved or 1009 and from 13 cars,  13   cars
have been achieved or 100%. For extension material, the
procurement was based or, the media effectivity and the
extension target's requirement, in this case for t"Ant-
ing media namely brochuros and for electronic media name-
ly films, copy slides and slides are the most consider._
ably provided.
5. The extension training for PPL, PPM and PPS which initial
ly meant for orientation training, has been added with
a basic training and special skill for operating exten-
sion equipment, so that the extension officers will have
better knowledged and skill in extension and improve
their credibility.
The basic technical training for extension staff    has
been incorporated witir a special technical skill train-
ing for commodity production increase program  for  each
sub-sector, Meanwhile the training for the extension
staff in the Provinces and Districts from 500  persons
has increased to 1,267 persons or achieving 253.9 %.
In addition thereto, the farmers/fishermen        courses
which initially is not included in the SAR, has been im-
plemented in a short term of 2-7 days in an intensive way
for 28,409 contact farmers. This assists to   accelerate
and extend the agricultural technology distribution for
other members of the farmer groups.
From 
200688
SNWT



From the training target which was initially 625,500
man-days has been implemented to 1,154,923 man-days or
achieving 184.6%.
6. Fellowships, English coursas, training abroad including
workshop for the extension staff and extension officers
have been implemented, exceeding the target, exoept for
82 programs abroad and training abroad for PPM. 83, D4
and D2 programs which initially did not exist,     nave
been added in the framework of improving   the   basic
oducation for extension officers.
In total from the target of 368 persons or 2,466 man-
months, have been implemented 686 persons or   7 5S3-,
man-months, which means achieving 307%.
7. Technical consultanoy in palawija crops has assisted to
stimulate the offorts for increasing the palawija crops
production, whereas other technical consultancies are
not implemented, as it is felt not useful.
Project )Inagement Oonsultancy has assisted to produce
an audited financial report, to prepare the BPP loca -
tion to be constructed, to establish the extension offi
oors personnel administration system and to develop the
ourriculum system based on work competency.  Bxtension
Organization and management study produced recommenda -
tion of the necessity of one line of command  in  the
implementation of extension ooordination before aohiev-
-ing a unified extension.
8. Sin3e ....
200688
SNWT



8. Since the 1984/1985 budget year, NAEP has ehanged its
status from the Project Directorate to become PIU, this
status change is due to the formation of Extenslow Di-
rectorates in all sub-sectors within agriculture      so
that the coordination of agricultural extension should
be improved.
9. The addition of the number of extension officers since
1980 from 12,296 persons to 29,239 persons in 1986/1987
or an addition of 137,8% from the previous number,   is
a correct step to increase the agricultural  extension
intensity. This is supported by the addition of the BPP,
which is spread in all areas, extension material, exten-
sion equipment, extension facilities, as well an  ade-
quate mobility. The increase in the number of extension
officers does not guarantee that the effectiveness   of
the T & V system, because of the decrease of the exten-
sion operational budget.
10. The farmers group as a forum for the farmers/fishermen
to cooperate in the farming undertaking and study, has
indicated a development towards a stable matur:ty.
A positive change of attitude has made   the    farmers
group more responsive to the rapid technological changes
by observing the sustainability of the   natural   re-
sources. As the subjeots of the agricultural development,
the farmers/fishermen and their groups was able to
d3monstrate a participative role.
The 
200688

The farmers group which cover various farming    under-
taking and covering the entire family members    should
still be developed in the framework of increasing   the
undertaking productivity and participation of every fa-
mily member.
11. This project has supported the government policy in in-
creasing the agricultural production with the strengthen-
ing of the agricultural extension in 26 provinces, the
implementation of agricultural extension in the  trans-
migration areas and the decision to adopt the extension
system developed in the food crop sub-sector to other
sub-sectors within agriculture. The success of this pro-
jeot in supporting government policy is reflected    in
the posit&ve corelation between the existence of a pro-
ject with the increasing productivity of the rice (45%)
corn (50%), cassava (24%), peanuts (36%), sweet potato
(9%), coconut (28%), rubber (60%), coffee (40%), clove
(233%), fresh water cultivation (36%), beef and buffalo
meat (66%), egg (50%), milk (46%). Particularly  as   a
result of the rice production increase, the rice  self-
support was already achieved in 1984.
12. In the implementation of an effective extension coor-
dination, the one line of command concept   should  be
applied. For the provincial level, an officer which is
able to manage the entire extension activity should be
appointed
200688
ATWq'



ll.,
appointed. In addition, an operational budget provision
is required, including a more adequate budget for exten-
sion supervision and transport facilities.
13. In order that the absorption of the agrioultural tech-
nology can proceed intensively, regularly and continuous
ly, the implementation of local verification    trials,
periodic review sessions and farmer courses should be
enhanced.
14. To thoroughly know the aspect which is able to support
the extension development, a study should be conducted
on the T & V System, farmers participation and distant
learning method.
15. The extension in the fishery and livestock sub-sectors
and the extension in the transmigration areas should be
given more attention and improved, in view of  a   good
prospeot in the future.
