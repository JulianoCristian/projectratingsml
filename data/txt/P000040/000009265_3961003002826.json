power rehabilitation program are to:  (a) lay the\n            institutional foundation for sustainable operations in the\n            sector; and (b) re-establish the integrity of the\n            transmission grid in the Northern and Central electrical\n            systems that was heavily sabotaged and destroyed during the\n            civil war.  The project will include the following\n            components:  (a) institutional reforms in the power sector;\n            (b) capacity building in the power utilities to improve\n            management and maintenance practices; (c) assistance to the\n            Ministry of Energy to define the legal and institutional\n            framework for the power sector and to coordinate the\n            implementation of the power sector rehabilitation program;\n            (d) rehabilitation of transmission lines and substations in\n            the Quileva-Lomaum-Huambo corridor and of the distribution\n            network of Huambo; (e) a pilot program of prepayment meters;\n            and (f) engineering studies and supervision of the\n            rehabilitation program in the Northern System."}, "docdt": "1992-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
