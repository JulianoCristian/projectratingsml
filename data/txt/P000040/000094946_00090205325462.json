Lessons indicate once again,\n            that for countries emerging from post-conflict situations,\n            it is necessary to begin with simple rehabilitation\n            projects, and with modest design of reform components,\n            allowing longer implementation periods. This would minimize\n            the risks for both the country, and the Bank's\n            portfolio. Furthermore, under restructuring circumstances,\n            detailed project risks should be reassessed, considering\n            even closure, for, if a fundamental risk assessment would\n            have been carried out when civil war resumed, definitely\n            closure would have been decided, and unnecessary risks would\n            have been avoided. The difficulty in increasing electricity\n            tariffs, was enhanced by the failure of other key prices,\n            namely low salaries, to withstand increases, hence, key\n            progressive sector reforms are only likely to succeed within\n            an overall adjusted environment of market prices. Although\n            management training of Bank-financed projects was provided\n            at the beginning of the project, given that implementation\n            capacity was seen as a major issue at preparation,\n            subsequent difficulties with procurement, and the management\n            of special accounts, suggest the need for continuous\n            training during implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
