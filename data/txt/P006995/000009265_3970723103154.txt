VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      The Dominican Republic.
Beneficiary:   Instituto Nacional de Formacion Tecnico Profesional (INFOTEP).
Amount:        US$5.8 million equivalent.
Terms:         Repayable over 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending
Terms:         The Bank loan would be made available to INFOTEP as a grant,
under a subsidiary financing agreement between the borrower
and INFOTEP.
Project
Description:   The purposes of the project are to:
(i) Strengthen INFOTEP's role and capabilities to coordinate,
regulate and monitor developments in vocational training.
The proposed project would provide technical assistance
(47 staffmonths of consultants services and eight
staffmonths of fellowships) to (1) enhance INFOTEP
planning services and management, (ii) develop a training
standard and certification system, (iii) improve course
content, and (iv) organize the technical supervision of
all vocational training courses;
(2) Assist the vocational training system, directly and
±indirectly, through INFOTEP, to respond effectively both
in quality and quantity, to anticipated skill
requirements. The proposed project would (1) expand the
capacity to upgrade and train about 990 instructors
through the organization of about 57 courses;
(ii) establish a trainee follow up and p'ltcement system;
(iii) increase the pre-service training for about 850
additional unskilled workers; (iv) increase the in-
service training for about 5,500 additional skilled
workers and supervisors; (v) establish a pilot production
training center to provide training for about 900 low
income workers engaged in the informal sector of the
economy; and (vi) enhance INFOTEP training advisory
services to assist about 560 enterprises in the training
of about 1,800 supervisors and anagers.. Therefore, the
project would provide for construction or expansion and
equipment of three vocational training centers, for
complementary training equipment for other collaborating
training institutions, for the establishment of a mobile
training program through the acquisition of 14 mobile
sets of training equipment and about 8 light vehicles,
and for technical assistance (59 staffmon:bs of
consultants services and 156 staffconths of fellowships).

I. THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING SYSTEM
General
1.01      The slowdown in growth plaguing the economy in recent years has
made the chronic unemployment problem acute. Open unemployment is estimated
at about 22% of the 2 million labor force and disguised unemployment may be
twice that. The situation is especially severe in urban areas where previous
pro-urban policies had attracted new workers. Nearly 60% of workers now live
in cities. Moreover, the Government's adjustment program will reduce the
subsidies and employment opportunities in the public sector and throw a
greater share of the adjustment to harsh external realities upon the
shoulders of the urban poor.
1.02      One element of the open and disguised unemployment problem is the
mismatch between the existing supply of skills of the labor force and the
demand. The demand for skilled workers in industry, agroindustry,
construction and services (tourism in particular) is projected to grow more
rapidly than the demand for unskilled labor. Given the preponderance of
supply in the low skill segment of the market and the scarcity in the higher
skill end, any resumption of economic growth is likely to be characterized by
a widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers. Thus, not only
will the short supply of skilled workers dampen growth, the structure of the
labor market will contribute to a worsening of income distribution when
growth resumes. Vocational training can mitigate both phenomena.
Characteristics of the Vocational Training System and its Institutional
Framework
1.03      The Ministry of Education provides, through a variety of means
(secondary education, special courses and technical schools), education with
some vocational content to about 10,000 students. However, this training is
merely of a pre-vocational nature since most of the graduates either advance
to higher education or enter the job market in areas different from those
they were trained for. Annex 2 indicates the structure of the formal and
non-formal system of education and training.
1.04      Vocational training proper is provided by a variety of private and
public institutions (Ministry of Agriculture, Armed Forces, Social Security
Institute, INFOTEP). Most institutions provide pre-service training, i.e.,
before entrance into the job market, to trainees who, in most cases, have
dropped out of the formal education system (at elementary or secondary level)
and in some cases, are adults without skills. Current enrollment in these
programs amounts to about 5,000 students who graduate as technicians or
mostly as certified skilled workers or craftsmen. Of this total, private
institutions absorb about 1,200 students and INFOTEP about 1,000. The Armed
Forces with 11 centers, the Ministry of Agriculture with four centers and the
private institutions provide for some regional coverage. The programs of the
Armed Forces, Social Security Institute and INFOTEP are mainly oriented
toward metal mechanics, construction and electricity, while the agricultural
sector is served by the limited vocational training capacity of the Ministry
of Agriculture.



-2-
1.05      In-service training, which has existed only since 1983, is provided
by INFOTEP to about 4,000 trainees. These in-service training programs,
although also covering the above mentioned areas of specialization, emphasize
training in the services and agricultural sectors. These are provided by
INFOTEP's own instructors or by other training institutions supported,
technically and financially, by INFOTEP, and include training of supervisors
and production engineers in private enterprises.
The Vocational Training System's Performance and Issues
1.06      The country's present capacity to retrain employed workers and
upgrade their skills represents less than one-fifth of the expected demand,
with these shortfalls being very critical to the services, agricultural and
metal mechanics sectors. The same projections indicate that, by 1987, the
demand for new skilled manpower (i.e., entering the job market) will exceed
the current training capacity of the country by about 10X. Clearly there is
a need to expand the vocational training capacity, particularly in the area
of in-service training. Annexes 3 and 4 show rough estimates of personnel
requirement for the 1983-87 period.
1.07      In addition, the pre-service training, as now conceived and run,
has problems with the relevance and quality of its programs. Because of lack
of analyses and forecast of changes in the labor market, the content and
composition of the vocational training programs offered by the institutions
bear no relationship to market demands. This results in enterprises
preferring to hire unskilled manpower and providing ad hoc on-the-job
training, and in high unemployment among the graduates of the pre-service
training programs. This problem is compounded by lack of coordination among
the institutions, resulting in duplications and gaps in programs and location
of facilities; by poorly qualified instructors who lack relevant industrial
experience; and by the poor quality of the equipment and materials used in
training.
Strategy for Improving the System
1.08      In order to structure the vocational training activities, increase
their output and improve the adequacy of the training, the Government created
INFOTEP in 1980.1/ INFOTEP's mandate consists of (i) regulating,
coordinating and monitoring all vocational training activities in the
country; (ii) supporting the activities of existing training institutions;
and (iii) complementing existing training activities where and when needed.
This initiative received the support of the business community and trade
unions who are represented on INFOTEP's Board and finance, through payroll
levies, its operations. Besides enterprises and unions, the Ministries of
Labour, Education and Armed Forces are represented on the Board. The Board
is assisted, in technical matters, by a National Advisory Committee composed
of representatives of enterprises and trade unions and of Government agencies
as the subject matter requires.
1/ The promulgation of Law 116 of January 1980 establishing INFOTEP was in
part the result of the Second Education Project (Loan 1142-DO) of 1975
(para. 1.13).



-3-
1.09      Since its inceptlon INFOTEP has received technical assistance from
ultilateral as well as bilateral sources. This has allowed INFOTEP to
establish itself as an Institution, to produce a preliminary medium-term
development plan for vocational training, and start implementing vocational
training programs, mainly at the in-service level. However, it still does
not have the technical capability and expertise to analyze the labor market
and forecast changes adequately; nor does it have the capacity to implement a
plan resulting from such analyses. Also, it does not have the capabilities
and facilities to complement the shortfall of existing training capacities
adequately and to monitor the impact of the training rrograms.
1.10      Coordination and Decentralization of the Training Activities.
INFOTEP intends to Improve its capacities to analyze and forecast labor
market requirements, and to monitor the impact of training provided. These
would enable INFOTEP to assist other institutions in planning and
coordinating their training activities both through direct advice and
selective support of programs of institutions, and through coordinating
mechanisms such as INFOTEP's Board and aectoral technical advisory
comittees, which will comprise representatives of training Institutions,
employers' organizations and trade unions. The guidelines for the
establishment of sectoral technical advisory committees at the regional level
would be submitted to the Bank for comments by not later than June 30, 1986,
and thereafter INFOTEP would promptly establish such committees. The use of
common trade standards, to be established by INFOTEP, would allow employers
and training institutions to identify timely the need for additional training
of employed workers and, at the same time, improve the targeting of programs
by institutions. Creation of job placement services would enhance the
integration of graduates into the labor market and into jobs corresponding to
their skills.
1.11      Quality of Training.  In order for INFOTEP to contribute to raising
the quality of training, It plans to build up a capability to train its own
instructors, and those from other institutions and private enterprises,
whether new or experlenced. Occupational analyses of all important trades by
INPOTEP should provide a basis for all training institutions to adjust and
upgrade course contents. Supervision of all training activities, based on
pre-established norms and regulations, would become a continuous function of
INFOTEP and will require training of qualified supervisors. Finally, through
expanded but selective support of other institutions' programs (material,
equipment, instructional programs and technical assistance) INFOTEP will be
able to influence the relevance and quality of the courses; an action plan to
that effect would be prepared by INFOTEP and submitted to the Bank for
comment by March 31, 1986, and promptly thereafter implemented.
1.12      Adequacy of Training.  INFOTEP aims at contrlbuting to the
expansion of the training capacity, mainly in the area of in-service training
where the shortfall of the existing capacity is the greatest. It will expand
its own training capacity, as well as encouraging other training institutions
to expand in-service courses with adequate support of INFOTEP, and will
assist private enterprises in setting up and running internal courses. In
addition, the creation of a mobile training program by INFOTEP will not only
increase the training capacity but also increase flexibility in meeting the
training needs of a wider range of geographic locations.

Bank Participation in the Education Sector
1 13      The Bank Groug has financed two education projects in the Dominican
Republic: a Pirst Education Project, supported by an IDA credlt of US$4
million, was signed In February 1971 (Credit 235-DO); a Second Education
Project, supported by a loan of US$8 million, was signed in July 1975 (Loan
1142-DO). Another Education Project, focusing on rural prlmary education has
been appraised, but was dropped by the Government from its Investment program
as part of its financial adjustment easures.
1 14      The first project aimed at preparing and Implementing a reform of
the education system by improving the quallty and content of secondary
education and tralning of prlary teachers, and by preparing a comprehensive
long-term plan for educational development. At completion2/ (April 1977),
the project had provided a modern, well-equipped and geogra-phically balanced
physical setting for secondary schools and primary teachers' training
colleges. The reform of secondary schools suffered from implementation
delays, and thus, had only a partial Impact. The educatlonal planning was
not finalized and the reform of secondary education (structure and
curriculum) was only partly completed and lplemented, indicating the need
for detailed pre-established job descriptlons and timetables allowing
effectlve supervision and evaluation of consultants' work In future projects.
1.15      The second project was designed to address the most Important
issues of rural basic education and vocational training, including
agriculture. The project aimed at the rationalization of the physical
distribution of rural primary education and provided, to that effect, for
construction or expansion and equipment of rural community learning centers
(RCLC), as well as of agricultural and other voeational training centers, and
included a technical assistance component for upgradlg program for teachers
in the RCLCs. At completion3/ (December 1983) the rationalization of the
rural primary education had been achleved by the creation of the RCLCs,
complemented by the primary teachers' upgradlg programs; four agrlcultural
and three other vocational training centers were established; and, also,
INFOTEP was created, which prepared a prelimlnary medlum-tetm development
plan, a first step toward a sustained improvement of the vocational training
system.
II. THE PROJECT
Background
2.01     The Government of the Dominican Republic has requested the Bank's
assiseance in financing a five-year project aimed at improving the country's
vocational training system, through increasing INFOTEP's capacity to
coordinate, regulate, monitor and decentralize vocational training
activities, and to improve the quality of and expand the vocational training
system.
2.02      The proposed project would help the Government's development
efforts oriented to more intensive use of the country's iatural resources (in
agriculture, tourism and resource-based manufacturing). It would contribute

to increasing labor productivity and reducing unemployment. Another
important feature of the government pollcy that this project would support is
producing Incentives for ruglonal development in order to slow worker
migration to the major cities and promote a more equitable distribution of
development benefits.
2.03      The Bank's support of the proposed project is justifled because:
(i) it would contribute to an overall improvement and more rational
utilization of the Dominican Republic's vocational training system; (li) it
would aid the Government's efforts to improve worker productivity and
regional distribution of employment; (ili) it would contribute to enhancing
exports and to attracting foreign Investment; (lv) it is feasible in terms of
financial and admlnistrative capacities of the borrower and the implementing
agency; and (v) it would complement the Bank's previous involvement in
institution building In the area of education and vocatlonal training.
2.04      A subsector study4/ mission visited the Dominican Republic In
February 1984, followed by preparatlon/pre-appraisal miselon In June 1984.
The project was appraised durlng October 1984. Negotiations were held In
Washington, D.C. on April 15 and 16, 1985. The Borrower and the Beneficiary
were represented by a delegation led by Dr. Pedro Franco Badia, Secretary of
Labour.
Project Objectives
2.05      As noted above, the project has two major objectives:  (a) to
enable INFOTEP to coordinate, regulate and monitor developments ln the
vocational training system; and (b) to expand INFOTEP's capacity to provide,
directly and indirectly, appropriate training In response to anticipated
skilled worker requirements.
Project Components
2.06      With regard to achieving the first objective, the proposed project
would provide technical assistance (47 staffsonths of consultants services
and eight staffmonths of fellowships) to INFOTEP to (i) enhance INFOTEP
planning services and management; (il) develop a training standard and
certlfication system, (iii) improve course content, and (iv) organize the
technical supervision of all vocational training courses. Concerning the
second objective, the proposed project would (i) expand the capacity to
upgrade and train about 990 instructors through the organizatlon of about 57
courses; (ii) establish a trainee followup and placement system; (iii)
increase the pre-service training for about 850 additional unskilled workers;
(iv) increase the in-service training to about 5,500 additional skilled
vorkers and supervisors; (v) establish a pilot production tralinng center to
provide training for about 900 low income workers engaged In the informal
sector of the economy; and (vi) enhance INFOTEP's training advisory services
to assist about 560 enterprises in the training of about 1,800 supervisors
and managers. Therefore, the project would provide for construction or
expansion and equipment of three vocational training centers, for
complementary training equipment for other collaborative tralning
Institutions, for the establishment of a mobile training program through the
acquisition of 14 mobile sets of training equipment and about eig..t light
vehicles, and for technical assistance (59 staffmonths of consultants
services and 156 staffmonths of fellowships). Annex 5 shows the correlation
between the main

function of the vocational training system and project objectives and
components. Annexes 6-15 provide further details on the description of the
project components.
Objective 1: Strengthen INFOTEP's Role of Coordinating, Regulating and
Monitoring the Vocational Training System.
2.07      Planning of Vocational Training System.  The proposed project would
include expert services and fellowships to provide assistance and training to
managerial and technical personnel of INFOTEP, and to develop the appropriate
mechanisms for planning and oricnting the vocational training activities of
the system components. To these ends, 55 staffmonths of technical
assistance, of which 24 staffmonths will be financed by UNDP, have been
included in the project. (See Annexes 7 and 8.)
2.08      Training Standard and Certification Services.  With support of
consultant services (three staffmonths) and a fe-llowship financed by the
project, INFOTEP would develop a trade testing system based on training
standards for recognized, skilled occupations. This would allow the
monitoring of training quality and relevance by targeting courses to provide
training in required skills; it would also motivate workers to attend the
prescribed courses in order to obtain a certification of the level of skills
acquired. (See Annex 9).
2.09      Occupational Analyses and Course Content. To increase the
relevance of training to labor market requirements and to standardize
training programs, the project would include: occupational studies in 35
occupations, preparation of 320 training modules, and experimentation with
modern training methods. Occupational analysis would be the basis for the
preparation of syllabi for different training modules, allowing workers to
attend successive courses according to their specific training needs. To
these ends the project includes consultant services (three staffmonths) and a
fellowship. (See Annex 10).
2.10      Supervision of Training Courses.  Supervision of all courses
provided by the different institutions would be organized as a permanent
INFOTEP function, and executed by qualified personnel to ensure that programs
are implemented following pre-established standards and methodologies. The
availability and quality of equipment, tools, training facilities and
training materials would be assessed, as well as trainers' skills and
performance. The project includes consultant services and a fellowship to
this end.
Objective 2: Expand Coverage and Improve the Quality of the Vocational
Training System.
2.11      Instructor Training Program. The project would finance 57 training
courses for instructors of INFOTEP and collaborating institutions. INFOTEP
specialists, assisted by experts financed by the project, would train about
400 new full-time and part-time instructors and about 590 experienced
instructors. (See Annex 11).
2.12      Trainee Follow-up and Placement.  Selective follow-up of graduates
would be organized to obtain feedback on the impact of the training on
workers' employment, income and performance. (See Annex 12). Placement
services and training agency-employer committees would facilitate the



7-
employment of new graduates, and help detect changes in needs and spot
program deficiencies. To that effect the project would provide consultant
services and fellowships. Specific follow-up studies, financed by the
project, of the graduates of the proposed pilot production center for the
informal sector occupation will be carried out to provide a basis for
deciding about future expansion; such studies would be prepared by INFOTEP in
consultation with the Bank and the results would be presented to the Bank for
comment and discussions by December 31, 1987, and promptly thereafter
implemented.
2.13      Expansion of Training Opportunities.  The proposed project, when
fully operational in 1990, would axpand the country's yearly training
capacity to supply pre-service training for about 850 additional trainees,
and in-service training for about 7,300 additional active workers and
supervisors representing about 25Z of the target group. Of this total, 5,000
trainees would be reached through the mobile training program, 1,800 through
training services and 500 through training centers. (See Annexes 13-14). In
addition, a pilot production training center would be established in a suburb
of Santo Domingo offering training opportunities to about 900 low-income
workers engaged in informal sector trades, which would allow them to earn
some income from the sale of items produced during training. Pre-service
training would mainly be expanded in agriculture and metal-mechanics.
In-service training would be expanded about equally in industry, agriculture
and service sectors, and to a lesser extent in the construction sector. In
addition, the in-service training capacity would be further increased
substantially by private firms using the trainers/supervisors trained by
INFOTEP, and by shifts, promoted by INFOTEP, in other institutions' programs
towards in-service training. Furthermore, expansion of training capacities
would take place through creation or expansion of vocational training centers
and mobile training programs.
2.14      The project would provide financing of construction, furniture and
equipment for INFOTEP's training center in Santo Domingo, and completion of
the Santiago center, owned by the Ministry of Education, but to be used in
part by INFOTEP under a formal agreement between the two parties. The
project would also provide equipment and furniture for the pilot
production-training center, and finance the replacement of obsolete equipment
and provide additional equipment for one small existing training center in
Santo Domingo (Herrera), and other selected training institutions. (See
Annex 14).
2.15      The proposed project would also enable INFOTEP to operate training
programs in small towns and rural communities where fixed centers would not
be economically viable. Financing would be provided for fourteen mobile sets
of equipment to provide for or complement existing local physical facilities
of the comnunities or collaborating training institutions. To that effect
INFOTEP will enter into agreements with enterprises or public agencies (such
as the Ministry of Housing, Agriculture or Education) who will share the
responsibility of the courses with INFOTEP and organize the recruitment of
participants. The mobile sets would be spe=ialized in industrial sewing,
maintenance and metal mechanics, house construction, agricultural mechanics,
and food production and preservation. (See Annex 15). This approach, which
has proven to be successful in other countries of the region under Bank
financed projects, is characterized by its low cost, high return and
flexibility.



-8-
2.16      INFOTEP's Advisory Services for Enterprises Requiring Systematic
On-the-Job Training Programs. INFOTEP would enhance its capacity to assist
enterprises in diagnosing training needs and in implementing on-the-job
training programs. Courses would be offered to improve skills in
organization, planning, administration, industrial relations, accident
prevention, etc. Supervisors and technicians would be trained as trainers in
specific subjects, where upgrading of skills of workers is needed. By 1988
about 560 enterprises would benefit from such assistance, permitting about
1,800 supervisors and managers to be trained per year. To that effect, the
project would provide (i) technical assistance for developing training
programs in small and medium enterprises; (ii) fellowships for INFOTEP
technical staff; (iii) audiovisual aids and learning materials; and (iv)
printing equipment to produce the instructional materials for the programs.
Project Costs and Financing
2.17      Costs.  The total cost of the project (net of taxes) is estimated
at DR$25.1 million or about US$8.4 million equivalent, of which US$5.5
million equivalent is foreign exchange (66%). Cost estimates for civil works
are based on tenders received. Equipment and furniture costs are based on
inventories of requirements. Costs of technical assistance are assessed on
the basis of terms of reference and a program of consultant deployment.
Physical contingencies amount to 10Z of total base cost. Price contingencies
for local and foreign costs combined amounting to 12% of total base cost
including physical contingencies, are based on estimated inflation rates for
local costs of 26.6% in 1985, 13 in 1986, 1OZ in 1987, 8X in 1988 and 7% in
each 1989 and 1990, and for foreign costs of 5Z in 1985, 7.52 in 1986, 8% for
each of the years 1987 through 1990. The estimated total cost and local and
foreign exchange components by categories for the main project items are
summarized in Annexes 16 and 17. A comparison of unit costs is shown in
Annex 18.
2.18      Financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$5.8 million would finance
69% of the total project cost or 94Z of foreign exchange cost and 20% of
local costs. This level of financing is recommended on the following
grounds: the reserves acciumalated by INFOTEP to finance in part the proposed
project have lost 55% of their purchasing power since appraisal as a
consequence of the change in exchange rate system and concomittant inflation;
because of its ongoing adjustment program, the Government cannot provide the
funds to fill the financing gap. INFOTEP would contribute, mainly from
accumulated revenues, US$2.3 million equivalent, representing 28% of the
total project cost; the annual contribution during project implementation
will be reflected in INFOTEP's budget. Under separate arrangements. Line UNDP
and the Government of Spain would finance technical assistance for abou.
US$0.3 million, which represents some 3X of the total project cost and 6% of
foreign exchange costs. A summary of project financing by category and
origin of resources is shown in Annex 19. The Government would pass on the
proceeds of the loan as a grant to INFOTEP by a financing agreement,
acceptable to the Bank. Execution of the financing agreement would be a
condition of effectiveness.



-9-
Project Implementation
2.19      Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of
INFOTEP. A project director has been appointed from the staff of INFOTEP,
while the Director General of INFOTEP will have overall project
responsibility. The appointed project director has qualifications in
accordance with terms of reference satisfactcry to the Bank. INFOTEP would
maintain a project director with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank
during project implementation. The project director would be assisted by
INFOTEP's planning, technical and administrative directorates and the
construction department. The project is expected to be implemented in five
years, and to be completed by June 30, 1990. Annex 20 shows the
implementation schedule and accumulated completion rates.
2.20      Executing Aency.  INFOTEP is a semi-autonomous organization,
established by law in 19 0 as the main vocational training entity in the
country. The headquarters are located in Santo Domingo and it has facilities
with regional responsibilities in Santo Domingo, Herrera, Santiago and Azua.
It is administered by a Tripartite Board, chaired by the Secretary of Labor,
and composed of representatives of the Government, employers organizations
and trade unions. The Board is mainly responsible for policymaking, resource
allocation, and review and monitoring of key issues concerning budgeting,
staffing, long-term planning and organizational setting. A General
Directorate executes policy, supervises training programs and coordinates
operations. The institution is organized into five operational units:
Finance; Collection; Administration and Personnel; Methods and Operations;
and Planning and Studies. The Institute is financed through a payroll levy
on public and private enterprises and their employees (contributions of 1%
and 0.5X, respectively), representing US$2.1 million equivalent in 1985 and
expected to increase in constant 1985 terms to US$2.5 million equivalent by
1989. A specific action plan to increase INFOTEP's income by 2CM in real
terms by December 31, 1989, by improving the efficiency of collecting the
payroll levy would be prepared by the Government and submitted to the Bank
for comment by December 31, 1986, and promptly thereafter implemented. From
1980 to 1985, INFOTEP's income exceeded operating expenditures, resulting in
accumulated reserves which will be used to finance part of the project. In
early 1985, INFOTEP's total staff numbered 284 persons and is expected to
increase to 324 by 1989, when the project would be fully operational.
INFOTEP's recurrent budget is forecast to increase in constant terms from
US$1.83 million equivalent in 1985 to US$2.47 million equivalent by 1990,
when fully operational. In the intermediary years INFOTEP is expected to
generate surpluses on its income which will complement the revenues
accumulated through 1985, to finance the project. Annex 21 shows past and
projected INFOTEP finances.
2.21     Procurement.  Contracting of civil works is being carried out on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures which are in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Tenders for the first phase of the civil
works, including construction of workshops, sanitary facilities, guard house
and store rooms of the Santo Domingo Regional Center, were received in



- 10 -
December 1984. The same procedure is being followed in the second phase of
the construction program, which includes classrooms and offices for the Santo
Domingo Regional Center, and in the completion of the Santiago Center owned
b; the Ministry of Education. To the extent possible, contracts for
equipment, furniture and other materials would be grouped to form attractive
packages and would be awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines, when exceeding US$50,000.  Contracts below US$50,000 would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with government procurement practices acceptable to the Bank; such purchases
would, in aggregate, not exceed US$350,000. In addition, miscellaneous items
that cannot be grouped in packages exceeding US$20,000 would be procured
through local purchasing on the basis of three price quotations; such local
purchasing would not in aggregate exceed US$300,000.  Prior -nk review would
be required for contracts exceeding US$100,000. Other contracts would be
subject to random review by the Bank after contract award. Contracts for
technical assistance would be made in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
In the case of ICB, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential
margin in bid evaluation equal to the prevailing tariff or 15% of the CIF bid
price, whichever is lower. Annex 22 provides the details of procurement
modalities.
2.22      Disbursement.  Because of the advanced stage of preparation and
implementation of parts of the project (civil works, equipment procurement
and technical assistance), a disbursement profile, which is substantially
different from that of the average education project in the region, has been
adopted which projects fast disbursements of the loan amount. The closing
date would be December 31, 1990. The proposed loan is expected to be
disbursed over a period of about five years to cover: (a) 30% of total
expenditures for the second phase of the building program which includes part
of the Santo Domingo center (classrooms and regional office) and the
completion of the Santiago Center; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures, and 80Z
of local expenditures (excluding taxes) for furniture, equipment and
vehicles, including inctallation costs where applicable; and (c) 100% of
foreign expenditures for consultant services and fellowships. Disbursements
against civil works, fellowships and contracts for furniture and equipment
with a value of up to US$20,000 each, would be made on the basis of
statements of expenditure. Related documents would be retained by INFOTEP
and would be made available for Bank review. All other expenditures would be
fully documented. A Special Account, in U.S. dollars, would be financed out
of the proceeds of the loan, through an initial deposit and subsequent
replenishment. The initial deposit would amount to US$0.5 million
equivalent. Annex 23 shows the estimated schedule of disbursement by
calendar and Bank fiscal years, and Annex 24 shows the categories, amounts
and percentages to be financed by the Loan.
Accounting and Auditing Procedures
2.23      INFOTEP would maintain separate accounts for the project in
accordance with acceptable accounting practices. A summary of project
accounts, reflecting cumulative expenditures incurred by the end of each
semester, would accompany progress reports sent to the Bank for information.
All INFOTEP accounts, financial statements and statements of expenditures
relevant to the project would be audited annually by independent auditors
with qualifications acceptable to the Bank. The annual auditor's report and



- 11 -
the certified copies of all relevant financial statements would be remitted
to the Bink not later than 120 days after closing of each fiscal year.
INFOTEP's current accounting practices and its auditing arrangements are
acceptable to the Bank. Similarly, the Government would be required to have
the Special Account audited annually by independent auditors with
qualifications acceptable to the lank. Annex 25 shows the INFOTEP
independent audit situation.
2.24      Monitoring and Evaluation. The project director would be
responsible for prepariag periodic progress reports which would provide
information on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the project.
Forms would be developed to suit the lank's reporting requirements, and the
relevant information would be sent quarterly to the Bank. Annex 26 provides
a list of main Indicators for project monitoring and evaluation.
2.25      The Directorate of Planning and Evaluation would participate in the
evaluation of project implementation; on-the-job performance of a selected
number of graduates from INFOTEP's and collaborating institutions' training
program would also be evaluated. Knowledge and insights gained from the
evaluation process will be fed back into the system for the periodic
upgrading of the curricula and course syllabi. A project completion report
would be prepared by the government within six months of project completion.
III. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
3.01     Building on an initiative started under a previous Bank financed
operation, the project would further the development of the vocational
training system through institutional development of INFOTEP, increases in
coverage and quality of the vocational trainDig provided, thereby
contributing to the government's development efforts.
3.02     Institutional Development.  The project would equip INFOTEP with
the capacity to carry out integrated planning for the vocational training
system, to assist enterprises and institutions to upgrade training programs,
and to optimize the use of the country's physical and human training
resources.
3.03     Improvement in Coverage.   he project would double the country's
capacity to supply in-service training in Santo Domingo and in the regions.
Coverage would be further increased by: (i) the maultiplier effect of firm
instructors/supervisors trained by INFOTEP; and (ii) changes in the
orientation of courses offered by collaborating institutions. Sectoral
coverage would also be enlarged.
3.04      Ixprv _ nt in Qulity.  Quality of training would improve because
of the avallability of: i) instructors with upgraded qualifications; (ii)
program content reflecting labor market requirements; (iii) adequate training
equipment, tools and materials; (iv) periodic technical and pedagogical
supervision of the courses; and (v) periodic follow-up of graduates'
on-the-job performance.



- 12 -
Risks
3. 05     No significant risks are associated with the technical
implementation of the project. Achieving the project's objectives, aimed at
improving the whole vocaticnal training system, is, however, subject to two
potential risks. The first is concerned with INFOTEP's ability to fulfill
its primary role of coordinating and monitoring all training activities in
the country; the second refers to the readiness of INFOTEP to provide
adequate financial resources to support the training activities of
collaborating institutions.
3.06      INFOTEP's Ability to Coordinate and Monitor the System.  As a newly
organized institution, there is always the risk that INFOTEP may prove to be
ineffective in its role of coordinating the activities of the entire system,
and may become instead another palliative institution competing with public
and private institutions already providing training. This r'sk would be
reduced if, as is recommended in the proposed project, INFOTEP were given the
means to offer good quality services, and thereby earn prestige as well as
the confidence of its clients. A technical assistance program, which forms
an integral part of the project and built upon technical assistance
previously provided by INFOTEP, aims to assist INFOTEP's technical staff in
coping with this task.
3.07      INFOTEP's Allocation of Resources to Support Collaborating
Institutions. INFOTEP has been expanding its training activities rapidly, to
some extent at the expense of collaborative efforts with other training
agencies, thus limiting its influence on improving the quality and providing
direction for the rest of the system. The required resources would be
obtained by earmarking an increasing portion of INFOTEP's resources for these
purposes by mitigating INFOTEP's tendency to increase its administrative
expenditures (including salaries). Therefore, assurances have been obtained
from INFOTEP that it would maintain separate entries in its annual operating
budget for contribution to other training agencies through several means,
such as training materials and equipment, instructional program and technical
assistance. A plan identifying measures to be taken to increase the share of
these activities in INFOTEP's annual budget to 30% by December 31, 1989,
would be submitted to the Bank for comment by June 30, 1986, and implemented
promptly thereafter.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations, the Government has provided assurances that
INFOTEP shall:
(a) submit to the Bank for comment not later than June 30, 1986,
guidelines for the establishment of sectoral technical advisory
committees at regional level and promptly thereafter establish such
committees (para. 1.10);
(b) submit to the Bank for comment by March 31, 1986, an action plan
for upgrading the quality and extending the use of the
collaborating institutions and promptly thereafter implement such
action plan (para. 1.11);



- 13 -
(c) present to the Bank for comments by December 31, 1987, the result
of the studies concerning training in the informal sector included
in the project and promptly thereafter implement such
recommendations (para. 2.12);
(d) submit to the Bank for comments by December 31, 1986, an action
plan to increase INFOTEP's income by about 20Z between 1985 and
1989 by improving the efficiency in collecting the payroll levy and
promptly thereafter implementing such plan of action (para. 2.20);
(e) forward to the Bank 120 days after end of the fiscal year the
annual auditor's report and the certified financial statements of
INFOTEP (para. 2.23); and
(f) maintain separate entries in its annual operating budget for
contributions to other vocational training agencies. A plan to
identify measures to be taken by INFOTEP to increase its annual
operating budget for these activities to 30Z by December 31, 1989,
would be submitted to the Bank for comments by June 30, 1986. This
would mainly be achieved by reducing INFOTEP's administrative
expenses including salaries (para. 3.07).
4.02      A draft financial agreement between the Ministry of Finance and
INFOTEP (para. 2.18), and the signed agreement between the Secretariat of
,ducation and INFOTEP for the permanent use by INFOTEP of a part of the
Santiago Center facilities were reviewed by the Bank to its satisfaction
during negotiations (para. 2.14).
4.03      A condition of Loan Effectiveness would be that the Government and
INFOTEP sign a financing agreement, acceptable to the Bank, by which the loan
proceeds are made available as a grant by the Borrower to the Beneficiary
(para. 2.18).
4.04      Subject to the above conditions the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of the Dominican Republic of
US$5.8 million equivalent, with a term of 17 years including a grace period
of four years.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
TRAINING STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION
1.  General Objectives
1.1 To recognize workers' skills regardless of how they have been
acquired;
1.2 To facilitate workers' occupational and social advancement; and
1.3 To provide information on skill levels so that effective
full employment policies, wage policies, and labor training and
development policies may be formulated.
2.  Specific Objectives
2.1 To establish minimum trade standards for occupations in the
different sectors of the economy;
2.2 To devise procedures capable of measuring skill levels and
technological knowledge required by the various occupations;
2.3 To devise certification procedures;
2.4 To establish national trade standards for the different
occupational levels;
2.5 To amalgamate these certification procedures into a comprehensive
national system of workers' certification;
2.6 To better implementation of vocational training policies, by
improving the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of vocational
training programs; and
2.7 To carry out a diagnostic study of occupational skills, aimed at
guiding workers' vocational training and advancing them along the
employment ladder.
3.  Advantages
Creating a national certification system would have the following
advantages:
3.1 Giving recognition to workers for the skills they acquired through
experience, or through vocational training courses (or a
combination of both);
3.2 Providing a means for workers to obtain promotion in their
respective fields through a continuing training process;

VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
TRAINING STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION
3.3 Offering unemployed and underemployed workers better opportunities
for finding the job they need;
3.4 Facilitating occupational mobility;
3.5 Validating work experience and divesting vocational training of its
formal aspects;
3.6 Giving workers the possibility of validating their knowledge and
abilities in the standard education system;
3.7 Furnishing Ministry of Labor with reliable instruments to adapt
wage policies to the complexity of the different trades;
3.8 Adjusting the labor supply to the demand generated in employment
markets, by ascertaining what skills and levels required;
3.9 Saving enterprises time and effort in the selection of workers, by
supplying certified personnel;
3. 10 Improving productivity;
3.11 Providing a clearer picture of available human resources
which would allow future projections of skilled labor to be more
accurate;
3.12 Improving statistical information on occupational structures and
employment;
3.13 Rationalizing the use of resources by training agencies;
3.14 Helping to adapt vocational training systems to quantitative and
qualitative requirements of employment markets;
3.15 Using vocational training methods and resources (such as
programs, teaching personnel and facilities) more effectively;
3.16 Promoting active participation by employers and workers in the
vocational training process; and
3.17 Making full use of skills acquired by workers in the course of
their labor for training and promotion.
4. Methodology
The methodology to be adopted would be implemented in seven stages:
4.1 Studies on the feasibility of resources for certification policies.

VOCAITIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
TRAINING STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION
4.2 Establishment of minimum trade requirements.
4.3 Preparation of methods to assess whether standards are being met.
4.4 Application of those assessment methods.
4.5 Establishment of certification regulations.
4.6 Coordination of vocational training and apprenticeship
certification.
4.7 Personnel training for the preparation, application, evaluation and
analysis of assessment instruments.
5.  Application
5.1 Application of the assessment methodology requires full support by
an interdisciplinary team made up of occupational analysts and
assessors, and by technicians of the trade in question.
5.2 Assessment procedures must be devised according to the minimum
requirements established in order to gauge the practical abilities
and applied technological knowledge required for satisfactory
performance in a trade.
5.3 Assessment procedures should be devised and applied according to
the economic, social, cultural and labor characteristics of the
country's economically active population.
5.4 Achievement of these goals make it essential for employers and
workers to be informed about the aims, conditions and criteria,
procedures and area covered by the assessment process.

VOCATTIOAL T    MIN PROJECT
HISTORIC AND PROJECTED INFOTEP FINANCES
INFOTEP was created during the latter part of 1980 and endowed
with three principal sources of operating income: (a) a 1Z payroll levy,
(b) a 0.5Z levy on the workers' share of firms' profits, and (c) direct
ad hoc contributions from the Ministry of Labor (MOL). The most iaportant of
these is the payroll levy, which has brought in 8(z to 9go of total operating
income. It is estimated that firms and public entreprises subject to the
payroll levy pay about 5oz of the total potential yield of the levy. The
great majority of sizable private and public enterprises currently pay the
levy; the small firms typically evade payment. The administrative costs
involved in enforcing payment by these small firms nearly offsets the gain to
INFOTEP. Another characteristic of the collection pattern, both for the
payroll and the profit share levies, is that many firms fall recurrently in
arrears, and they resume regular payments, together with payment of the
arrears, only after persistent visits from INFOTEP's administrative
departrient. Thus, the yield of levies in 1982-84 shows fluctuation
unconnected to the evolution of wages.  The levy on the workers' share of
profits has also been significant, at about 5-10Z of the total. Contrary to
these two, MOL's contributions have been small and declined during the past
four years. An unexpected source of income has been interest on the
accumuIlated Lquid funds of INFOTEP, created during 1981-83 when INFOTEP was
being organized, and therefore, its training activities were limited.
For 1989, it is projected that operating income from the levies
will increase by about 20Z in real terms in comparison to 1985. This is due
in part to the expected increased effectiveness of INFOTEP in inducing more
firms to pay their obligations, and in part to the willingness to pay dues
that many small firms have in order to be included in INFOTEP's and
collaborating institutions' training programs.  0OL's contributions and
interest are projected to fall to an insignificant amount as the result of
the proposed project. All of INFOTEP's accumulated surplus will be invested
in the proposed civil works. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the State will
be willing to contribute to INFOTEP's operating income through budgetary
allocations, because the government is expected to service the proposed World
Bank loan.
On the expenditure side, the biggest item is personnel salaries,
making up about 65Z of the total in 1984. INFOTEP salaries are significantly
above the rest of the labor market in the Dominican Republic (probably 20-4(1
on average). INFOTEP has tried to attract above-average personnel in this
way, but, more importantly, the large operating surpluses of 1981-83 allowed
salaries to rise. Therefore, an important source of future economies, as
INFOTEP's financial situation becomes tighter from the combined effect of the
expanding training programs and the projected stagnation of the country's

ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 2
economy, will lie in restraining the growth salaries. As a matter of fact,
this process has already started. Although INFOTEP's personnel is projected
to rise by about 5-10% during 1985, allocation for salary payments in the
1985 budget is only 10% higher than in 1984, implying stable nominal salaries
during a period when inflation will exceed 20%.
The next most significant category is General Expenditures
(transport, publicity, maintenance and repairs, rent payment, Board of
Directors' honoraria, etc.). As in the case of salaries, many of these items
are higher than necessary because of INFOTEP's financial surplus.
Anticipating large requirements for counterpart funds during 1985 and
subsequent years in the context of the proposed project, INFOTEP's Board of
Directors is decreasing authorization for this category for 1985, it is
projected that INFOTEP will limit salary increases to the cost-of-living
index, keeping salaries of its personnel at their 1985 real level. For the
General Expenditures category on the other hand, it is project that following
a drastic reduction between 1984 and 1985, it will grow rapidly until 1989
because important components (transport, maintenance and repairs, etc.) are a
function of training activities and therefore will have to be adjusted to the
rate of increase of these activities.
The following table provides a sumary picture of INFOTEP's
finances in 1982-85, and the projected income and expenditure flows in 1989.

INFOTEP's INDEPENDENT AUDIT SITUATION
1.        The auditor's report on the financial statements of INFOTEP since
the beginning of the operations has been prepared by Gomez Santos & Assoc.
within four months of the end of the fiscal year in 1983/84. The reports
have been qualified based on the fact that INFOTEP recognizes and records the
income from contributing entreprises only at the time that such income has
been deposited at the National Treasury. This is an acceptable financial
policy by a conservative Board of Managers. The independent auditors argue,
however, that in accordance with Law No. 116 dated January 16, 1980, all
enterprises are compelled to contribute to INFOTEP with 1Z of their total
payroll and that a certain number of the enterprises are in the process of
complying with the law; and therefore, there are accounts receivable and
income in an amount neither quantified nor recorded. This situation will
persist as long as the law does not allow INFOTEP to demand monthly reports
from the enterprises on the respective payroll.
2.        Gomez Santos & Assoc. is an acceptable national firm of public
accountants representing Touche Ross, an international CPA firm with
representation offices in over 100 countries. Gomez Santos & Assoc. ranks
fourth (with about 25 professionals) in the Dominican Republic next to Price
Waterhouse, Cooper & Lybrand and Pannel, Kerr, Fuster representatives (all of
which are totally national firms). The firm is currently auditing some other
Bank projects (one partially) as well as several IDB projects (Ministry of
Public Works, Rural Housing, Ministry of Education), the Venezuelan Fund
project (road construction), and the USAID project (road construction under
the Ministry of Public Works).
3.        As agreed with the independent auditors and INFOTEP's management,
who were briefed regarding Bank's audit requirements, starting with the
operation of Bank's loan two separate audit reports will be prepared: one
covering INFOTEP's financial statements as an economic unit and a separate
report regarding Bank's project. In both cases, the Bank's auditing and
reporting requirements will be observed by the auditors.
