                   CREDIT AND PROGRAMSUMMARY

                    THE REPUBLIC OFNICARAGUA

             SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

Borrower:           The Republic ofNicaragua
ImplementingAgency: The Ministry o f Finance and Public Credit (MHCP)
Amount:             SRD 16.83 million (US$ 25 millioneauivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace
                    period
Tranching:          Single tranche o f SDR 16.83, up to US$ 25 million
                    equivalent, to be released upon effectiveness, expected in
                    December 2006.
Description:        The proposed operation is an integral part o f the o f the Bank's
                    InterimStrategyNote, presentedto the BoardinAugust 2005.
                    The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 11)
                    would be the second in a series o f operations supporting the
                    implementation o f the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy,
                    now in its second generation (PRSP 11). The PRSP I1builds
                    on five strategic areas: (i)economic growth for poverty
                    reduction,  (ii)human capital development and social
                    protection, (iii)productive and so'cial public infrastructure,
                    (iv) governance and state reforms and (v) macroeconomic
                    stability.

                    PRSC I1would provide budgetary financing, within a medium
                    term macroeconomic framework. It would support the
                    adoption or implementation o f policies designed to:(a)
                    maintain macroeconomic stability while protecting poverty
                    reduction spending, (b) promote international trade, (c)
                    promote registration o f indigenous communities' titles, (d)
                    ensure fiscal sustainability o f education sector legislation: (e)
                    implement legislation establishing a civil service, (f) improve
                    public finance management; and (g) promote regular,
                    financially sustainable roadmaintenance. PRSC I1would also
                    help identify an agenda o f major policy undertakings for a
                    possible new series o f PRSCs inthe next CAS period.
Benefits:           The proposed operation would support the Government's
                    efforts in pursuingthe policy objectives set out in its PRSP I1
                    and the Matrix o f Goals and Actions for 2005-2009. It would
                    provide needed resources for financing general Government
                    expenditures. The operation would contribute to donor
                    coordination through its close links with other external
                    financing agencies inthe Budget Support Group (BSG).

Risks:              The uncertainties surrounding the scheduled national elections
                    in November 2006 are the biggest sources of possible
                     difficulties for PRSC 11's successful implementation. Others
                     could emerge from Nicaragua's weak institutional capacities,
                     its vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters, and
                     its fiduciary processes.

                    The operation's one-tranche design would help to mitigate
                     some o f these risks. In addition, to address possible problems
                    associated with the national elections, PRSC I1 has been
                    intensively discussed and coordinated with a broad based
                    team ledby the authorities o f the Ministry o f Finance, as well
                    as other BSG members. There have also been consultations
                    with the National Assembly, civil society groups and other
                    private sector entities about the operation. During the
                    consultations, all major political leaders expressed support for
                    the National Assembly's approval of the operation before the
                    end o f the calendar year.

                    Furthermore, the accompanying Public Sector Technical
                    Assistance Credit would address some o f the institutional
                    weaknesses and seek to strengthen fiduciary capacities. A
                    projected Public Expenditure Review i s being prepared
                    simultaneously in order to obtain a better comprehension o f
                    fiscal sustainability issues and to analyze their possible
                    solutions. Also, the Bank's Natural Disaster Vulnerability
                    Reduction and Mitigation project i s helping to address some
                    o f the risks o f natural disasters.

                    In addition to these measures, the Bank will maintain close
                    dialogue with the authorities and partner donors to address
                    any other problems which may arise.

                            IDA PROGRAMDOCUMENT FOR A
                  SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                           TO THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA


                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1. This program document outlines a proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC 11) for the Republic o f Nicaragua.' The PRSC I1would be the third operation in a
series o f programmatic credits in support o f Nicaragua's Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the
second in the PRSC series. The previous two operations were the Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Credit (PSAC), approved in March 2003 and PRSC I,approved in January
2004.2     Since the approval o f PRSC I,the Government updated its Poverty Reduction
Strategy under the title National Development Plan (henceforth PRSP 11). This second
generation Poverty Reduction Strategy was analyzed by Bank staff jointly with staff o f the
International Monetary Fund(IMF) in a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), which the Board
endorsed inJanuary 2006.

2. PRSC I1 was designed to be disbursed in a single tranche o f US$ 25 million,
approximately in the last quarter o f 2006. All o f its prior actions have been fulfilled. This
operation would conclude the first series o f PRSCs for Nicaragua. A third PRSC for more
extended support o f the PRSP's medium-termprogram would be considered under the next
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nicaragua, scheduled for Board presentation in early
FY08. This operation identifies some areas for support under a possible future PRSC series,
which are to be discussed with the Nicaraguan authorities.

3. Alongside o f the PRSC's main poverty-reduction focus, the policy reforms to be
supported under the proposed operation aim to: (a) maintain macroeconomic stability while
protecting poverty alleviation spending, (b) promote international trade, (c) avoid negative
fiscal implications o f recently approved legislation in the education sector, (d) promote
registration o f indigenous communities' land titles, (e) establish a merit-based civil service,
(0 improve the management of public finances, and (g) promote regular, financially
sustainable road maintenance.

4. These policy reforms are key to the Government's realization o f the results defined inits
PRSP I1 and would help Nicaragua pursue the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Second, they aim to enable the authorities to continue their sound macroeconomic
management without compromising public expenditures aimed at reducing poverty. Third,
they would helpthe country realize more o f its growth potential and upgrade its public sector
management in core areas. Lastly, the policies supported should improve the livelihoods o f

5. The reforms to be supported stem from the Government o f Nicaragua's National
Development Plan (NDP) and PRSP 11, which were developed from the extensive
consultations initiated in the 2003 Consultative Group Meeting. Subsequently, the
Government also carried out broad consultations throughout the country, which involved
civil society organizations, the private sector and the donor community. In this connection,

         services in education and health, with an added focus on technical training and labor conditions,
         including child labor. On social protection, emphasis is on improving institutional coordination
         by consolidating multipleprojects into keyprograms to increase access o fvulnerable groups to
         basic social services.
     I   Productiveand social publicinfrastructure(Area 111):Increasecoverage and quality o f
         infrastructure to support economic growth and attain the MDGtargets. Emphasis for productive
         infrastructure is on roads, ports and energy. Emphasis for social infrastructure is on education,
         health, water and sanitation, and housing.
     I   Governance and state reforms(Area IV): Strengthen good governanceby emphasizing the
         reform and modernization o f the justice system, respect to human rights, guarantee public safety,

         and accountability. Implement a national decentralization strategy to enhance the provision o f
         public services while maintaining fiscal stability.
     I   Macroeconomic Stability (Area V): Consolidate macroeconomic stability and medium- and
         long-term sustainability while maintaining poverty-reducing expenditures, and increasingly align
         expenditures with the priorities o f the PRSP 11. Strengthen tax administration by amending the
         tax code, stop deterioration o fthe pension system, extend the scope o f the financial
         administration law, advance decentralization o fpublic spendingconsistent with fiscal neutrality
         and devolution o f responsibilities to the local level, and tackle the energy sector financial losses
         by tariff adjustmentswhile avoiding distortionary interventions.

6. The rationale for programmatic assistance to Nicaragua was initially presented in the
FY03-FY05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) considered by the Board in March 2003,
which was updated inthe FY06-FY07 InterimStrategy Note (ISN)discussed by the Board in
August 2005.4 The ISN conditioned continuing policy-based lending on the full re-
engagement o f the IMF after a lapse, disbursement o f the second tranche o f PRSC Iand the
Government's accomplishment o f the performance targets for PRSC 11. The first two were
hlfilled by the first quarter o f 2006. All o f PRSC 11's prior actions were met by end
September 2006.

7. The proposed PRSC I1 builds on the reform agenda laid out under PRSC I.It also
addresses some o f the new priorities for poverty reduction posedinthe PRSP 11.Specifically,
PRSC I1places a greater emphasis on growth-enhancing policies, such as improving access
to foreign trade markets, enhancing the financial sustainability o f road infrastructure
maintenance and promoting land tenure security. At the same time, key issues supported in
the PSAC and PRSC I,such as macroeconomic stability, protection o f poverty relief
spending and more efficient public administration, are still targeted, in order to hrther

Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was successfully completed in September 2006. The
Government and nine donors signed a Joint Financing Arrangement (FA), along with a
common Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM), in May 2005. IDA, which also signed the
F A , has been hlfilling its commitment to prepare the PRSC I1in pursuit o f convergence
with the common PAM, and to harmonize the monitoring and evaluation processes o f its
PRSCs with the monitoring o f the P A M monitoring (see Annex 7(b) for details o f this
coordination).

9. A notable feature o f this collaboration i s the German financial cooperation, which co-
financed PRSC Ithrough KfW, and i s co-financing PRSC 11. in the amount o f 4 million
euros. Furthermore, an IDA project o f technical assistance for the implementation o f PRSC
actions -Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC)- i s also being co-financed by
the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and the U.K.

                                        11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. POLITICAL BACKGROUND

10.The present Government o f President Enrique Bolaiios took office in early 2002, and
confronted a large fiscal deficit and allegations o f widespread public sector corruption. It
promptly took decisive action to seek the removal o f parliamentary immunity for the former
President Arnold0 Alemhn, and to prosecute him for various corruption charges. He i s
currently serving a 20-year sentence o f restricted movement within the Department o f
Managua. The new Government also moved quickly to restore macroeconomic discipline. It
signed a PRGF agreement with the IMF in late 2002 and took actions designed to reach the
HIPC Completion point in early 2004. This was achieved with the congressional support o f
the opposition Sandinista party (the FSLN). However, after the HIPC milestone was
achieved, the FSLN started negotiating and reached a pact with the Constitutional Liberal
Party (PLC), which i s still controlled by former President Aleman.

11. Subsequently, as a result o f this pact, relations between the Executive power (which has
less than 10 percent o f loyal votes in the National Assembly) and the two major political
parties, (which control the remaining 90 percent) became very tense. Accordingly, the
National Assembly last year approved: (i)     Constitutional amendments enabling it to ratify


                                              4

ministerial and ambassadorial appointments and to remove them, (ii)     changes inarms control
legislation and (iii)a revised 2005 budget that jeopardized Nicaragua's adherence to its
program with the Fund.

12. In November 2005 the constitutional amendments and related legislation were set aside
by the approval o f a framework law ("Ley Marco"), which postpones their entry into force
until after the next Government takes power (in2007). As a result of political agreements,
though, the Executive Branch was strengthened and was DR-CAFTA ratified by the National
Assembly. The next presidential-cum-congressional elections are scheduled for November
2006. President Bolaiios can not run for re-election and the political landscape i s highly
unpredictable. It is possible that none o f the presidential candidates will obtain the necessary
number o f votes in the first round o f the elections, in which case a second round will take
place between the two highest contenders inmid-December.

B.      RECENT MACRECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INNICARAGUA

13. The economy has continued to perform well, notwithstanding the adverse pressure from
higher oil prices. Growth accelerated to 5.1 percent in 2004 and 4 percent in 2005, while
inflation picked up to 9.6 percent y/y when the rising international oil prices were passed
through to domestic consumers. These caused losses in the power sector in 2005 although
electricity tariffs were since raised by 20 percent through January 2006. Strong export
growth, as well as higher-than-expected external flows, facilitated an increase inreserves o f
about $70 million in 2005 in spite o f the larger oil import bill. The 2005 budget included
large public sector wage increases. However, a tax package and spending controls helped to
reduce the consolidated public sector deficit to an estimated 2.2 percent o f GDP.

14. Economic growth in 2006 i s expected to continue to accelerate at slower rates than in
previous years. It i s expected to reach levels slightly below 4 percent despite electoral
campaign spending and the implementation o f DR-CAFTA. The main reasons for this
deceleration include slower consumption and investment decisions due to the uncertainty o f
the outcome o f the upcoming elections.. Further high oil prices could also dampen growth
and put pressure on inflation, which i s projected to remain above 9%. Other factors such as
the crawling peg devaluation and increasing agricultural prices could add other inflationary
pressures. While export growth will benefit from the implementation o f DR-CAFTA, imports
o f non-durable consumer goods and high oil prices may widen the trade deficit, but
remittances would partly offset this deficit.

C.        MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15. The 2006 budget aims to hold the consolidatedpublic sector deficit at 2.2 percent o f GDP
in 2006, with wage bill growth slightly above expected inflation. The approved budget
implies a substantial underlying adjustment given the large, one-time electoral expenditures
(estimated at one percent o f GDP). The authorities, as noted, have committed to additional
electricity tariff increases in order to contain losses in the power sector. They have also
adopted a monetary program for 2006 that is consistent with building international reserves
and lowering inflation. Progress has also been made with advancing on important macro-
structural reforms, including in the financial sector and on fiscal management. The recently
approved tax procedures law, however, threatens to weaken tax administration, and needs to
be reformed.

16. Since reaching the HIPC Completion Point in January 2004, debt relief has freed-up
additional public resources for poverty-reducing programs, while the reduced debt overhang
served to boost investor confidence, likely contributing to the growth o f remittances and
private investment in 2005. This trend i s likely to continue since Nicaragua's participation in
the Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative (MDRI) was approved by the 1MF)inDecember, 2005
and IDA'SBoard in March, 2006. The Initiative would provide debt relief amounting to SDR
518 million (in present value terms). However, while the relief provided enhances the
prospects for future fiscal stability, Nicaragua still has a significant domestic debt (of around
26.3 percent o f GDP) that continues to burden public finances (Annex 6). Another positive

development was the signature with the United States, the Dominican Republic and other
Central American economies o f the agreement to form a free trade area (DR-CAFTA), which
became effective in April 2006. These developments have led to a strengthened
macroeconomic framework that resulted in the successfbl completion o f the pending PRGF
reviews and the extension o f that Program until end-2006. Hence, the macroeconomic
framework i s adequate for the proposed operation.

         111.     THE GOVERNMENT'S POVERTY REDUCTION PROGRAM

A.      PRSPIMPLEMENTATIONIN2002 -2005

17. Progress in PRSP intermediate indicators lagged behindthe goals in health in 2003 and
2004, while those for education and water were surpassed. The positive education outcomes
were abetted by such sectoral support as the Education-for-All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-
FTI) and significant coordination which helped accomplish the education sector's Common
Work Program (Plan Corntin de Trabajo) supported by bilateral and multilateral donors.
Water coverage goals were also overachieved. In particular, urban areas in Matagalpa and
Jinotega had significant investments for producing improved water quality, service and
coverage. However, the achievement o f health goals has lagged behind, e.g., as the coverage
o f vaccination programs in 2004 was insufficient, raising concerns about effectiveness o f the
health system in priority PRSP areas. This can be partly attributed to a significant share o f
recurrent spending on salaries and historically inefficient resource allocations. To address
these concerns, the Government has formulated a new health plan for 2005-09 incorporating
strategic priorities for attaining the MDGs.These have been expressed for the first time inthe
2006 Budget Proposal within a sectoral three-year MTEF.'

   B.       THE NEW STRATEGY

   18. The Government o f Nicaragua completed its National Development Plan 2005-2009 in
   November 2005 and presented it to the Boards o f the IMF and IDA in January 2006 as the
   country's second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II).6                 The document
   reflects a rethinking o f the country's development strategy which was elaborated in the
   Operational National Development Plan (NDPO) in 2004. The PRSP I1builds on the PRSP
   but puts more emphasis on economic and employment growth than the earlier PRSP which
   focused more on measures to improve social indicators. It proposes better articulated policy
   actions and reforms to support the private sector and increased spending on economic
   infrastructure. On human capital development, it aims to improve the balance between
   central Government interventions and local measures to accelerate social progress.

   19. The five strategic areas o f the PRSP I1are: (i)   economic growth for poverty reduction, (ii)
   human capital development and social protection, (iii)productive and social public
I  infrastructure, (iv) governance and state reforms and (v) macroeconomic stability. The PRSP
   I1 is framed by a medium term macro-framework in which prudent economic policies
   (especially fiscal discipline) would help sustainimprovements inkey indicators, GDP growth
   i s projected to average 4.3 percent p.a. over 2005-09, while inflationgradually falls to around
   3 percent. This i s intended to facilitate the attainment o f the 2009 milestones for reaching the
   MDGs.

   20. The PRSP I1 emerged from a broad participatory process at the local level with
   departmental development councils, and sectoral consultations. Consultations took place in
   seventeen workshops at the departmental level, engaging civil society, the private sector and
   the donors. This process was initiatedin2003 with the dissemination of the "Vision for the
   Nation" and the PNDP, and followed in 2004 with the presentation o f the operational NDP.
   The consultations culminated at the national level with the discussion o f the National
   Development Plan 2005-2009 in August at the National Commission for Economic and
   Social Planning (CONPES). The participatory process also entailed the production of
   territorial plans and discussions o f sectoral priorities and policy matrices. Territorial plans
   were produced for all 15 departments and two autonomous regions, The Government heldsix
   fora with donor participants to discuss sectoral priorities and to elaborate policy matrices in
   education, health, social protection, governance, production and competitiveness, and
   infrastructure. The PRSP incorporates views voiced in the consultations, such as increasing
   infrastructure investment, emphasizing participation and decentralization in the PRSP's
   implementation, increasing transparency in monitoring and evaluation, and improving the
   alignment o f donor contributions with the PRSP I1goals. Because o f the political difficulties
   between the Executive and the National Assembly, the consultations with the legislature
   were not as extensive as desired. However, several meetings between the donor
   representatives in Nicaragua and the principal leaders o f the National Assembly indicated a

   Development Plan website www.pnd.nob.ni and at the Office of the President's website

basic consensus on the PRSP's key issues and policies. It i s expected, thus, that the new
Government will probably introduce some adjustments but not make any radical departures.

21. The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the PRSP I1stated that the strategy presents a
coherent medium-termmacroeconomic framework and a viable poverty reduction strategy. It
cautioned though that the economic outlook confronts important risks and vulnerabilities,
underscoring the need for continued prudent macroeconomic policies, complemented by
structural reforms to raise the economy's growth, enhance the investment climate and
improve Nicaragua's capacity to manage possible problems.

22. Six areas were identified as needing further work. These are: (i)prioritizing the
implementation o f measures aimed at attaining PRSP II/MDG goals, e.g. ensuring PRSP
spending allocations in budget formulation and execution, and improved targeting of key

fiscal impact o f transfers under the Municipal Transfers Law, containing the pension

and budget decision- making processes.

           IV.    BANKSUPPORTOFTHE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

A.      LINKTOISN

23. The Interim Strategy Note was designedas an extension o f the program recommended in
the FY03-05 CAS in order to extend Bank support of the Government's poverty reduction
efforts. The interim nature o f the strategy would align the CAS cycle with the country's
election cycle. In this context, the PRSC I1 i s a focal instrument intended to permit the
Government to proceed on the development path that emphasizes increased economic
activity and employment growth for poverty reduction, Although the I S N suggests that new
budget support could have been undermined by the growing political uncertainties that
destabilized the country during 2005, the Nicaraguan Government secured a stronger
political mandate in2006, as discussed inparagraph 13.

24. The ISN amounts and allocation criteria were set apart from the traditional scenario-
based approach and it instead, proposed a matrix o f decisions for IDA assistance based on the
observance o f certain criteria. Hence, a Second Poverty Reduction Credit was only to be
proposed once the criteria for "excellent" performance were met. Under this approach, a
rating o f "excellent" performance would be granted if the country had a satisfactory
macroeconomic situation in place, the first PRSC had disbursed its second tranche, PRSC I1


                                            10

performance benchmarks were met, and the Boardhad reviewedthe JSAN o f the PRSP 11, all
by mid-2006. These criteria were fblfilled by mid-2006, with the exception of a few PRSC I1
prior actions, which were accomplished by the thirdquarter o f 2006.

B.       COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

        B.l.    Coordinationwith the IMF

25. During 2004 and 2005 the Bank has collaborated very closely with the IMF. This has
taken several forms, including Bank participation in IMF missions, reinforcing respective
conditionalities, and reliance on each other's findings in order to avoid duplication and
ensure consistency o f advice to the authorities. The collaboration has been particularly close
in the areas of pension reform, decentralization, public financial management, civil service
reform and the energy sector. In addition, two joint reports have been prepared lately: a
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and the JSAN o f PRSP 11.

         B.2.   Cofinancing

26. German financial cooperation through KfW, helped co-finance the PRSC 1's first tranche
with four million euros. Following IDA'Sdisbursement o f PRSC 1's second tranche, KfW is
projecting to disburse another 2 million euros later in 2006. As part o f this joint effort, KfW
included the prior actions related to the water sector and municipal investment planning, as
well as participated inevery stage o f the operation's processing and supervision. Further, the
German Government has decided to co-finance PRSC I1with 4 million euros, again through
KfW.

         B.3.   Budget Support Group(BSG)

27. In May 2005, the Bank and members o f the donor community which provides budget
support to Nicaragua, signed a Joint-Financing Arrangement (JFA), which i s intended to help
the Government to become more effective in implementing its policies and upgrading its
institutions. The JFA's Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM) facilitates the monitoring
and evaluation o f the Government's policy actions, The Bank's participation in the BSG
reflects the importance being given to policy-based lending and to harmonizing efforts,
especially in the areas o f public financial management as well as overall information sharing
on budgetary support. PRSC 11's preparation has been consistent with the objectives and
activities o f the donor group. Its monitoring and evaluation provisions were especially
closely coordinated with the BSG.

C.       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

28. Virtually all areas o f PRSC Iwere linked to the Bank's investment portfolio in
Nicaragua. This practice has been continued for PRSC 11. The PRSC team consists o f the
task team leaders o f the different investment operations and the analytical and advisory
activities that bear on PRSC 11. While the PRSC would provide policy backing for sector
investment operations in particular areas, the investment credits provide implementation



                                              11

follow-up and data necessary for monitoring and evaluation. Supervision o f the PRSC is
virtually an ongoing process as every related Bank investment project supervision mission i s
responsible for the surveillance o f the related PRSC policy actions. Box 2 below shows the
most important areas o f mutual reinforcement.

D.      LESSONSLEARNED

        D.l. Lessonsfromthe FirstPRSC

29. Experience has shown that it i s difficult to implement policy-based lending with more
than a single tranche. PRSC Iwas designed so that prior actions for the second tranche
would not require congressional approval,. Nonetheless, the political difficulties during2005,
in particular the rift betweenthe executive and the legislative branches led to delays inthe
implementation o f the required measures. The design o f PRSC I1 took this lesson into
account.

30. Second, the experience demonstrated the importance in policy-based lending o f
coordinating closely with other donors providing budget support. On this account, the Bank
worked actively throughout 2005 and 2006 with the Budget Support Group to ensure
consistency and avoid duplication o f policy actions.




                                                   12

 31. Third, the lack o f timely data hampers monitoring and evaluation. Inpart. this reflected
 the difficulties o f coordinating the agencies involved in the PRSC. On this account, closer
 support from the accompanying Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit will be sought for
 this second operation.

 E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

 32. The Bank has prepared several analytical and fiduciary reports on Nicaragua over the
 past few years. These were taken into account inthe designo f the proposedoperation. Most
 of their principal recommendations are reflected inactions includedinthe policy matrix
 contained inAnnex 3. Box 3 below shows these links.

34. At the same time, the PRSC team has identified a few policy, structural and institutional
reform priorities on which IDA i s expected to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the
authorities and BSG partners. Significant progress on these priorities would be expected for a
possible future PRSC series. These priorities are indicated inBox. 5.

        municipalities.

            A.l.         Benefitsof the ProposedOperation

35. The proposed operation would provide needed foreign resources to finance general
government (including poverty reduction) expenditures, and help to maintain the
Government's fiscal equilibrium. It would support the Government's pursuit o f the policy
objectives proclaimed in its PRSP 11, especially in the adoption and implementation o f key
measures constituting prior actions for disbursement o f PRSC 11.Finally, the operation would
contribute to donor coordination, as it is being closely coordinated with the other donor
agencies inthe Budget Support Group.

36. Over the mediumto long term, the actions to be supported are expected to have important
development impacts. These include opening new markets for Nicaragua's exports,
promoting regular road maintenance to help reduce transport costs, bolstering the security o f
legal tenure o f property, improving the education system, initiating the professionalization o f
the public sector, and promoting better planning and use o f public resources, while
maintaining an adequate macroeconomic framework and protecting poverty-reducing
expenditures. The operation would also help the Government maintain macroeconomic
stability and sustain programs that affect the livelihoods o f the most disadvantaged segments
o f Nicaraguan society.

              A.2.        ExpectedResults and MonitoringIndicators

37. As indicated, PRSC I1 seeks to strengthen the overall economy by bolstering the
macroeconomic stability that the Government has achieved, and continue its progress in
areas likely to have very significant impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. In
this connection, Box 6 below lists the Credit's expected outcomes and results, which were
developed in collaboration with the Government. They constitute the PRSC's monitoring
indicators for PRSC I1prior actions.

B.     POLICY AREAS

       B.1.     Economic Growthfor PovertyReduction

i. SupportiveEnvironmentfor Investment and Growth

38. Key Issues. Improving the Nicaraguan business environment i s key for attracting the
needed new foreign and domestic investment. There has been some progress on improving
competition and consumer protection but the proposed Competition Law has yet to be
approved. Also needed i s further trade integration.

39. Government Actions. The Government has been taking some steps to improve the
business investment climate. MIFIC has started to implement an action plan for
administrative simplification involving many Government agencies. It organized a workshop
heldinSeptember 2006 to disseminate and gather feedback on the plan, which was prepared
by the Presidential Competitiveness Commission (with Bank support under the first
Competitiveness Project). The Government recently obtained the Bank's                    Second
Competitiveness Project support for further administrative simplification and investment
climate improvement actions. The Presidency has sent the Legislative Assembly the draft
Competition Law. On trade opening, the Government successfully negotiated the DR-
CAFTA trade agreement with the US and obtained its legislative approval. Inaddition, some
14 complementary measures have been approved, covering such issues as environmental
protection, intellectual property rights, commercial arbitration, labor issues and customs
procedures.

40. Assessment and Recommendations. The Government moves to open foreign markets,
improve the business investment climate and simplify its administrative processes are
considered salutary. CAFTA's ratificationwas also important. The authorities' further efforts
to get the proposed Competition Law approved would be beneficial, as would subsequent
actions to have an implementing agency functioning properly. Another desirable action
would be the implementation o f further administrative simplification. For future PRSCs, it
would be expected that the National Assembly has approved the Competition Law and that a
competition agency i s fully staffed and functioning.

ii. Broader Access to Land and Credit: Registration of Indigenous Territories

41. Key Issues. Improving the security o f Nicaragua's indigenous lands i s very important for
poverty reduction inview o f its potential positive effects on environmental sustainability and
the empowerment o f a historically disadvantaged group. Securing their land rights would
have that impact by (i)reducing third parties' encroachment in livestock operations,
commercial logging, and mining; (ii)    resolving the overlapping titles and land regimes inthe
areas claimed by indigenous groups; and (iii)clarifying rights and mechanisms for
enforcement o f the legal framework. Regularization ("saneamiento")        i s important for the
consolidation and improved sustainability o f these rights through conflict resolution and
resolution o f disputes over previous titles.


                                             19

42. Government Actions. The Government o f Nicaragua has moved towards improving the
land tenure security o f the indigenous communities. In December 2002, the Indigenous
Titling Law was enacted, setting an institutional framework to promote, coordinate, and
manage demarcation and titling processes. Under the PRSC I,five indigenous territories in
the Bosawas Reserve were demarcated and titled, with the assistance o f the IDA-financed
LandAdministration Project (Credit 3665-NI). Although title registration was a condition for
disbursement o f PRSC 1's second tranche, this conditionwas waived upon the Government's
presentation o f an action plan to complete the registration process. The plan emphasizes the
need for the participation o f the indigenous communities and supporting institutions in
addressing these problems in the future, and establishing a legal precedent for the
regularization o f indigenous lands inthe rest o f the country..

43, Assessment and Recommendations. Although progress in the implementation o f the
action plan was slower than had originally been hoped, this was attributed to unanticipated
legal issues outside the control o f the authorities, who remain committed to further progress
on the titling issue. Therefore, the Bank recommended completion o f the registration of one
o f the titled territories in Bosawas as a prior action for PRSC 11. Its accomplishment
established a precedent and a model for regularization o f indigenous territories and
communities in the rest o f the Atlantic Coast. Its outcome would result in the complete
recognition o f the rights o f one territory in Bosawas, benefitingapproximately 5,945 people,
with no pending issues. Progress inthe registration o f additional territories in Bosawas and
the demarcation o f more territories or communities in this Coast would inform the
consideration o f future PRSC actions inthis area.

iii. Broader Access to Land and Credit: National Registry System

44. Key Issues. More effective land administration services through the integration o f the
Cadastre and Registry systems are needed to increase land tenure security, facilitate land
transactions and promote agricultural investment. There are discrepancies between
Cadaster's land records and those o f the Property Registry. The lack o f an integrated cadastre
and registry system has caused numerous problems related to property rights. Before the
needed integration o f the two systems can occur, the Property Registry needs to be
modernized. Its offices have limitedcapacities as a result of: (i) absence o f a central body
                                                                   the
to coordinate the different registries; (ii)   the lack o f a system to plan, organize, control,
monitor and evaluate their activities; and (iii)the lack o f rules governing administrative
procedures and staff functions. Other problems include the losses and deterioration o f the
Registry's books, the lack o f harmonizedprocedures for calculating and collecting taxes, and
the absence o f systematic procedures for its services.

45. GovernmentActions. The Government i s addressing the modernization o f the Cadastre
and the Property Registry and the establishment o f an Integrated Information System
(SIICAR).under the Land Administration Project (Credit 3665-NI). A law to modernize the
Cadastre was enacted and its regulations published in 2005. The Cadastre Law created the
National Cadastre Commission to assist in SIICAR's implementation. The contract for



                                                20

SIICAR has already been awarded and i s in effect.       The approval o f the proposed Registry
Law is, however, still pending. It would establish a National Directorate o f Public Registries,
which would be responsible for the supervision and coordination o f departmental offices. In
addition, the Directorate would establish systematic methodologies, set precedents in
complex legal situations, and compile indexes and digital images into a central database in
coordination with the National Commission for the operation o f SIICAR.

46. Assessment and Recommendations.Establishment o f the National Directorate would be
important for SIICAR to initiate its operations. It also would be desirable that the National
Assembly approve the proposed Law o f Public Registries, which could be considered a
priority action for future PRSCs. Progress with the implementation o f the new institutional
framework for registries, including the link with the Cadastre, establishment o f the National
Directorate and the initiation o f SIICAR operations i s also expected inthe context o f future
PRSCs.

iv. Increase Productivity of Agriculture and Forestry

47. Key Issues. Productivity in agriculture and forestry remains relatively low compared to
other Central American countries particularly in the small holder sub-sector. This condition
i s expected to be affected by important impacts o f the DR-CAFTA agreement. Producers o f
some traditional small holder crops such as corn and beans will encounter greater
competition while the agreement would open new opportunities for the small holder sector to
produce non-traditional crops. The forestry and wood processing sectors are still very
traditional and need new technology and better management to be competitive. Inaddition,
there i s a general institutional weakness and dispersion o f rural development agencies and
lack o f cohesion in efforts to improve the rural areas' competitiveness and incomes. There i s
little coordination among the pertinent Government agencies which mainly rely on foreign
development financing.

48. GovernmentActions. The Government has been tackling the productivity issues through
bolstering agencies in charge o f helping small holders to improve productivity (the public
National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) and the private-public partnership
FUNICA). It has also strengthened the NationalForestry Institute (INAFOR) and launched a
sector-wide initiative for rural development (PRORURAL). It contracted an IDA credit to
support INTA, which has significantly improved its effectiveness and impact, and to
strengthen INAFOR. It also obtained an International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) loan to help FUNICA implement an extension program in the poorest areas o f the
country. The Government also has been working to improve coordination between its
agencies and the donors through the PRORURAL approach. The latter i s reported to already
be producing useful important dividends in the form o f the reduction o f overlaps and
conflicting operations. A common fund for financing PRORURAL has been set up with
contributions from the Nordic countries and Switzerland.

49. Assessment and Recommendations. The continuation o f the Government's effort inthis
sphere i s necessary. Future support could be particularly linked to further progress in



                                             21

PRORURAL. It would be desirable that: (i) least 50,000 rural producers receive technical
                                                at
assistance to increase their productivity (35,000 through INTA, 14,800 through FUNICA and
200 through INAFOR), and (ii)     at least 80 percent o f the Government institutions and donors
involved judge PRORURAL'S implementation and monitoring arrangements to be
satisfactory.

        B.2.    Development of HumanCapitaland Social Protection

i. Basic Education

50. Key Issues. Nicaragua's education system made some important strides recently in
expanding coverage and extending the school autonomy program. However, problems o f
access, equity, quality and institutional development compromise the achievements and
impede the attainment o f the MDG o f universal completion o f primary education. Poverty
and inequality disproportionately affect the school age population in rural and indigenous
areas. Approximately half o f children and youth aged between 6 and 18 years who live in
extreme poverty are not in school, compared to 16 percent o f students from less poor
households. There are also regional disparities in school readiness and the quality o f service
delivery. There are now several policy measures and programs in place to address these
issues, as well as a better investment framework for arranging public and external
investments. But changes inthe Education Ministry's staff have provided little o f the needed
stability for successful implementation o f these programs, thus limiting their potential to
mitigate the sector's pressing issues. Also, there are very large gaps in financing among the
sub-sectors. The public universities are allocated more than US$l,000 per student while the
Ministryreceives less than US$70 for eachprimary and secondary student. As a result, salary
levels o f primary and secondary school teachers are low. Many therefore have left, which
increased the proportion o f unqualified teachers from 25 percent in 2002 to 37 percent in
2005.

51. A new General Education Law was passed to establish the basic guidelines and
framework for an amended national education system. It created a National Educational
Council as the maximum consultative instrument in the sector, and has important provisions
on the different subsystems. It guarantees the existence o f the SEAR (Subsistema Educativo
Autonomico Regional) for Nicaragua's two autonomous regions and creates a system for the
accreditation o f educational institutions. The new law, however, also mandated increasing the
budget for primary and secondary education by 5 percent o f tax income per year until 2015.
This would have resulted ina level o f expenditures for public school education that would far
exceed those o f other countries, and would have been well beyond the possibilities o f the
national treasury. While there is general agreement on the need to increase the education
budget, the law's provisions posed an issue for the Government's continued adherence to the
PRGF. Another issue is the consolidation o f the school autonomy program so that it avoids
arrears inthe budget's execution.

52. Government Actions The Ministry o f Education has embarked on a Common Work
Program (CWP) as a framework for financing the sector's policy priorities on the issues o f
access, quality and institutional development. The Ministry develops annual operational


                                              22

plans with specific targets, financing and expected outcomes for each o f the priorities, which
international support agencies have embraced. The immediate actions planned for 2006-07
include: (i)consolidating the school autonomous program, (ii)   reviewingthe school financing
formula to promote strong student retention, particularly inthe early grades, (iii)
                                                                                  participating
in a regional student assessment (SERCELLECE)           and undertaking a follow-up national
student assessment to compare with its predecessors, (iv) assessing the results of the 2005
population census to identify the areas and groups most vulnerable and at risk o f not
receiving appropriate educational services, (v) studying the implementation o f a program
aimed at upgrading planning, administration and management, and streamlining processes at
various educational levels, vi) strengthening the Ministry's management and technical
capabilities under a cost effective framework, and (vii) reviewing the adequacy o f teacher
educationprograms.

53. The General Education Law was vetoed in part by the President o f the Republic,
especially regarding those articles with adverse fiscal implications. However, the National
Assembly overruled the veto. The Executive Branchand the Assembly have beennegotiating
these issues, which resulted in an agreement on modifying those articles o f the law that had
adverse fiscal implications.

54. Assessment and Recommendations. The passage o f the General Education Law was
salutary. The concerns regarding its fiscal sustainability have been overcome by the recent
passage o f modifications to the Law, which constitutes a prior action for the proposed
operation.

55. Actions to ensure that the school autonomy program reaches all public schools are also
considered beneficial. It is expected that by the end o f 2006 all schools would have received
the training and technical support required to ensure their successful incorporation in the
program. Similarly, there i s merit in the proposals to initiate the studies to launch the
reengineering program, participate in the international student assessment program, review
the school financing formula from the standpoint o f its adequacy as an incentive for student
retention, particularly in the early grades, and assess teacher education programs vis-his
students' demands and needs. For future PRSCs, progress would be expected on evaluating
and adjusting, if necessary, the school finance formula applied in 2006 to ensure it does not
create perverse incentives on either the demand or supply sides.

ii. Health and Population

56. Key Issues. Nicaragua has made substantial progress in the health sector over the last
decade. The 2002 joint IDNIMF annual progress report o f the Nicaraguan PRSP showed an
improvement in 12 o f the 13 intermediate health indicators. Therefore, some key health
MDGs are likely to be achieved (e.g. child mortality, chronic malnutrition and maternal
mortality). In particular, the improving trends o f life expectancy and child mortality
indicators are significant in comparison with countries o f similar per capita income.
However, health services' coverage in remote rural areas remains low and most o f the
indicators on equity showing improvement at the average level do not demonstrate that the



                                            23

poor have been reached inview o f the increasing inequalities across income quintiles. Other
important areas to be addressed are the inefficient service quality and the regressive
distribution o f public health subsidies. The GON appreciates that further gains will only be
possible -and sustained- if the country overcomes the challenges of: (i)health inequality by
geographical areas, gender, and income, (ii)    inadequate sector resources, and, (iii)need to
expand their pro- poor allocations.

57. These shortcomings reflect the Health Ministry's inadequate capacity to implement and
to monitor the National Health Plan, and to assess the impact o f health expenditures. It has
had difficulties in coordinating financial assistance for the sector, as well. Furthermore, labor
productivity and the supervision o f sector's           service qualities require substantial
improvement. Poor compensation scales and complicated compensatory labor incentives
negatively impact labor productivity and the quality o f care in the sector. During the first
semester o f 2006, a general strike o f doctors and all health workers o f the Ministry seriously
damagedthe provision o f essential health care services.

58. Government Actions. The Government has been trying to improve health outcomes,
particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and sustainability
o f the health system. With assistance from the Bank, alongside funds from other sources, the
authorities have set the goal o f improving maternal and child health in the poorest
municipalities o f Nicaragua, constituting approximately half o f the country's poor. It i s
aiming, by improving the health conditions o f this population, to reduce health inequities
reflected in the figures on disparities in maternal and infant mortality. The Government i s
also focused on accelerating progress in implementingthe sector strategy and on improving
the weak supervision and monitoring o f its results. Itmoreover has encouraged the provision
o f health care services by non-public providers through the purchase o f services from local
care facilities under the SILAIS, using capitation methods. The Government has enlisted a
wide array o f donors (including IDB, PAHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, JICA, Netherlands,
Swedish, Finland and Austria) which are now engaged in broad sector support and
coordination efforts. A smaller collection o f donors constitutes the FONSALUD group
which has agreed on support o f the National Health Plan, harmonization o f procedures
possible, and coordination o f activities. In addition, the Government i s now assessing the
impact o f new working and salary arrangements and developing the legal framework for the
professional career within the health sector.

59. Assessment and Recommendations. The policy actions laid down in the Government's
sector strategy would be constructive, as would be its operation plan for 2007. It also would
be beneficial to work on \the design o f the demand side financing options and other
innovations in support o f the health plan. Implementing organizational reforms and
overcoming the above-mentioned challenges, however, will require strong political
commitment in order to improve sectoral equity and efficiency. Extensive technical
assistance should be obtained to achieve these goals, for which the Bank team agreed with
Government officials on the need to coordinate donor assistance and to implement a new
model for the delivery o fbasic health and nutrition services inpriority municipalities.




                                             24

iii. Water andSanitation

60. Key Issues. While coverage ratios for urban water facilities (96 percent) und rural
sanitation (77 percent) are comparatively high, those for rural water facilities (50 percent)
and urban sewage disposal (35 percent) remain low. Moreover, these figures do not reflect
the significant water rationing, poor water quality, especially inrural areas, highinefficiency
o f water losses, lack o f domestic metering, and low collection rates, as well as problems o f
labour and energy cost. Therefore, reaching the sector MDGs remains an important
challenge.

61. Underlying factors include an inconsistent legal framework, excessive political
interference and limited institutional capacities. The draft water law being discussed in the
NationalAssembly, the municipal law, and the law to suspend private sector participation are
inconsistent with the 1998 sector law, which was an important reformbreakthrough. Political
interference hampers the regulatory body (INAA) from exercising tariff setting and service
quality supervision, which could worsen if the 2005 constitutional reforms enter into force.
And institutional weaknesses impede the policy body (CONAPAS,) INAA and the main
public operator (ENACAL).

62. GovernmentActions. The sector strategy approved by the Government in October 2005
(a prerequisite for disbursement o f the second tranche o f PRSC I)       was oriented towards
reaching the sector MDGs in line with the National Development Plan. It stressed: (i)
improving the legal and institutional framework, (ii)expanding access to water and
sanitation, (iii)implementing efficient, participative and decentralized operational models,
(iv) financial sustainability, and (v) improving environmental conditions. It called for: (i)
strengthening CONAPAS' political leadership and decisions on sector resource allocations,
(ii)strengthening INAA, encompassing the implementation of a tariff decree and a
transparent,   pro-poor    targeted   subsidy mechanism,       (iii)modernization,      gradual
deconcentration and decentralization o f ENACAL (including the option o f private sector
participation), and (iv) developing an operational model for rural areas based on user
committees supported by municipalities and the Emergency Social InvestmentFund(FISE).

63. The Government consulted on the sector strategy extensively with donors and
municipalities and NGOs. However, it refrained from entering into a deep discussion with
the National Assembly because o f the existing political differences. Consequently, the
Government did not decide on pending tariff increases or start ENACAL's deconcentration.
The tariff freeze and internal inefficiencies have severely deteriorated ENACAL's finances.
It is now totally dependent on external and Government hnds for its investments. Therefore,
the new Government will have to resume key reforms and dialogue with the National
Assembly in order to resume the efforts planned under the sector strategy. Meanwhile, an
ENACAL restructuring proposal i s expected shortly.

64. The elaboration o f the sector strategy led to the creation o f a sector coordination forum
involving the Government, and many donors and NGOs. They aim to agree on a road map to
complete a SWAP and sign a Code o f Conduct on Alignment and Harmonization. The
Government will have to define strategic and annual operation plans o f the key sector


                                             25

institutions, a sector medium-term economic framework (MTEF) and a monitoring system.
This inturn may lead to understandingswith and among the donors on a common financing
mechanism.

65. Assessment and Recommendations. IDA concurs with the Government's sector
strategy. The Bolafios Government demonstrated good commitment to the sector. However,
implementing reforms and overcoming their opposition will require strong political will and
implementing actions by the incoming Government. Two particular areas could be
considered priorities for policy actions in future PRSCs: (1) improving ENACAL's
efficiency mainly in terms o f reducing unaccounted-for water, possibly by initiating its
decentralization, and (2) preparing a new five year tariff plan, including more precise pro-
poor targeting o f subsidies. Furthermore the Government should link its direct subsidies to
performance improvements specified inENACAL's concession contract.

iv. Social Protection

66. Key Issues. Nicaragua has chronic malnutrition (particularly among pre-school children),
low enrollment in pre-primary and low and late enrollment in primary school, school drop
outs and child labor, youth unemployment, and domestic violence. It i s necessary to
strengthen interventions o f the social safety net inorder to enable the most vulnerable to: (a)
have equal access to quality basic services and opportunities to buildtheir human capital, and
(b) protect them from natural and economic shocks. Weaknesses inthe interventions include
poor targeting o f priority groups, low coverage (particularly in remote rural areas),
duplication and little coordination among programs, unclear definition o f responsibilities, and
lack o f information about programs' efficiency and impacts.

67. Government Actions. The Government has initiated social sector reforms for modifying
the traditional models o f service delivery to include a greater role for households and
communities, and strengthening the key respective institutions. It has put in place several
programs, including the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and an early childhood
development operation. It appears committed to ensuring their coherence and expansion
under its Social Protection Policy (Solidaridad), to continue its implementation, as part of
this operation, the Government will expand its activities to an additional 30 municipalities.
In addition, it will define key areas and target groups for the extension o f basic coverage,
starting with basic health services.

68. The Ministry o f the Family has reorganizedits programs to improve their integration and
better coordinate their operations. It i s also piloting the implementation o f Solidaridad infive
municipalities and experimentingwith different forms o f integrated social service delivery.
The main target groups include poor and vulnerable pre-school children (0-7 years o f age)
and their families, with the goals o f improving their nutritional status and educational
attainment. In addition, Government officials are contemplating a combined rural
developmenthocia1protection strategy, and have started to discuss microfinance operations
and cash transfers.




                                                26

69. Assessment and Recommendations. Integration o f key programs o f the Family Ministry
i s a first step. A second challenge i s the coordination with health and education agencies to
address the problems affecting pre-school children. Mechanisms for coordination with local
governments and NGOs need further definition, along with strengthening accountability
mechanisms for service providers at community-levels. To further the integration o f social
protection with rural economic development, pilot interventions to coordinate social
interventions with productive and income-generating activities and micro-credit initiatives
should be expanded.

         B.3.     PublicInvestment for the ProductiveDevelopment of HumanCapital

i. Energy

70. Key Issues. Nicaragua carried out substantial structural reforms in the sector in the late
1999s. It more recently adopted policies to promote renewable sources o f electricity
generation, facilitate service expansion and adjust tariffs to increased oil prices. But results
on the grounds have fallen short o f expectations and recent black-outs have shown a grave
situation. Lack o f sufficient generation and diversification from the most expensive energy
sources are the major sources o f the problem. Heavy losses indistribution (about 28 percent)
reduce even more the available electricity and contribute to the financial fragility o f the
sector. This inturn discourages generators from contracting to produce electricity on a long-
term basis. An unfavorable investmentclimate i s the major reason for these problems, caused
by a poor legal framework, institutional instability and questionable actions by the
Government's regulator. These have contributed to the lack o f clarity and predictability o f
the sector's rules, which largely explains the scarcity o f resources for new investments and
maintainingexisting facilities.

71. Government Actions. Given the Government's fiscal limitations, a key pillar in its
strategy for this sector has been to attract greater private sector participation, involving the
privatization o f the National Electricity Company's (ENEL) generating and distribution
units.The Government has divested allthe distribution unitsandhalfofthe power generating
units. Privatization o f the remaining generating units has been postponed because o f the
market structure. The Government has adopted measures to promote the use o f domestic,
renewable sources o f energy. A new law provides incentives for renewables and new tariffs
reflect the increased international oil prices. The authorities have developed methodologies
intended to increase access to electricity inrural areas which would involve participation o f
private providers and the local communities. Recently, the Government promoted a dialogue
among parties involved in the sector to try to diffuse tensions which had been mounting due
to the serious supply situation.

72. Assessment and Recommendations.The Bank commends the Government's initiatives
for solving the sectoral crisis and adjusting tariffs to international oil price levels. At the
same time, there is a need for short term actions to help attract investments and reduce
distribution losses. The former could include overcoming the legal limitations on usingwater
resources for projects above 30 megawatts, promoting run-of -river and wind power, and
shielding end users from excessive price fluctuations (without creating distortions). Equally


                                              27

important i s the need for an agreement on reducing the highenergy losses to a level closer to
international norms. It has been recommended that the Government commission an analysis
o f this issue with the participation o f all interestedparties, and the subsequent agreement on a
remedial action plan.

73. There i s also a need for a critical assessment o f the overall legislative framework inorder
to ensure that this is more complete and internally consistent. Further, it would be useful to
examine such issues as the design and functioning o f the wholesale market and the structure
o f subsidies for better targeting and fiscally more efficient results. Adoption o f reforms in
these fields should be a key priority for future PRSCs.

ii. Telecommunications

74. Key Issues. After years o f stagnation and poor service, the Government o f Nicaragua
took bold reform steps starting in 2001 with the privatization o f 40 percent o f the National
Telecommunications Company (ENITEL). It sold its remaining shares in 2003 and granted
new cellular licenses in 2001 and 2003. To provide service to the poor especially in rural
areas, the Government created the Telecommunications Development Fund(FITEL). In2005
the regulatory agency TELCOR successfully awarded the first FITEL bid to provide public
telephones in 340 communities. Sector liberalization began in April 2005, at the end o f
ENITEL's monopoly over basic telephone service. Coverage has improved dramatically as
telephone lines in the country increased from 3.3 to 17 lines per hundred inhabitants between
 1998 and 2004. However, competition in the basic service market i s still not developed
enough.

75. Government Actions. The Government plans to grant at least three new licenses for the
provision o f basic service to new operators during 2006. With the intention that more
competition will lower prices and increase choices for consumers and businesses. Under the
new Rural Telecommunications Project, FITEL will extend service to many communities in
the Atlantic and Central Region of Nicaragua which are still isolated. It intends also to
provide Internet service to 103 municipalities.

76. Assessment and Recommendations. However salutary the Government's efforts to
liberalize the sector, more competition i s considered important to ensure more adequate
service availability at reasonable prices without subsidies. There i s also merit in FITEL's
efforts to extend service to rural areas through innovative schemes in which private
companies would co-invest with the Government.

iii. Transportation

77.Key Issues. The condition and coverage o f Nicaragua's paved road network are the
lowest inCentral America. More than 75 percent o f it i s reported to be inpoor shape, despite
considerable improvements over the last five years. The trunk and collector roads have now
been mostly restored to good condition but the situation o f the secondary, tertiary and
unclassified roads (which comprise 87 percent o f the total network) i s very bad. This
condition largely reflects sustained under-investment, and the use o f inappropriate designs


                                                 28

coupled with inadequate maintenance. Therefore, in order to improve its prospects for
effectively competing under DR-CAFTA,Nicaragua must address the deficiencies inits road
infrastructure, which i s largely the main transport mode for commerce.

78. Government's actions. The Government's strategy has been focused, firstly, on
investments to improve and expand the paved road network to the levels o f comparator
countries. With the success o f the trunk road rehabilitation program, the next priority i s to
improve the secondary and major rural roads which link to the trunk roads and serve the
productive zones. Three IDA-supportedprojects have helped the Government complete 630
km., or just over 50 percent of the NDP's target o f 1200 km. of cement-brick stabilization.
The second area is maintenance. Arrangements for the financing o f maintenance were
achieved under PRSC Iwhen the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV) funding law was
approved. The focus since then has been on developing more efficient channels for
transferring resources to the Fund and ensuring that it carries out least cost maintenance
programs for the core network and subsequently for selected sections o f the municipal
networks.

79.Assessment and Recommendations. It will be essential that roads that have been
rehabilitated are not left to deteriorate (as in the past) and once again allowed to become
bottlenecks. A comprehensive program o f maintenance, including the guaranteeing o f
funding arrangements via the FOMAV, is critical to increase Nicaragua's paved road
coverage. Hence, the passage o f amendments to FOMAV's law to ensure its regular,
sustainable financing through the collection o f a tax o f fuel sales has been critical, and
constitutes a prior action under the proposed operation. The deployment o f least-cost
contractual approaches using micro-enterprises and private contractors for works i s also very
important. For the next PRSC operation, progress should be expected in: (i)         the Finance
Ministry's transfers of proceeds of the special fuel tax collection by the 20th day of each
month, (ii) the Maintenance Fund's more effective supervision o fmaintenance contracts, and
iii)an improved definition o f the maintainable municipal network that i s eligible for FOMAV
co-financing. Also, given the sizeable hikes in oil prices and asphalt costs, the Government
should consider usingthe cementhrick programs whenbuildingnew main roads.

        B.4.    Governance and State Reform

i. Establishing a CivilService

80.Key Issues. Passage o f the Civil Service Law in 2003 produced the basis for a normative
framework for merit-based professionalization o f the public sector. Issues related to
excessive politicization and high turn-over o f public sector employees continue to be
troubling, but initial steps have been undertaken to address them. However, other issues
about personnelmanagement inthe public sector are still pending, limitingthe Government's
ability to implement public policies and to deliver services in an efficient manner. Excessive
and sometimes uncontrolled wage bills and benefits for large groups o f public sector
employees in the health and education sectors, the lack o f proper criteria to provide
incentives for public servants, and the pervasive use o f externally funded consultants to
perform line government positions, are some o f the issues that need attention.


                                              29

81. Government actions. The Government has accredited almost 4,000 public servants and
incorporated them into a permanent administrative career regime. It i s expected that by the
end o f 2006, more than 5,000 more will acquire this status. The process o f fkther
implementing the Law is scheduled to continue until it covers the entire central
administration. Inaddition, the Government is now planning activities which would include:
(i) analysisandultimateadoptionofwagemanagementpoliciesforgradualapplicationin
   the
the education and health sectors for their greater fiscal sustainability and to link salary
increases to performance, and (ii)  the issuance of regulations to limit the excessive use of
consultants, and the design o f a medium-term strategy to implement them.

82. Assessment and Recommendations.Advancing the implementation o f the civil service
reform proved complex. Progress did not meet the expectations set out in the PRSC I
program but, given the complex political situation, the accreditation achievements were
considered adequate. But the other aforementioned issues are now posing serious risks to the
fiscal situation. They also are threatening the sustainability and efficiency o f public policies
and service delivery. Proposed actions to start dealing with them are, therefore, considered
timely and important. The Bank will provide the analytical basis for policy decisions in this
area through the PER and the needed technical assistance through the ongoing PSTAC. The
issues o f public sector wage and consultants' usage are expected to be areas o f expected
progress under subsequent PRSCs.

ii. Public Sector FinancialaManagement and Medium TermExpenditure Framework

83. Key Issues. A two-year action plan for strengthening public financial management
(PFM), prepared on the basis o f the Bank's Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), was implemented under PRSC I.As a result, public expenditure management
systems in Nicaragua have improved, but challenges remain. Box 3 in Section 1V.E o f this
document summarizes key messages o f a recent report on PFM Performance and Annex 8
contains more information on its findings.

84. GovernmentActions. A key outcome o f the Government's plan to strengthen PFM was
the modernization o f the legal framework with the recent issuance o f the Financial
Management and Budget Regime Law (Law 550). The reform record attests to the
Government's commitment in this area. The PFM measures undertaken as part o f the
proposed operation aim at consolidating and modernizing the legal framework regarding
budget    credibility, comprehensiveness      and   transparency,    policy-based    budgeting,
predictability and control o f budget execution, accounting, recording and reporting, external
scrutiny and audit, and donor practices. With the implementation o f the Financial
Management Law, all external hnds channeled through public sector entities are recorded in
the CUT. Inaddition, the Executive has approved budgetary execution norms. Other actions
accomplished include the formal introduction o f a medium-term budget framework, as
evidenced by the incorporation inthe 2006 official budget documentation o f a medium-term
fiscal framework and aggregate budgetary projections o f revenues, expenditures and
investments.




                                             30

85. Assessment and Recommendations. The Government's actions to modernize PFM are
broadly consistent with the Bank's CFAA recommendations, supplemented by the
improvements brought about by Law 550, which is a prior action under PRSC 11.At the same
time, while the Law has improved the general regulatory framework satisfactorily, budgeting
procedures for externally-funded projects are still in need o f refinement. Further actions
which could be considered under future PRSCs include the requirement that central
government financial statements be issued officially, and that a medium-term sector
expenditure framework covering at least 75 percent o f primary expenditures o f the central
administration, i s includedinthe official budgetdocumentation.

iii. Public Sector Procurement

86. Key Issues. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) finalized in 2004
indicated that . there was a need for more adequate direction, management and coordination
o f the overall ongoing Government Procurement Reform Program (GPRP), as well as the
need to ensure that the GPRP was realistic and compatible with the country's implementing
and absorptive capacities. Its key issues were described in the aforementioned Box 3.
Although there have been advances in practices, there i s scope for further improvement. A
module o f the Integrated System for Financial Management and Auditing (SIGFA), which
would inform the public o f procurement legal requirements, transactions and bid
opportunities, is not yet ready. .

87. Government Actions. A new proposed Procurement Law Reform which would provide a
better legal framework has been drafted but i s yet to be approved. The Government has
prepared standard national bidding documents and i s now in the process o f strengthening
public institutions on the use o f these documents. It also has implemented procurement
training and certifications.

88. Assessment and Recommendations. The actions taken by the Government are positive.
But they need further progress inthe following areas: (i)the implementation o f modules for
Government contracting information and purchase price quotations in SIGFA, (ii)the
submission to the Assembly o f proposed amendments to Law 323, and (iii) regular use of
                                                                            the
standard bidding documents in 13 institutions o f the central Government, 6 municipalities, 3
other state powers and 28 enterprises and autonomus agencies. Subsequent actions should
include the full integration o f the Government purchase module into SIGFA and the
Assembly's approval o f amendments to Law 323.

iv. CivicEngagement and Transparency

89. Key Issues. Government and civil society have advanced on the transparency front inthe
areas o f social accountability and the promotion o f a Law on Access to Public Information. t
NGOs have been developing several pilot projects in order to measure the quality o f basic
services (health, education and use of municipal transfers) at a municipal level while several
line ministries, including education, FISE and health, have been working on the design o f
programs to increase citizen participation in the monitoring and evaluation o f the services



                                            31

they provide. Nevertheless, most stakeholders concerned with this agenda remainconcerned
about lack o f access to public information.

90. Government Actions. The Government has worked steadily to develop, institutionalize
and consolidate a system o f citizen participation led CONPES, the National Commission for
Economic and Social Participation. Over the last year, the leadership and the legitimacy o f
CONPES were strengthened. Present priorities include department-level workshops to further
disseminate and discuss the National Development Plan. One indication that the Citizen
Participation strategy i s beginning to show concrete results i s that 32 percent o f the
municipal-level projects registered in the National System o f Public Investment were
recommendedby Departmental Development Committees.

91. A group was established led by civil society organizations, to work on the design o f a
Law on Access to Public Information, Its passage was expected under PRSC I,     butmore time
was found to be needed to obtain consensus on its content. This has now been approved by
the Justice Subcommission o f the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Government has
implemented a Voluntary Information Access Strategy ineight line ministries.

92.Assessment and Recommendations. Access to public information and key development
indicators i s needed for increased transparency and accountability in management o f public
funds and improvements inthe delivery o f basic services. Further actions could include: (a)
approval by the National Assembly o f the Law on Access to Public Information, and (b) the
implementation in at least five departments o f the System for Monitoring and Evaluation o f
PRSP/NDP/MDG/PRSC targets and goals.

v. Poverty Analysis

93.Key Issues. The large external assistance dedicated to budget support focusing on
supporting the PRSP I1indicates that there i s a need to continue annual monitoring o f PRSP
implementation and to have more meaningful analysis on the use and impact o f public
resources, especially those devoted to poverty alleviation.

94. Government's Actions. The Government will continue producing an annual report on
progress in implementing the PRSP 11. The authorities have committed themselves to
preparing annual analyses o f public expenditures, especially those related to poverty
reduction, and include them in the annual PRSP progress report, as well as continue to
prepare the quarterly report on the execution o f poverty expenditures. The PRSP progress
report will also include data on progress on the PRSP/MDG/NDP/PRSC targets. The
Government will also continue to lead the production o f Poverty and Social Im act Analyses
and has agreed to systematically incorporate their findings into PRSP revisions.P

95, Assessment and Recommendations. These plans are constructive. They would enable
donors to effectively monitor the execution o f public expenditures, and would contribute to
determining whether analytical work i s influencing public policy.

'Subjectareas will be agreed with KfW.

        B.5.     Macroeconomic Program

i. Poverty Reduction Expenditures

96. Key Issues. Poverty spending substantially increased from 1998 to 2005 as a share of
GDP (from roughly 8 to 13.5 percent).* This outcome was initially possible by directing a
substantial share o f the HIPC debt relief towards poverty-reducing programs. The authorities
are committed to do the same with the resources which will be saved from debt service after
approval o f the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative for Nicaragua. Unfortunately, the slow
growth o f the economy after 2000 meant that per capita income in 2005 was only justly
above the level o f the year 2000. The impact o f the Government's additional poverty
spending accordingly was limited as the slower growth created fewer opportunities for
citizens to improve their incomes and well-being.

97. Government actions. The Government learned from this experience that poverty
reduction cannot advance substantially solely by expanding public social spending.
Accordingly, PRSP I1 placed greater emphasis on growth-enhancing activities, mostly on
improving the country's physical infrastructure, boosting export potential improving the
investment climate. At the same time, the Government's definition o f poverty reduction
expenditures was modified to take into account this new emphasis and its data series was
adjusted to facilitate comparisons. Further, during the first quarter o f 2006, the authorities
compensated for the shortfall in foreign financing o f poverty expenditures by increasing their
domestic share.

98. Assessment and Recommendations. The level o f poverty expenditures has been rising
steadily, especially in 2005 when the budgetary execution exceeded the approved budget for
such expenditures. Therefore, given the budget's tightness, the resources allocated to poverty
spending in 2006 were left unchanged (as a proportion o f GDP). This prior action for PRSC
I1was accomplished in late 2005 when Assembly approved a budget assigning resources to
poverty spending equivalent to 13.6 percent o f projected GDP. The timely execution o f
poverty expenditures also remains an issue to be closely monitored. Therefore, another prior
action for PRSC I1 was to reach a level o f poverty expenditures execution in the first
semester o f 2006 equivalent to 40 percent o f the total budgeted expenditures. (This is less
than half the year's total allocation as it takes into account the seasonality o f these
expenditures, on the basis o f prior year's experience). Further, the quality o f spending has
become a major concern, since neither improvements in social indicators nor per-capita
income growth have advanced pari-passu with the increase in resources assigned to poverty
reduction. For this reason, the IDA team, BSG donors and government counterparts have
agreed that actions aimed at improving the quality o f poverty spending would be priorities
for future budget support. The precise actions will be agreed after analysis o f the poverty
incidence o f public expenditure inthe next Poverty Assessment.

ii. Maintenanceof adequatemacroeconomicframework

99. Key Issues. While there has been significant progress in reestablishing macroeconomic
discipline, Nicaragua's debt levels continue to be elevated and pose a moderate risk. This
requires continuing fiscal consolidation, reduction o f public debt ratios and the greater
realization o f Nicaragua's growth potential, There are, at the same time, threats to
macroeconomic stability associated with (i)the transfer o f progressively larger fiscal
resources from the central government to the municipalities, mandated by the 2003
Municipal Transfers law, without a corresponding transfer o f fiscal spending responsibilities,
(ii) implementationoftheCivilServiceReformlaw, (iii)rapidlyrisingteacherwages,
     the
and (iv) the recent passage o f laws that threaten to weaken tax administration. There i s also,
from a longer term perspective, the actuarially unsound pension system. Despite the
parametric reforms, additional measures will eventually be needed to compensate for the
projected onset o f system deficits.

100.    Government Actions. The main Government actions to address the threat o f fiscal
destabilization emerging from these developments are discussed in paragraph 79 to 81 (in
reference to the civil service law), paragraphs 101 to 103 (pension reform) and paragraphs
104 to 109 (municipal transfers law). Also, the National Assembly recently approved
amendments to the tax code legislation and the Government has commissioned a study on
containing the growth o f the public sector wage bill.

101.    Assessment and Recommendations. Nicaragua's              fiscal performance remains
favorable and the Central Bank has substantially increased its reserve cushion. However,
possible risks continue to mount as the next presidential elections draw closer. It i s
significant in this context that the Nicaraguan authorities have a good track record o f
adjusting to potentially destabilizing problems. Furthermore, the IMF approved the tenth
program review under the PRGF in September 2006. Accordingly, the PRSC's basic
requirement for the maintenance o f an adequate macroeconomic framework i s considered to
have been satisfied.

iii. Pensions

102.    Key Issues. The Nicaraguan pension system has had financial sustainability problems
since the late 1990's. Therefore, the authorities decided to reform the system along the lines
undertaken by other countries in Latin America, i.e. by converting the pay-as-you go in a
system o f individual capitalization accounts, managed by private administrators. A
Superintendency o f Pensions was created for this purpose. However, actuarial projections
performed after the 2004 Financial Sector Assessment Program showed that the fiscal cost o f
this reform would be greater than its potential benefits and that the financial sustainability of
the on-going systemwas not inimmediatejeopardy.

103.    Government actions. Following these projections, and inlight o f experience in other
countries which have implemented similar reforms, the authorities decided to halt the
implementation o f the reform as originally designed in order to explore other options. A




                                             34

Presidential Advisory Commission has prepared a report analyzing the situation and
suggestingpossible solutions. Its recommendations are still being discussed.

104.     Assessment and Recommendations. Given the difficulties in implementing any
major changes to the pension system, it i s unlikely that such a reform could be successfully
undertaken in an electoral year. Moreover, it is believed that there i s no imminent fiscal
urgency. For these reasons, IDA agreed that it was undesirable to press for any actions under
PRSC 11. Also, since the new Government will need some time to analyze and decide its
policies on the issue, it was agreed that it was untimely too to try to define actions on r future
budget support operations at the present time. Nevertheless, the issue will be kept under the
Bank's surveillance by the Bank, and mightbe addressed infuture PRSCs.

iv. Decentralization

105.    Key Issues. The main issue i s the reduced fiscal space for central Government due to
progressive revenue-sharing without expenditure decentralization. The Municipal Transfers
Law mandates the transfer o f tax revenues to municipalities, beginning at 4 percent o f such
revenues with a target o f 10 percent for 2007. Currently, transfers amount to 7 percent of
collections. This constitutes a severe financing problem as more revenues are being made
available without committing subnational governments to adopt more expenditure
responsibilities. The implementation o f the Law had the potential to weaken the fiscal
position o f the central government, aggravating the fiscal deficit.

106.    Also, decentralization initiatives are being carried out in an ad-hoc fashion. Clearly
defined functions and budget responsibilities have not been distinguished between
municipalities and central agencies. Enforcement has been limited and an overall
decentralization framework, policy and strategy and clear laws are lacking.

107.     Government actions. The GON i s trying to neutralize all transfers to municipalities,
formalize a decentralization policy and decentralization strategy and implementation
program, and clarify municipal and budget functions. While municipal transfers for year
2004 were executed without corresponding transfers o f expenditures, the Government later
acted to cushion the impact o f the Law. Under PRSC I,    the Government committed itselfto a
gradual fiscal neutrality strategy, In 2005, 33 percent o f fiscal neutrality was achieved
through investment expenditure cuts across all sectors. In 2006, it achieved 58 percent o f
fiscal neutrality, below its 66 percent target, through expenditure cuts related to municipal
responsibilities. For the 2007 budget, the Government aims to achieve 100 percent fiscal
neutrality.

108.    A National Policy and Strategy for Decentralization which is linked to the broader
process o f modernization o f the State and institutional reform, aligned with the national
priorities as defined inthe National Development Plan, 2005-2009, i s inthe process o f being
finalized. A presidential decree i s scheduled to be issued approving the policy. The strategy
for decentralization i s being completed and efforts are being made to win consensus among
the main stakeholders. The GON i s currently preparing a new draft o f the Municipal Law
and i s planningto revise sector laws for compatibility.


                                              35

109.    Assessment and Recommendations.The Bank has recommended actions in support
o f fiscal neutrality designed to relieve the problems inthe transfers. However, for 2007, it i s
unlikelythat budget cuts can be realized inthe amounts necessary for full fiscal neutrality. It
i s recommended that there be a transfer o f expenditure responsibilities in key sectors. Also,
the GON should formalize the policy for decentralization and seek broad consensus on its
strategy.

110.    Inthe context ofPRSC I, presidential decree was issuedaimed at clarifyingsome of
                                   a
the budget responsibilities o f municipalities, which was the legal basis for neutralizing the
transfers to the municipalities. To help ensure the continuity o f this reform, the Bank has kept
monitoring the 2005 budgetary execution to determine whether it conformed to the Decree.
Furtherprogress inthis area would be a priority for future PRSCs, including the presentation
o f a new law proposal to the National Assembly, as part o f a revised strategy and policy.
Other laws would need amendment to make them compatible and to better clarify
responsibilities among levels of government ineach o f the sectors.

                         VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

111.    PRSC 11's actions are expected to have positive poverty and social impacts building
upon the findings o f the Poverty Assessment and the Development Policy Review (Box 3).
They particularly relate to P A findings in the areas o f education, increased access to rural
roads and water, and improved access to targeted social protection facilities by the poor.
Similarly, PRSC I1 actions expected to have positive poverty and social impacts based on
DPR findings are designed to improve infrastructure services, rural electrification, and
education achievement, strengthenthe financial system, and to improve governance.

112.    A study on the impact o f DR-CAFTA on Nicaraguan agriculture was undertaken in
2004 as part o f a Central America Regional Study. It showed that the vast majority o f the
population inNicaragua (90.2 percent) is likely to experience welfare gains from the Treaty's
implementation, even in the short run. At the same time, the removal o f trade barriers in
sensitive agricultural crops could adversely affect a small share o f the population living in
poverty in rural areas (less than 5 percent) in the long run. The provisions allow for long
timetables inreducing tariffs on the most sensitive products. Nevertheless, support programs
for certain households may be needed, along with investments in education, rural
infrastructure, rural finance, and technical assistance to help ensure that the rural poor have
the means to take full advantage o fthe new opportunities.

113.    In addition, there have been poverty and social impact analyses in the areas of tax,
education and water reforms. The first two's findings were included in PRSP I1while those
on water reform were incorporated into the country's water strategy. Their significant
features included the following:




                                              36

    a. The PSIA on tax reform determined the impact to be slightly progressive, both on
        vertical and horizontal equity grounds.               The largest redistributive impact o f the
        reform would come once the laws are fully implemented, and complemented by
        progressive public spending. Thus, improvements in tax administration to reduce tax
        evasion and increase revenue collection will be key to the distributive gains o f the
        reform.
    b. The PSIA work on the EFA-FTI indicated the need to consider both supply and
        demand constraints for the poor to take advantage o f this initiative. Although the
        number o f enrolled children with and without EFA would be almost the same,
        efficiency gains (reduced repetition and drop-out rates) mean that children in the
        system would be primary-aged rather than overaged children. For the poor to take
        advantage o f this initiative, the high direct costs o f schooling plus the opportunity
        cost o f labor o f working children need to be addressed. Almost one-third o f rural boys
        in Nicaragua are engaged in child labor and there is almost a one-to-one
        correspondence between work and non-attendance to school.
    C.  The PSIA on water reform's main findings included a need to revise water tariffs
        taking into consideration consumers' abilities to pay in a tier-system. Subsidies could
        be given to the poor based on the volume o f water consumed and the sector's
        financial capacity. Financing o f additional investment needs to be incorporated into
        the water tariff system to be managed by a separate entity. Current water operators
        and future concessions need to have a mechanism for linking contractual
        responsibilities with incentives and penalties. The country's water strategy needs a
        timetable for actions to be implemented.

B.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

114.    The PRSC I1program is being implemented by a Government multi-sector team led
by the MHCP, including nine representatives from the different government agencies
involved in the program. Correspondingly, the Bank staff will focus on the actions involved
inthe fulfillment o fCredit's legislative approval and disbursement, considering that the prior
actions have been satisfactorily met.The ClosingDate was set at June 30,2007,

115.    The Government's monitoring system for the PRSP I1 provides the basis for
monitoring the PRSC's targets. It i s the National System o f Development Indicators
(SINASID) managed by the Technical Secretariat to the Presidency (SETEC), which is also
the GON's leader for the PRSP 11. The five policy areas in PRSC I1are consistent with the
GON's PRSP 11, have agreed overall outcomes. Additionally, prior actions and all other
actions in the policy matrix have specific agreed outcome indicators. The review o f the
PRSC series will be largely based on the monitoring indicators presented in Annex 3. The
indicators o f this operation, and any adjustments that need to be made to the operation as it
evolves, take into account the latest country developments, stakeholder support, and feasible
options for fulfilling the intended development goals.

9Vertical equity implies that those with greater ability to pay taxes should contribute a larger proportion of their
income or wealth in taxes. Horizontal equity implies those with equal ability to pay taxes should pay the same
proportion intaxes.


                                                      37

116.   Further,with the support of the PSTAC, specific actions were agreed on to enhance
SINASID and to allow for PRSC evaluation o f monitoring indicators (benchmarks) and the
goals o f the program. The JSAN to the PRSP I1suggested that the system could be improved
in two ways, by supporting better quality o f administrative data at the sector and municipal
levels, and by establishing a link with SIGFA to provide information on execution o f
disaggregated anti-poverty spending by programmatic area on-line. The Bank i s providing
technical assistance inthis area under the PSTAC. The actions currently being supported are:
(i)furtherstrengtheningoftheSINASIDcentralunitinSETECbyprovidingitadditional
resources to monitor quality and opportunity o f information flows and to enhance its capacity
to process information and prepare timely reports, (ii)reviewing and updating PRSP
indicators with data fkom the last Census, (iii)strengthening Public Sector and Regional
Investment Units (USIP and UTIP) to serve as focal points for gathering information at
sector and regional levels, and (iv) analyzing the qualities and capacities o f sector entities to
produce adequate and timely information as required.

C.     FIDUCIARYASPECTS

117.   Ingeneral, the public financial management systems are adequate for this operation.
As described earlier, the Government, the Bank and other donors are preparing a Public
FinancialManagement Performance Report which inter alia concluded that, while challenges
remain, the Government has taken important steps and i s further moving ahead to strengthen
its public fiduciary control framework. In connection to this process, the Bank i s engaged in
policy dialogue with the Government to follow up on issues identified in the PFM
Performance Report. Drawing on this, certain key actions, cited in Section V.B, were
introduced inthe PRSC program.

D.     DISBURSEMENTANDAUDIT

118.   The Credit proceeds would be disbursed in US Dollars, thus forming part o f the
country's foreign reserves, in compliance with the stipulated single-tranche release
conditions. Disbursements will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirements would be needed. Once the Credit i s approved by the Board, the Borrower
would open and maintain a dedicated deposit account in US Dollars for the loan proceeds. If
the proceeds o f the Credit or any part thereof are used for ineligible purposes ("excluded
expenditures"), as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the
Borrower to either return that amount to the deposit account for use for eligible purposes or
refund the amount directly to IDA. The deposit account in US Dollars would be maintained
in the Central Bank (BCN) and its transactions and balances fully incorporated into the
Government's accounting records and financial statements, via the integrated financial
management system (SIGFA). When credit proceeds are withdrawn from the Deposit
Account and converted into Cbrdobas, the C6rdoba equivalent amount i s to be paid into the
Treasury's Single Account (CUT). Since the CUT centralizes government revenues for
financing o f government spending, credit proceeds will become available to finance budgeted
expenditures.




                                            38

119.   IDA reserves the right to require an audit o f the deposit account by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. In such a case, the audit report would be submitted no later than
six months after the date o f IDA'Srequest. The audit would be conducted in line with
international standards and would provide comfort that the credit proceeds were recorded and
passed on to the CUT as described above.

120.   The IMF's Staff Report on its 2005 Article IV Consultation stated that, "the updated
safeguards assessment o f the BCN, which was completed on August 29, 2003, found that it
continues to maintain strong safeguards and has taken steps to implement the
recommendations made in the 2001 safeguards assessment. The main recommendations o f
the 2003 safeguards assessment and included the adoption o f International Accounting
Standards (IAS). A task force has been established by the BCN to ensure adequate training
for the transition to f t l l IAS. The updated assessment's recommendations have been
implemented, with the exception o f the adoption o f full IAS, which i s planned for the 2004
financial statements." The 2004/2005 audited financial statements o f the B C N were not yet
ready by appraisal. Hence, the PRSC proceeds will be disbursed to a dedicated account
subject to any external audit requested by the Bank.

E.      ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

121,    The specific policies supported by this operation are not expected to entail significant
impacts on the environment, forests or other natural resources. However, as outlined in OP
8.60 on Development Policy Lending, the PRSC team has reviewed the environmental
policies and practices in the country and has taken into account the relevant findings and
recommendations o f such reviews in the design o f PRSC 11. Annex 9 contains this analysis
and recommendations and it identifies positive and negative linkages between the various
policy reforms proposed and the environment. As indicated therein, most policy measures
supported by PRSC I1have positive environmental impacts. To the extent there are potential
negative impacts, these are localized and specific measures have been identifiedto counteract
them, or explain how mitigation is otherwise being achieved within the country's
environmental safeguards legislation and practice, summarized below, and the Bank's
accompanying investment credits, as described inAnnex 9.

122.     Nicaragua prepared a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in the early
1990's which has been followed up with various plans and instruments covering most
sectors. More recently, the GON has prepared a National Environmental Strategy, covering
sustainable economic development, economic valuation, decentralization, environmental
planning, protected areas, environmental quality, environmental education, information
management, science and technology and natural disasters.

123.   Within the National Development Plan, a matrix o f priorities o f the Environment
Policy and Action Plan 2000-2005 lists the objectives, actions and indicators for
accomplishing these targets. The Environment Ministry (MARENA) is also moving forward
with an Environmental SWAP (ProAmbiente) to help coordinate environmental actions.
MARENAproduces an annual State o f the Environment Report that highlightsissues related
to population and the environment, water resources, forests, biodiversity, coastal and marine


                                            39

resources, protected areas, air quality, national policies, and laws and international
conventions. SINIA, the country's environmental information network provides access to a
vast amount o f environmental information.

124.    Most environmental policies and practices in the country are based on the
Environmental and Natural Resource Law enacted in 1996, administered by MARENA.This
law and related legal instruments provide for specific regulation, protection, and
enforcement. These legal instruments describe the conditions under which an environmental
assessment (EA) o f development activities i s required, and the procedures to be followed in
preparing EA studies. Typically, the law requires that any development activity that i s likely
to generate significant negative environmental impacts be subject to an environmental impact
assessment, and that this assessment be cleared by MARENA. The law also requires public
consultation to be held with affected parties/communities to discuss the potential impacts and
their mitigation. Other projects with less significant impacts require various levels o f
screening.

125.    A Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) will be carried out in FY08 to assess the
regulatory and institutional framework for environmental protection in Nicaragua. DR-
CAFTA i s expected to improve enforcement o f environmental norms and regulations due to
explicit commitments in the treaty to this effect. While the implementation o f the treaty i s
expected to lead to greater levels o f trade and investment, which could pose some challenges
to Nicaragua's capacity to manage potential environmental risks, the CEA will analyze the
efficiency and effectiveness o f Nicaragua's environmental policy and institutional framework
to address current and fiture environmental issues, with special emphasis on those arising
from trade liberalization and infrastructure investments. The CEA would also identify policy
and institutional gaps and provide politically feasible and cost-effective recommendations as
well as help the Government to address trade-offs related to (i)  protecting and restoring key
environmental services essential for long-term sustainability, (ii)expansion o f trade, and (iii)
increasing social and corporate responsibility in the stewardship o f the environment to meet
national, regional, and global commitments.

F.       RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

        F.l. PoliticalInstabilityandPolicyContinuity(highrisk,partlymitigated)

126.    Since PRSC I1i s designed as a one-tranche operation and its prior actions have been
accomplished before Board presentation, Credit disbursement faces small risks. The biggest
possible one would be the National Assembly's failure to approve the Credit, given that it
would be presented in the period surrounding the national elections and probably before a
possible second round. Inorder to mitigate this risk, IDA has undertaken consultations with
major political leaders, who expressed a commitment to approve the operation before the end
o f CY06. Moreover, the operation was prepared in close coordination with the other donors
inthe BSG.Nevertheless, there is a riskof lack of adequate political support for the PRSP I1
itself, and hence the sustainability o f the policy actions supported by PRSC 11. Extensive
consultations held with donors, civil society groups and the private sector, though, provide
some grounds for confidence that the policies supported by PRSC I1have broad support. In


                                              40

addition, the programmatic nature o f the PRSC would contribute to the continuation o f key
policies and some o f them would be difficult to reverse. Finally, the fact that a new PRSC
series will be initiated after this operation in order to better reflect the priorities o f the new
Government, should help to mitigate this risk.Yet, there i s uncertainty about the outcome o f
the elections and the associated risks cannot be ignored.

        F.2.    Weak InstitutionalCapacity(medium risk, mitigationmeasures
                underway)

127.    Weak institutional capacity could risk the sustainability o f some reforms supported by
the operation. The accompanying Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit is beingusedto
address some o f the institutional weaknesses and to strengthen fiduciary processes, while a
Public Expenditure Review i s being prepared simultaneously in order to understand better
fiscal sustainability issues and analyze possible solutions. At the same time, several
investment operations in the Bank's Nicaragua portfolio are accompanying the reforms
endorsed by the PRSC series so as to obtain mutual reinforcement between policy actions
supported by the PRSC and their implementation, supported by investmentoperations.

        F.3. Vulnerability to NaturalDisastersandExternalShocks (mediumrisk,
               partly mitigated)

128.    Vulnerability to external shocks i s an ever-present risk in a small, open economy like
Nicaragua's. The country has undertaken important measures to mitigate this risk, supported
by the Bank and other donors, like maintaining an adequate and accommodating monetary
policy. Also, the operation itself would help mitigate these types o f risks by supporting trade
diversification once important export markets are opened by the implementation o f DR-
CAFTA.

129.    Vulnerability to natural disasters i s another source o f concern for the sustainability o f
some o f the policy actions supported by PRSC 11, especially those related to infrastructure.
Once again, the operation itself would help to face better some o f the possible damages
should this risk materialize as the country would now have a self-sustaining mechanism for
maintaining roads. In addition, the Natural Disasters Vulnerability Reduction project has
been supporting a series o f works in decentralized municipalities to reduce the vulnerability
to these risks.

        F.4. Macroeconomic instability(mediumrisk,partly mitigated)

130.     Inspite of major progress in consolidating its public finances, Nicaragua continues
to face threats to fiscal sustainability. In the recent past, these risks have arisen from
legislative measures driven by political considerations, like the changes in transfers to
municipalities, the approval o f the General Education Law implyingunrealistic increases in
the education budget and approval o f pension legislation. Increases in the public salary bill
over and above the private sector overall pay increases have also been a source o f concern.
Other increased fiscal obligations are the result o f increased transparency and efficiency in
the budget management process. As a result of the passage of the Financial Administration


                                               41

Law inlate 2005, all Central Government expenditures are duly recorded inthe budget.Even
though such discipline in public financial management i s highly desirable, the implication
has been that earmarked funds expressed as a percentage o f total expenditures have
increased. The increased obligation o f honoring internal debt in the next few years, implied
by the payment profile o f this debt, is another source o f vulnerability. These risks are being
addressed by the IMF's PRGF program and most political parties are inclined to maintain the
economy under an IMF-sponsored program. Nevertheless, the uncertainties surrounding the
electoral process and its outcome imply that the risk o f some unexpected measures with
negative fiscal consequences remains.

131.    Finally, the sustainability o f public expenditures financed partly by the operation, also
remains a concern. For this reason, the PRSC team has consistently stressed the need to
maintain macroeconomic stability and has coordinated very closely with the IMF. The Public
Expenditure Review to be conducted later this fiscal year will examine the extent o f this risk
more closely and suggest possible mitigation measures. Pending the results o f this study, this
risk is not consideredmajor, giventhe relatively minor amount of the operation inrelation to
its predecessor.   '



132.    Nevertheless, unforeseen political risks and external shocks are still possible. The
Bank will maintain close dialogue with the authorities and partner donors to address these
residual risks as they may arise.

        F.5. Fiduciaryrisks(low risk,largely mitigated)

133.    As discussed previously, the control environment under which the funds will be
disbursed has recently been assessed by the Bank and the IMF and there are no reasons to
believe it to be other than adequate. Accordingly, this risk is considered low.

134.    On balance, all o f the above risks are considered offset by the potential benefits of the
operation.

Dear Mr,Wolfowik:

I am writing to request, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of
Nicaragua, a Poverty Reduction Support Credlt (PRSC) of US$ 25 million
equlvalent in support of our second poverty reduction strategy (PRSP-II), which
was presentedto the Boards of the InternationalDevelopmentAssoclation (IDA)
andthe InternationalMonetaryFundInFebruary2006.

This letter descrlbes the actlons that the Government has undertakenduring the
last two years, focusing partlcularly on the measures that we believe will
contribute most to a sustainable decline in poverty,I refer to the 'PRSC-II Policy
Matrix", which is aligned to the matrix prepared wlth the Budget Support Group
of donors provlding budgetary assistance to Nicaragua in the context of the
Joint Financial Agreement, This PRSC aims to support the bask premises of
macroeconornlc stability and poverty expenditure while focusing on a select
subset of measures of the PRSP-II considered priorities to reduce poverty In
Nicaragua, It emphaslzes economic growth as a necessary conditionto reduce
poverty, development of human capital of the poor, governance and state
reform, and it continues the satisfactory implementation of soclal sector reforms
supported by the PRSC-I.

To contribute inachieving the poverty reductionobjectives set out in the PRSP-It,
the reforms supported under the proposed operation alm to: (1)                     increase the
efficiency of the public sector while Improving Its transparency and
accountabitlty, (Ii) improve the effectiveness and impact of public expenditure

In a number of key sectors through better targeting and coordination of sector
programs, and (iii) strengthen Nicaragua's prospectsfor investmentand growth,

Backgroundand RecentDevelopments

Nicaragua presented its first poverty reduction strategy, titled Strengthened
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (SGPRS), to the Boards of the
International Development Association (IDA) and the International Monetary
Fund In September 2001, The SGPRS served as the basis for the actions and
policies laid out in the PRSC-I matrix and rested on four strategic pillars (broad-
based economlc growth and structural reform, human capital investment,
protection of vulnerable groups, and good governance and instltutlonal
development) and three cross-cutting themes (a reduction in envlronrnental
degradation and ecologlcal vulnerability, an increase in soclal equity and
decentralization),

The Implementation of the SGPRS provided an economic revitalization in a
context of low inflation, exchange rate stability, and declining interest rates, It
also led to institutional reforms in the publlc administration that included the
State's political, administrative, and financlal decentralization, Despite these
achlevements, the increase in per capita income and the reduction of poverty
levels did not turn out as expected. The SGPRS did not foresee the negative
effectof the fall incoffee prices andotheragro-exportproducts, the recordhigh
oil prices, andthe repercussion of the 2001 bankingcrisisonthe internaldebt,

In 2002, the government lnltlated a bottom-up consultation process to update
the SGPRS recognizing the importance of economic growth as a necessary
conditionfor poverty reduction. The resultwas the National DevelopmentPlan
(NDP) presented to the Nicaraguan people in September 2003 and to the
International cooperation community at the Consultative Group meeting later

Macroeconomicstability

Recently the IMF has completed and approved the 10th review of the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program signed with the Government of
Nicaragua in December 2002, During the implementation of the economic
program the country has made substantlal progress in reestablishing
macroeconomic and flscal discipline whlte at the same time protecting
spending on poverty-reducing programs. The level of poverty spending has
been risingsteadily from 11.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to 13,6 percent of GDP In
2005, despite the budget adjustments made in recent years to lower the fiscal
deficit (projected at 2,2 percent of GDP at the end of 2006), This demonstrates
the Government's commitmentto fight povertyand to achieve the MDGs.

The speclflc measures that the Government has taken In the context of the
PRSC-II to reach the objectives of poverty reduction while preserving
macroeconomic stability include:

  0   Obtaining the approval by the Natlonal Assembly of a budget for 2006
      that Is consistent with poverty reduction expenditures of the non-financial
      publicsector of at least 13.6%of GDP.

 Nlcaragua's CompetltiVeneSS, exportsprospects, accessto internationalmarkets,
and the attractionof foreign investment,

ImprovingNicaragua's businessclimate isfundamentalto attractingnew foreign
and domestic investment and to achlsve the rates of growth necessary to
reduce poverty. For that reason, the Government has taken a series of
measures in this area, includlng the negotlatlon and approval by the National
Assembly of the OR-CAFTA agreement, whlch is expected to enhance the
country's economic prospectsbycreatinggreater marketopportunities.

The Government Is takingstepsto preparethe country for the implementationof
the DR-CAFTA and to reduce the negative impact on some sectors. For thls
purpose, it has submitted a series of laws to the National Assembly, includlnga
Competition Law that will provide the creation of an independent agency to
enforce consumer protection rules and regulations against anti-competitive
behavior, legislationto protect intellectual property rlghts, a taw to promote the
competitiveness of small and medium enterprlses and to facilitate their access

In addition, the Government has taken specific actions towards Improving the
landtenuresecurily of indigenouspopulations inthe Atlantlc Coast, The process
of titling and registration of the first indigenous terrltories in the Bosawas
BiosphereReserve has been cumbersome and has taken longer than expected
due to gaps in Law 445.         Nonetheless, the Government has been able to

the future regarding conflict resolution with thlrd parties. It also establlshed the
legal procedures not contemplated by the law for the regularization of
indigenouslands inthe restof the country.

Additionally, the Government Is committed to lncreaslng land tenure security
and improving land adrnlnlstratlon services through the modernization of the

     To help reachthe objectlves of the PRSP-Iiof Improvingthe humancapital of the
     poor and assisting the populations in conditions of extreme poverty, the
     Government has adopted a number of measures aimed at (i) improvlng the
     education system in Nicaragua, (11)   improving the dellvery and effectiveness of
     the health services, (iii) increasing the access of water and sanltation in rural
     areas, and (iv) improving the coverage and impact of social protection

     Basic Education

     The Government has made importanteffortsin the education sector to expand
     the coverage and quality of basic education and to extend the school
     autonomy program. Sector initiatives such as the Education-for-AllFast Track
     Initiative and improved sector coordination and donor alignment have had          Q
     positive Impact on educatlon outcomes, particularly on the coverage of pre-
     school(mainly Inruralareas) and hlgh-schoollevels,

     The Ministry of Education has recently adopted a Common Work Program
     supported by bilateral and multilateral donors for channeling financing to key
     policy priorities and actions in the sector. The actions wlthin this framework that
     are supported by the PRSC-II include:the consolidation of the school autonomy
     regime by, among other things, providing sufficlent financing to autonomous
     schools, and the appllcation of regional and national student assessments to
     evaluatethe quality of educationalservlces.

Early this year the National Assembly passed a General Education Law whose
main objective is to establish the core guidelines and legal framework for the
creation of a National Education System. The law contains Important provisions
to improve the synergy among the educational subsystems and creates a
subsystem for the accreditation and evaluation of educational institutions.
However, it also mandated to raise the budget for prlmary and secondary
education by 5 percent of tax Income per year until 2015, Such an increase
would be beyond the capacity of the national budget and would thus, have
adverse fiscal Implicationso

The Governmentvetoed the law and initiateda processof negotiationswith the
National Assembly which culminated with the modificatlons of the relevant
articles in the law and eliminated the automatic budget increases, In this
manner, the Governmentwas able to

       Obtain the approval by the NationalAssembly of the modifications to the
       General Education Law to eliminate the automatic Increment of the
       transfersto the budgetfor the Ministryof Educatlon.

In the health sector the Government has made further advancements In the
reforms and actions Implemented under the PRSC-I. In this regard, MINSA has
officially adopted and dlsseminated the National Health Plan to be
implemented during 2006-2011 and It is engaged with donors In harmonizing

              In the sector of water and sanitation there has been signiflcant progress in
              achieving the coverage targets at the national level, although great disparities
              remain between the urban and rural areas. The Government has made
              advancements in setting up a sector round table as a coordination forum with
              donors and NGOs and It has demonstrated Its commitment to the
              implementation of the water and sector strategy approved in late 2005.
              However, there have been difficulties in the implementation and institutional
              reforms lald out in the strategy due partly to the adverse political climate. Full

     of two new cellular licensesinthose same years.

     Further to thls, TELCOR has begun to put in place the regulations to open the

Governanceandstate reforms

in recent years the Government has carried out a considerable number of
reforms in the public administration which represent a quailtative turn in the
effectiveness, transparency and accountabilityof the publicadministration. The
passage of the Financial Management and Budget Regime Law in 2005 has
modernizedthe legalframework, establishlng, among other things, the adoption
of a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) based on results for all public
sector entitles. The implementation of the law is underway and so far it has
producedmajor improvements in budget presentation, execution reportlng and
controls. The budget 2007 to be presented for the approval of the National
Assembly will incorporatethe MTEFof all budgetaryagencies,

Following the mandates of the Clvll Service Law, the Government initiated in
2005 the accreditation and incorporation of public servants Into a permanent
administrativecareer reglme, demonstrating itscommitmentto the objectives of
the law of establishing a merit-based regime that gives more job stability to
public sector employees, The accreditation process has resulted In the
incorporation of nearly 4,000 public employees of 18 institutions and it wlil
continue until reaching the entire central government administration In the
mediumterm,

The Governmenthas also made Importantadvancements in other areas of the
public administration as recognized by recent public performance reports
carried out by the Bank and other donors. In the context of the PRSC, it has
consolidated the use of the Single Treasury Account requiring that ail donor
funds channeledthrough public sector entities be recorded In it, Inaddition, it
has prepared a draft Procurement Law draft that will substitute the current Law
323 and make the legal framework for publlc procurement and contracting
consistent with international practices. The Government is moving forward in
spreading the use of standard bidding documents to all central government
institutions, other state powers, autonomous agencies and municipal
governments.

In addition, the Government has continuously reported PRSP II implementation
and the execution of poverty expenditures on a quarterly basis, To improvethe
quailty and Impact of expenditures, it is committedto preparingannual analysis

             ANNEX 2: Nicaragua'sNationalDevelopment Plan(NDP)


1.    InJanuary 2004 after a long process of structural adjustment and fiscal discipline,
Nicaragua finally achievedthe relief o f more than 80 percent o f its foreign debt under the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC).                  Support from the international
community and Nicaraguan society enabled this process to move forward within the
frame o f the Strengthened Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (SGPRS or PRSP I,
2001). This allowed the formulation o f strategies and development programs with
participatory processes to define priorities and establish commitments in the
implementation and monitoring o f national and territorial goals and action plans. The
SGPRS led to institutional reforms in the public administration that included the State's
political, administrative, and financial decentralization.

2.    The National Development Plan (NDP or PRSP 11, 2005) is the culmination of a
process o f participatory planningand consultations from the bottom up that facilitated the
incorporation o f objectives, targets and indicators for economic growth and poverty
reduction. The NDP also incorporates new elements and analytical methods to make the
necessary adjustments on the economic and social policy and to adhere to international
commerce and free trade agreements that will facilitate accelerated economic growth and
poverty reduction, which remain the fundamental objectives o f the NDP.

3.    Despite some progress with the SGPRS, there has been a slow economic growth
and thus the fight against poverty has not been highly effective. The result o f the initial
consultation process was the NDP proposal, designed to overcome the shortcomings of
the SGPRS, and presented to the Nicaraguan people in September 2003 and to the
international cooperation community at the Consultative Group meeting later that same
year. Specific and general recommendations were received and incorporated into the
NDP implementation process.

4.    The implementation o f the SGPRS provided an economic revitalization ina context
of low inflation, exchange rate stability, and declining interest rates.              However, the
increase in per capita income and the reduction o f poverty levels have not turned out as
expected. The SGPRS did not foresee the negative effect of the fall in coffee prices and
other agro-export products, the record high oil prices, and the repercussion o f the 2001
banking crisis on the internal debt.

NDP's Objectiveand Policies

5.    The objective o f the NDP is sustained high levels o f economic growth by
supporting local development through the formation o f human capital and social
protection, democratic governance with wide citizen participation, equity, government

transparency and accountability, and modernization o f the State to take advantage o f
global commerce and regional free trade agreements.

6.    NDP policies are directed at achieving long-term sustainability o f public finances to
maintain low inflation levels and stimulate economic growth. The process to transform
the national budget into the main instrument directed at fostering competitiveness and
productivity in the economy was initiated and it was proposed to reduce the combined
public sector deficit after grants, from -5.3 percent o f GDP in 2001-2005 to -1.4 percent
inthe next five-year period.

7.    It is expected that under a less adverse international setting and under the stimulus
o f the economic development policies, the economy will grow at an average annual rate
o f no less than 4.5 percent during the 2006-2010 period. Under the full implementation
o f the NDP, it i s estimated that GDP growth, in real terms, will be above 5.0 percent for
the 2010-2020 period, with the consequent recovery ofper capitaincome.

8.    The effect o f fiscal discipline and economic growth on the balance o f payments is
important, but also debt relief, increase in family remittances and foreign investment. It
i s estimated that the current account deficit will drop at an average annual rate o f 3.0
percent, from 18.0 percent o f GDP for the 2001-2005 period to 15.2 percent for the next
five years.

9.    More favorable international prices for export products, a boost inthe production o f
non-traditional products, the opportunities fiom free trade agreements, and sound public
policies will speed up, inthe medium term, exports growth. Nevertheless, the impact o f
high oil prices, raw materials and capital goods imported will bring the commercial
deficit above the 2001-2005 period average.

10. The medium term perspectives for resource allocation take into account: a sustained
growth o f GDP based on the comparative advantages of the territories; opportunities from
free trade agreements; the priorization o f policies, programs, and projects with social
impact that will facilitate achieving the millenniumdevelopment goals; and to structure a
better targeted social safety net.

11. Positive aspects that facilitate the financing for the NDP priorities are: a better
financial situation after the HIPC debt relief; the inclusion and approval of the
Millennium Challenge Account initiative; more and better available export markets; the
impact o f higher economic growth on fiscal revenues and tax reforms to be implemented;
the accumulation o f external resources still pendingdisbursement equivalent to more than
20 percent o f GDP; and, the increase o f private and direct foreign investment.

NDP's Actions

12. The NDP contains policy actions in five strategic areas: i)Economic Growth and
Poverty Reduction, ii)Development o f Human Capital and Social Protection, iii)Public

Investmentsfor the Productive Development o f HumanCapital, iv) Governance and State
Reform, and v) Macroeconomic Stability. For each one o f this areas the NDP emphasizes
key policy areas detailedbelow.

13.  Economic Growth for Poverty Reduction.The NDP stresses actions to support
economic growth as a necessary condition for poverty reduction inthree policy areas:

     1) Improving the investment climate for growth by emphasizing the need to
     increase Nicaragua's competitiveness, exports prospects, access to international
     markets, and the attraction o f foreign investment. The plan stressesses the
     importance o f improving Nicaragua's business climate to attract new foreign and
     domestic investment and to achieve the rates o f growth necessary to reduce poverty.
     The plan details a series o f measures in this area, including the negotiation and
     approval o f the DR-CAFTA agreement, which i s expected to enhance the country's
     economic prospects by creating greater market opportunities.

     2) Broadening access to land and credit by increasing land tenure security and
     improving land administration services through the modernization o f the Cadastre
     and the Property Registry. In particular, specific actions are supported towards
     improving the land tenure security o f indigenous populations in the Atlantic Coast;
     and,

     3) Increasing productivitv o f agriculture to fight against poverty on the basis o f
     strong economic growth, supported by a modem and competitive export sector and
     improvements in the domestic market. New policies in the rural sector, besides
     agriculture, are complemented by public-private partnership programs supporting
     agro-industry and food processing that responds to consumer demands.

14. Development of Human Capital and Social Protection. The NDP aims at
improving the human capital o f the poor and assisting the populations in conditions o f
extreme poverty, by focusing on four policy areas:

     1) Improving coverage and aualitv o f education by supporting sector initiatives,
     such as the Education-for-All Fast Track Initiative, improving sector coordination
     and donor alignment to enhance the impact o f interventions on education outcomes,
     and extension o f the school autonomy program. The NDP emphasizes the
     expansion o f the supply o f education alongside the provision o f demand incentives
     to improve access, adaptability, and equity through the increased coverage o f
     services, the transformation o f education to enhance relevance and quality through
     flexible strategies,    and improvements o f school governance to enhance
     participation, results, accountability, and efficiency, including the application o f the
     national system for evaluation o f quality.

     2) Enhancing the deliverv and effectiveness o f health services by bringing into
     effect the conditions for the adoption o f the National HealthPlan to be implemented



                                             55

      during 2006-2011 and harmonizing donor cooperation in the context o f a sector-
      wide approach in support o f this plan. This plan incorporates implementation o f the
      new model for the delivery of basic health and nutrition services in prioritized
      communities to improve the health indicators in the poorest municipalities o f
      Nicaragua and the health status o f these groups to reduce persisting health
      inequities and disparities in maternal and infant mortality indicators across
      geographical areas and income groups. In the area o f population policy, the
      government has revised the population action plan formulated in 2001 and has
      launched background studies to update the plan.

      3) Broadening coverage and aualitv o f social protection programs require
      improvements in their impact and supporting coordinated actions o f all programs,
      including conditional cash transfer, the social protection network and the
      community-based early childhood development program. The main target group o f
      social protection programs continues to be poor and vulnerable pre-school children
      and their families, with the goals o f improving their nutritional status and
      educational attainment.

15.   Public Investments for the Productive Development of Human Capital. The
NDP emphaizes the development o f the social public infrastructure o f the country with
the principal objectives o f promoting balanced economic growth for all territories,
according to their potential, increasing competitiveness through public investments that
foster private investments, reducing social gaps, thereby enabling the country to reach the
millenniumdevelopment goals, promoting inclusion and social participation indecision-
making, and increasing the efficiency o f the investment process. Identified key sectors
and actions are the consolidating the electricity market, expanding telecommunications
services and opening the telecommunications market, supporting reforms in water and
sanitation, and rebuildingthe deterioratedroad network.

      1) Broadening coverage and consolidating energy sector reforms by extending the
      distribution grid, especially to localities without service and which, because o f their
     productive characteristics, to make a qualitative leap in terms o f their productivity
     with special attention to regions with low coverage, such as the central region and
     the Caribbean Coast. Actions to consolidate the energy sector's reform include
     reducing legal and administrative barriers that hinder the entry o f investors into the
     sector, bringing into effect the role o f the regulatory agency, facilitating private co-
     participation to reduce energy deficits and costs to enable increased productivity for
     national industry, and promoting the generation o f energy based on renewable and
     environmentally-friendly sources.

     2) Increasing access to telecommunication services, such as fixed-line telephone
     services, cellular phones, and internet, by opening up the telecommunications
     market. The NDP supports reforms to the telecommunications sector to consolidate
     the privatization o f the National Telecommunications Company (ENITEL) and
     opening the market to competition by awarding cellular licenses to private



                                               56

     companies. Support appropriate regulations to open the fixed-line telephone
     services to competition, such as interconnection, tariffs and competition, which
     should lower prices and give more options to consumers.

     3) Carrying; out the institutional and policv reforms in water and sanitation.
     Coverage targets have improved at the national level, but large disparities remain
     between urban and rural areas. The water and sector strategy was approved in late
     2005, but further efforts are needed to implement the strategy, including the
     required institutional and policy reforms to ensure the financial viability o f the
      sector.

      4) Improving the infrastructure network is vital for the development o f the country,
      particularly in light o f the opportunities from the free trade agreements. The plan
      supports investmentsin paved roads (new and maintenance), reliable access to ports
      and airports, and the interconnection o f the regional networks o f unpaved roads to
      incorporate rural and urban areas. The restoration o f road network conditions i s a
     priority inorder to improve Nicaragua's potential for dynamic, export-led growth and
      to maximize its prospects for competing under DR-CAFTA. Thus, the plan supports
      establishing the mechanism to provide appropriate hnding to the road maintenance
      fimd(FOMAV), to implement a comprehensive programo froadmaintenance.

16. Governance and State Reform. The objectives o f the policy for governance and
state reform are to establish broad and permanent processes for national dialogue, to
strengthen institutions and systems for citizen participation and concertation, to reform
and modernize the state, improving the delivery o f public services, transparency, and
accountability, to decentralize as a process to strengthen local governments and their
competences, and to strengthen branches o f government and reform the legal framework,
according to sectoral demand. The NDP strategy for governance and state reform focuses
on four policy areas:

      1) Modernizing the legal framework for public financial administration to
      qualitatively improve the effectiveness, transparency and accountability o f the
      public administration. The reforms include the adoption o f a MTEF (medium term
      expenditure framework) based on results for all public sector entities, major
      improvements inbudget presentation, execution reporting and controls.

      2) Modernizing the legal framework for public orocurement to make contracting
      consistent with international practices. The NDP also supports the implementation
      o f standard bidding documents to all central government institutions, other state
      powers, autonomous agencies and municipal governments.

      3) Imulementing; the civil service reform by advancing in the accreditation and
      incorporation o f public servants into a permanent administrative career regime,
      which i s consistent with the objectives o f the law for establishing a merit-based
      regime that gives morejob stability to public sector employees.



                                              57

      4) Improvina expenditure tracking svstems, including those devoted to the
      reduction o f poverty, and monitoring and evaluation o f the execution o f poverty
      expenditures on a quarterly basis to improve the quality and impact o f expenditures.

17. MacroeconomicStability. The NDP supports the implementation o f the economic
program inthe country towards consolidating macroeconomic and fiscal discipline while
at the same time protecting spending on poverty-reducing programs. Poverty spending
has been rising steadily since 1998, despite the budget adjustments made in recent years
to lower the fiscal deficit, showing the government commitment to fight poverty and to
achieve the MDGs targets. The plan incorporates medium-term projections for increasing
poverty expenditures while preserving macroeconomic stability. The plan incorporates
sustained efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit, manage the internal debt problem, make
progress in the structural reforms still pending, reduce the social impact o f the high oil
prices, strengthenits poverty reduction strategy, and its democratic process with the next
year's regional and national elections. The plan directs greater efforts at reactivating the
economy in order to set it on the path o f sustainable growth in a context o f low inflation.
Priorities for fiscal policy have also been set in order to reduce the combined public
sector deficit (CPS) after grants, from an annual average o f -4.8 percent o f GDP for the
period o f 2001-2005 to -1.4 percent inthe next five-year period, to increase public sector
savings rate rapidly, and to improve the country's international reserves standing. This,
combined with more targeted social policies with greater impact, will allow for better
results regarding poverty reduction.

Goals and Indicators

18. The NDP responds to the need to review the SGPRS and to carry out new reforms
with the purpose of accelerating and increasing economic growth, employment
generation and be able to reach the millennium development goals. The Government i s
pursuing greater efficiency in the public administration through a decentralized and
fiscally sustainable structure. Municipal decentralization is not limitedto fiscal transfers,
but includes the regulatory legal framework, the development o f strategic and
administrative capacities at the local level, and fiscal neutrality.

19. The NDP, as a strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction, seeks to
balance the country's development policies. It recognizes the progress made, the
challenges and the financial requirements necessary for meeting the main development
goals within realistic limitations imposed by fiscal discipline and economic sustainability.
The goals and indicators found in the NDP (detailed in Table A2.1) are the result o f a
thorough participatory process that included every department o f the country and the
Atlantic regions. From this process, it can be noted that public policy must be focused in
the formation o fhumancapital inthe mediumand long term; and employment generation
and improved income level inthe short term.

Redirectingresources for development

20.   Regarding the financial requirements for reaching the objectives and targets o f the
NDP, a costing o f the required financial resources was made. Based on unit costs,
projections were made for reaching the millennium development goals inthe social areas
(expanded scenario) and for the actions involved in supporting production, investment
and employment generation for the 2006-2010 period. The projections o f the expanded
scenario compared to the ones for available resources under the PRGF (base scenario)
provide a gap that indicates a shortage in reaching some o f the goals originally
established. The NDP prioritized according to sectoral gaps, with an estimated total o f
about US$187.2 million annually to be invested in in infrastructure and support for the
private sector. Evenwith these described changes, social spending continues to represent
the greatest portion o foverall spending.

21. As explained fbrther on, the redirecting o f resources to reach the objectives o f the
NDP includes new mechanisms for channeling international cooperation. The policy
assessment matrixes o f the Joint Financing Agreement, signed inMay 2005, are included
inthe subset ofthe overall actions andare anintegral part ofthis plan.

NDP's Implementation

22.   The establishment o f a participatory system for implementation, follow-up, and
evaluation i s a key component o f the NDP in order to have timely knowledge o f the real
degree o f progress for the next five-year period and the degree to which these meet the
needs o f the different sectors o f the population.        The Presidency coordinates the
formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f the NDP through SETEC
with support from MINREX, MHCP and BCN. Civil society participation is coordinated
through CONPES and the support o f the local development councils, which also play a
role insocial auditing.

23.   The departmental councils and cabinets participate inthe coordination o f the multi-
sector efforts required for implementation and monitoring, supported by the municipal
authorities, the business sector, and civil society.         The SNIP will continue the
deconcentration process o f the Territorial Units for Public Investment (UTIP), through
which public investment proposals are being formulated "from the bottom up" with
ample local participation. This process operates according to specific local conditions
and the Law for Citizen Participation.

24.   The organizational structure for the implementation o f the NDP has been developed
throughout its formulation and has been enriched with recommendations coming out of
the territorial consultation process. This structure adheres to the principles o f the NDP:
broader participation, greater transparency and accountability, greater equity, the
continued modernization o f the State, and support for local development and clusters.
Inter-institutional coordination and the participation o f business leaders and civil society




                                              64

are stressed as key elements. The lessons learned in the implementation o f the SGPRS
and duringthe formulation o f the NDP facilitate future actions inthis field.

25.   At the local level, there are continued calls on groups for consultation and follow up
to municipal projects based on existing structures (cabinets and municipal development
committees). Representatives o f producers and beneficiaries will be incorporated and an
effort will be made to assure a balance by gender and by ethnic groups.

26. SETEC has taken on the strategic coordination for the implementation, monitoring,
and evaluation o f the NDP; and through the Suplementary Social Fund (FSS for its
acronym in Spanish), will continue to coordinate allocation and monitoring o f poverty
spending and HIPC debt relief, as well as to define strategic lines and coordinate the
poverty reduction programs. Also organized and non-organized civil society and the
international community are key partners inthe implementation o f the NDP.

27. An obligatory dimension o f the implementation o f the NDP i s its dissemination and
appropriation and for this, there will be continued reporting and consultation ina massive
or selective manner as required. The results o f these consultations will continue to be
shared with the territories. By sharing the best strategies for implementation, the
requirements to reach the goals and indicators, and improving local capacities and market
potentials, there will be optimum impacts on the NDP implementation process.

Follow-Up Systems

28.   The Government will follow-up and evaluate economic growth and its impact on
reducing poverty levels, on meeting the millennium development goals and on selected
intermediate indicators for the social, productive, infrastructure, environmental, and
governance sectors. Equally important i s the follow-up to the overall process o f the
departmental development plans along with the communities and the local governments.
Reinforcement o f inter-institutional coordination i s essential for guaranteeing the follow-
up and transparent and efficient evaluation o f the NDP. SETEC, MHCP, MINREX and
B C N head up this effort, which also requires support from the local governments, other
institutions o f central government, CONPES,other representatives from civil society, and
the cooperation community in order to maintain a participatory and effective system for
follow-up and evaluation.

29. The system for follow-up and evaluation is articulated out from the existing
governmental structures, and the available instruments for measuring economic growth
and reduction o f poverty will be strengthened. B C N keeps information about key
macroeconomic variables, MHCP plans and controls budgetary execution, and SETEC,
through SNIP, follows-up the physical and financial performance o f public investment
and the overall NDP goals evolution. The Institute o f Census and Statistics (INEC)
gathers and processes socioeconomic data, including household surveys for measuring
the living standards (LSMS, NDHS, other specific surveys, and agrarian and national
population census).



                                             65

30. In order to have key information about the NDP implementation and progress
process, priority i s put on following-up of: (a) the General Budget, including poverty
spending, HIPC relief, and budget support; (b) the Public Investment Program (PIP),
including Municipal Investment Plans; (c) the economic and social impact and output
indicators; (d) policy actions; (e) the PRGF and other international commitments; and (f)
budgetexecution auditing by the CGR. For each aspect mentioned, there'are systems for
follow-up that consolidate the information from the institutions and are based on existing
structures and follow-up systems. To follow-up performance, each ministry or line
institution has a database with statistical information from which the global information
systems gather the most relevant indicators.

31.   Below i s a brief description o f the systems being implemented for follow-up to
prioritized information:

Integrated Systemfor Financial Management and Auditing -SIGFA

32. SIGFA is a system o f financial information for the formulation and execution o fthe
General Budget for all public institutions. Its objective i s to contribute to efficiency,
efficacy, and transparency in the management o f public sector finances.          It has four
modules: a) SIGFA: financial system (budget, treasury, and accounting); b) SIGFAPRO:
physical-financial follow-up o f projects for institutional cooperation; c) SNF: national
system for the fiscal payroll; and, d) SIGFITA: temporary system for the formulation and
execution      o f   temporary     deconcentrated    spending.      SIGFA's     web     page
http://www,hacienda,nob.ni/hacienda/dr sinfa esig;fa.isp for on-line access to budgetary
information from all governmental institutions. The SIGFA i s now installed in 38
governmental institutions that use the system to update their data and generate periodic
reports on budgetary execution at the level o f recurrent spending and capital spending by
program and project. It i s expected to extend its implementation to the rest o f the public
institutions, strengthening the processes for the administration o f public funds.

National Systemfor Public Investments-SNIP

33.   This is a physical-financial information system for all public investment programs
and projects o f the institutions, autonomous andor decentralized entities, and all those
institutions or autonomous agencies that receive funds from the public sector or in which
the State i s a shareholder. SNIP has two modules: a) a database for physical follow-up to
public investment projects; and, b) an accounting system for projects.          It generates
various kinds o f physical-financial reports about public investment with major levels o f
breakdown. The database i s available on the SNIP web page -)                         where
documents about public investment projects can be accessed. In concordance with the
decentralization process and through' the Program for Participatory Implementation,
Monitoring, and Evaluation o f the NDP (PASE), the Departmental Technical Units
(UTD) have been set up as decentralized bodies for the formulation of the portfolio of
public investment programs and projects inRivas, Le6n, Jinotega, Boaco, Chontales, Rio



                                             66

San Juan, Carazo, Esteli, RAAS and MAN. This system is currently being used by 30
institutions for the physical-financial follow-up o f their projects.

National Systemfor Follow-Up of Development Indicators -SINASID

34. The national information system (SINASID) expands the flow o f information for
monitoring, coordinates and develops the activities o f gathering, analyzing, and
disseminating information related to the SGPRS, NDP, Millennium Development Goals,
PRSC, Joint Financial Agreement (FA), and others. The system, on the web page
www.setec.nob,ni/sinasid, provides the necessary inputs for making evaluations o f the
impact o f policies and programs on the poorest population. The main information
providers continue to be the line ministries, MHCP and BCN. This information i s
complemented with data from censuses and surveys undertaken by INEC and by
specialized surveys and additional specific studies considered necessary for evaluating
the impact o f public actions on poverty reduction. Territorial Units for Monitoring and
Evaluation were established in five departments already to contribute to the process o f
formulation, implementation, and monitoring o f the Departmental Development Plans
with programs, projects, and indicators at the local level.

Evaluations

35.   In order to evaluate the efficiency and impact of the strategy in relation to
established objectives, the Government i s undertaking objective and systematic analysis
o f the performance o f policies, programs, and projects. Recently, the Government has
undertaken evaluations o f certain policies with technical assistance from international
organizations and bilateral donors, like the Poverty Social ImpactAnalyses (PSIA) on tax
reform, education, and public investment. Others PSIA on decentralization, autonomous
schools and family remittances are programmed. There have also been evaluations o f
specific programs to determine their impact on target population and the results have
helped to identify weaknesses and strengthen implementation, or to abort programs,
thereby freeing up resources to rationalize spending.

36.   Social auditing has been taking on greater relevance in recent years, especially
because o f its fbnction in improving policies to fight poverty and state reform. It
represents a participatory space that allows for measuring, evaluating, and controlling
efficiency inthe implementation o f policies, projects, and actions, fostering transparency
and accountability. Its importance lies in that it constitutes a means for democratization
and its strengthening, making space for citizen participation with a greater emphasis on
the poor and unprotected population. The institutions fostering social auditing are
CONPES,which constitutes a bridge for non-political communication among community
associations, other civil society, political parties, and government institutions; and
CONADES, which i s a forum for follow-up, analysis, and evaluation and dissemination
to promote the adoption o f a model for sustainable development.

Reports

37.   SETEC has the responsibility of monitoring the overall implementation o f the NDP
and to prepare progress reports presented to Nicaraguan society and the international
community. Among these reports, the NDP progress report, poverty expenditures, and
HIPC debt relief allocation and usage are o f importance. Additionally, there are reports
for the PRGF, the social and economic policy, and the evaluation o f the public
investmentprogram, and structural reforms contemplated in sectoral-wide program and
budget support. Lastly, the monitoring of poverty reduction levels requires financial
resources and some actions, such as the LSMS, DHS, employment surveys, population
census, and other instruments like poverty and territorial economic potential map that
will facilitate additional adjustments to the goals o fthe NDP.

On January 18, 2006, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Nicaragua.

Background

Nicaragua has made many important advances inthe last few years. The economy has grown
and poverty has fallen in the context o f a stable macroeconomic environment that has
supported real incomes o f the poor and created more jobs. Several key reforms have
advanced inthe areas o f improving revenues, and strengthening governance and the financial
sector framework.

Following a decade o f economic decline, the return to democracy and adoption o f economic
reforms in the early 1990s generated a strong recovery. Nonetheless, this period also saw the
emergence o f new vulnerabilities, including high fiscal deficits and a widening current
account deficit financed in large part by official transfers. Moreover public sector debt levels
remained elevated at close to 200 percent o f GDP. In 2000-01, the economy deteriorated
sharply following a severe banking crisis, a weakening o f fiscal and monetary policy and
deterioration inthe external environment.

The government that took office in 2002 moved quickly to address the large imbalances,
tightening the fiscal and monetary policy stance. The authorities' economic program was
supported by a PRGF arrangement approved inDecember 2002. Real GDP growth increased
from 0.8 percent in2002 to 5.1 percent in2004 and inflation remained stable, averaging 6.6
percent inthis period. Nicaragua reachedthe HIPC completion point inJanuary 2004 and the
NPV o f the country's external debt should fall from 120 percent o f GDP at end-2004 to 70
percent o f GDP upon full delivery o f expected HIPC relief.

Subsequently, the economy has been adversely affected by the increase in international oil
prices, which has slowed growth and contributed to higher inflation. Real GDP growth i s
expected to have moderated to 4 percent y/y in 2005 while inflation ended the year at 9.6
percent y/y and the foreign currency reserve coverage ratio decreased to about 2.6 months o f
imports. The program went off-track at the end o f 2004 reflecting the impact o f heightened
political tensions on policy implementation. Since then the authorities have sought to reforge
the domestic political consensus for economic reforms, strengthen the macro-policy
framework and advance key structural reforms to bring the program back on track. They

' Under  Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holdsbilateraldiscussionswith members, usually every year. A staffteam
visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summaryis transmittedto the country'sauthorities.




                                                                81

have taken measures to bolster fiscal performance such that the consolidated public sector
(CPS) deficit after grants i s expected to fall to 2.2 percent o f GDP in 2005. Meanwhile,
monetary policy has continued to be conducted in the context o f the crawling peg exchange
rate regimewith the currency depreciatingby 5 percent per annum.

In order to strengthen the macro-policy framework further, the 2006 budget targets an
unchanged CPS deficit in 2006 at 2.2 percent o f GDP which should support stability in the
run-up to this year's elections. To preserve competitiveness and the room for poverty
spending, the budget contains the growth of the public sector wage bill broadly in line with
expected inflation. Since adoption o f Nicaragua's first PRSP in 2001, poverty reducing
spending has been increased from about 10 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 13% percent o f GDP
projected for 2005.

The authorities have made renewed advances on the structural reform agenda in recent
months. The assembly has approved three key financial sector laws, which together represent
significant reforms in line with FSAP recommendations. They have also approved the
financial administration law which strengthens budgetary procedures and the fiscal
framework. Other measures have sought to off set the fiscal impact o f the decentralization
process and contain losses inthe electricity sector.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Nicaraguan authorities for maintaining a broadly stable
macroeconomic framework, with continued growth, rising reserves, and lower fiscal deficits.
They welcomed the efforts o f the authorities to strengthenthe domestic consensus in favor o f
the reform agenda supported by the PRGF arrangement. The recent political accord has
allowed for passage o f key measures under Nicaragua's reform program that holdthe promise
o f strengthening medium-term sustainability, and supporting the economic growth that will
be needed to reduce poverty levels-which      remain among the highest in the region-and       to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this context, Directors welcomed
the authorities' commitment to use resources set free through the debt reductionprovided by
the Fund to Nicaragua under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) for poverty-
reducing spending, and recommended that such spending be monitored closely. They
encouraged the authorities to continue negotiations with creditors, including non-Paris Club
creditors.

Directors cautioned that, despite the positive orientation o f recent policies, significant
vulnerabilities remain, including from the level o f public debt-which  i s still high even after
MDRI debt reduction-a         large current account deficit, and widespread financial system
dollarization. In that light, prudent macroeconomic policy implementation will be important,
focusing on key structural reforms in the fiscal, energy, and financial sectors aimed at
fostering growth and promoting fiscal consolidation-while     increasingthe scope for poverty-
reducing spending. Directors welcomed Nicaragua's approval o f the U.S.-Central America-
Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), but notedthe need to improve the




                                             82

investment climate, governance, and the legal and regulatory framework further in order to
leverage fully the Agreement's potential.

Directors welcomed the authorities' progress in implementingthe poverty reduction strategy,
and the revised and improved second-generation PRSP (PRSP 11) that has been incorporated
inthe 2005-2009 NationalDevelopment Plan. They broadly welcomed the formulation ofthe
PRSP I1through a participatory process, and its emphasis on increasing economic activity
and employment in order to promote poverty reduction. Directors noted that poverty-
reducing spending has increased, resulting in an improvement in indicators in the education
and water sectors. They looked forward to the release o f more recent data regarding poverty
trends.

Directors commended the authorities for the disciplined fiscal policy stance o f the 2006
budget, which will support stability in the run-up to the elections. They stressed the
importance o f adhering to the budget framework in the election year, and o f identifying
measures that could be taken inthe event o f unforeseen shocks.

Directors encouraged the authorities, in light o f the rapid growth o f public sector wages over
the last few years, to maintain tight control over the public sector wage bill. They therefore
welcomed that the budget broadly contains the growth o f the wage bill in 2006 to the
expected inflation rate. They urged the authorities to resist any pressures to increase public
sector wages beyond program levels. At the same time, a few Directors recommended that
the authorities re-examine the structure o f the public sector wage bill to ensure that priority
pro-poor services were not compromised.

Directors supported the steps taken by the authorities to contain losses in the electricity
sector, which had begun to threaten the overall fiscal position, while protecting low-income
electricity consumers through targeted subsidies. Looking ahead, Directors noted that further
rate increases would likely be needed to fully eliminate losses. They emphasizedthe need to
strengthen the regulatory framework to attract much-needed investment in energy assets. In
this regard, the recently approved Energy Stability Law should be amended to eliminate
distortional interventions inthe energy market.

Directors welcomed the central bank's intention to tighten liquidity conditions to curb rapid
credit growth and safeguard reserves. They noted that this would also help contain the recent
pick-up o f inflation, which seemed to reflect inpart second-round effects o f the oil shock and
demand pressures from rapid growth in credit and public wages. Directors agreed that the
current crawling peg exchange rate system i s appropriate, and that keeping the rate o f crawl
o f the depreciation o f the c6rdoba unchanged in 2006 would appropriately balance stability
and competitiveness. At the same time, Directors recommended that, after financial sector
strengthening and full credibility o f the macroeconomic policy framework have been
secured, the authorities should consider moving over the medium term toward a more
flexible exchange rate arrangement.




                                             83

Directors stressed the importance o f taking early steps to strengthen the elements o f the tax
code governing the powers and operations o f the tax administration. Inthis regard, they were
concerned that the tax code approved last year would weaken the authority o f the tax
administration and could undermine revenue collection. Accordingly, Directors urged the
authorities to amend the law soon in line with international best practice, as envisaged under
the program.

Directors welcomed the measures taken to safeguard the fiscal framework, including the
passage o f the Financial Administration Law. They stressed that a significant fiscal reform
agenda remains to be articulated and implemented. In particular, Directors highlighted the
need to develop a plan to set the public pension system on a sound actuarial foundation and
prepare a strategy to introduce a disciplined fiscal responsibility framework. The
decentralization framework needs to be reformed to link the devolution o f revenue transfers
to municipalities with spending responsibilities and accountability in a transparent manner.
Directors also advised the authorities to consider reducing earmarking o f budgetaryresources
over time to support fiscal flexibility. They looked forward to action in these critical areas
soon after the elections.

Directors commended the authorities for the approval o f several key laws on banking and
supervision, in line with many core FSAP recommendations, which they considered have
strengthened the financial sector framework. However, further work i s needed to ensure
smooth implementation o f these laws. Directors welcomed the authorities' plans to
incorporate additional FSAP recommendations into their reform agenda, in particular, to
strengthen central bank independence and reinforce the protection o f bank supervisors,
especially against criminal prosecution related to their good-faith official actions. The
progress made in strengthening the legal and institutional framework to counter money
laundering and the financing o f terrorism was noted, but the authorities were encouraged to
expand the Financial Analysis Commission and create an independent Financial Intelligence
Unit.

WhileNicaragua's debt burden has been substantially reduced thanks to the HIPC initiative,
debt levels remain elevated and subject to a moderate risk of distress. Maintaining this risk-
classification will be contingent on the continued reduction of the high level of domestic debt
and the realization of the growth prospects assumed in this analysis. Long-term debt
sustainability will continue to require the support of sound macroeconomic policies,
including pursuedfiscal consolidation. Full delivery of expected HIPC debt relief is key to
reduce the risk of debt distress. The A4DRI will contribute to lower debt-related vulnerability.

3.         Domestic public debt increasedin2000-01 in the context of a bankingcrisis and
the settlement of claims arisingfrom the expropriationof property, but has since fallen
with the pursuitof fiscal consolidation. As o f end-2004, it amountedto about 30 percent o f
GDP. At this point, more than 2/3 o f the domestic debt comprised property indemnization
bonds (BPIs), issuedby the government to resolve land disputes arising from expropriation
o f property under the former Sandinista regime. Most o f the rest comprised central bank
paper, issuedon behalf o f the government, to recapitalize intervened banks during the
financial crisis o f the early 2000's. About 4/5 o f the stock o f bonds at end-2004 had a
remaining maturity o f longer than one year. Domestic debt has fallen since 2003 inthe
context o f shrinking fiscal deficits and substantial net external financing that has facilitated a
substitution o f domestic market debt with concessional external debt. This has also ledto a
reduction inthe net presentvalue o f total debt, However, gross financing requirements on
domestic debt inthe next few years are expected to remain large, reflecting upcoming
maturities o f BPIs, highlightingthe need for cautious liquiditymanagement and moving
forward with the fiscal consolidation effort.

policies sustain improvingmacroeconomic conditionsover the rnedi~m-term.~ such a                                        In
scenario, consistent with the authorities' PRSP, investment inhuman capital and
infrastructure, financial sector development, and governance improvements boost total factor
productivity, allowing a rate o f GDP growth o f about 5 percent per year. As the impact o f the
current oil shock is assumed to wane, inflationgradually decreases to around 3 percent

maintained thereafter. The current account improves gradually as exports benefit from
continued investment inthe tradable sector and rising volumes o f traditional exports, while
tourism activity converges to regional levels. Foreigndirect investment is boostedby DR-
CAFTA and the improvement inbusiness conditions. Despite a gradual reduction inofficial
financing to very small amounts, the coverage o f net international reserves is expected to
improve and reach about 4 months o f imports by the end o f the projection period.

5.      DR-CAFTA is expected to enhance the growthperformanceof the whole
CentralAmericanregionincludingNicaragua,The main effects are likely to be a rapid
increase intrade flows with the United States, increaseddiversification o fproduction by the
traded sector, a pickup inFDIinflows, and reducedmacroeconomic volatility. Of all the
signatory countries, Nicaragua i s expectedto face the smallest fiscal impact, mainly owing to
a favorable schedule o f tariff reductions. Sustained structural reforms, including further
strengthening o f the business environment and regulatory framework, would helpNicaragua
leverage the full benefits o f the agreement6

6.      The debt-burdenthresholds usedfor the analysis are those applyingto strong
performersinterms of policies and institutionquality, as measured by the WorldBank's
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA). However, Nicarapa was only
recently reclassified into this stronger category, and that by a narrow margin. Inthis context,
debt indicators close to the thresholds reflect a vulnerable situation.

HIPC reliefby all creditors by end-2006, the net present value (NPV) o f external public debt
would increase from 40 percent o f GDP in2005 to 53 percent o f GDP in2011, reflecting

debt would only decreasebelow the 50 percent threshold after 2014. Debt as a share o f
exports, however, would remainbelow the thresholds for the whole projectionperiod,
reflecting the relative openness o fNicaragua's economy.     * Duringthe projectionperiod, the
external debt service-to-export ratio would also remain well below thresholds owing to the
relative front loading o f HIPC relief and the long grace periods granted by multilateral
creditors.

8.      Totalpublic debt would show a similar path(Table 5). Under the baseline
scenario, fiscal consolidation would facilitate continuing the process o f substituting
expensive domestic debt for external concessional debt for some time. Consequently,
domestic debt would continue to decline gradually. As such, given the highproportiono f
external debt, the overall debt dynamics are dominated by developments o f external debt.

11.Sensitivity analysis

9.      Eventhough the baseline scenario points to Nicaragua'sriskof debt distress
beingreduced over time, the debt stillremainsvulnerableto shocks. Stress tests illustrate
the vulnerability o f Nicaragua's debt situation, Under the standardizedboundtests provided
by the LIC-DSA externaltemplate, which simulate the impact on the baseline scenario o f a
series o f shocks to real GDP growth, export growth, GDP deflator, the amount o f transfers
and FDI, and exchange rate, the external debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly above 70
percent (Table 4). Inthe most extreme stress test o f a 30 percent nominal depreciation, the
external debt ratio would not come back below the 50 percent threshold before 2021. Inthat
scenario, total public debt would increase dramatically to over 90 percent and remain above
70 percent o f GDP until2015, even assuming that the fiscal consolidation effort is
maintained through time (Table 6).

10.     The implementationof the MultilateralDebtReliefInitiative(MDRI) would
help reduceNicaraguadebt's vulnerability. The initiative would provide debt reliefto
Nicaragua equivalent to about 8 percent o f GDP, o f which 2 percent for the Fundand 6
percent for the Bank.' With the implementation o f the MDRI, all indicators o f external debt
sustainability would remainbelow thresholds for the whole projection period. The savings on
debt service should be usedto increase poverty reducing spending without generating any
new debt burden.The dynamics o f the external debt are mirroredby total public debt, given
that the MDRIdoes not have an effect on domestic debt.

111. Conclusion

11.     Nicaragua'sdebt is subject to a moderate risk of distress, but can be managed
with the support of sound macroeconomic policies.Nicaragua's risk classification will
remaincontingent on the materialization o f the growth prospects expected inthe baseline

scenario and on the sustained quality o f economic policies and institutions. While most ratios
remainbelow their thresholds inthe baseline scenario, the threshold i s breachedinthe case
o f the external-debt-to-GDP ratio for severalyears. Inaddition, the highlevel o f domestic
debt, ifnot successfully reduced, could pose a significant risk o f debt distress inthe medium
term. While full delivery o f expected debt relief is essential to lowering debt stocks, and
delivery o f reliefunder the MDRIwould further reduce risks, reducing the probability o f
debt distress inthe mediumand long-term will continue to require sound macroeconomic
policies, among which fiscal discipline i s key.

12.     The authorities broadly shared staff's assessment. Their own DSA is inline with
staffs results. They agree that careful macroeconomic management i s neededto ensure long-
term debt sustainability, as recognized inthe PRSP. The authorities also stressedthat they
have one o f the largest share o f non-multilateral non-Paris Club debt intheir total debt
among all HIPCs, and that this explains why progress inachieving the reduction o f their debt
expected at completion point has been slower. Finally, the authorities welcomed the MDRI
and looked forward to benefiting from it as early as possible.

ratio of 168 percentat end-2004. Usingthe methodologyof the Low IncomeCountriesDSA framework
(DSF), this ratio as of end-2004 i s now estimatedat 110percent, 58 percentagepoints lower.This decrease
i s mainly explainedby the changes in methodology,but also in part by unanticipatedchanges inthe
variables usedto calculate the ratio. The factors underlyingthe decreaseinthe ratio are the following:
1, Changes in methodology.The bulk o fthe decrease inthe NPV-of-debt-to-exportsratio (53 percent) is
explainedby the change inthe methodologyusedto calculateNicaragua's debt indicators,including
changes in:
  a.     The definition of exports: The DSFmethodologyuses a gross definition of the maquilasector, while
        the completionpoint definition includedmaquilaexports net of imports.Inaddition, the DSFuses
         same-year exports, as opposed to the 3-year backwardaverageusedfor the completionpoint.
  b. The discountrateusedto calculatethe NPV of debt:the DSF methodologyuses of afixed 5
        percentrate comparedto the currency-specificdiscount rates under the HIPC methodology.
  c.     Exchangerates: Debt service is projectedusingWE0 assumptionsinthe DSF, as opposedto fixed
        (end-2002) exchanges ratesusedfor the completionpoint.
2. Unanticipated changesinthe variables usedfor the projection,including stronger-than-anticipated
export performance and slightly higher-than-anticipatednew disbursements.

   Annex 7 (a): PRSC I1Consultationswith Civil Society andNationalAssembly


At the concept review meetingheldon April 24,2006 for this operation, itwas decidedto
hold a series o f smaller consultations with civil society and congressional leaders o f the
National Assembly earlier on in the design process,              with the hope that earlier
interchanges o f information would not only enrich the designo f specific prior actions
but would also create informed and timely support for the operation within the different
political tendencies o f the Nicaraguan parliament given the electoral climate o f the last
six months o f the calendar year.

A total o f 4 consultations were carried out between the 6th and the 8th o f June with the
following groups and thematic areas: (See Annex 1 for lists o f consultation participants
Per group)

            0    Titling of Indigenous Land: Representatives o f the regional autonomous
                 governments (RAAN and RAAS), donors, representatives o f civil society
                 concerned with Indigenous land titles and other national land tenure
                 issues, and one member o f the Nicaraguan Supreme Court.

            0   Overall discussion of        PRSC trigger actions:        Members o f the
                Nicaraguan National Assembly- Executive Committee,              members of
                Economic and PRSP commissions and chief heads o f political parties
                (PLC, ALN, FSLNand CC)

Inpreparation for the consultations, background information on budget support and the
PRSC was circulated ahead o f time via email and copies o f the power point presentations
were given at the beginningo f each consultation with tailored questions to help focus the
discussion. (See Annex 2: Presentations for PRSC 2 consultations)

Each meeting started with a presentation by the World Bank on the characteristics o f the
PRSC programmatic series in support o f government policies to poverty reduction in
Nicaragua. The presentation outlined the concept o f budget support in Nicaragua and a
description o f the content and prior actions o f the programmatic PRSC.

The following i s a briefsummary o f the four consultations:

Titling of Indigenous Land and pending PublicRegistryLaw

Participants from both government and civil society made suggestions to clarify concepts
such as region,     territory, and community.      Territories, which may include numerous



                                              99

communities, are the entities to be titled and registered. Bosawas should be referred to as
the "protected area o f Bosawas".        Region should only be used to refer to the 2
autonomous regions, the RAANand the RAAS.            The 5 territories whose registering and
titling are conditioned inPRSC 2 and 3 encompass 87 Indigenous communities.

One member o f the Regional Council o f the RAAN commented that, as a result o f the
partial waiver givenby the Bank with respect to the titling and registering o f 5 territories
inBosawas, there is less confidence that a solution will be found.       Itwas evident, after
comments from the Supreme Court magistrate and from the legal advisor o f the Regional
Council o f the RAAN, that there are fbndamental differences in the interpretation o f the
legal requirements to registry Indigenous territories.    Nevertheless, both parties, in the
discussion, expressed confidence that a solution could be politically negotiated and all
parties agreed that the revival o f CONADETTI was a necessary condition for that
solution.    The discussion was in general constructive and the authorities who attended
from the M A N and the RAAS thanked the Bank for facilitating a constructive
discussion.

In a general discussion about the pending Public Registry Law,            it was evident that
improved communication between the major government entities (Executive, National
Assembly and Supreme Court)          would most likely lead to a consensus on the 4 or 5
issues still needing resolutions. These include: definition o f the juridical nature o f the
land registry process, the issue o f supplementary titles, the relation between cadastre and
registry. Parties involved agreed to meet duringthe following week to devise a process
to resolve these issues in order that the National Assembly could consider the bill before
leaving for midyear recess.

Macro-economic related triggers consultation

The main observations o f participants in this session emphasized the need to focus not
only on the amount o f resources dedicated to anti-poverty expenditures,         but also the
quality o f the expenditure. Ingeneral there was agreement with the areas highlighted for
PRSC I1and 111, and further clarificationwas requested for the more general prior action
on the energy sector. The participants also agreed that structural reforms were needed in
the area of water and that including this reform in the PRSC would help the new
government politically deal with this issue. This was affirmed even after the Executive
clarified that it had not agreed to a condition on water tariffs. Participants also noted that
the area of pensions continues to be a "time bomb" that will need addressing by the new
authorities.

Civil Society: Overall discussions of PRSC trigger actions and PRSP systems of
monitoring and evaluation

The session with civil society in general was divided into two sections, the first being a
general presentation and discussion o f PRSC 2 and 3 prior actions, followed by
presentations and discussions on the monitoring and evaluation systems o f the PRSP
from both government and civil society perspectives.



                                             100

Participants also supported the needto increase attention to quality and the focalization o f
pro poor spending, for example, the representative o f the Network o f NGO's that work
with children spoke o f the need to target poor children.    There were also comments on
the needfor a better classification and disseminationo fwhat pro-poor spending consisted
o f and a questioning o f the use o f highly paid external consultants whose salaries also
have been classified as anti-poverty spending. In general, however, there were few
specific comments on the content o f the majority o f the prior actions proposed for PRSC
2 or 3.

Nevertheless, a comment was made about the need o f the World Bank to learn from past
attempts at policy reforms and explicit reference was made to the privatization o f the
distribution o f electricity and GON attempts at pension reform. In the area o f water,
participants suggested that past lessons around ensuring that strong regulatory
frameworks are inplace should guide attempts at sector reforms

An official from SETEC opened the second half o f the session with a presentation o f the
government's system o f monitoring and evaluation o f the PND 2005-2009 (PRSP 2),
including the systems o f SIGFA, SNIP and SINASID.               (See    Annex 3 for this
presentation). It was evident that many o f the participants in the discussion were not
aware o f the details o f these systems and that observation was made concretely by one
participant who commented that these tools for monitoring and evaluation were generally
inthe hands ofthe government with little citizen participation at the national level.

Participants noted that this is particularly worrying, since budget support such as the
PRSC requires that national systems provide security and information around public
financial management. In this respect, much o f the discussion that followed focused on
the need for better monitoring and evaluation systems. It was also noted that Nicaragua
does not perform well on the international budget transparency index and thus
improvements in the transparency around budget planning and execution need to be
made, including providing better access and user friendly information in SIGFA. The
Executive Director o f CONPES intervened to explain that CONPES would soon have a
portal to access SIGFA and SIGFA officials would be training a number o f civil society
actors in the use o f the system. However, since SIGFA is still an incomplete system and
provides information without much disaggregation or without reference to what
constitutes "poverty" expenditures, it i s likely that some improvements to the system will
need to be made.

Comments were also made on the need to establish better dialogue between civil society
and the government by improving the functioning and level o f discussion in the sector
discussion networks (mesas sectoriales) as well as the need to improve coordination with
civil society efforts to monitor the PND at the municipal level.

           NationalAssembly: Overall discussion of PRSCtrigger actions

Inadditionto seekingthe views ofcongressionalleaders onthe prior actions proposedfor
the PRSC I1and 111, this session was also designed to include a discussion o f key dates
suggested in the process o f the credit, including the final approbation by the National
Assembly and what additional information would be needed by the congressmen to
consider the approval o f the PRSC I1within the time frame presented.

Overall, the members o f the National Assembly expressed support o f the PRSC 11, but
although there is an understanding that the funds from the PRSC (and other sources) go
to general budget support, there i s concernthat the funds support a National Development
Plan which i s perceived by the legislature as not sufficiently discussed with others
branches o f government or society in order to achieve a national consensus. At the same
time, the lack o f adequate information on poverty and extreme poverty, as well as how
effectively are policies to combat poverty measured, was mentioned as one important
restriction in their ability to assess the use o f government resources (and lending to
support the budget) to effectively reduce the levels o f poverty.

In addition to the availability of information, it was mentioned that the quality of
information was very important, Although there has been a significant investment indata
availability through SIGFA, the information i s o f limited availability to members o f the
National Assembly, but more significantly, the data does not provide enough information
interms of quality of spendingor impact onpoverty. Although there is a lot on emphasis
on poverty reduction, there i s the perception, due to insufficient data, that there i s no
significant reduction on poverty rates.

Participants also questioned in some cases a reliance on quantitative indicators of
performance and the need for qualitative indicators o f overall performance and delivery:
case in point a previous indicator on the number o f schools under the Participatory
Education Regime instead o f an indicator which showed qualitative results.

There were also questions with respect to how spending on poverty reduction i s
accounted for, as in the case o f investment in infrastructure. During the dialogue, the
World Bank explained that infrastructure investment does contribute to reduction in
poverty rates, especially in supported activities such as rural electricity, rural
telecommunication inthe poorest municipalities, and support for agricultural technology,
that have been included inthe programmatic PRSC.

Specific suggestions referred to the need for inclusion o f the energy sector as a key policy
variable   as well as issues related to social security pensions. In relation to the Law o f
Registry, which is one o f the triggers o f the PRSC 11,members o f the NationalAssembly
mentioned that it was possible to approve the remaining articles o f the legislation so as to
comply with the triggers.

Participants also emphasized their support for the advances in terms o f coordination and
harmonization between the World Bank and other members o f the donor community. It



                                              102

was suggested that the donor community, and more precisely, the World Bank, should
invite the five presidentialcandidatesand their teams to presentwhat hasbeendone and
what is inthe plans onthe lendingprogram. Inthis way the commitmentsthat the current
government has with the donors can be transmitted to the new incoming team, at the
same time guaranteeinganactiveparticipationoftheNationalAssembly.

        Donor Coordinationand HarmonizationinNicaraguafor the PRSC I1

1.Background Budget SupportinNicaragua.
                 -

Several evaluations done by different donors have revealed some significant obstacles to
executing development projects, due to some flaws intheir conception and development.
This has led some o fthe more active cooperation agencies to reflect onhow to define and
implement the policies in a more coherent way and one that is more in line with the aims
o f developing countries. In addition to this, finding ways to make policy more
complimentary to internal institutional development processes i s considered essential for
sustainable social and economic development.

The key to this new focus is providing support to the aims o f Nicaragua's 2005-2010
National Development Plan (PND), a declaration o f the country's objectives for
economic growth and poverty reduction. In terms o f financing the PND, budget support
i s seen as the most appropriate and most flexible form o f foreign aid that can be given to
the Government o f Nicaragua. This i s due to the fact that budget support i s a direct
contribution to the Government's general budget and uses the Government's own
allocation, procurement and accounting systems, and i s not linked to specific project
activities. The appropriate allocation and use o f resources i s expected to result in better
impact o f the poverty reduction strategy and an improved economy, which should inturn
be reflected inthe evaluation indicators.

Hence, the signature in May 2005 o f a Joint Financing Arrangement (FA) between the
Government o f Nicaragua and the international donor community produced a substantial
improvement in support of policy dialogue in a more coordinated manner. In addition to
the World Bank (IDA), the BSG includes the European Commission, Finland, Germany,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The IMF acts as
an observer.

The BSG has two meetings during the year: an annual meeting in May to assess the
performance o f the previous calendar year and one in September to establish overall
policies as well as new goals and targets. Prior to the two yearly meetings, Technical
Working Group (TWG) meetings are held. There are five thematic working groups:
Macro, Public Finance, Social, Productive and Governance. Follow-up i s done using a
Performance Assessment System (PAM) which specifies the main objectives, actions and
goals agreed between the Government and co-operation agencies.

2. Consultations inthe context of PRSC I1preparation

The World Bank participates regularly in the BSG meetings and is hence consulting
permanently with donor partners on budget support, including coordination o f policy
actions. In addition, the Bank undertook a few focused discussions with the coordinator
of the BSG and the key government counterparts. They explained some o f the views o f
the other partners o f the BSG (the bilateral donors and the European Commission).



                                            105

According to them, the BSG offers a substantial improvement to the donor community
butalso poses a challenge o fcoordinationthat needsto be addressed.

Inrelation to the P A M that serves as the basis for the dialogue with the Government of
Nicaragua, it i s viewed as a complex and extensive document as it incorporate most o f
the prior actions suggested by the World Bank, plus the suggested policy actions and
indicators presented by the individual bilateral donors. As such, the matrix i s not
necessarily a coherent document as it tries to include as much as possible, most o f the set
o f policies that are important for all the groups o f donors.

In addition to its complexity, the P A M shows no priorities among the different
components, and this increases the difficulty inthe policy dialogue with the Government.
This is not the case o f the World Bank's PRSC, as the identifiedprior actions andtriggers
are the key elements for compliance.

Some o f the main points that the coordinator o f the BSG presented, from the perspective
o f the other partners o f the BSGwere:

     0   The P A M is organized ina different way than the PRSC, and this complicates the
        policy dialogue within the BSG and with the Government. The matrix was
        basically established by adding up most o f the actions and objectives o f the World
         Bank and the bilateral donors, but without further effort intrying to obtain a more
         coherent document.

     0   The World Bank and the donors hadjust begunits coordination efforts last year,
        but the coordination was a lot better this year inthe annual meeting inMay.

     0   The other donors hope that a new P A M can be designed before September 2006.
         This new P A M should have a reduced number o f objectives and actions and with
         an emphasis in key aspects o f policies, especially those linked to poverty, macro
         and budget reform.

     0   The other donors hope that the World Bank could participate with a leadership
        role inthe design o f the P A M before September, usingthe new PRSC-2 matrix as
         a starting point. There must be an effort to coincide with the times arranged as a
         group inthe BSG.

     0  The other bilateral donors appreciate the benefits o f the analytical capacity o f the
        World Bank.

     0  Although there i s recognition that the approaches o f the World Bank and other
        donors can be different, this should not discourage the need for improved
        coordination. The World Bank gives more weight to actions (triggers and prior
        actions), while the bilateral donors look more at the objectives (indicators). At the
        same time, bilateral donors tend to be more flexible when the Government does




                                               106

       not comply with all the objectives, but i s advancing in the right direction o f
       policies that the donors are trying to support.

       Dialogue with the Government must be coincident in time, but also in what are
       the most relevant issues, not also because this would avoid duplicity in actions
       and efforts, but mainly because it strengthens the policy dialogue with the
       Government and the opposition, given the political polarization inthe country.

    0  Although there are differences, given the implicit leadership o f the World Bank,
       the PRSC-2 matrix should be a sub set (as much as possible) o f the PAM.

    0  There i s a time inconsistency issue. While the bilateral donors announce its
       commitment according to an established set o f polices and indicators agreed with
       the Government on the PAM, the World Bank's disbursement o f the PRSC i s
       subject to compliance o f the prior actions, and that can be delayed by the
       Government's lack o f effort or problems with the National Assembly.

    0  In trying to reduce the size and scope of the PAM, the bilateral donors suggest
       taking out o f the matrix the specific themes that can be addressed inother lending
       or donor operations.

3. Progress made inthe coordinationbetweenPRSC and BSGand future challenges

There have been some significant advances in the process o f coordinating the PRSC and
BSG processes, although there is still much work to do. Along the progress so far, the
following actions are the most relevant:

       i)     The PRSC review was done at the BSG meeting, and this was pointed out
              as a positivepoint inthe September 2005 BSGmeeting report.
       ii) Most of the PRSC "prior actions" were includedinthe BSG's PAM
              matrixes.
       iii) Thereisnowgreaterwillingnessanddispositionfromallparties(World
              Bank, Government and Co-operation) to work together in a more co-
              ordinated way.
       iv)    There is recognition that the approaches used by the World Bank and other
              donors can be different: however, there are also similar principles
              involved (which are a fundamental part o f the BSG Joint Financial
              Agreement) especially on key issues, which will make it possible to work
              together more easily.
       v>     There has also been recognition o f the World Bank's leadership and
              technical capacity, which will help to improve co-ordination.
       vi)    Although the review was done jointly, and the WB actively participated in
              the BSG meetings, there is one significant difference between the Bank
              and the other co-operation agencies. The other co-operation agencies make
              a global performance evaluation o f the Government and based on that
              evaluation decide whether or not to make a disbursements. Meanwhile, the



                                             107

          Bank's disbursements are tied to "triggers", regardless o f the evaluation
          made o f their global performance. In this respect, World Bank
          disbursements are more predictable and subject to clearer points of
          evaluation, even though these are only focussed on the "triggers".
   vii)   Although the Matrixes have improved in terms o f their consistency, there
          are still two different sets o f them and there are still two different people
          in charge: one for PRSC (Karen Schneegans) and another covering BS
          (Mauricio Chamorro). Nevertheless, there is now better co-ordination
          between the two.

Futurechallenges to improve coordination include:

   i)     The final aim should be that the Government Plan has a matrix for actions
          and follow-up indicators which will act as a sort o f core matrix for follow-
          up and monitoring. The World Bank and partner cooperation agencies
          should coordinate with the Government on this, so that this matrix
          includes the most important and relevant aspects o f the country's
          development. From this core matrix other sub-matrixes could be extracted,
          by sector. In this case, the P A M for budget support would be one sub-
          matrix with the indicators that are most relevant to the objectives o f the
          BSG. The Bank could then choose those actions from the PAM Matrix
          that it considers important enough,to be used as "prior actions." In this
          way the Government would have only one matrix, one office in charge of
          follow-up and monitoring, and several follow-up authorities depending on
          the point o f information inquestion (BSGWorking Groups).
   ii)    Given that a change o f government is drawing near and the new
          government i s likely to have its own development plan, one o f the aims
          that the WB and cooperation agencies should propose i s to work together
          with the new government to create this core matrix. At present, the
          government has several different matrixes (e.g. PND and Millennium
          Goals) that are followed-up on by the Presidential Technical Secretariat
          (SETEC), while P A M and PRSC are followed up by the Ministry o f
          Finance.
   iii) Onestep forwardwouldbetomergethePAMandPRSCmatricesinto
          one (PAM-PRSC) and that even if some actions and indicators are seen in
          the BSG and others in the PRSC, at least there would be only one
          government office and one single Matrix. The Government should only
          have one person in charge o f both elaborating and monitoring progress o f
          this matrix, who can then coordinate with the different ministries, working
          groups and cooperation agencies.
   iv)    There should also be a simple transparentlaccountable              system o f
          evaluation that would make the international cooperation's overall
          evaluations somewhat less subjective.
   v)     So that the World Bank i s seen as being more involved in the global
          evaluations done by cooperation, they should analyse the possibility o f




                                        108

     having part o f the credit (or some future credit) disbursed according to this
     overall evaluation.
vi)  The dialogue process with the Government should coincide intime as well
     as on the most important issues. This would fulfill the double purpose o f
     avoiding the duplication o f efforts and giving more power o f influence to
     cooperation agencies, not just in terms o f dialogue with the government,
    but also with the politicalopposition and the NationalAssembly.

           Annex 8: PublicExpenditureManagementPerformanceinNicaragua


Credibility of the budget. Over the last three years, aggregate expenditure budget execution has usually
exceeded the correlated budgets. The fiscal discipline risks have not materialized because o f domestic
revenues and concessionaVdonor funding that have also exceeded the budget forecasts. It should be
mentioned, however, that their effects have been distributed in a relatively proportional manner among the
budget entities and there are no significant concerns on payment arrears. Looking forward, it is expected
that recent passage o f the Financial Management and Budget Regime Law (Law 550), which establishes
stricter limits on budget modifications, the credibility o f the budget as policy instrument will be increased.

Comprehensiveness and transparency. Budget information is ample, based upon a good classification
system, and with a comprehensive institutional coverage. That is not the case, however, with budget
execution reports, which currently cover only the General Budget o f the Republic (PGR) but not the use o f
revenues from the rest o f the central government. On the other hand, public access to information is limited
by the absence o f certain key information (e.g., audited financial statements and comprehensive data and
statistics on public procurement processes). Similarly, the limitedtransparency o f the fiscal decentralization
system and the inability to monitor aggregate public sector fiscal risk are areas inneed o f improvement.

In the short term, enhancements are foreseen through the preparation o f comprehensive budget execution
reports and government financial statements (required both under Law 550), and the implementation o f the
integrated system o f state procurement and contracting (SICCE). To the extent that decentralized entities
(by function and territory) comply with the information requirements o f Law 550, supervision o f aggregate
fiscal risk will be facilitated. And, implementation o f a fiscal neutrality framework for decentralization is
critical and urgent.

Policy-based budgeting. The annual budget formulation is performed in an orderly and participatory
manner, despite the limited margin (caused by "fixed" costs and earmarked revenues) for flexibility. As
with respect to the mediumterm budget framework, steps taken are very recent and consequently advances
are limited, but relevant. The framework has a clear legal basis and the MFPC developed an adequate
strategy for a sequenced implementationo f the new tool.

Predictabilityand control of budget execution.The system shows a number o f strengths, particularly for
fiscal discipline, in the centralization o f treasury balances through the Treasury Single Account (CUT), as
well as in the controls for contracting and recording public debt. Inother areas, nevertheless, there is room
for improvement.

Compliance with the timely recording o f expenditure commitments i s required (e.g., through interfaces
between the integrated financial management system -SIGFA- and SICCE), and Treasury's direct payment
mechanism needs to become operationally efficient (requiring better coordination between MHCP and the
Central Bank). The development o f the integrated civil service system (SISEC) and the expansion o f the
fiscal payroll system (SNF) should continue, so as to reach a consolidated payroll system, which in turn
should be subject to periodical audits. And the implementation o f the recently issued internal control
technical norms (NTCI) needs to be complemented with information systems that allow continuing
evaluation o f their performance. Finally, internal audits are in need o f more professional development,
systematic approaches based on risk, and more disclosure and better follow-up to their reports.

Accounting, recording and reporting.Information on monthly, quarterly and annual budget execution is
prepared on a timely basis, supported by a good recording system and by a good system o f periodic
reconciliations o f bank accounts managedby the Treasury.

However, the execution reports are not yet complemented with data on bank balances and financial
statements prepared under adequate accounting standards. These are elements needed to substantiate the
integrity o f reports now produced and to increase the information and scrutiny on patrimonial aspects that,
by their nature, are not reflected inbudget execution reports. The development o f mechanisms to produce



                                                       111

the cited financial statements is one o f the main challenges that the MFPC is assuming under the
framework o f its implementation plan for Law 550. On the other hand, it is also necessary to deepen
sectorial efforts, mainly in education and health, to compile more information, and process it properly, on
resources received (or not) destined to service delivery units(education and health centers).

External scrutiny and audit. Positive aspects are the clarity and application o f the legal framework
regulating the capacity o f the legislature to review and approve the annual budget law. Moreover, Law 550
recently normalized the mechanisms for budget modifications during the fiscal year. Conversely, the ex-
post scrutiny o f public expenditure, although guaranteed by law, inpractice is limited because the National
Assembly does not receive all external audit reports, and when it does, the review and discussion are tardy
and their follow-up minimal.

As regards the Controller General Office (CGR), a recent important step has been the preparation of
evaluations o f the annual budget execution report. However, since this activity is not a financial audit per
se, its coverage and effect i s limited when compared with international practice. On the other hand, for
those audit reports that are produced (mostly o f a "special" nature), follow-up to recommendations is
formal, but in general the responses are not sufficiently detailed. A monitoring system being implemented
by the CGR is another important step that shouldhelpto improve this area over coming years.

Donor practices. Critical accords have been made to try to align external funding with the national
budgetary system. Worth mentioning is the Joint Financial Arrangement for Budget Support (FA), which
inter alia includes commitments over provision o f information that will improve predictability o f budget
support. I t is also notable the recent increase in the use o f national systems and in the government access to
information on disbursements made by donors.

Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the cited actions are o f recent implementation and, therefore, their
outcomes are only starting to be evident. It seems that future actions could be focused on the incorporation
o f a larger number o f donors to those efforts, in terms o f timely provision o f funding forecasts and
disbursements, in cash and in kind, and in terms o f larger use o f national procedures for investment
projects. All o f this is consistent with the national action plan for harmonizationand alignment.

           Annex 9: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT I1(PRSC 11)
               ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES


Summary of PRSCActivities

 1. The policy reforms supported under the proposedNicaragua PRSC I1aim to: (a) maintain
macroeconomic stability while protecting poverty spending; (b) promote international trade;
(c) improve land tenure security and promote registration o f indigenous communities' titles;
(d) strengthen public administration by implementing the legislation establishing a civil
service; (e) improve management o f public finances, especially o f foreign financing; and (0
promote regular and financially sustainable maintenance o f roads. In doing so, the reforms
will thus constitute an important step on five fronts.

2. First, the reforms are key to achieving the results envisaged in the Nicaraguan
Government's PRSP I1 and are also expected to help Nicaragua in the pursuit o f the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Second, they aim to ensure that Nicaragua
continues its sound macroeconomic management without jeopardizing public expenditures
aimed at reducing poverty. Third, they support regional integration, land tenure and
infrastructure maintenance to help the country achieve its full economic potential. Fourth,
they will allow Nicaragua to improve its public sector management in core areas like the civil
service and the management o f foreign aid. And, lastly, the policies supported by PRSC I1
aim at supporting environmentally sustainable livelihoods o f indigenous populations in the
North Atlantic Coast o f the country, which are among the most vulnerable segments o f
society.

3, The Bank will use several lending and non-lending instruments to reinforce institutional
capacity to carry out the reform actions indicated in the PRSC policy matrix. The key Bank
Team Leaders o f these investment credits, as part o f the PRSC team and in agreement with
their respective government counterparts, have agreed to use these projects to provide
necessary financing and technical assistance to carry out the agreed actions for the PRSC.

Review of World Bank Supportfor EnvironmentalManagementinNicaragua

4. The World Bank has an active portfolio in Nicaragua, including IDA Credits, GEF
donations, carbon finance operations, and targeted AAA. Paragraphs 5 - 14 highlight
ongoing and planned activities which serve to strengthen environmental management and
social participation across the portfolio o f operations.

SustainableDevelopment Support

5. Many World Bank operations and programs in Nicaragua target the social sector, as
detailed throughout this document. In terms o f strengthening environmental policies and
management at the macro level, the ongoing Second Rural Municipality Development
Project (approved in FYOl) seeks to improve the performance o f rural municipalities by
building their capacity to provide local public infrastructure, protect the environment and
manage natural resources ina sustainable manner, and promote local economic development.
The project's support to Nicaragua's National Environmental Information Agency (SINIA) is
an important part o f promoting environmentally sustainable development inthe country.

6. Under the Second AgricultureTechnology Project(FY06), procedures have beenput in
place to promote sustainable agricultural practices, updated agricultural technologies, sound
pest management, research and training. Subproject screening and careful monitoring and
evaluation help ensure that these measures are applied across project-financed activities.

7. As part o f future Bank support to Nicaragua's environment sector, a Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA) is scheduled in FY08 that will provide specific
recommendations on key environment issues The CEA will assess the regulatory and
institutional framework for environmental protection in Nicaragua. While DR-CAFTA i s
expected to improve enforcement o f environmental norms and regulations due to explicit
commitments inthe treaty to this effect, future Bank operations inNicaragua are expected to
support investments in infrastructure, which may have localized impacts.           The CEA is
expected to introduce instruments which may be used to support the use o f innovative
instruments (e.g., SEA) within growing sectors. Furthermore, the CEA will analyze the
efficiency and effectiveness o f Nicaragua's environmental policy and institutional framework
to address current and future environmental issues with special emphasis on those arising
from trade liberalization and infrastructure investments. It i s expected to identify policy and
institutional gaps and provide politically feasible and cost-effective recommendations as well
as help the Government to address trade-offs related to (i)protecting and restoring key
environmental services essential for long-term sustainability, (ii) expansion o f trade, and (iii)
increasing social and corporate responsibility in the stewardship o f the environment to meet
national, regional, and global commitments.

Strengthening of EnvironmentalAssessment Framework

8. The ongoing Second Rural Municipality Development Project, in the MARENA-
implemented component, provides limited support to the strengthening o f environmental
regulatory capacity, particularly as related to decentralization o f such functions to local
entities. Additional support i s beingprovided to MARENA in this area by financing from the
Danish and Finnishgovernments.




                                             114

Strengtheningof Sector-specific Capacity

9. The Third Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (FYO1) follows detailed
environmental guidelines, including consultation, the preparation o f environmental
assessments and environmental impact assessments, and the implementation o f mitigation
measures. As a result, social analyses and screenings were carried out to understand potential
social impacts o f road rehabilitation, and the environmental unit o f the Ministry o f
Transportation and Infrastructure has been strengthened.

10.The blended IDNGEF Off-Grid Rural Electrification Project (FY03) supports the
sustainable provision o f electricity services, including alternatives to fossil fuels, and seeks to
maximize associated social and economic benefits. The project also includes screening
mechanisms for investments, as well as a focus on providing appropriate services for
indigenous communities.

11. During project preparation o f the Rural Telecom Project (FY06),                        specific
environmental and social guidebooks were prepared which outline procedures and strategies
to be followed when installing communications antennas in rural areas. The project also
drafts specific environmental managementplans for each investment.

SupporttoRegularization of Indigenous Territories

12. The Land AdministrationProject (PRODEP) (FY02) has made important progress in
promoting land regularization, especially in indigenous lands. To date, five o f the six
indigenous territories in Bosawas have been demarcated and titled. Final registration has
been completed in one o f the territories (a prior action for PRSC II),    and is pending for the
others. The Indigenous and Ethnic Communities Land Law (Ley 445) was approved with
support from the now completed Atlantic BiologicalCorridor Project,as was the Cadastre
Law and associated regulations. The Registry Law i s in the National Assembly for approval.
A draft bill for the Regularization Law has been completed. PRODEP has also supported the
preparation o f manuals on the procedures for the land demarcation process and training
materials for capacity building on indigenous and ethnic community lands, as well as
diagnostic studies, conflict resolution and other actions for the demarcation and titling o f the
lands o f indigenous and ethnic communities.

13. While progress in land regularization has been positive, work remains to be done. The
final registration o f the five indigenous territories in Bosawas i s pending because o f complex
legal and procedural constraints. This process requires broad consensus between the
Executive, the Supreme Court, National Demarcation and Titling Comission (CONADETI),
and the final beneficiaries. Such consensus i s advanced in one territory, but less so in the
other four. The sixth territory has not yet been titled; the presence o f many illegal settlers
makes this situation the most complex o f the six. The Bank i s actively facilitating the
political dialogue and consensus among the two major political parties in order to have the
Registry law approved.

14.The GEF-financed Corazdn Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Project (FY06) is
working to ensure the conservation o f the globally-important proposed NicaragudHonduras
Corazon Transboundary Biosphere Reserve through improved management o f the Bosawas
area, respecting the rights o f traditional occupants. Safeguard measures focus on mitigating
potential negative impacts from the implementation o f management plans or livelihood
activities, and in guaranteeing traditional residents effective participation inthe management
o f their area.
