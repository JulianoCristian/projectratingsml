Despite recent steady progress in poverty reduction, at\n            the launch of the program in 2004, some 46 percent of\n            Nicaragua's population lived in poverty, and 15 percent\n            in extreme poverty. A poverty reduction strategy, prepared\n            through a broad participatory process, identified main focus\n            areas for the country's development including better\n            governance, broad-based growth, and improved health and\n            education status of Nicaraguans. The goal of the first\n            poverty reduction support credit (PRSC), one of a series of\n            budget support operations, was to support the implementation\n            of this national strategy. It provided financial support for\n            public institution reforms, better governance,\n            competitiveness, and social improvements. The second PRSC\n            has already been approved. In addition to focusing on\n            poverty reduction, it includes measures in the areas of\n            trade, education, land titling, civil service reform, and\n            road maintenance. This work will be complemented by other\n            specific investments and by analytical work."}, "docdt": "2007-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
