Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to review the targets against key indicators, particularly\n            where indicators are linked to community mobilization\n            efforts, such as obtaining house connections, and\n            rationalize them on regular basis based on ground realities.\n            Else, the overall project performance ratings get\n            undermined, despite the other positive outcomes of the\n            project. The community contracting adopted under the project\n            has worked, resulting is good quality works and goods\n            leading to a sense of ownership and pride with the\n            community, enhancing their confidence in dealing with\n            similar major activities.
