                         implemented remained unsatisfactory and remedial action has been proposed for these. Functioning of the Monitoring and Evaluation system and data capture methodology has
                         been weak and inefficient leading to delays in reporting.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project remain largely on track to meet its Project Development Objectives and has benefited a large section of the rural communities of the intended project areas with safe
                         water and sanitation. It is expected that the numbers of connections would increase with time beyond project closure. The community driven model used in the project has been
                         pioneering work in the rural water sector and would serve as a valuable reference point and as learning for future interventions in rural water supply.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
