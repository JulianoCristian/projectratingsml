Farm Privatization\n            Support Project for Tajikistan are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: land tenure security and\n            farmers' freedom to make their own management decisions\n            are vital for successful farm privatization. In the case of\n            Tajikistan, strong support from the highest levels of\n            government was not enough to restructure and privatize state\n            and collective farms throughout the country. In\n            cotton-growing areas, local governments were more interested\n            in profiting from cotton production than sharing benefits\n            with newly independent farmers. International experience may\n            enrich project design, but only when local conditions are\n            fully taken into account. In the case of Tajikistan, project\n            design was overly ambitious and not tailored enough to the\n            local circumstances, including five years of civil war and\n            the remaining aspects of a command economy. Care must be\n            taken to identify all the factors constraining the\n            achievement of project objectives, and then something needs\n            to be done about each one of them. While some of the\n            barriers to farm restructuring (such as improving access to\n            water and credit), were dealt with at appraisal, the lack of\n            farm machinery was not recognized as in issue, even though\n            it was a high priority for farmers."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
