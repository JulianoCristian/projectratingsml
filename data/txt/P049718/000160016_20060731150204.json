has a modest institutional development\n            impact. The performances of both the Bank and the Borrower\n            are satisfactory. The lessons cited concerned: using a\n            dedicated project management unit; the need for active\n            intervention by Ministers and high level officials to push\n            through changes that were unpopular at the lower echelons of\n            Government; establishing credit facilities even though the\n            legal and regulatory had not yet sufficiently evolved; the\n            demonstration value of the land registration component; and\n            difficulties in adapting former soviet administrative\n            structures to serve private clients at the grass Roots. In\n            regard to the latter, the weakest aspect of the project has\n            been the inability to institutionalize more effectively the\n            delivery of farm information services. That is mostly due to\n            the fact that the current structure of the agricultural\n            ministry is on the one hand under-funded to effectively\n            fulfill its mandate and, not suited for the delivery of farm\n            information to the grassroots. The Government needs to\n            revisit its agricultural policy and the institutional\n            instruments through which it will develop the sector. Its\n            institutions should be reorganized to better be able to\n            serve the emerging private sector, and shift from a command\n            and control structure focusing on production targets to a\n            regulatory and policy body which lays the proper incentives\n            to foster the development of the agricultural sector. Such a\n            structure would concentrate more efforts on its ability to\n            deliver information and guidance to the producer at the\n            grassroots and involve consultation with the private sector\n            in forming policies and guidelines."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
