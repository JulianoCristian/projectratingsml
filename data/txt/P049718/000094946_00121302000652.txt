1.       The proposed Supplemental Credit is the second step in the process of
responding to the drought emergency; it is to reimburse the FPSP for funds
re-allocated to the emergency response.    The funds to be restored to the
FPSP are a subset of those originally designated for the repair or
replacement of critical irrigation and drainage facilities to create and
sustain privatized agriculture, activities with a strong economic
justification. Without these funds, the economic viability of the FPSP will
be significantly impaired and it is unlikely that it will achieve its
objectives. Tajikistan is itself resource-short at the present time, and
cannot supply the missing resources, nor would it be able to obtain
additional funds from other lenders on reasonable terms or in reasonable
time. The additional time required to process a further freestanding Bank
loan would be a significant setback to the FPSP, because procurement
processes must be launched soon for the irrigation and drainage activities
the supplemental credit would finance if the FPSP is to meet its timetable.
Moreover, the irrigation and drainage works are linked through project design
to all other project activities. The supplemental credit would therefore
provide vital support to meeting project objectives.     The Government of
Tajikistan is committed to the FPSP, and the performance of the implementing
agencies in carrying it out is satisfactory.
