I IEGWB Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectiveness throughexcellence and independenceinevaluation.                   I
 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programs and activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
 first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank`sself-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bank`swork is producingthe
 expected results,and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of this work, IEGWBannuallyassesses about 25 percentof
 the Bank`slendingoperationsthroughfield work. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
 thatare innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations;thosefor
 which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management haverequestedassessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate
 important lessons.
        To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine project files and other
 documents, interview operationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operation with the government,
 and other in-countrystakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff bothat headquartersand
 in localoffices as appropriate.
        Each PPAR is subject to internalIEGWB peer review, Panel review,and managementapproval. Once cleared
 internally, the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
 relevant.The completedPPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'commentsare attached to
 the document that is sent to the Bank`s Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to
 the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


 About the IEGWB RatingSystem
        IEGWB's use of multipleevaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibilityto adapt to
 lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
 arrive at their project ratings.Followingis the definitionand rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
 (additional informationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
        Outcome: The extent to which the operation'smajor relevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expected to
 be achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance,efficacy, and efficiency.Relevanceincludes
 relevanceof objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
 objectives are consistentwith the country's currentdevelopment prioritiesand with current Bank country and
 sectoral assistancestrategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country
 AssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
 the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project'sobjectives
 were achieved,or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
 extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
 and benefitsat least cost compared to alternatives.The efficiencydimension generally is not appliedto adjustment
 operations. Possibleratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
        Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
 expectedoutcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: High
 Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
        Bank Performance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
 operation and supported effective implementationthroughappropriatesupervision (including ensuringadequate
 transitionarrangementsfor regular operation of supported activities after loanlcreditclosing, toward the
 achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
 Possibleratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
        BorrowerPerformance: The extentto which the borrower(includingthe governmentand implementing
 agencyor agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and
 agreements,toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
 performanceand implementingagency(ies)performance.Possible ratings for BorrowerPerformance: Highly
 Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.

This is a Project Performance Assessment Review (PPAR) o fthe FarmPrivatization Support
Project (FPSP) inTajihstan, for which Credit 32400-TAJ inthe amount o fUS$20 millionwas
approved inJune 1999 and made effective inFebruary 2000. A Supplemental Credit 32401-TAJ
inthe amount ofUS$3 millionwas approvedbythe BoardinFebruary 2000. The original closing
date o f June 30,2004 was extended to November 30,2005 to allow for the implementation o f
sub-projects. At project conclusion, US$25 million inIDA fundinghad been disbursed.
Approximately US$30,000 was cancelled from Credit 32400 and US$220,000 from supplemental
Credit 32401. Total project expenditures amounted to almost US$29 million after including the
government's contribution.

The PPAR was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). It i s based on the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), the Memorandum o f the President (MOP), sector and economic
reports, special studies, Country Assistance Strategies (CASs), Policy Framework Papers, credit
documents, review o f the project files, and discussions with Bank staff. An Implementation
Completion Report (ICR, Report No. 36487, dated June 29,2006) was prepared by the Europe
and CentralAsia Region. An IEGmission visitedTajihstan inNovember and December 2007
and discussed the effectiveness o f the Bank's assistance with government officials, other
development organizations, beneficiaries, and stakeholders (see Annex C). Their hnd
cooperation and invaluable assistance inthe preparation o f this report are gratefully
acknowledged. Special thanks go to Svetlana Balkhova, Sodiq Abduvalievich Haitov,

Summary

Underthe Soviet Union, Tajikistan's collective and state farms receivedtheir farming
inputs from Moscow and delivered cotton inreturn. After independence in 1991,the flow
o f inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, farm machinery, and spare parts, as well as wheat and
energy stopped. A five-year civil war ensued between 1992 and 1997, duringwhich time
irrigation systems became dilapidated, andmany specialists knowledgeable about
operating irrigation pumps left the country. By the time o fthe 1997 peace agreement, the
agricultural sector was inpoor condition, with irrigation systems indisrepair. Duringthe
appraisal process the project evolved away from one that would finance the rehabilitation
o f irrigation systems, toward a focus on restructuring the large state and collective farms
inwhich they operated. Farmswould only beprofitablewhen farmers madethe key
investment and farming decisions, and increasing farm profitability was expected to
allow the systems' users to finance infrastructure maintenance.

The Farm Privatization Support Project (FPSP) was approved inJune 1999 with the
objectives to (i) develop procedures and institutional mechanisms at the state level and
selected regions to ensure fair, secure and equitable transfer o f land and other farm assets
to private individuals or groups; (ii)   test and implementthese procedures inten selected
former state and collective farms inorder to provide representative models which could
serve as a basis for wider geographical replicability; and (iii)create sustainable private
family farmingunits andprovide them with the enabling conditions to operate
independentlyina market economy. In2001, a Supplemental Credit inthe amount o f
US$3.0 millionwas approvedwith the objective to (iv) mitigate the effects o f a severe
2000 drought byproviding emergency agricultural inputs to the families affectedbythe
drought.

Overall this PPARrates project outcome as moderately satisfactory. The project was
relevant to what the 2005 CAS described as the Government's priorities inthe
agricultural sector. With respect to the drought intervention, distributinggenetically
improved seed for wheat, fertilizer, andother chemical inputshas ledto an impressive
increase inwheat production over the last seven years. The project effectively
restructured ten pilot farms into 5,782 individual and family farms. The procedures used
inthis farmrestructuringexperience arebeingreplicatedina follow-on project, which
involves 300 additional farms.

However, project design was overly ambitious andnot tailored enough to the
circumstances o f a country that was just emerging from five years of civil war. Inthe
cotton-growing areas o f Tajikistan, quotas for cotton andwheat production are enforced.
Local governments have the authority to take land away from farmers who do not achieve
their cottonproductionquotas, eveniffarmers couldmakemore moneywith other crops.
Unfortunately, about 80 percent o f the project's efforts took place incotton quota areas.
While the project offered farmers a package o f support to serve as an incentive for
restructuring, the PPAR concludes that the package provided necessary but not sufficient
enabling conditions. The package included rehabilitation o f irrigation infrastructure, the
establishment o fwater users associations for their maintenance, a one-time grant for farm
inputs,and accessto credit, andtraining. While insome farms restructuring resultedin

                                               X



increased farmprofitability, inothers, restructuring met with significant local resistance.
Local governments have constrained the farmers' right to choose their own crops and
credit institutions have preferred other borrowers over farmers. Many farms havebeen
unable to avail themselves o f even rental tractors and other agricultural machinery. Some
associations established to maintain irrigation systems lack operating funds to keep the
rehabilitated structures operating and farmers' groups have beenorganized ina way that
creates disincentives to working together.

Riskto development outcomeis ratedas substantial. Tajikistan is still confronting
fundamental legal, cultural, and socialbarriers to farm restructuring. Bank performance is
rated moderately satisfactory because o f an overly ambitious project design andinspite
o fhighlydedicated supervision. Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory because o f
the strong support from the highest levels of government and a dedicated and creative
Project ImplementationUnitteam.

Among the lessons suggestedby the project experience are the following:

    Landtenure security and farmers' freedom to make their ownmanagement decisions
    are vital for successful farm privatization. Inthe case o f Tajikistan, strong support
    from the highest levels o f government was not enough to restructure and privatize
    state and collective farms throughout the country. Incotton-growing areas, local
    governments were more interested inprofiting fkom cotton productionthan sharing
    benefits with newly independentfarmers.
    International experience may enrichproject design, but only when local conditions
    are fully taken into account. Inthe case o f Tajikistan, project designwas overly
    ambitious andnot tailored enough to the local circumstances, including five years o f
    civil war andthe remaining aspects o f a command economy.
    Care must be taken to identify all the factors constraining the achievement o fproject
    objectives, and then somethingneeds to be done about each one o f them. While some
    o f the barriers to farm restructuring (such as improvingaccess to water and credit),
    were dealt with at appraisal, the lack o f farm machinery was not recognized as in
    issue, even though it was a highpriority for farmers.
    Donor coordination can assist with the propagation o f major reforms. InTajikistan, it
    took the Bank until2003 to realize that ifdonors would speak with one voice to the
    government on land reform, it might create conditions more favorable for the project-
    restructured farms.

1. Backgroundand Context

1.1       Followingthe collapse o fthe Soviet Union, Tajikistan beganrestructuring its
large collective and state farms into smaller units. Previously, under the Soviet Union,
collective and state farms receivedtheir farming inputs from Moscow and delivered
cotton inreturn. However, after Tajikistan's independence in 1991, the flow o f inputs,
such as seeds, fertilizers, farm machinery, and spare parts, as well as wheat and energy
stopped. A five-year civil war ensued between 1992 and 1997 duringwhich time,
irrigation systems became dilapidated, critical equipment was stolen, and many
specialists knowledgeable about operating irrigation pumps left the country. At the end o f
the conflict in 1997, when Tajikistan reached apeace agreement, the agricultural sector
was inpoor condition, with irrigation systems indisrepair, anddrainage systems
dysfunctional.

1.2       Evenworse, severe flooding duringthe spring in 1998 and 1999further destroyed
infrastructure. The floods were followed by a drought in2000 and 2001 when people
were forcedto consume seeds vital for the nextplanting season. As a result, farmers were
discouraged and agricultural productivity declined (see Figure 1).

1.3       Tajikistan i s a mountainous country, with only 7 percent o f arable landon which
the majority o f Tajikistan's 7 million people reside. Agriculture accounts for 21.5 percent
o f GDP and employs 67 percent o f the country's labor force, andthe cotton sector is the
largest employer. Poverty is concentrated inrural areas, especially incotton-growing
areas. With declining cotton production andhighunemployment, between 500,000 and
1,500,000 Tajiks' left the country to work as unskilledlaborers inRussia or other
Commonwealth o f Independent States (CIS) countries. These workers have been sending

home significant remittances, which in2007 accounted for 36.2 percent o f GDP.2Since
the majority ofthose who go abroad are men, women havehadto bearmost ofthe burden
o f childcare and agricultural labor.

1.4      The achievement o fpolitical and macroeconomic stability, post-conflict recovery
o f the manufacturing and service sectors, substantial growth inremittances by labor
migrants, and favorable world prices for the country's main exports (cotton and
aluminum)were amongthe factors contributingto strongeconomic gr~wth.~                      According
to the 2006 PSIA, "over the last five years the GDP growth rate has averaged about 8
percent, while poverty rates, measured at US$2.15 per day (at purchasingpower parity),
have fallen-fi-om     81 percent in 1999 to 64 percent in2003." However, this growth has
not yet reached rural areas, and the cotton sector inparticular remains inbad shape with
low yields and an ever-increasing debt spiral.

ROLEOFTHE BANK
1.5      Tajikistanbecame a member o fIBRDandIDAinJune 1993. Before signingthe
Credit for the FarmPrivatization Support Project (FPSP), IDAwas involved in five
operations. These operations were markedby extremely difficult circumstances, due to
the civil war duringwhich time anestimated 50,000 peoplewere killed and600,000 were
displaced. The FPSP was conceptualized in 1998 one year after the end o f the civil war.
The Bank's involvementinthe project providedassistance for investments aimed at
rehabilitating imgation and drainage infrastructure and supporting the restructuring of
state and collective farms inpilot areas (see Box 1).

Box 1. Terminology: Farm RestructuringVersus Farm Privatization
The project is calledFarm Privatization Support Project. Underthe project, farms were to be privatized,
but land was not. InTajllustan land is owned by the government, which leasesit to farmers for cultivation.
Inorder to avoid confusion, this PPARuses the term farmrestructuring instead offarmprivatization to
more precisely describe the achevements and shortcomings o fthis project with respect to land reform.

1.6      The project reflectedthe priorities established by the borrower andthe Bank in
the 1998 CAS. The CAS described the recovery o f the agricultural sector's growth as a
critical priority. At the time, neighboring countries (Azerbaijan and Kirgizstan) that
transformed the rural sector from a supply-driven and inflexible state-based sector to a
private sector business had significantly increased productivity. Transforming the
massive and formerly state-managed farms into privately-managed family farms was the
strategy on which the project was based. This was to be done on a pilot basis with the aim
o f subsequentlyscaling up the program ifit was successful. The project is still relevant to
the Government's priorities inthe agricultural sector described inthe 2005 CAS. These

priorities include continuing the farm landprivatizationprogram, improving competition

1.7     A US$20 million Credit was approved bythe BoardinJune 1999, andbecame
effective on February 29,2000. A Supplemental US$3 million Credit was also approved
bythe Board onFebruary22,2001. Furthermore, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
advance o fUS$600,000 and a Japanese PHRD grant o fUS$400,000 have beenused for
start-upproject activities andthe procurement o fessential initialequipment, office
supplies, operating services, and training andtechnical assistance. Uponproject
completion, the combined IDA Credits were nearly fully disbursed (99 percent). The
actual project costs o f each component were close to appraisal estimates except for the
project management component costs, which were nearlytwice the appraisal estimate.
This was primarilydue to greater than expected demands on the PIUto deliver technical
assistanceinprocurement and financial management to government agencies.



2.      Objectives and Design

PROJECTOBJECTIVES
2.1     As stated inthe Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the mainproject objectives
were to (i) develop proceduresand institutionalmechanisms at the state level and in
selected regions to ensure fair, secure and equitable transfer o f land and other farm assets
to private individuals or groups; (ii)test and implement these procedures inten selected
former state and collective farms inorder to provide representative models which could
serve as a basis for wider geographical replicability; and (iii)create sustainable private
family farmingunits andprovide themwith the enabling conditions to operate
independentlyina market economy.

2.2     A Supplemental Credit inthe amount o fUS$3.0 millionwas approved bythe
board on February 22,2001. This Supplemental Credit supported the prior three
objectives and added a fourth one, whichwas to (iv) mitigate the effects o f the severe
2000 droughtbyproviding emergency agricultural inputs to the families affected by the
drought.

PROJECTCOMPONENTS
2.3     The project consisted o fthe following five components:

    1) FarmRestructuring Services:
        To establish and commence implementationof land use registration services
        comprising: aerial surveying andmapping; participatory land allocation of
        individual plots to farm families (from the former collective or state farms); land
        registration to record ownership o fthe plots; "trainingo ftrainers" and subsequent
        training andprovision o ftechnical assistance to farmers innew agricultural
        technologies; and (ii) establishment o f rural information and advisory services
        through: strengtheningo f the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) staff, inparticular

                                                 4


        o f six project implementationunits inthe project's six pilot regions; training in
        information disseminationtechniques; field level demonstrations incrop varieties
        and agricultural technology; and, establishment o f farmers' information desks at
        M O A andthe National Training Center.

        Rehabilitation o f Critical Main andField Level Irrigation andDrainage Works:
        To rehabilitatecritical main and field level irrigation and drainage works inthe
        ten project field sites including the establishment o f financially sustainable water
        users associations to manage the rehabilitated irrigation facilities.

        Provisiono f One-time Grant and Creation o fRural Savings and Credit
        Association:
        First,to allocate one-time grants to farm families o fup to US$300 per hectare
        (andwith anupperlimit o fUS$600 per family) to enable themto purchase a
        minimal amount o fthe most critical farm inputs; and second, create farmer-owned
        rural savings and credit associations including provision o f start-up capital and a
        credit line.

        Project Management and LmplementationUnits:
        To manageproject implementationoverall and especially inthe six project
        regions.

         Supplemental Credit:
        The Supplemental Credit was to provide seed and fertilizer packages to some
         56,000 farming families affectedby the 2000 drought, with distribution handled
        bycontracted NGOs.

PROJECTDESIGN
2.4     At the design stage o fthe project, Tajikistan's agricultural infrastructure was in
generally poor condition. Irrigation systems were dilapidated, metal (galvanized steel)
irrigation gutters and other critical equipment hadbeen stolen duringthe civil war and
on-farm and off-farm irrigation canals hadbeen destroyed by flooding or filled by silt due
to a lack o fmaintenance. Inmost o fthe project farms irrigation had deteriorated to the
extent that deliveredwater hadbeenreduced by about 40 percent. Although the
Government o fTajikistan (GOT)requested a project that would finance the rehabilitation
o fthe irrigation system, the Bank suggested that the project should also restructure the
large state and collective farms. Inthe Bank's view, increasing farm profitability would
generate sufficient revenue to allow the system users to sustainably finance the
maintenance o f the reconstructed irrigation systems. Moreover, farms would only be
profitable when farmers made the key investment and farming decisions. Discussions
with project staff indicated that the GOTreluctantly agreedto farmprivatization in
addition to rehabilitatingthe irrigation system, but its enthusiasm for the proposed
approach varied by governmental level.

2.5     Although local governments and potential beneficiarieswere extensively
surveyed during a period o f about two years, muchofthe farm privatization approach
designedinto the project built on earlier work inneighboring countries. Ten state and
collective farms insix districts would bebroken up.Despite the attitude surveyingthat
hadbeendone, several governmental officials (interviewed for the preparationo f this
report inNovember 2007) made the point that farmers were largely taken by surprise by
the proposed restructuring efforts. It should beborne inmindthat there was a very
precarious security situation after the civil war that restrictedthe free movement o f
project staff.

2.6     Since farmers were usedto having decisions made for themwithin the state and
collective farms for more than 60 years, they were not natural entrepreneurs. Farmers
participatinginthe restructuring were to be supported by a wide range o f activities,
including land registration, landsurveying, public awareness, training, irrigation system
rehabilitation, the formation o f Water User Associations (WAS),installation o fwater
measurement devices, creation o f credit institutions, provision o f grants, and distribution
o f seeds and fertilizers. The assumption was that iffarm restructuring andprivatization
could be shown to work with ten farms, thenthe project wouldbereplicated inthe more
than 600 remainingstate and collective farms. Such thinkingwas based on previous
World Bank experience with farmrestructuring inother countries, where some pilot
efforts had ledto farm privatization inthe whole country (see Box 2 on Azerbaijan).

Box 2. Farm Privatization in Azerbaijan
InAzerbaijan, the WorldBankfinancedtwo operations onfarmprivatization. The first was the 1997
Azerbaijan FarmPrivatization Project (FPP), and the second was the 1999Azerbaijan Agricultural
Development and Credit Project (ADCP). Based on the early experience o fthe FPP, which over a period o f
just 18months restructured six pilot stateandcollective farms into 6,645 family farms, the government
decided in 1997 to launch a rapidnation-wide roll-out of the landprivatization program, using the FPP
model. By 2001, two years before FPP completion, some 1,980 o fAzerbaijan's 2,020 state and collective
farms hadbeenprivatized, representing 95 percent o f agricultural land. As a result, Azerbaijan privatized
its collective farms into one millionprivate family farms.

2.7       InTajikistan farmland was government-owned. Since the enactment ofthe Land
Code in 19964,landuse rights inTajikistan were made transferable so that farmers could
use landfor 99 years, pass it on to the next generation and sub-lease it. Ingeneral, land
use rights may encourage productive farming just as well as ownership rights. There are
numerous western countries with advanced agricultural production systems and strong
incentives to investwhere farmers only have landuse rights - as opposed to land
ownership rights (e.g. NewZealand and Australia).

2.8      What seems to be important is not the type o f land-use right, but the security o f
ownership o fwhatever land rights have been acquired. The project was designed as
though the LandCode was broadly enforced. But that proved not to bethe case - tenure
security i s still very much an issue inTajikistan. As o f March2008, landuse rights can
bewithdrawn bythe local government incase o f"irrational" use o fland.Ifthis provision
was only exercised inthe face o f environmental irresponsibility, it would be a sensible
provision. Unfortunately project experience and the local farmers consultedindicated that
capricious tenure revocationis more the norm. And the failure to adequately address this
problem duringdesignhad implications for the pilot effort.

INSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK
2.9      A number o fcentralministries and their local departments as well as a local bank
and NGOs have beeninvolved inthe implementation o f the FPSP. These organizations
include the following: the State LandCommittee, the Savings Bank o f Tajikistan, the
MinistryofWater Resources, the MinistryofAgriculture, district administrations andthe
district-level department o f agriculture. The Government established a Prime Ministerial
level steering committee to manage the farm restructuring program and also a national-
level Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the implementation o fthe more routine
activities, with satellite units at the district level.

3.      Implementation

IMPLEMENTATION      EXPERIENCE
3.1     The FarmPrivatization Support Project financed a centralPIUinTajikistan's
capital, Dushanbewith satellites inthe six districts that hadbeen selected for farm
restructuring. Inthe beginningo f the project, the PIUwas unfamiliarwith Bank
requirements. Establishingthe PIUas an independent agency proved helpful inshielding
it from undueinfluence. Inaddition, a consultant familiar with Bank procedures was
hired for the duration o fthe project to provide procurement and contracting assistance.
While this increased project management expenditures, it helped overcome problems
experienced by earlier projects andmade sure that the credit proceeds were acceptably
used.

3.2     At the beginningo fthe project, private contractors didnot exist andinfrastructure
rehabilitationwas undertakenby line ministries. With assistance from the PIU, the
project encouraged private enterprises to undertake infrastructure rehabilitation. A total
o f 11such firms were established, which bidon andwere awarded 18 contracts to restore
the irrigation system, install irrigation pumps, and excavate drainage channels. These
newly established firms were closely supervised by PIUstaff, whichmonitored works on
a regular basis.

3.3     Byall accounts, PIUstaff were highlydedicated to the project, anddifficulties in
project implementation were expeditiouslyresolved. Over the years, the PIUtook on
responsibility for administering additional Bank Credits, such as the Rural Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project, the Community Agriculture andWatershedManagement Project,
and the Avian Influenza Control, andHumanPandemic Preparedness and Response
Project.

3.4     The project's original closing date was extendedfor 17 months to allow for
completion o f sub-projects. Project extension was necessary because in2000 project staff
were busyameliorating the effects o fdrought by implementing the supplemental drought
reliefcomponent.

INITIAL  PPARFINDINGS
3.5     To exercise its accountability fbnction, the PPAR attempted to confirm the
findings o f self-evaluation. The ICR concluded that the project established a model for
privatizing state and collective farms that i s transparent, equitable and generally
acceptable to the population, andtechnically easy to implement by the government. The
PPAR does not hlly concur (see Box 3). The ICRmaintains that the project fully
achieved its objective o f establishing a privatizationmodel. This i s indeedthe case, at
least inthe sensethat there is a follow-on project that has adopted the same approach.
The ICRwas frank inadmitting that inthe cotton areas o fTajikistan, very little "real"
privatization has takenplace. Unfortunately, about 80 percent ofthe project's efforts took
place inthose areas.

Box 3. Barriersto Farmers' Freedom to Crop Constrain them from Achieving the Benefits
of Privatization
     The Law o nDehqan Farms5, signed by the President o n M a y 10,2002, guarantees farmers the freedom
     to grow the crops o f their choice. According to this law, government structures are not allowed to
     interfere with farmers' decisions o n what to produce. Inpractice, however, farmers incotton-growing
     areas still need to hlfillquotas and follow a central plan, which defines when to sow cotton, when to
     water, and when to harvest it.

     Market failures and distortions prevent farmers from reaping the benefits o f cotton. These include high
     taxes charged by local governments, andpowerful investors, who provide inputs, such as seeds and
     fertilizer on credit but at a highprice during the planting season; and commercialize cotton, requiring
     repayment inkindwhile buying at a l o w price at harvest time.

     Irrigationwater is provided according to the water requirements o f cotton, which makes it difficult to
     switch to other crops.

     Tajik cotton farms carry a highburden o f debt, which has beenpassed on to individual and family
     farms. This debt burden makes farmers dependent on investors. (Despite recently held discussions
     among the GOT,the IMF, the World Bank, and the ADB among others, to address the cotton debt issue
     inTajikistan, so far there is no resolution o fthe matter.)

3.6       The ICR extensively covers the technical aspects and especially the challenges o f
the landregistry, andthe credit institutions. These will be discussed hrther below. In
addition, the ICR classed the provision o f farm information services as the weakest aspect
o f the project. The PPAR concurs with thisjudgment, and generally found that farmers
made little use ofthe teachings andmaterials produced. This happened both because not
enough stakeholder consultation took place inthe designofthe technical component, and
also because the training was given at a level o f complexity andina vocabulary
inaccessible to agricultural laborers.

3.7        This PPAR finds that usinga lottery to divide up the tenpilot farms was
perceivedby all concerned to be an equitable and fair way to do this. Farm restructuring
was happeningoutside o f the project as well. Farmers living onhillsides where large
machinery never played a significant role, and especially those farms close to Dushanbe
have managed to independently operate their farms, make their own cropping decisions,
andmarkettheir products inuncontrolledmarkets that sell directly to consumers.

3.8       Inthe cotton-growing areas ofTajikistan, however, project achievements follow
the letter rather thanthe spirit o f the project objectives. Quotas for cotton andwheat are
enforced. Local governments can (and reportedly do) take landaway from farmers who
do not achieve their cottonproduction quotas, even ifthey have to lose money by doing
so.

3.9       With respect to the drought intervention, distributinggenetically improved seed
for wheat, fertilizer, and other chemical inputshas ledto an impressive increase inwheat
production over the last seven years.

MONITORING EVALUATION
                AND
3.10    Monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial for the reasons explainedbelow.

3.11 M&Edesim: A detailed performance measurement framework (log-frame
matrix) was developed inthe PAD, with clearly specified overall goals from the CAS, in
addition to project objectives, andcomponents. Overall goals andobjectives were
reflected infive key performance and five outcome / impact indicators. Output indicators
were too sparse to capture all elements o fthe highly complex project design, but they did
somewhat reflect components. Outcome indicators were to be measuredby land
registration records andperiodic surveys, while output indicators were to be measured by
progress reports and IDA supervisionmissions. No guidelines were provided with regard
to sampling methods for surveys, nor was a timeframe established for a baseline survey.
Despite these limitations, overall, the monitoring framework was appropriate interms o f
demonstrating attribution along the logical results chain as the implementation and
utilization o fthe results framework will demonstrate.

3.12    M&Eimplementation: Duringproject implementation, Project Status Reports
(PSRs) tracked outcome and output indicators. Indicators were adjusted during
implementationinorder to better track results. For example, five initial outcome
indicators were increased to ten inorder to also keep track o f the number o f WUAs
created, O&M andcost recovery results, as well as information utilization from extension
services. Output indicators were less detailed inPSRs, but didreflect components.

3.13    Inaddition, abaseline survey was carried out in2001, about one year after project
effectiveness (inFebruary 2000). A major deficiency o f the baseline study was that it was
undertaken after project implementationhad already begun, and some o f the base
variables identifiedhadalready been affectedbyproject activities. For this 2001 pilot
survey, as well as for the 2003 update, all ten pilot farms were selected, representing
universal coverage o fpilot areas. A final survey was conducted in2005. This survey
selected a sample o f 200 restructured farms, chosen from all ten pilot project areas. In
addition, a control group was selected representing restructured farms from non-project
areas. This control group was drawn from the areas adjacent to project pilot areas. A
control group o f 50 farmers was selected. Survey questions covered output and outcome
indicators developed inthe PAD. Inaddition to this overall survey, separate surveys were
conducted for each sub-component, which effectively facilitated learningfrom the pilot
projects.

3.14    M&E utilization: Results from the final survey in2005 inaddition to specific
surveys by sub-component provided detailed outcome and output measurements. These
output and outcome indicators were tracked ina log frame matrix providingevidence for
achievement o f objectives and components. As noted above, output indicators were not
very detailed. A 2004 ProgressReportprovides evidence that changes inthe irrigation
component were tracked indetail, providing tables with costs, changes inquantity,
monitoring results, as well as pictures o frehabilitated or newlybuilt structures. This
facilitated quality control duringthe construction phase. According to that report as well
as to PIUmembers interviewed, inseveral cases construction companies had to tear down
already finished works because they didnot meet design specifications. The PAD results
framework called for tracking court cases andlegal resolutions relatedto land disputes as

                                                    10


well as keepinga history o f landtrading andthe evolution o f landuse rights. This never
happened, although such sector-wide information would have beenhelpfblto clarify the
extent o ftenure insecurity andthe rather slow development o f landrental. Inaddition, the
M&Eresults laidthe foundation for the LandRegistrationand Cadastre System for
Sustainable Agriculture Project, which was developedinthe follow-on project.

SAFEGUARDS, FIDUCIARY           COMPLIANCE, AND UNINTENDEDOUTCOMES
3.15     The project was classified as environmental category "B" for the purposes o f OD
4.01. According to the PAD, the environmental impact o fthe proposedproject was
expected to be small but positive. Positive activities were expected to help improve water
use efficiency, reduce salinization and water logging, and arrest the process o f land
degradation. The project was expected to foster more prudent use o fprivatized
agricultural land. This i s essentially what happened. The PAD also identified overgrazing
and degradation o fpasture lands as an environmental issue, as was the possibility o f
excessive use o f ago-chemicals.

3.16     Duringimplementation, the FPSPimproved atotal o f 10,758 hectares ofirrigated
lands andreclaimed 1,375 hectares o f formerly saline andwater logged lands, which not
only increased landproductivity,but also hadenvironmental benefits.6Negative effects
from ago-chemicals were not encountered, because farmers could not afford the
recommended amounts o f fertilizer. No data were available on overgrazing, but it
remains a severe problem inTajikistan, especially innon-irrigated areas.

3.17     After a weak start, fiduciary compliance is reportedto have been satisfactory.



4.        Outputs and Outcomesby Objective

4.1      Obiective 1: To developprocedures and institutional mechanisms at the state
level and selected regions to ensurefair, secure and equitable transfer of land and other
farm assets toprivate individuals or groups; (modest).

4.2      As noted above, the project developed a mechanism, bywhich landwas
transferred ina fair and equitable manner. The process occurredintwo steps. First, state
and collective farms were dividedinto brigades (sub-units o f state and collective farms)
usingalready-existing administrative structures. Ifa collective farmhadpreviouslybeen
made up o f 1,000 families, then these families were divided insub-groups o f about 100
families. These family farms formed ajoint stock company. The process o f formingjoint
stock companies was already ongoing inTajikistan at the time o fproject identification,
and the project took advantage o f this home-grown approach to landtran~ference.~



'Republicoo f Tajikistan: FarmPrivatization Support Project. Dushanbe 2005.
 Groupings fthis size inTajikistan have a long tradition. Evenbefore the Soviet Union these
administrative units existed. They are based on kinshiptribal groups. The development o f dehkun or family
farms is indeeda new structure for Tajikistan (see Sehring, 2006).

                                                11


Second, a lottery was organized duringwhich each of the 100 families inajoint stock
company received their individual parcel o f land. Inthis second step, farmers were able
to either register their own land or unite with the extended family, with each member
being listed on a certificate that the family farm was to receive. Women were listed on
the certificates as well as men. Bothtypes o f farms are called dehkan farms ("dehkan"
meaning "farmer"). The IEGPPAR mission visited the State Land Committee andwere
shown the certificates that farmers received (Figure 2).

4.3      At $120perhectare, the cost o fcertificates was high.Underthe Bank-funded
follow-on project', costs have been reduced to US$7 per certificate o f farm restructuring.
Eachmember of a former collective farm - farm managers as well as farm workers,
teachers, artists and doctors -received a parcel o f land. This complied with stakeholder
ideas o f fairness. Highcosts o f certificates were offset for every family through the
provision o f family grants that had to be usedto buy farming inputs4learlyan equitable
way o fhandling the problem. These grants compensated farmers for initial highcosts
spent to obtain the certificate and provided them with enough money to start their farm
business. The lottery was perceiveda fair process o f landdistribution, which differed
from some other parts o f the country where the project didnot operate, where landwas
allowed to pass into the hands o fpeople who were well connected, understood the
bureaucratic process, and who had the funds to pay for the certificate.

4.4      As already noted, the lack o flandtenure security remainedaproblem duringthe
life o fthe project. Local governments inTajikistan have a strong vested interest incotton
which significantly diminishes their support for land reform. Eventhough farms earn
very little from cotton (due inpart to price-fixing bymiddlemen), it i s one o f the premier

foreign exchange earners, andtaxes are raisedinsuch a way that local governments profit
from cottonrevenue. Inaddition, investors incotton processingandcommercialization
have historic ties to the government echelon. By all accounts, there are regions where
farmers are told that ifthey do not produce what the local government tells them to, their
landwill beconfiscated-and       the mission heard repeatedly about instances where
farmers lost their landfor no good reason. As long as farmers canbe coerced into
producing unprofitable crops it i s unrealistic inthe extreme to expect them to invest in
increasing production.

4.5     Obiective 2: To test and implement theseprocedures in ten selectedformer state
and collectivefarms in order toprovide representative models which could serve as a
basisfor wider geographical replicability; (substantial)

4.6     Ten state and collective farms, whose farm managers had agreed to restructure
their farms under the FPSP, were divided into a total o f 5,872 individual and family
farms. Procedures includingupdating landmaps, identifying, numbering, and
demarcating parcels were introduced inaddition to the issuance o f land-holding
certificates. Inaddition, landregistration was computerized. Farmers contacted duringthe
PPARmission were able to locate their parcels on a map (see Annex F) as each
certificate indicatedthe exact demarcations o f landparcels, including those o f their
neighbors.

4.7     The procedures usedinthis farm restructuring experience were documented for
eventual replication (see Annex D [Sampath, 20061). The ten-step process i s being used
inthe follow-on project. Thus theproject clearly servedas abasis for replication,
although it i s too early to say how successful this next attempt (which involves
restructuring 300 additional farms, mostly innon-cotton-growing areas) will be.

4.8     Inthe absenceofbroader disseminationofthe project experience, however, other
donors are highly unlikelyto replicate this effort. Donors consulted duringthe PPAR
mission inTajikistan said that they were unaware o f any project-developedmodel for
farm restructuring. Yet restructuringseems to be anunstoppable process. A 2007 study
undertakenbyUSAID examinedthe country-wide progress with landrestructuringin
Tajikistan (see Figure3). According to this study, 27,294 land use titledcertificates have
beenissued. The mission found that tracking the influence o f the project on such a large
sample was not possible without a significant further investment inresearch.

4.9      Obiective 3: Createsustainableprivatefamily farming units andprovide them
with the enabling conditions to operate independently in a market economy; (modest)

4.10     The project offered farmers apackage o f support attractive enoughto serve as an
incentive for state and collective farm managers to restructure their farms. The package
included rehabilitationo f irrigation infrastructure, the establishment o f WUA's for their
maintenance, a one-time grant for farm inputs, and access to credit, training, and travel
tours for local officials andproject staff to other countries. Inaddition, a public
awareness campaignwas organized with the aim o f informing farmers about the benefits
o frestructuring.

4.11 This PPAR concludes that the package provided necessary but not sufficient
enabling conditions. Sustainably restructuring state and collective farms required
ensuringthat necessary finance, inputs, andmechanizationwould be available inthe
intermediate term. It might be reasonable to expect private providers to step inat some
point. But a one-time grant has to bequestioned as to its overall sufficiency to provide
the necessary.

4.12     The freedom to makecropping decisions i s a sine qua non o f operating ina
market system. Farmers innon-cotton growing areasclose to marketsinDushanbeand in
the hills were able to make their own cropping decisions and buy seeds and fertilizer on
the market. Farmers incotton-growing areas were another story. Theyhad to rely on loan
brokersto provide themwith overpriced, low-quality inputs at highrates o f interest. In
return, farmers hadto deliver cotton at a lower than marketprice to the cotton gin.

4.13     Irrigation. Irrigation is an important enabling condition. InTajikistan about
860,000 hais suited for agriculture, and some 720,000 ha (or 84 percent) are irrigated.
Most o f Tajikistan's agricultural land, including the FPSP project area, is located inbowl-
shaped valleys with gentle slopes. To irrigate these fields, rather than to rely on gravity as
muchas possible, Tajikistanhas developed arelatively expensive way to irrigate using

                                                        14


p~mping.~      Water is pumped uphill(sometimes over 150meters) to main canals, which
are aligned on the higher contours. Subsequently, water from the maincanals is applied
to the landdownthe slope, at the bottom o fwhich it i s collected ina drainage system.

4.14     Inmostproject farms irrigation capacity haddeteriorated to the extent that water
delivered to the fields hadbeenreduced by about 40 percent. Only about halfo f the
requiredpumps were working ina typical pumpingstation, and even these were inpoor
condition, requiring constant repair andthe importation of expensive spare parts. Since
the farms could not afford the needed repairs, restoringthe dilapidated pumping
infrastructure was one o fthe main incentives that made farm chairmen agree to the
proposed restructuring.

4.15     The IEGPPARmission found that while the repair needs for irrigation
infrastructure hadbeen carefilly assessed(see Box 4), inthe absence of cropping
freedom, access to free markets, etc., the farms were unlikely to be able to maintain the
project-repaired systems.

Box 4. Repairs Carefully Tailored to the Specific Needs of the Restructured Farms
Inone restructuredfarmvisitedbythe PPARmission, pumpmotors hadbeenreplacedandthe pumphouse
building hadbeen rehabilitated. Inanother farm nearby where water loss due to absorption was a bigger
problem, canals hadbeen lined with concrete, new aqueducts hadbeenbuilt, outlet gates to tertiary
channels hadbeenreplaced, and open and closed drainage systems had either been constructed or restored.
(For a list o f all infrastructure rehabilitated under FPSP see Annex B.)



4.16      Infact, maintenanceisalreadyaseriouschallenge. TheIEGPPARmissionfound
that aqueducts were leaking, outlet gates to tertiary channels that hadbeenreplacedunder
the project were missing, and the rehabilitated drainage systems were clogged by
garbage. The challenge has clearly not yet been overcome interms o f sustainably
maintaining irrigation systems. Why not?

 WUAsNot YetReady toManage On-farm Irrigation Systems

4.17       Under the Soviet Union, off-farm irrigation structures, such as primary and
secondary canals were maintained bythe Ministry o f Irrigation and Water Resources
Management, while on-farm or tertiary irrigation channels were maintainedby state or
collective farms. One o f the challenges that farm restructuring posed was the
maintenance o f on-farm irrigation channels once a state or collective farm was
restructured into individual or family farm units. To overcome this challenge, the 2000
Water Code (later amended in2003), provided a legal basis for the establishment o f
W A S .The W A S 'mainfunctions were to: 1) equitably allocate water, 2) provide for
maintenance o f on-farm irrigation channels, and 3) collect water user fees.




 According to Sehring (2006), some 60 percent o f Tajikistan's irrigated land i s served at least inpart by
pumps.

                                                       15


4.18      The IEGPPARmissionvisited four (of the nine)WUAs established underthe
FPSP and learned that meetings were heldon a regular basis. There were three main
problems, however. First, regarding equitable water allocation, some farmers complained
that water was distributedonly according to the schedule needed by cotton plantations
andthat the irrigation needs o ffarmers planting other crops were neglected. Inparticular,
farmers at the tail end o f the irrigation channel didnot receive sufficient water
allocations. Inresponse to its questions, the mission noted that no dispute resolution
mechanisms hadbeen established under the project other than the purchase o fbicycles to
bringchairmenmore quickly to areas where disputes were takingplace. Second,
concerningthe operation o f on-farm irrigation channels, field verification saw little
evidence o fmaintenance. For example, leaky aqueducts and eroded concrete were
causing extensive water losses andreducing conveyance efficiency. Finally, regarding the
collection o fwater user fees, which might havebeenusedto pay workers to perform
maintenance, the W A S 'performance was not optimal. Underthe project, a gradual
process o f introducing water user fees hadbeen envisaged. Inthe first year, 75 percent o f
the costs for operation and maintenance were to bepaidby the project; inthe second
year, 50 percent; and inthe thirdyear, 25 percent. By the fourth year, WUAs were
expected to be fully self-financed. However, o f the four WUAs visited by the mission,
only one WUA was current with fee collection."

Water Meters Installed, But Not Used
4.19      Inorder tomeasurewater allocations andtokeepwaterusesustainable, water
measurement devices (reikus)were installed under the project. The PPAR mission visited
five stations where such meters hadbeeninstalled. While intwo locations it turnedout
that they could not be seenbecause access doors were closed and locked, intwo other
locations, meters were completely missing.Inthe fifth location, a meter was found;
however, the compartment was full o f sediment and garbage, which meant that
measurements were impossible to take.

4.20      It is important to note that WUA members stated that farmers were hostileto
meteringbecause they feared that they would be charged inthe hturenot only for
maintenance andwater delivery, but also for water as a commodity. This fear was not
unfounded, since a sign infront o f one o fthe WUAs displayed a quote from the President
o f Tajikistan saying that water i s infact a commodity and it needs to be paid for. The
above may inpart explain the reluctance ofWUA members to measure water levels. It is
also true that inthe past, water usage was estimated according to flow velocity and
allocations were based on farm size rather than actual water use."




lo missionwasinformedthat inthe
   The                                    WUA, which was current with its fee collection, the ISF [Irrigation
Service Fee] was volumetric based and estimated at 0.06 somoni per cubic meter o f water. This amount
was paid infull to the Ministry o f Irrigationand Water Resources. An additional 0.02 somoni was collected
for operation and maintenance. As a result, farmers had to pay 0.08 somoni per cubic meter o f water
received. Thus, ISF amounts to about 80 somoni per hectare o f cotton land.
11 According to Sehring (2006), "the mirob calculates the water volume by the flow velocity. The ISF
[irrigation service fee] is calculated according to land size andnot actual water use. As all farmers grow
more or less the same products (due to state prescriptions), they also use more or less the same amount o f
water."

                                               16


WUAs Organized by CountyRather than by Irrigation Channels

4.21    The LandCode (2003) specifies that W A Sbe organizedby brigade. Underthe
Soviet Union, vast state andcollective farms were sub-divided inbrigades (which loosely
correspond with counties). Brigadiers were powerful andwell-respected county
commissioners. These administrative structures were originally clan-based and they ante-
date the Soviet Union. Brigadesthus have a deep-rooted tradition inwhich patronage
plays an important role. To some degree, buildingon a long-standing
sociaVorganizationa1 structure may have facilitated the acceptance o f W A S ,while at the
same time, it may have also reinforced traditions o f inequality andpatronage that thrived
inthose earlier times. Perhapsthis unintendedconsequence couldhavebeenavoidedif
WUA members hadan important sharedinterest. Butthis could only have happened if
the project had set up WUAs based on actual irrigation channel use rather than on county
boundaries. As integrated water resources management principles become more broadly
accepted, WUAs may eventually be modified so the membership follows actual irrigation
channels, which would improve the likelihood that those channels are maintained.

Farms' Needfor Farm Machinery Not YetResolved

4.22    The mission found that another factor critical to the sustainability o fthe
restructuredfarms was regular access to farm machinery, which the project optednot to
finance. Machinerybelonging to the farms had fallen out o f their control duringthe civil
war. Some o fit was now inthe hands o fpowerful peoplewho were either unwillingto
return or share it. Inother cases equipment hadbeen sold, eventhough ownershipwas
unclear, and it i s currently beyond the ability o fthe farms to recover it.

4.23    Traditional farm machinery is very large inscale, andit is more appropriate for
the 80 ha to 100ha fields o fthe old collective farms. After the project-financed
restructuring, farmers cultivate on average 3.25 ha o f land (rangingbetween 2.30 ha and
6.90 ha). Operations on such a scale find it difficult to find the funds to invest innew
machinery or evento rent it, especially since the smaller scale equipment usedinsome
countries i s not yet widely available inTajikistan.

Missing the Target

4.24    Under the Soviet command economy, farming was highly specialized. However,
with farm restructuring, iftheywere going to farm sustainably farmers neededto acquire
skills innew technologies, such as how to apply fertilizer and conserve water, develop a
business plan, apply for credit, market their produce, and defend their tenure rights.

4.25    The gender division o flabor traditionally followed inagriculture was
compromised when men from the rural areas often moved to the capital Dushanbe, or for
Russia or other CIS countries inorder to find paidwork. Women stayed home and were
therefore forced bynecessity to do the bulk o f agricultural labor. While it maybe argued
that the lack o f farm machinery created employment (as the ICR does), the burden was
borne mostly bywomen, who inaddition to caring for children inthe absence o f their
husbands, also laboredinthe fields.

                                                17


4.26    Under FPSP, training institutes were set up inorder to train trainers. Three
months o f intensive training courses were provided inorder to communicate new farming
technology andalso establish field demonstration sites, for which the Agro University
provided plots. Followingthe selection o f 150trainers o ftrainees, they went out into the
six districts o fthe pilot project area andtrained some 18,000 farmers.

4.27    Unfortunately, the training methods useddidnot meet the needs o f farmers.
Trainers useduniversity-style lectures to convey information, which farmers could not
fully understandnor apply inthe field. As demonstrated inAnnex Ebelow, little increase
incrop variety andproductivity canbedemonstrated, except for wheat, which canbe
explainedby seed distributed duringthe post-drought intervention.

4.28    Yet another shortcoming o f extension services was the fact that the trainingo f
trainers was providedpredominantly by andto men.Because family farms inTajikistan
are overwhelmingly runbywomen (since the menfolk migrated), and since according to
local culture norms women are not supposed to attend official meetings, male extension
trainers missed an important component ofthe target population which reducedthe
possibility o fintroducing change on the ground.

4.29    Training centers were established underthe project to provide training and
information to the farmers participatinginthe project, and facilities were renovated and
equipped with furniture, computers, offices, publication technology, libraries, kitchens
and bedrooms. However, once the project was closed, the government took most o fthe
newlyrenovated facilities and equipment and put them to usesnot focused on the
restructured farms.

4.30    One training center, however, continues to serve the targetpopulation inthe
manner anticipated, although it was moved to Dushanbe, a different place than where it
was established by the project, and it i s now runon a for-profit basis. This newly
established independent training center provides services for international donors and
NGOs. At the time o fthe field visit, activities finded by fourteeninternational
institutions were takingplace. These involved the production o fbrochures and training
materials, and also the use o f the facilities for training. At the time the PPAR mission
visited Dushanbe,the center hadjust trained 60 trainers inGIS technology for the
ongoing World Bank-financed LandRegistration and Cadastre System for Sustainable
Agriculture Project. While the independent training center i s profitable and meets donor
demand for an outreach capacity, farmers are not willing to pay for training themselves,
and the services the center provides will be sustained only as long as funding from
international organizations continues.

Agricultural Credit Too Costly

4.3 1 It took the Bank until2004 to set up six credit institutions, each inthe form o f a
Non-Banking Financial Organization (NFBOs) as classified withinTajikistan's legal
system. Moreproblematic, the interest rate charged the farmers is highanddifficult to
repay from traditional agricultural activities. Interest rates varied between 30-37 percent
depending on the NFBO (with an inflation rate estimated at 12percent in2003 and at 7.5
in2006).

                                              18


4.32    Fieldvisits to two o fthese institutions found the following:

     0  NFBOs are turningaprofit, not surprising given the interest charged, andthey are
         on schedule with the repayment o f their US$200,000 line o f credit. One o fthe
        NFBOsvisitedis planningto buyitself apermanent mainoffice building.

     0   Repayment rates were initially very high(100 percent for the first credits), but
         they have been dropping considerably as time passes.

     8   Credit application procedures were kept simple and assistancewas provided in
         formulating the requiredbusiness plan.

     0   NFBOsprovided credit not only to farmers, but also to other groups. Ofthe total
         credit extended, halfwent to small businesses.

     8   While under FPSP andWorld Bank supervision, more than 15 percent o f credit
         applicants were women. By 2007, the number o f women applying for credit fell to
         10percent.



One-time Grants

4.33     Theproject provided a one-time grant to restructure farms inorder to increase
their newly acquired independence from state and collective farm managers. The reason
for these one-time grants (modeled after the U.S."homestead grants") was to help
farmers overcome a number o fproblems that hinderedtheir ability to become
independent.

4.34     The one-time grant provided to each family amounted to US$300per
(restructured farm) hectare up to a maximumo fUS$600for farms with two hectares or
more. These grants were intendedto help families obtaintheir own inputs, such as seeds,
fertilizer, and farm machinery, which were previously provided by the government, and
following independence, bymerchants and sometimes loan sharks. Grants were
transferred into abank account provided that families met the following criteria: 1)proof
o f local residency had to beprovided, 2) their farming area had to be irrigated, 3) a land
certificatehadto be shown, 4) membership o f a WUA was required, and 4) proof o f
having opened a bank account was also necessary.

4.35     A beneficiary survey conductedin2005 foundthat out of a randomly selected
sample o f 100family farms spread across the ten FPSP pilot areas, 98 percent received a
one-time grant. The beneficiary survey also found that while about halfo fthe farm
families (54 percent) have utilized the grant to buy farm inputs for the next cropping
season, 38 percent have used it to improve housing, and 66 percent have used some o fthe
grant funds to meet family needs.

4.36     While grants were aimed at increasingthe independence o f farmers, their one-
timenature, andthe fact that they were so often usedto payback debt or cover other
deferredexpenditures resultedina very short-lived independence.

4.39     Inresponse to the drought, IDAprovided aUS$3million Supplemental Credit,
which was usedby the PIUto procure seeds and fertilizers. Since independence, yearly
delivery o f hybrid seeds from Russiahad stopped, and farmers usedpart o ftheir yields
for the new plantingseason. As a result ofreplantingwith degenerated hybrids,which
lose their effectiveness inone season, yields declined. Therefore, the project reestablished
the supplychain for improved seeds inorder to stabilize yields for the coming years. The
PIUcontracted five NGOS'~ deliver the seeds and fertilizer infamily-sized packages to
                              to
some 56,000 farm families. Overall, Tajikistan received 10,000 tons o ftraditional wheat
seed, 500 tons o f genetically improved wheat seed, and 5,300 tons o f chemical
fertilizers-sufficient  to cover a total area o f 55,555 hectares. While the southern region
o fKhatlon receivedthe most seeds, and Badakhshonthe least, Figure 5 shows that on a
per hectare basis, seed distribution byregion was equitable. Fertilizer distribution was
not equitable.

ACTED, CAREInternational, Global Partners, Gender andDevelopment, and GermanAgro Action.

4.40      Recent years have seen a dramatic increase innational wheat yields (see Figure
6). While it is difficult to attribute the increase inwheat yield to this particular
intervention alone, joint donor efforts, which provided Tajikistan with agricultural
training inconjunction with humanitarian relief distributions inthe form o f cereal and
potato seeds along with fertilizer, have contributed to these results.

5.       Ratinp

OUTCOME
5.1      The outcome o fthe project is rated as moderatelysatisfactory.The basis for this
rating i s outlined inthe following sections.

RELEVANCE
5.2      The relevance o fproject objectives is rated as substantial.The project was
relevant to what the 1998 CAS described as fair and equitable landallocation and
distribution processes andmechanisms, as well as the development o f land use rights and
lease markets. The project i s still relevant to what the 2005 CAS described as the
Government's priorities inthe agricultural sector. These priorities include continuing the
farm landprivatization program, improving competition infarm inputsand cotton
marketing, andrehabilitatingirrigation infrastructure.

5.3      The relevance o fproject design is rated as modest.Giventhe differences between
Tajikistan and some o f its neighbors, the use of a blueprint design ledto a pilot that was
too complex and ambitious and not tailored enough to the specific circumstances o f the
country. Tajik institutions at the time o fproject design were weak, as was the country's
legal system, making it difficult to introduce landtenure security (objective 1). Inthe
absence o f a hlly functioning market economy, it was also ambitious to expect the
project to provide farmers with the enabling conditions to operate independently ina free
market (objective 3), giventhat elements o f the command economy were still
predominant, and the transition to a market economy had onlyjust begunto take place.
Eventhough the very same approach to farm restructuringworked well inAzerbaijan,
legal, institutional, andeconomic conditions were more difficult inTajikistan andthese
differences were not adequately taken into account duringappraisal. For example, at the
time ofprojectpreparation, itwas difficult for project staffto evenreceive a copy o fthe
Land Code. The design o f the FPSP could have focused more on securing landuse rights
at the central level andensuring enforcement at the local government level. Assuming
that secure landuse rights could be introduced infive years was an over-ambitious
objective.

EFFICACY
5.4      Overall efficacy is rated as modest.There were moderate shortcomings inthe
achievement o fproject objectives. As described indetail inprevious sections, ten pilot
state and collective farms were restructuredinto 5,782 individual and family farms, with
each farm having its own landcertificate listing all family members. Inaddition, a model
that provedreplicable to some degree inthe follow-on was created for farm restructuring.
Furthermore, while rehabilitated infrastructure, training, access to credit, and one-time
grants for every family living inan irrigated area have easedthe transition to independent
farming to some degree, overall progress has beensuboptimal. A particularly successhl
activity under the project - the provision o f improved wheat seed - has contributed to a
dramatic increase inyields. Yet despite these achievements, challenges remain. Tajikistan
still faces fundamental legal, cultural, and social barriers to farm restructuring.

                                                       22


Specifically, regarding irrigation system maintenance, lack o f access to credit and
machinery, and the strong interest o f local governments inkeeping cotton production
high,restructuringhasbeenmetwith significant localresistance. Furthermore, W A S
established to maintain these irrigation systems lack operating funds to keep the
rehabilitated structures operating andthey have been set up ina way that makes little
technical sense.

EFFICIENCY
5.5      Efficiency is rated as substantial. According to the PAD, the project's two broad
types o f economic benefits were the creation and promotion o f a privatized form o f
agriculture andincreasingindividual families' income from farming. The estimated
population expected to directly benefit from the project was about 28,000 persons who
depended on agriculture as their principal source o fincome. Inthe event, the same
number actually benefited.

5.6      As aresult ofthe project, average family incomes increased from US$1,375 in
2001 to US$2,345 in2005 based on householdconsumption surveys conductedunder the
project. This increase was due to higher cropping intensity and crop rotation, rather than
increases inyields (except for wheat). Family incomes innon-project farms didnot show
such increases. For eight out o ften project farms, this meant an increase inincome above
thepovertythresholdo f earningUS$l per day. However, despite this increase inincome,
privatized forms o f agriculture were realized inonly two of the ten farms. Because these
farms didnot depend on large pumpingstations for water and had easy access to markets,
diversifyingcrops andmarketingthem couldbe achieved. With respect to the eight other
farms located incotton-growing areas, privatization was hampered for the reasons
explained earlier.

5.7      Interms ofreturnsonirrigation investments, thepre-project IRRwas estimated at
21 percent. Ex post analysis finds the IRRto be 21 percent, inline with initial estimates.
Other economic benefits stem from an increase incropping intensity, which increased the
gross margin three to fivefold.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
5.8      The risk to development outcome is rated as substantial.As discussed earlier (see
Box 3), a number o fbarriers to replicating farm restructuring all over the country remain.
Inaddition, strong vested interests incottonstillprevent farmers fromdeterminingtheir
own crop-growing andmarketing choices. According to a 2007 surveyundertakenby
USAID andthe World Bank, respondents listedthe followingthree major barriersto farm
restructuring: 1) limitedaccess to irrigation water, 2) lack of access to machinery, and 3)
lack o f cash or credit to buy inputs.13The findings o f this survey underlinethe
importance o f a broad and sustained support (financial, technical, legal, organizational)



13USAIDAVorld Bank (2007). The survey was undertakenby the Center for Sociological Research.
"Zerkalo." A sample was scientifically drawn from USAID-funded project areas, and the World Bank-
financed project areas o f the FPSP and the follow-up project. Inaddition, one hundred twenty-eight
individuals were selected for the qualitative part of the study. The qualitative interviews were conducted in
the three regions where the FPSPpilotproject hadbeen undertaken.

                                              23


untilfarmers attainfunctional independence. The lack o ffarmmachineryavailable for
rent at affordable rates i s being addressedinthe Bank-funded follow-on project.

5.9     Itis important to emphasize that farmrestructuring inTajikistan is clearly donor
driven. Some 40 to 50 donor agencies working incountry are currently advocating land
reform for Tajikistan. The borrower was interested inirrigation system rehabilitation. The
Banklobbied for aprivatized approach to farming generally.

5.10    Despite the weakening o fthe command economy to some extent following the
collapse o f the Soviet Union, elements such as quotas for cottonproduction still exist,
andthere are still powerfulvested interests inother aspects o fthe former system. Inthe
past, donors have proposed that new laws on landreform and cropping choice be enacted.
These would reduce some o fthe risks to which project achievements are subject. But
there is little local ownership o f change. These laws tended to be prepared and fundedby
donors. But Parliamenthas been unwilling to resolve the legal issues around farm
restructuring andthe freedom to crop that are so important for the project's sustainability,
and any resolutionwill take timeto work its way through the system.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.11    Bankperformance is rated moderately satisfactory for the reasons discussed
below.

5.12    Oualitv at entry i s rated as moderately unsatisfactory: The project designwas
overly ambitious and complex inany case, much more so for a country that was just
emergingfrom five years o fcivil war, andinwhich manyofficials had fled the country,
creating a dearth ininstitutional memoryand know-how.

5.13    Ouality o f supervisionis rated as satisfactory: Despitethe precarious security
situation following the civil war, Bank supervision was extensive andresolved issues
relatedto procurement andproject managementexpeditiously. For example, the task
manager's acquisition o f the Russianand Tajik languages facilitated communication with
local government representatives as well as beneficiaries. When necessary, the Bank
team made use o f its access to the highest levels o f government inorder to facilitate
project implementation. However, clarifying tenure security early on could have ledto
the spreado f farm restructuringmore rapidly throughout the country. Morework on
donor coordination might have assistedthe process. In2003, however, the Bank beganto
capitalize on a uniteddonor front, participating inregular donor meetingsunder the
leadership o f FA0 aimed at inducinginvolved international donors to speak with one
voice on privatizationintheir interactions with the government.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
5.14    Overall, Borrower performance i s rated as satisfactory.

5.15    The Government's performance i s rated as satisfactory: Though initially
somewhat reluctant, the government supported farm restructuring duringproject
implementation. There was strong support from the highest levels o f government and
good cooperationwith line ministries. However, there were difficulties at the level o f

                                             24


parliament with respect to legal reforms, and at the local level, which found it difficult to
overcome its financial interest inthe revenues that came fiom cotton production.

5.16   The implementing agency's performance i s rated as satisfactory: The PIUwas
highlydedicatedto makingthe project a success. For example, initially there were no
private contractors inTajikistan, and after the Bank suggested it, the PIUtook an active
role inhelpingset up private companies. Through close on-the-ground supervision, and
carefil review o fprocurement actions it also facilitated the introduction o f good practice
standards of contracting.

6.    Lessons from the FPSP

Theproject experience suggests the following lessons:

      Land tenure security andfarmers 'freedom to make their own management
      decisions are vitalfor successful farm privatization. Inthe case o f Tajikistan,
      strong support from the highest levels o f government was not enoughto
      restructure and privatize state andcollective farms throughout the country. In
      cotton-growing areas, local governments were more interested inprofitingfrom
      cottonproduction than sharing benefits with newly independent farmers.

      International experience may enrichproject design, but only when local
      conditions arefully taken into account. Inthe case o f Tajikistan, project design
      was overly ambitious andnot tailored enough to the local circumstances,
      including five years o f civil war and the functioning presence o f aspects o f a
      command economy. While the Bank's worldwide sectoral experience i s an asset,
      transferring a model which was successful inone country to another country can
      becounterproductiveifproject design does not sufficiently take local conditions
      into account.

       Care must be taken to identi!all thefactors constraining the achievement of
      project objectives, and then something needs to be done about each of them.
      While some o f the barriers to farm restructuring (such as improving access to
      water and credit), were dealt with at appraisal, the lack o f farm machinery was not
      recognizedas inissue, even though it was a highpriority for farmers.

      Donor coordination can assist with thepropagation of major reforms. In
      Tajikistan, it took the Bank until2003 to realize that ifdonors would speak with
       one voice to the government on landreform, it might create conditions more
       favorable for the project-restructured farms.

      Establishing WUAs along irrigation channels creates an incentive to tackle
      problems. InTajikistan, W A Swere set up according to political divisions like
      counties, but this ledto users havingno shared interest inimproving the system
      beingmanaged. Haduser associations beenset upbyirrigation channels there
      would have been a strong incentive to improve their hnctioning by addressing
      maintenance preventively.

       The experience with water measurement devices shows that installingphysical
      devices is not enough. The installation o fmeters needs to be accompanied by a
      public awareness campaign ifchanges inthe rules o f the game are going to leadto
      water conservation andother changes inpractice.

                                   (PPFIQ 1080, Credit 233400, 32401)

        We are very grateful to the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) o f the World Bank for its
thoroughreview o f the activity implementedunder the FarmPrivatization Support Project ("Project"),
and for the developed Report reflecting in details the outcomes o f the activity implemented under the
Project.

        This Project i s one among the first projects o f the World Bank aimed at development o f
agriculture o fTajilustan. The Project i s very challenging, andmainly supports the reforms implemented
inagriculture, as well asreorganization ofkolhozsandsovhozs; rehabilitationofirrigationsystem, and
establishmento fthe organizations suchasWater UserAssociations; non-banlang financial organizations,
etc.

        The Project was approved inJune 1999. The purposes o f the Project include the following:

        1)          Developmento farrangements andinstitutional mechanisms at governmental level in
                    selected regions to ensure an equitable, guaranteed and equal transfer o f land to
                    individuals or groups; 2) test and introduction o f the procedures inten selected ex-
                    sovhozs and kolhozs to develop models to use as a basis inpractice inmore number
                    o fdistricts; 3) establishmento fsustainable dehkanhouseholds to independentlywork
                    inmarket economy conditions.

        Aslongago asin2005 the Governmental Committee conductedamonitoringandhighlightedthe
Project had attained the aims determined as priority ones in agriculture sector. Given successful
implementation o f the Project, 10 pilot kolhozs had been privatized and 5782 individual dehkan
households hadbeen established.

        At the same time it should be noted that in2001 an additional credit inthe amount o fUSD 3
million was approved. A purpose o f the credit was to mitigate a severe drought o f 2000 through
emergency agriculture support to households suffered from drought consequences. It comprised the
following: delivery o f genetically-improved seeds o fwheat, fertilizers and other chemicals. These steps

        We agree that land tenure protection and freedom o f farmers to take managerial decisions are
essential for successful privatization; strong support from the Government to continue reforms in
agriculture usingthe experience gained.

        Internationalexperiencehadprovidedanopportunity to the Project Teamto achievethe goals of
the Project, however, the Team should have taken into consideration the local environment, such as
ensuring access to water resources and loans. No sufficient attention had been paid to agriculture
equipment, despite this issuehad a top priority for the farmers. Assuredly, this issue is still very crucial
and requiresresolutionduringthe further stages coordinating and cooperating with donors giving their
hands o f support to the country insuccessful implementation ofreforms.
