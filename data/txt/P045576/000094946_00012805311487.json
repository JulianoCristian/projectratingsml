The key lessons learned from\n            ERP-2 include: a) Planning and implementing in a highly\n            unstable environment such as West Bank & Gaza requires\n            an unconventional approach. The challenge is to act quickly\n            on the basis of the best existing information, and modify\n            behavior based on learning. This may require continual\n            redefinition of objectives and even project redesign during\n            implementation. b) Productive emergency job creation is not\n            an easy task and requires special planning if resources are\n            to be effectively deployed. New types of sub-projects and\n            specially designed implementation structures are required.\n            c) It is critical that beneficiaries be adequately consulted\n            during project preparation in order that their needs and\n            priorities are properly reflected in project design. d)\n            Communities are willing to participate in program\n            formulation and contribute directly (up to 20 percent of\n            project costs) for projects which directly benefit their\n            communities. e) As the development program shifts from\n            \"emergency\" operations and begins to tackle more\n            complex issues, the Bank and implementing agencies must\n            develop the capacity to undertake more sophisticated project\n            appraisal. f) Greater attention needs to be paid by the\n            borrower to the timely acquisition of land and building\n            permits if significant implementation delays are to be avoided."}, "docdt": "1999-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
