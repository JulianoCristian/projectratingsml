1.   Background.  The Palestinian economy's present state of economic
crisis has been generated by border closures, initiated in response to
four suicide bombings in February - March of 1996.
The ensuing deprivation of the Palestinian labor force by loss in
earnings, and the severe restriction in the flow of merchandise exports
and imports for the WBG, has exacerbated a situation of chronic
unemployment.
2.   To address the crisis, urgent donor measures were implemented to
ensure the rapid delivery of benefits to the worst-affected
Palestinians. These benefits have principally taken the form of short-
term labor intensive employment generation programs (funded primarily by
the Bank's Holst Fund). As a key coordinator and administrator of donor
finance to the Palestinians, the Bank provided additional emergency
rehabilitation funding to accelerate the delivery of more conventional
project financing. A key component in this strategy was to provide
funding for sub-projects with high rates of return which generate
construction employment. The Second ERP funding is providing $20,000,000
on IDA terms in pursuit of this objective.
3.   Project Description.   The Second ERP is supporting some 40 road and
water and wastewater sub-projects, of which 33 are to rehabilitate and
improve village access and municipal roads (27 in the West Bank and 6 in
Gaza) and the remaining 7 to rehabilitate and extend water supply and
wastewater disposal facilities (all in Gaza). The bidding for
approximately half of the 40 sub-projects began in late April 1996,
while implementation begun in May, 1996. As of the end of December
1997, 32% of Project Funds had been disbursed.
4.   Project Cost.   US$20,000,000.00, in the form of an IDA Trust Fund
Credit, to supplement commitments under the on-going ERP of
US$30,000,000.00.
5.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.   This is one of several quick-
response initiatives to relieve the present economic crisis. The Bank
was in a good position to provide immediate financial assistance through



an on-going program of sub-projects that had already been identified.
It is estimated that the sub-projects have created over 150,000 person-
days of employment in WBG, and that they will make important sustainable
contributions to the stock of infrastructure.
6.   Implementation of the Second ERP.   Procurement arrangements are
identical to those used in the ERP. The majority of the 40 sub-projects
of the Second ERP are below US$500,000, and no sub-project exceeds
US$2,500,000 in total estimated cost. The works contracts are expected
to be awarded under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures in line
with implementing agency procurement procedures. The single
modification to these procedures is the shortening of the minimum period
between the first appearance of tender notification and bid submission
from 30 to 15 days. Disbursement arrangements remain unchanged.
7.   Environmental Aspects.     The sub-projects under the proposed
Second ERP, like those in the first ERP (FY94, $30,000,000 from the
Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank) focus on rehabilitation and
improvement of existing infrastructure facilities which do not involve
extensive land acquisition, or result in involuntary resettlement, or
affect any known historical or archaeological sites. Conversely, by
improving water supply and wastewater disposal facilities, as well as
drainage systems in the covered sections of the road network, the
project is resulting in significant environmental improvements,
especially in the more seriously affected Gaza Strip. As with the first
ERP, environmental procedures and reviews by PECDAR, the PA and the Bank
continue, generating the same environmental screening category of 'B'.
