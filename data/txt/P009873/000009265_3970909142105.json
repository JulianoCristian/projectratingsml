There were two project objectives at\n            appraisal which reflected the two parts. These were: (a) to\n            support the improvements in urban sector management and\n            institutional strengthening initiated by the Government of\n            Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) and to reduce the serious deficits in\n            urban shelter, infrastructure and services in the State; and\n            (b) to assist the Central Ganga Authority (CGA) in its\n            efforts to reduce pollution levels in the Ganga River. There\n            were shortcomings in Bank performance. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was not satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) The Ganga Action Program part of UPUDP\n            was not adequately appraised; (ii) Bank management should\n            investigate the possibility of arrangements for partial\n            suspension of disbursements for projects with numerous\n            implementing entities; (iii) contractor disputes can\n            continue for many years and greatly delay progress; and (iv)\n            the Bank should ensure that there is reasonable continuity\n            of its management, task manager, other staff and consultants\n            working on a project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
