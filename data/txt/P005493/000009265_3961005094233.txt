KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT LOAN
Loan and Project Summanr
Borrower:                        Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:                          US$121 million equivalent
Terms:                           Repayment in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Executing Agency:                Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Development
(MAMVA).
Project Description:             The primary objective of the ASIL II would be to support a
well-conceived investment program in Morocco's agricultural
sector. This program is a time-slice of the Government's total
agricultural investment program for 1994-97, estimated at
US$993 million. The ASIL II would finance just over
12 percent of this program. The ASIL. II would also support
an action program of measures designed to further promote the
Government's sector objectives (increasing sector growth,
environmental protection, reducing poverty, and redefining the
role of Govermnent) and improve the efficiency of subsector
investments, focusing in particular on actions to consolidate
the agricultural adjustment program, private sector
development and improved public sector management.
The ASIL Ll would finance specific critical investments
selected from the Government's investment program for 1995-
97 with retroactive financing for part of 1994. These include
investments in: agricultural education, livestock, crop
production, plant protection, land policy programs, rainfed
land improvements, forestry, extension, small- and medium-
scale irrigation, and planning. The Loan would also finance
an Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) which promotes
private investments in: land improvements; irrigation
improvements; increased use of small-scale farm equipment;
livestock intensification; phyto-sanitary protection; and
increased tree planting.

- ii -
The package of policy actions supported by the ASIL 11
includes:
(a) liberalization of internal and external trade.
(b) reforms in the budget execution process;
(c) reforms of the FDA; and
(d) subsectoral reforms (covering livestock, agricultural
education arnd training, forestry and soil conservation, small-
and medium-scale irrigation, plant protection, extension, crop
production, research, and land policy).
The ASIL 1I would also support the establishment of an
Environmental Management Unit which would have the
responsibility for undertaking environmental screening of
projects, arranging for environmental impact assessments when
appropriate, and monitoring impact results from investments.
Project Risks:                     A possible risk is a Government failure to provide adequate
budget funding for seiected investments during the project
period. Annual reviews during the budget cycle will minimize
the risk that overall budget levels fall short of planned
expenditures. In the event of a shortfall, however, design of
the ASIL II is flexible enough to permit substitution of
alternative investments meeting the established selection
criteria. There is also the risk that parts of the action program
would not be implemented as agreed. However, the program
is very much "owned" by the Government, particularly the
subsector reforms and these status of these actions would be
carefully assessed and discussed with the Government as part
of regular supervision and the anrual reviews.

PART 1. TIHE AGRICUITURAL SECTOR IN MOROCCO
I.  Overview of the Agricultural Sector
A. Agriculture in the Ecoriny
1.        The agricultural sector plays a critical role in the Moroccan economy. Although it
contributes only 16 percent to Morocco's GDP, it provides employment for 40 pei-cent of the labor
force and generates 30 percent of export earnings. Food crops are the largest subsector, contributing
about 60 percent of the gross value of agricultural production. Cereals alone account for nearly
80 percent of the harvested area and 33 percent of the gross value of production.
2.        Morocco has 28 million hectares of agricultural land, of which only 9.2 million hectares
of potentially arable land are cultivable. Half of this area receives average rainfall sufficient for
production of many crops but the precipitation is inconsistent and shortfalls are common. While some
800,000 hectares are currently irrigated, the Government aims to develop one million hectares of
irrigated crops. --he agricultural sector is characterized by a fairly dualistic structure whereby
relatively prosperous areas use modern technology to produce a variety of food, industrial and export
crops, and poorer areas practice traditional agriculture in which cereals and pulses predominate.
B. Government Objectives and Strategy
3.        The Government's objectives in the early 1980s were shaped by the urgent economic
circumstances in which it found itself. Faced with increasing economic disequilibria in the internal
and external accounts, the Government sought to (i) reduce fiscal and balance of payments deficits;
and (ii) increase productivity by reforming the underlying structure of key economic and social
sectors. In 1984, the Government introduced a medium-term program of stabilization and adjustment.
Public investments were cut to reduce the fiscal & ficit and a number of policy measures were taken
to improve the balance of payments. As part uf this strategy, a major Medium-Term Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Program (MTASAP) was launched to bring about accompanying reforms in the
agricultural sector. This program was supported by two sector adjustment loans from the Bank (see
paras. 24-31). Consistent with the macroeconomic objectives of internal and external balance and
increased productivity, the focus of the MTASAP and the Bank loans was to liberalize input and
output prices and the external trade regime, deregulate the domestic marketing system and transfer
commercially viable activities to the private sector.
4.        Progress under the MTASAP was very good. While agricultural growth was slow in the
1970s, averaging 2.4 percent p.a. in real terms, it rose to an average 8.2 percent annual real rate
between 1981-91 despite several drought years. This growth reflects the impact of the MTASAP's
improved incentives framework, as well as the growing impact of irrigation and adequate rainfall in
the non-drought years. This output growth was accompanied by increases in agricultural exports
(3.2 percent p.a. in real terms on average between 1981 and 1991) and reductions in food imports (an
average of 1.2 percent p.a. in real terms over the same period). In fact, food imports fell steadily
from a high of 17 percent of total imports in 1984 to 8.6 percent in 1991.
5.        Despite these achievements, challenges remain. For example, productivity in the
agricultural sector is well below what it could be: potential yields range up to more than 2.5 times



- 2 -
actual yields for many crops.' The ability of farmers to respond to changing economic circumsEarces
is weak due to limited information about technical options, lack of capital and poor access to support
services. An ability to adapt to world market conditions is essential as Morocco expands its
international role. The quality of the natural resource base is deteriorating: there is severe soil
erosion, degradation of the watersheds, depletion of the forest cover. overgrazing of the rangelands
and depletion of soils. Water resources are becoming scarce due to few incentives for conservation
and rational use, pollution and poor planning. Poverty is a national concern and is primarily a rural
issue. While there has been an enormous reduction in the percentage of the rural population that is
poor (32 percent in 1985 compared to only 18 percent in 1991), the share of the rural pool in the
total poor population has been increasing. One of the principal causes of rural poverty is lack .^,f
general infrastructure: electricity, roads, potable waier, hospitals and schools, and this is
compounded in isolated regions by a lack of agricultural infrastructuire such as farm-to-market roads,
flood protection works and irrigation facilities. While these challenges need to be addressed in the
near term, the current macroeconomic situation is such that budgetary resources are tight and are
likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. This has constrained the Government's ability to
directly address these problems through public intervention.
6.          In light of the current circumstances, the Government and the Bank have re-focused the
goals for the agricultural sector around four principal objectives which are fully consistent with the
six pillars described in the County Assistance Strategy (CAS): (i) increase sector efficiency. flexibilitv
and growth by raising sector productivity, expanding the ability of farmers to respond to changing
markets and reducing risk; (ii) assure en-ironmental protection by maintaining, protecting, and
developing the natural resource ibase; (iii) reduce Dovert, by expanding income generating
opportunities in rural areas and directly addressing specific pockets of intense pc ierty; and
(iv) redefine the role of the Goverrnent by increasirg reliance on the private sector and strengthening
public administration through greater accountability, decentralization and increased efficiency.
7.          The Goveriment aims to achieve these objectives by: (i) continuing to pursue the
adjustment program (deregulation and liberalization of domestic markets, further opening of external
trade regime); (ii) increasing private investment (further liberalization of the pricing framework,
provision of an adequate investment code and rural financial services, increased security of land
tenure); (iii) reducing and diversifying risks in the sector (greater use of improved crop varieties,
expansion of irrigation schemes and introduction of a calamity insurance scheme); (iv) enhancing
responsiveness to changing economic conditions (continued loosening of restrictions on cropping
paterns, greater access to services); (v) increasing incentives for more rational use of natural
resources (higher irrigation water charges, fees for use of communal lands); and finally (vi) more
carefully selecting public investments and improving the performance of current investments and
publicly-provided services. The Government is committed to these objectives and fully owns the
adjustment program, as demonstrated by its continued pursuit of the policy reform agenda in the
agricultural sector, even after closure of the Bank sector adjustment loans.
'These figures vary by crop: the ratio of potential to actual yield is 1.5 for irrigated wheat, 2.1 and 1.6 for rainfed soft- and durum-
wheat respectively, 2.4 for maize, 1.3 for sugar cane and sugar beet crops, 1.7-3.0 for milk, and 1.3-1.5 for meat. Of course,
maximizing financial or economic returns does not necessarily imply that technical yield should be maximized. Nonetheless, in the
Moroccan situation, it seems clear that there is scope to further increase yields under economic conditions.

C. Agricultural Sector Institutions
8.         -.1mistru of Agriculture and Agricultural Develcpment (MAMVA).2 The Ministry of
Agriculture is rt ;ponsible for agricultural development and policy in Morocco. It is the primary
agency in chard of executing the investment and recurrent budget for the sector. The Ministry was
reorganized in April 1993.3 Until then, it was divided into nine central directorates: Rural
Equipment (DER), Crop Production (DPV), Livestock (lDE), Extension and Agrarian Reform
(DVRA), Forestry and Soil Conservation (DEFCS), Plant Protectiotn (DPVCTRF), Agricultural
Education and Research (DEAR), Administrative Affairs (DAA) and P!,tnning and Economic Affairs
(DPAE). A tenth directorate. Land Surveying and Titling (DCFTT), fell under the Ministry of
Agriculture's supervision with its own separate budget.
9.         The reorganization made minor changes to this structure. In particular, the diroctorate of
Rural Equipment (DER) was replaced by a Administration of Rural E gineering (AGR) overseeing
three directorates: (i) irrigation Development and Management (DDGI); (ii) Hydro-Agricultural
Works (DAHA); and (iii) Land Improvement (DAF). The DVRA was abolished with extension
activities being transferred to the ex-DEAR (now renamed Education, Research and Development or
DERD) and agrarian reform efforts being taken over by the DAF. Two new directorates were also
created for a total of twelve: (i) Human Resources (DRH); and (ii) Public Enterprises and
Professional Organizations (DEPAAP). Finally, the DCFTT was renamed the Directorate of Land
Conservation, Cadastre and Mapping (DCFCC) with the same functions and status as it held prior to
the reorganization.
10.        Agricultural Research is carried out by several agencies in Morocco. The most important
is the National Instittute for Agricultural Research (INRA), which is the only institution in Morocco
where the activities are exclusively devoted to agricultural research. Other autonomous institutions
conduct agricultural research in support of their principal activities, including the Agricultural and
Veterinary Institute Hassan If (IAV) in Rabat and the National College of Agriculture (ENA) in
Meknes, both of which provide university level agricultural education. Although in principle
financially autonomous, all are supervised and primarily funded by the Ministry of Agriculture.
11.        The National Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA) is a financially autonomous,
Government-owned bank which provides most of the short-, medium- and long-term financing
extended to the agriculture sector. CNCA specializes in rural fiinance and its main priority involves
supporting credit/savings schemes aimed at promoting rural development.
12.        The Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) was creatted in 1986 under the ASAL I to
provide capital grants to stimulate selected private investments. The FDA is funded by the Ministry
of Agriculture's budget (DPV, DE, AGR/DAF, AGR/DDGI/DAHA with DPAE supervision), a
special treasury account (which receives earnings from variable levies on agricultural imports). and
foreign donors. All disbursements are channeled through the CNCA which is responsible for
administering the Fund. In general, FDA disbursements fall into two categories: (i) funds for
2IJUtil October, 1993, MAMVA was called the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA).
'The previous organization is important to understand since the appraisal was based on the former structure. The new directorees,
in particular DRH and DEPAAP, were not budgeted until 1994, and therefore no investments falling under their jurisdiction were
appraised.



- 4 -
"upstream" investments, primarily small-scale equipment purchased in large quantities (such as small
plows, threshers, harrows, etc); and (ii) funds for "downstream" investments, primarily larger items
in which FDA grants reimburse a share of the costs (such as irrigation equipment, field structures,
etc).
13.        Provincial Departments of Agriculture (PAs). At the regional level, the Mini ;try of
Agriculture operates through 35 Provincial Directorates ot Agriculture (DPA) which are responsible
for the execution of the agricultural programs in their respective provinces except for the areas
covered by the ORMVAs (see below), The DPAs are the regional extension of the Ministry of
Agriculture's central directorates and are organized into Services which essentially match the
directorates at the central level. Each DPA has services for rural engineering, crop production and
zricultural extension, forestry, livestock, statistics and administration. Funds for the operation of the
DPAs are allocated under the Ministry of Agriculture's budget to the central directorates which, in
turn, delegate the necessary tesources to their respective services in the 35 DPAs.
14.        Large-scale irrigation is the responsibility of nine Regional Agricultural Development
Authorities (ORMVAs), agencies with a separate legal identity and financial autonomy under AGR
supervision. The ORMVAs are responsible -ior all perimeters under large-scale irrigation or which
have the potential for such irrigation. They are also responsible for small-scale irrigation and for
rainfed agriculture within their respective geographical jurisdictions. The DPAs have no authority in
ORMVA areas.
15.        Extension Centers (CTs & CMVs). At the field level, Government services ii
agriculture are provided by extension centers comprising 121 CTs in the rainfed (DPA) areas and
156 CMVs in the irrigated (ORMVA) areas. The CTs are semi-autonomous public bodies funded by
Government budget allocations, managed by a board of directors, chaired by the Caid,4 and under
the day-to-day control of a director who is nominated by the Minister of Agriculture. Staff at these
centers provide extension services and assist with cooperative development and agricultural credit
operations. Since April 1993, extension services have fallen under the direct authority of the DERD
(before then the DVRA was responsible) and technical supervision is provided ,y staff of the DPAs'
crop production and extension service. The CMVs depend directly on the ORMVAs, and the DERD
has no authority over extension services in the ORMVA areas. Previously, both CTs and CMVs also
provided input supply and machinery hire services to farmers, but as part of the MTASAP these
services were discontinued and, for the most part, they have been taken up by the private sector.
16.        Other institutions operating in the agricultural sector include half a dozen state-owned
enterprises and the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), which plays an important role through its
administration of the rural municipalities and tribal collectives.
17.        With the exception of the field services, the Bank is satisfied with the institutions in the
sector. The Ministry of Agriculture is one of the more efficient ministries in the country. It is
generally capable of developing an investment budget that is consistent with sector objectives and
follows acceptable project selection criteria. The principal problems with budget execution identified
by the Agricultural Expenditure Review (AER, Report No. 8878-MOR, 1990) have been tackled

under the first agricultural sector investment loan or would be supported by the proposed Loan (see
para. 59). Regarding organization of field services, the Ministry of Agriculture remains overly
centralized with overlapping functions between the different levels of its field offices (DPAs and
CTs); and an overabundance of lower-level staff and lack of qualified personnel at the field level.
The proposed Loan would address this problem through support for a reorganization of the ministry
at the field level (see para. 78).
n1. Bapk Involvement in the A iltural Sector
Lending Program
18.       Bank Group lending to Morocco began in 1965. To date, 103 loans and credits have
been made totaling US$6,025 million. In agriculture, 29 loans and credits have been made totaling
US$1,771 million, or 29 percent of total lending. Twenty-two of these projects have been completed
and seven are currently being implemented (see Annex 1 for details on status). These include: two
agricultural sector adjustment loans (FY85 & FY87, boti completed) and an agricultural sector
investment loan (FY91); eight irrigation projects, Sidi Slimane (FY65), Sebou (FY70), Souss
Groundwater (FY75), Doukkala I (FY76), and II (FY77), Small & Medium Scale Irrigation I (FY83),
al completed, Small & Medium Scale Irrigation II (FY88), Large Scale Irrigation Improvement
Project I (FY86 completed) and 11 (FY93); seven agricultural credit projects (FY66, FY73, FY77,
FY79, FY84, FY86 all completed, and FY89), five rainfed agricultural development proiects: Meknes
(FY75), Loukkos (FY81), Fes-Karia-Tissa (FY79), Middle Atlas (FY82) and Oulmes Rommani
(PY83) all completed; an agro-industrial and flood control project, Sebou II (FY74 completed); a
-egetable and marketing project (FY80 completed). a foresty project (FY82 completed) and forestry
II (FY90); and an agricultural research and extension project (FY 89).
Projeci Performance of Sector Loans
19.       The first Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL I) was extended in support of the
first 18 months of the MTASAP (para. 3). The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) concluded
that the loan met its main targets and strengthened the agricultural reform process; all covenants were
complied with and the loan was disbursed fully, six months ahead of schedule. According to the
PPAR, the program's primary objective was the generation of fiscal savings through a reduction in
subsidies. The audit report states that budgetary outlays for agriculture were reduced by 25 percent
over two years (although some decrease was due to budget difficulties). The loan initiated the
agricultural reform process and provided the framework for designing the second phase of the reform
program (see paras. 24-31 for details). The ASAL-n continued the adjustment process started under
ASAL I and supported actions designed to: (a) liberalize the agricultural and food pricing, marketing
and trade regimes, (b) complete the restructuring of the public expenditure program and (c) continue
the streamlining of essential Government support services. There was remarkable progress under the
second Loan although, due to the large number and the complexity of the reforms, implementation of
some measures took longer than initially estiraated (see para. 25 for details).
20.       The sector adjustment process has been followed with support for the sector investment
program. The first Agricultural Sector lnvestment Loan (ASIL I) financed part of the Ministry of
'Yes refer to signing dae.



- 6 -
Agriculture's 1991-92 investment budget and supported important reforms of the budgetary process;
as well as several key subsector reforms, notably in the area of livestock services and irrigation water
charges. The project experienced initial difficulties with disbursements due to the need to train a
multitude of actors in Bank procurement procedures and disbursement reporting requirements but the
investments themselves have proceeded satisfactorily.
Project Performance of Traditional Investment Proiects
21.        Bank-financed investment projects in agriculture have largely been successful.
Performance of irrigation projects has been good and problems of land distribution and organizational
delays in construction and in procurement of irrigatior. equipment are being overcome. The PPAR
for the Sebou I Project stresses the project's success in institution building and in contributing to
increasing crop production. An Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Impact Evaluation Report
for Doukkala I and 11 projects concludes that the projects complemented the Government's objectives
of investing in large-scale irrigation to enhance domestic food production, boost export earnings and
expand rural employment opportunities. The PPAR of the Souss Groundwater Project emphasizes the
success of private land consolidation, public land distribution and the establishment of cooperatives,
but highlights the neglect of maintenance due to inadequate funding and staff. This problem has been
addressed by the Large-Scale Irrigation Improvement Project (LSII 1) which began a process of
making the LSI subsector more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable. The project has been
successful in rehabilitating infrastructure, increasing water charge collection rates and beginning the
transfer of commercial activities to the private sector.
22.       In the rainfed sector, the results of rainfed agricultural development projects have been
mixed. The first project (Meknes) experienced considerable delays due to land redistribution
problems, insufficient project preparation, optimistic implementation targets and management
inexperience. The following four projects, Fes-Karia-Tissa, Loukkos, Middle Atlas and Oulmes
Rommani, were designed to minimize such organizational and management problems. They were all
concluded satisfactorily except that the completion dates were considerably extended due to delays
arising from the general financial crisis which Morocco experienced in the 1980s.
23.       Technically the implementation of first forestry project, Gharb-Mamora, was successful
but it also suffered delays due to budgetary shortfalls arising from the financial crisis. The Forestry
II project is a sector-wide operation based on lessons and experiences from the first project and from
forestry components in the various rural development projects. It started successfully, although
reforestation efforts in 1991-92 were seriously limited due to severe droughts and this significantly
delayed disbursements under the loan. Performance under the six completed agricultural credit
project was good and the PPARs stress the contribution made to the country's agricultural
development by the successful expansion of credit to small farmers. Implementation of the
agricultural research and extension project is proceeding satisfactorily although disbursements have
been delayed by budget shortfalls and the time taken to effect certain institutional changes. The
PPAR of the agro-industrial and flood control project, Sebou II, notes that the project was successful
in introducing commercial sugarcane production and processing but stresses the vulnerability of
investments in commodities such as sugar which are subject to wide price fluctuations.

m. Agricultural Sector Adjustment Aenda Proaress and Pr srilie
A. Sector Adjustment
24.        During the MTASAP, the Government focused its attention primarily on identifying and
resolving sector policy issues. With the support of the Bank through ASAL I and II, considerable
progress was made. Morocco now has quite a favorable policy environment in the agricultural sector
to which farmers have responded remarkably well. This is demonstrated by the high growth rate in
agriculture since 1985 (para. 4) and the rapid increase in private investments (para. 33). This
performance is due in large measure to a number of successful policy reforms implemented over the
past several years.
25.        The ASAL I was accorded to help launch the first phase of the MTASAP. It focused on
the execution of studies and analysis needed to fully carry out the adjustment process and pported
initial adjustments in the prices and incentives framework, improvements in agricultural s pport
services and marketing, and increased efficiency in the operation of the price support program. The
second phase of the MTASAP was supported by the ASAL II. While implementation of the Loan
was difficult because it tackled reforms in some of the most politically sensitive subsectors (cereals,
oilseeds, sugar), considerable progress was made in a number of areas. The ASAL I has been
complemented by the agricultural component of the SAL IP which has extended reforms into several
new areas. With the support of these three loans, a substantial amount of the sector policy agenda
has been, or is in the process of being, completed. Specific actions are discussed below.
26.        Foreien Trade liberalization began under the ASAL I and was extended under the ASAL
11 with 386 of the 805 products subject to quantitative restrictions (List B) transferred to the list of
freely importable goods (List A). The SAL II supported passage of the 1992 Law on External Trade
which will completely eliminate quantitative restrictions on all goods (except a small negative list),
and reduce tariffs across the board to a maximum of 35 percent (and an import levy of up to 15
percent), except for tariffs on certain strategic agricultural commodities, by mid-1994. For these
latter, which include cereals, sugars, oilseeds, meat and milk, separate protection schemes apply for
each commodity. For cereals, the ASAL II accepted the introduction of a reference price system,
based on a five-year moving average of world prices plus a 25 percent protection level. A variable
levy has been assessed to cover the difference between actual import prices and the reference price.
While this system was endorsed by the Baank under the ASALs, a safeguard clause permits the
Government to maintain the reference prices in real terms, undermining the effectiveness of the
system.7 Under the recent GAIT agreements on agriculture reached at the Uruguay Round, the
whole reference price system will be converted to a system of tariff equivalents which would lead to
the elimination of the accompanying safeguard clause. The ASIL II would support the conversion to
tariff equivalents for cereals (see para. 58). For sugars and oilseeds, the SAL II accepted the
introduction of reference price/variable levy schemes generally similar to the existing one for cereals.
They are based on average international prices, although the periods for calculating the averages are
longer and the protection rates vary. The safeguard clause for these two commodities is acceptable (it

by August 1993.

However, prie. are significantly higher than they would be had the moving average formula strictly been applied.

essentially buffers potentially large movements in prices). This system will be converted to tariff
equivalents under the GATT agreement.8 For meat and milk, the SAL II has introduced a system of
tariff equivalents which took effect in October 1993. The Bank fully supports this conversion,
although the resulting absolute tariff rates are high and cause over-protection of the subsector and
distortions in relative prices within the sector. The GATT framework calls for reductions in these
levels over time.
27.         Domestic Marketing and Prices. Producer prices for most agricultural crops are now
freely determined. Domestic marketing and price formation for all grains and flour (except for bread
wheat which is subsidized at the consumer level) have been liberalized in practice, but restrictions on
trade in these commodities still exist officially. The Government has been unwilling to deregulate
bread wheat markets until the consumer subsidy on this commodity is eliminated. To this end, the
total quantity of subsidized flour has been reduced and targeted (via quality differentiation
mechanisms) to the most disadvantaged among the population. The ASIL II would support official
liberalization of the domestic marketing system for cereals. To complement its external trade
component of reform measures, the SAL II supported a process of eliminating restrictions on
domestic trade and administered pricing for oilseeds; as well as liberalization of sugar prices and
closure or privatization of several sugar factories. Under the ASALs, the Government introduced a
20 percent price differential for milk between the peak and lean seasons to better balance supplies
over the course of the year. Milk prices have now been completely liberalized. The SAL IX also
supported liberalization of meat prices.9
28.         Input Marketing. Subsidies on most agricultural inputs were eliminated under the ASALs
or are being phased out. Fertilizer subsidies previously constituted the heaviest burden on the
Government's budget, amounting to one third of agricultural investment expenditures in 1985. The
MTASAP called for a gradual reduction in these subsidies but the Government has gone much
further, completely freeing fertilizer prices and trade, thereby eliminating all subsidies on this input.
29.         Irrigation Water Charms. Morocco possesses a relatively strong legal framework for
recovering all operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and a share of investment costs for irrigation
water. Cost recovery, however, is imperfect due to operational, legal, and political constraints: the
overall recovery rate averaged 43 percent from 1969 to 1984.10 The ASAL I addressed these issues
by supporting a five-year program to gradually increase water charge recovery rates. As a condition
for the second tranche release, the ASAL I supported an increase in the water charge recovery rate to
about 55 to 60 percent of O&M for 1985. Achieving full O&M cost recovery through water charges
was a primary ofjective of LSII I and the overall O&M collection rate is estimated to have risen from
74 percent it, i;%41 to 79 percent in 1992.11 Under the LSI II, the level of water charges will be
further increased within the framework of the existing legislation so that a volumetric charge covers
the entire estimated O&M cost and a share of investment and depreciation costs.
'Under the GATr Agreemerit on Agriculture, tariff equivalents will be introduced in April 1995.
9These actions were not oonditions of tranche release but constitute part of the program being implemented under the Loan, even
though it has now been fully disbursed and closed.

undertaen in the context of the Moroccan Water Sector Review. This is expected to provile a more accurate reflection of the
economics of irrigtion.



- 9 -
30.         Livestock Services. Good progress has been made in the liberalization of this subsector.
A large part of animal health services, covering half of the cattle and one-third of the sheep, has now
been transferred to the private sector as have been artificial insemination services furnishing
70 percent of the total inseminations. The Government has also transferred natural breeding stations
covering 20 percent of the cattle population to the private sector. Some parts of the country,
however, remain untouched by these privatization efforts and the Government intends to pursue them
further in other zones. This liberalization process would be supported under the ASIL II (paras. 67-
68).
31.         Land Pol_cy. The lack of a comprehensive land policy has constituted an important
constraint to agricultural development and has resulted in an extreme fragmentation of holdings, a
lack of land titles, and poor management for certain judicial statutes, in collectively-owned lands in
rainfed areas (see para. 83). Large-scale irrigation areas are regulated through a set oi fairly
comprehensive legislative instruments. Under the ASAL I, land policy reforms aimed at extending
the legal framework already adopted in irrigated lands to rainfed areas in order to avoid further land
fragmentation and to facilitate farm restructuring and land transfers. Actions undertaken during the
ASi.L II period included preparation of: (i) a cadastral mapping and land registration and titling
program for 1988-92; and (ii) a program for economically and technically viable land consolidation
patterns. Three draft laws and a memorandum on the establishment of a Land Bank have recently
been prepared to improve the security of land tenure and facilitate land transactions.12 The proposed
loan would further support these efforts (see para. 83).
B. Agricultural Sector Investments
32.         One of the principal objectives of the overall adjustment program has been to reduce
fiscal deficits. As a consequence, Government expenditures, including investment budgets in all
ministries, have been limited. Actual public investment in agriculture (as channeled through the
Ministry of Agriculture) fell in real terms by an annual average of 3.2 percent between 1981-91.
While the SAL II classified the Ministry of Agriculture into the group of priority ministries for which
the investment budget was to be protected, other commitments on fiscal balances have made the
investment targes difficult to achieve. Moreover, total investment (public and private) in agriculture
has been estimated at about 11 percent of gross fixed capital formation, some 30 percent less than
agriculture's share in GDP (16 percent). This has created a challenge for the Govermment as it seeks
to address the weaknesses of the sector (as discussed in para. 5: environmental degradation, rural
poverty, the need for improved technical options, lack of infrastructure, etc.). The Government's
strategy to address this challenge includes: (i) creating the appropriate environment and incentives for
the private sector to assume responsibility for an increased share of the investment program in the
sector; and (ii) refocusing public investments toward those of the highest priority, with the best
justification for public intervention and those most supportive of private activities.
2Specifically: (a) the development of rainfed land (Loi relative aux zones de mise en valeur agricoles) the draft was approved by the
Conseil du Gouvemement in September 1991; (b) the control of land fragmentation (Los relaWve a la umiaon diu morceuement des
proprids agdcoles sitdes a Pfintideurdes prinmires d'irmgaon, des zones de mue en valeur agrcoles et des seaers de
remembremetm rural): the law is expected to be approved soon; and (c) the privatization of collective rainfed tand (Projetde hlo
reladlf a la melldsauon des terres coUectives en bour).



- 10-
33.          The private sector has demonstrated a considerable willingness to invest in agriculture:
growth in private investment between 1981-91 is estimated at some ten percent p.a. in real terms.
This has led to a healthy shift in the composition of public and private investments with the private
sector accounting for 27 percent of the total in 1981 and 70 percent in 1991". This is consistent
with the higher growth rate achieved in the sector (about eight percent p.a.) compared to about
4.5 percent p.a. for overall GDP during the same years. The Goverrtment's structural adjustment
programs and support of the CNCA are likely to have been contributory factors by providing the
necessary incentives and means for increased private sector participation. Nonetheless, there is a
clear need to complement private investment witli the essent;al infrastructure and other public good-
type services to ensure the productivity of private capital in the sector.
34.          The total investment program of the Ministry of Agriculture for 1994-97 is estimated at
DH9435 million (US$993 million) and is presented in Table I below. It is well-balanced across the
different subsectors of agriculture, including: agricultural education, livestock, crop production,
research, plant protection, land policy, rainfed land development, forestry, planning, administration,
human resources, and public enterprises.

PART IH. THE LOAN
I. Project Objectives and Rationale
A. Objectives
35.        As discussed in para. 6, the Government's sector objectives include: ti) increasing sector
efficiency, flexibility and growth; (ii) assuring environmental protection; (iii) reducing poverty; and
(iv) redefining the role of the Government. Although the sector objectives are clear, resource
constraints limit the options for public intervention to pursue them. The principal need in the sector
is to select investments that further these objectives, but at the same time, to focus them ilito carefully
chosen areas where public sector involvement is well-justified or where they can facilitate private
investments and private services. These investments need to be coupled with an action program that
also advances sector objectives begun under the ASALs and that is designed to make the investments
more productive. The principal objectives of the Loan are, therefore, (i) to provide a general
resource transfer to the agricultural sector in support of a well-conceived public investment program
by financing selected investments in the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture; and (ii) to support
deepening of complementary sector reforms, with emphasis on private operators.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
36.       A series of agriculture sector investment loans (ASILs) forms the backbone of the Bank's
agricultural lending program to Morocco, complemented by stand-alone projects where extra technical
assistance and/or project preparation/appraisal or supervision skills are particularly needed. Emphasis
on ASILs is a key feature of the sector assistance strategy for Moroccan agriculture."4 The
endorsement of ASILs as an important lending instrument is based on the detailed AER, undertaken in
1990, which found the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture to be generally satisfactory
and worthy of Bank support. This AER has been updated as part of the preparation for the proposed
ASIL II and would be updated again as subsequent ASILs are prepared. The Bank has unique
experience in undertaking expenditure reviews which it can bring to bear as a systematic part of the
ASIL process to help Morocco further develop, monitor, and evaluate its sector investment program.
37.       The proposed Loan, the second of the series, would allow the Government and the Bank
to build on efforts begun under the ASIL I, most notably by continuing to improve the investment
process, e.g., by streamlining budget execution and strengthening procedures for project appraisal and
project selection. ASILs further provide an instrument for the Govermnent to maintain an on-going
sector dialogue with the Bank and give it an opportunity to receive support for continuing policy
reforms, both of which are strongly valued by the Moroccan Government. The ASIL II would permit
a deepening of the policy agenda, begun under the ASALs, into specific, priority sub-sector issues
that were not addressed under the more sector-level adjustment loans. Finally, the ASILs provide
?unding for small, scattered, but important investments that would not otherwise benefit from external
financing. In Morocco, this is particularly crucial with regard to investments in the rainfed subsector
where the poorest in rural areas tend to be found. The ASIL II would provide a vehicle for such
investments, with particular emphasis on small-scale farmers.

11. Project Description
38.        The overall project would encompass the entire agricultural investment program of the
Ministry of Agriculture for four years. 1994-97. It would be comprised of two components: an
investment program and an action program. The investment component would fund selected items in
the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture for those years. The action program would be comprised of
a series of reforms designed to improve the efficiency of selected investments or operations in the
sector.
39.        As discussed in para. 8, the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture is executed
by its twelve central directorates plus the DCFCC and INRA. Each of these directorates is
responsible for carrying out reforms related to its respective subsector. The proposed Loan would
finance investments in most subsectors" and would also support an action program linked to those
investments in each subsector. This global approach is necessary to achieve project objectives, not
only to assure even progress across the entire agricultural sector, but also because it is the principal
way to involve the diverse array of actors and operations of the Ministry of Agriculture in the new
approaches that the ASIL II brings to investment selection (para. 40), environmental assessment
(para. 87) and reforms in the investment process (paras. 59-63).
A. The lnvest-ment Program
40.        Investment items to be financed under the proposed Loan are presented in Table 2 below
and were selected according to the following procedures. First, they were screened to ensure that
they were: (i) consistent with pursuit of sector and subsector objectives; and (ii) not already financed
by other donors or the Bank. Second, a more detailed evaluation was then made using project
summaries prepared by the Govermment to ensure that investments conformed to accepted project
selection criteria. These project summaries have been developed for all of the investments in the
budget of the Ministry of Agriculture. They group individual budget line items into "projects" or
"programs" as the units for analysis. They present information on economic rates of return where
calculable and available, social impact (e.g., effect on employment, or on the poor), environmental
benefits, as well as a justification for public intervention. Since it is not always possible, nor
practical, to undertake a rigorous quantitative assessment of these impacts, the project summaries
often provide a qualitative judgement or assign ratings to the impacts according to a "high-medium-
low" classification system. For all large projects (those larger than DH50 million) a formal economic
analysis is prepared. Projects in this category with "high" economic"6, social or environmental rates
of return and sound justification for public intervention were then selected for financing under the
Loan.
41.        Since some subsectors already benefit substantially from external financing while others
do not, the level of investment eligible for consideration under the Loan varies considerably from one
subsector to another. As a result, the distribution of proposed financing under the Loan differs from
the distribution of overall investments in the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture. Moreover, for
these same reasons, the proposed Loan distribution does not reflect relative priorities accorded to the
different subsectors, nor the relative quality of investments across subsectors.

42.          The subsector investment programs and the items to be financed by the Loan are
described by subsector in paras. 43-53 below. Investments by subsector are listed in the
accompanying tables and by specific line item in Annex 2.
Livestock (DE)
43.          The Govermnen.'s priorities for the livestock subsector include improvements in:
(i) animal health; (ii) rangelands; (iii) local fodder supply; and (iv) genetic quality of cattle and sheep.
The 1994 investment budget for livestock (6 percent of the total) allocates approximately 37 percent
to animal health, of which most goes for large-scale vaccination campaigns. Genetic improvement
receives around 20 percent; animal nutrition and range management get around seven percent.
Roughly one-third of the budget is allocated to the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) project which supports similar categories in the eastern provinces. The ASIL II would
finance certain expenditures in each of these priority investment programs, including: (i) inputs for
the vaccination campaigns of contagious diseases and laboratory equipment for the animal health
program; (ii) demonstration materials for the animal nutrition program and range rehabilitation works;
(iii) field structures, equipment and materials for genetic improvement; and (iv) improvements in
rangeland management. Both the vaccination programs and genetic improvement services are
progressively being privatized and the Loan would make continued financing of these activities
conditional on implementation of certain privatization reforms (see paras. 67-68).

Agricultural Education and Training (formerly DEAR. now DERD)
44.          Education and training in the sector is carried out by numerous agricultural training and
research institutes. In the past, they mainly trained students for employment in the civil service. The
continuing transfer of responsibilities away from the public sector means that the Government must
reorient the education and training system to meet the needs of private sector employers, which are
considerably different than those of the Government. The investment program in agricultural
education is now focused on: (i) an employment "bobservatory" which identifies skills needs of private
employers in the sector (see para. 72); (ii) professional training programs to transfer these skills to
students; (iii) new programs to train students to become farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs
themselves; and (iv) new programs to train existing farmers and laborers in modern technologies.
Investments in agricultural education (five percent of the total) are concentrated in equipment to
expand training and educational facilities at, and acquire materials for, the forestry school, the
training centers, the agricultural schools and research at the level of the institutes of higher education
(technical and agricultural). The Bank has never been involved in this subsector and these
investments have not benefitted from any other external financing. The change in focus of the
program and the innovative approaches being applied make it now worthy of Bank support. Thus,
the ASIL II would finance investments in these same areas, with a focus on construction of
classrooms, laboratories and acquisition of technical and pedagogical equipment.

Rainfed Land Development (formerly DCFTT and parts of DPV and DVRA: now DCFCC. DAF and
parts of DPV)
45.           The Government's priorities for land development involve consolidation and restructuring
(to improve the efficiency of investments and to gain economies of -- !e in production), and destoning
(whereby heavy rocks and stones are brought to the surface by contractors financed by the Ministry of
Agriculture and removed manually by farmers). Destoning operations are gradvally being privatized:
new legislation was prepared in 1993 to extend the berefits of the FDA  (para. 64) to these activities
so as to encourage private investment in this area. The Government is also responsible for cadastral
services and topographical surveys for land transfers in land restructuring and consolidation schemes.
The ASIL II would finance land improvements (destoning, construction of access roads for newly
consolidated plots), studies associated with land consolidation, and topographical services, including
computer equipment and mapping.

provision of infrastructure and related activities in support of crop production (mostly promotion of
improved technology) and on area development projects. These latter are primarily oriented toward
land reclamation and development, range development, construction of roads and other infrastructure,
primarily in rainfed areas. The ASIL 11 would finance studies, technology promotion (e.g., early
vegetable promotion in the coastal zone, distribution of disease tolerant date palms and planting
materials for demonstration); as well as continuing actions to promote rainfed agriculture in areas
previously financed by the Bank and in selected irrigated areas (e.g., land conservation).

Aaricultural Research (INRA)
47.          Agricultural research is carried out at several institutes, funded through the budget of the
Ministry of Agriculture, but the INRA is the most important and the only one whose budget is
devoted entirely to research. The investment budget for INRA (three percent of the total Ministry of
Agriculture budget) finances 19 research programs of which the top five priorities were selected for
financing under the Bank's on-going Research and Extension Project (R&E, see para. 23). This
project will be extended and is expected to close in 1996. Because of the significant level of
financing already provided to INRA by this project, the ASIL II would not fund any additional
investments in this area.
Plant Protection (DPVCTRF)
48.          The Government provides plant protection services on state-owned lands primarily to
combat forest pests and pest populations that are frequently shifting or where reliance on private
operations is not satisfactory due to externalities or other causes. The Government is currently
seeking to increase farmer participation in the pest control process to improve forecasts of pest attacks
and assist farmers in detecting and identifying pests responsible for crop damage. At present, the
investment budget in this area (two percent of the total) is allocated to: (i) rodent and bird control;
(ii) forest pest control; (iii) construction of infrastructure; (iv) plant protection; (v) seed control; and
(vi) prevention of fraud (in all areas of the agricultural sector). T'he ASIL II would finance primarily
the construction of field structures (workshops, storage sheds, rural inspection stations), technical
equipment (sprayers, trucks, pumps), improved labeling and packaging of chemical products,
technical literature and training on treatment of migrating pests.

Forestry and Soil Conservation (DEFCS)
49.          Virtually all of Morocco's forests are state-owned. Priorities in the sector include:
(i) protecting and conserving natural forests by adopting measures to prevent deforestation, soil
erosion and desertification; (ii) maintaining the forest cover through demarcatior. of the forest estate,
justifying the use of forest resources on the basis of economic rationale, and regenerating the natural
forest and plantation establishment; and (iii) strengthening forest management. The Government's
budget in this area (nine percent of the total) finances the demarcation and regeneration of natural
forest, plantation establishment and watershed management. Roughly three-quarters of the budget is
financed by the Bank and the AfDB under two separate Loans. As a result, the role of the ASIL II
would be extremely limited. Nonetheless, as the Government's efforts to protect the forest have
expanded with the support of these forestry projects, several additional important investment needs
have been identified: principally construction of fire prevention structures and acquisition of
communications devices for forest guards. These would be financed by the ASIL II.

Large-scale Irrigation (ORMVAs and AGR. formerly DER)
50.          Roughly 40 percent of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture goes to the
nine Regional Agricultural Development Authorities (ORMVAs) which are responsible for building,
operating and maintaining the large-scale irrigation systems. The ORMVAs operate on a regional
basis and are also responsible for the limited amounts of small- and medium-scale irrigation and
rainfed crop production that fall within their jurisdictions. These secondary activities account for only



18 -
nine percent of the ORMVAs' budget."' The remainder covers rehabilitation and expansion of
large-scale irrigated areas. Approximately half of the funds are allocated to the construction ot
irrigated perimeters, canals, pumping stations, roads and other infrastructure. Most of the rest is
dedicated to the rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigated areas. Around ten percent is
allocated to auxiliary investments such as the construction of buildings and investments in crop and
livestock production. The recently announced National Irrigation Program (PNI) envisages an
expansion of irrigation by some 250,000 hectares (representing a 48 percent expansion of thte l't.d
under large-scale irrigation) and the rehabilitation of around 200,000 hectares by the year 2000. This
PNI is likely to have an impact on the level of funds allocated to the ORMVAs and the distribution of
the Ministry of Agriculture's investment budget across subsectors, but this ilmpact is not yet clear.
For a num1ber of reasons (the Bank has given significant support to the large-scale irrigation subsector
in the past, including a second large-scale irrigation improvement project (LSII II) and a major review
of water use is in progress), the ASIL 11 would not fund any additional investments in this area.
Small- and Medium-scale Irrigation (AGR/DDGI/DAHA. formerly DER)
51.         Small- and medium-scale irrigation (SMSI) is primarily the responsibility of the
Administration of Rural Engineering (AGRIDDGI/DAHA), although some is undertaken by the
ORMVAs. The AGR/DDGI/DAHA provides services for small- and medium-scale engineering and
rural works. Since the 1980s it has given increasing attention to improvement of existing works.
The PNI calls for rehabilitation of 138,000 hectares by 2000. The budget of AGRIDDGI/DAHA for
SMSI is allocated to: (i) SMSI feasibility studies and contracts for control of works; (ii) investments
in SMST works; and (iii) emergency maintenance of SMSI schemes. Some 60 percent of the budget
of AGRIDDGI/DAHA is financed by the Bank/KfW SMSI II Project. Accordingly, ASIL II support
would be lestricted to financina feasibility studies, some public works and very minor flood repair.

Planning (DPAE)
52.         Planning and Economic Affairs are the responsibility of a single directorate within the
Ministry of Agriculture. The role of this directorate is to: (i) carry out analysis on agricultural
pricing and marketing policies; (ii) review and adjust incentives for private investment; (iii) ensure
that the public investment and expenditure programs of the Ministry of Agriculture conform to
formally established selection criteria; (iv) develop sector strategy; (v) monitor and evaluate projects
and programs; and (vi) collect survey and agricultural census data for the sector. The investment

budget for these purposes (one percent of the total) is primarily focused on studies and consists of:
consultants, technical materials and equipment, vehicles and travel costs associated with studies. The
ASIL 11 would finance consultants for several specific agro-economic studies and for program and
project evaluation. It would also fund a small amount of technical equipment for the agricultural
census.

Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)
53.          The Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) was created under the ASAL I and provides
direct grants which partially finance private investments (up to 40 percent) in the agricultural sector
(particularly on small- and medium-scale farms). Within the FDA budget, some 40 percent goes for
land improvements (conservation, destoning, destumping) and irrigation improvements (equipping and
electrifying small wells, improved drainage, water-saving devices, etc.); roughly 31 percent for seed
production and transport; 19 percent for small-scale farm equipment; four percent for livestock
intensification; three percent for phyto-sanitary protection; and two percent for plants and fruit-tree
seedlings." Recently the Government has eliminated subsidies for the use of consumable inputs
from the program (HYV seed and fertilizers). The effectiveness of the FDA was the subject of a
major study under the ASIL I. The study recommended several reforms *n the program which would
be implemented under the action program of the ASIL II (see para. 64). While these reforms are
being implemented, ASIL II support in this area would be capped at 35 percent of the total loan
amount (see para. 66).

B. The Action PrQgram
54.       The Action Program supported by the Loan is designed to further promote sector
objectives and to improve the efficiency of subsector investments. This program by and large
addresses the current policy issues in the sector. Other important policy questions are currently being
treated by other operations. For example, issues of water use and water pricing fall under the LSII II
and under the on-going water sector review (to be followed with a proposed Water Sector Investment
Loan); issues of natural resource management fall under the Forestry II project and a Japanese grant
studying watershed management (with a proposed follow-up loan); external trade questions on oilseeds
and sugar and other agro-industrial issues are being treated by the SAL If and will be further pursued
unde. the proposed Private Sector Develonrnent/Agro-Industry Loan; and pockets of severe rural
poverty will be addressed directly under the proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation Project. The
proposed ASIL II is expected to complement, but not overlap with, these other efforts. In many
areas, the specific reforms supported by the Loan are part of a medium- to long-term process that the
Loan would further; it is not expected to complete the entire policy agenda.
55.       The Action Program under the ASIL II consists of a Development Action Plan submitted
by the Government to the Bank and complemented by a matrix of concrete actions and studies and a
timetable for their implementation (see Annex 3). This Development Action Plan was has now been
signed. The program is fully consistent with the six pillars of the CAS with a focus on liberalization
(consolidation of the adjustment program), private sector development and improved public sector
management. The Action Program for each subsector constitutes a coherent program for the
subsector focused on elements of the agenda that should be addressed in the near term. The program
by subsector is described in paras. 57-83 below and the actions are described according to the CAS
framework in Annex 4.
56.       Five priority actions from the Action Program have been identified. First, a set of
improvements to the budget execution process have already been made (paras. 59-63). Second, the
Loan would support a series of measures to liberalize internal trade, including: (i) obtaining approval
by the Council of Government on mechanisms for the deregulation of the domestic marketing system
for cereals (except bread wheat), as a condition of effectiveness (para. 57); and (ii) submitting to
Parliament a draft law for this deregulation by December 31, 1995. Third, the Loan would specify
establishing an official environmental screening unit (para. 87) as a condition of effectiveness.
Fourth, the Loan would support improvements to the FDA program, including issuing a regulation to
permit the private sector to make certain investments (as a condition of effectiveness) (paras. 64-66).
Finally, the Loan would support a number of steps to liberalize external trade, including
(i) introducing tariff equivalents less than or equal to the tariffs proposed under the GATT agreement
for all cereals by April 1, 1995 (para. 58); (ii) putting in place tariff equivalents less than or equal to
90 percent of those proposed for 1995 under the GATT agreement for all cereals by April 1, 1996
and for subsequent years (para. 58); and (iii) ensuring that these tariffs remain fixed except under
certain circumstances (para. 58). The remaining actions supported by the proposed Loan would
constitute an overall program which the Government has committed to carrying out. Progress on the
program would be assessed during annual reviews (see para. 104) and future commitments under the
Loan would be subject to satisfactory implementation of the action program. Funding for subsequent
years would not be allocated to directorates that have not adequately executed their programs, even if
overall progress on the action program is deemed satisfactory.

Liberalization of Internal and External Trade
57.       Internal trade. As discussed in paras. 24-31, the Government began the process of
deregulating domestic markets under the ASALs in the mid-1980s and has made significant gains
since that time. In parallel to its program of external trade reforms, the SAL 11 initiated a prograrn to
deregulate the meat, milk, sugar and oilseeds markets. Despite this progress, cereals markets remain
controlled. The ASIL II would support reforms to reduce regulation in the cereals subsector
including elimination of. (i) trader licensing requirements; (ii) fixed margins for storage, handling and
transport; and (iii) restrictions against certain types of grain procurement by millers and other agents.
Approval by the Council of Government for the deregulation of cereals markets (except for bread
wheat) would be obtained by loan effectiveness. The Loan would also support submission to
Parliament of a draft law fo; this deregulation by the end of 1995.
58.       External trade. As for domestic market deregulation, liberalization of the external trade
regime began under the ASALs and progress has been good. As discussed in para. 26, the SAL 11
supported an important program to introduce tariff equivalents on meat and milk and to introduce a
system of reference prices, based on a moving average of world prices, for sugar and oilseeds. These
reference prices will be converted to tariff equivalents as part of the GATT process. The proposed
Private Sector Development Loan, which focuses on agro-industries, would seek to reduce the tariff
protection levels afforded to these latter industrial crops over time (see para. 26). The ASIL 11 would
suDort continued progress in implementation of the trade regimes for cereals. First, tariff
equivalents would be introduced on all cereals by April 1, 1995. These tariff equivalents would be
less than or equal to their maximum levels allowed under GAIT. Second, after April 1, 1996, and
for subsequent years, these tariff equivalents would not exceed 90 percent of the maximum level
allowed under GATT for 1995. Third, these tariffs would generally be fixed for each marketing year
(to prevent them from being used as variable levies) and would only be altered under specific
circumstances: (i) dumping; (ii) major fluctuations in the exchange rate; and (iii) substantial
reductions in international prices. All adjustments to tariffs will be communicated and justified to the
Bank. Tariff levels would be an important element of discussion during tae annual reviews.
Budget Execsution
59.       Difficulties in efficient execution of the budget process were identified under the AER as
a critical constraint to implementation of the investment program of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Reforms in the budget process were an important focus of the ASIL I, and good progress has been
made in this area. Most notably, the delegation and expenditure of funds have been accelerated
through new budgetary procedures, a very important step to ensure that available funds can be used
during the year. In 1993, 95 percent of delegations were made during the first quarter, whereas in
1987 and 1988, almost half of the total were not made until the fourth quarter (45 percent and
52 percent respectively). Also, the Ministry of Agriculture has improved its monitoring of the budget
using a new computerized system installed with the support of ASIL I and now generating useful
information for decision makers about the status of commitments and expenditures in a timely
manner. Finally, the Government has undertaken a major study identifying institutional constraints to
efficient procurement, and commitment and expenditure of funds. The study identifies Government
actions that could alleviate these constraints and further improve the budgetary process. The Ministry
of Agriculture has already taken certain steps based on the recommendations from this study and the
ASIL II would support implementation of additional measures, a number of which have already been
undertaken. These are discussed in paras. 60-63 below.



- .v,-
60.       Improvements in document preparation. The budget study found that there were quasi-
systematic mistakes in the preparation of budget documents and a lack of respect for procedures
regarding attachment of supporting information, both of which led to rejections by the Comptroller of
Commitments and Expenditures (CED) and the General Treasury (TG) and, ultimately, delays in
budget execution. The budget study has identified the most common mistakes and the type of
information (e.g., guides) that would help budget-execution agents in preparing their documents.
Also, standardized bidding documents were prepared and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Bank under ASIL 1. The DPAE alreadv prepared and introduced a Guide for establishing budget
documents. T he ASIL It would also support establishment of a guide for bidding documents for the
entire Ministry by: December 31. 1915.
61.        Improvements in monitoring and management of budget process. The budget study found
that top managers in the Ministry of Agriculture did not receive information about delays in budget
execution, nor reasons for those delays. As a result, they were unable to implement appropriate
remedies. "Contract monitoring sheets" have already been prepared and introduced in all of the
Ministry of Agriculture's services.
62.        Improvements in capacity of staff responsible for budget execution. The budget study
found that a key problem in the preparation of budget documents was that staff were not properly
trained and did not understand the underlying purpose of their work. A target group has already been
defined for training in budget execution and a training program was prepared. The ASIL II would
also support (i) implementation of the program for at least two staff members in each of the Ministry
of Agriculture's services by the end of 1994; and (ii) extension of the program to the Ministry's
detached services and continuation of regular training for new staff by the end of 1995.
63.        keductions in errors in preparation of contracts. greater consistency between different
services of the Ministry of Agriculture. and better flows of information. The budget study found that
most of the Ministry of Agriculture's services have no computer support and work is done manually.
As a result, performance is poor. Under ASIL 1, a computerized system was introduced in the DPAE
to manage delegation of credits with great success. Under the ASIL 11, the Ministry of Agriculture
would introduce a permanent computerized monitoring system of contracts and expenditures within
the DPAE before the end of 1994 and extend the system to the central directorates of the Ministry of
Agriculture by the end of 1995.
Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)
64.        As discussed in para. 53, the FDA was established under the ASAL I to stimulate
agricultural growth through private investment in economically viable activities and in new
technology. Investments under the program were financed by the ASIL 1. The FDA has four
principal, complementary objectives: (i) introducing technologies that are not widespread in the
country; (ii) promoting investments that generate positive externalities (e.g., soil conservation, water-
saving devices); (iii) providing a transitional means for the Government to reduce its budgetary share
of investments from '10% to up to 40 percent (before completely privatizing them); and
(iv) transferring income to the poorest farmers. Funds are self-targeted to the poor through the
choice of equipment and services eligible for financing. For example, most of the equipment
available is relatively small-scale (hand-held threshers, sickles, seeders, etc.) and not in demand by
large-scale farmers.



- 23 -
65.        The effectiveness of the FDA in terms of increased productivity, technology transfer and
equity was the subject of a major study supported by the ASIL 1. The study demonstrated that the
program did indeed (i) stimulate additional investment at the margin: (ii) induce the adoption of
"new" technology; (iii) finance numerous investments with positive externalities; and (iv) channel
many of the investments more than proportionately towards small farmers. Nonetheless, the self-
targeting for many of the components financed was not as effective as it should be for the program to
truly meet its equity objective, and a considerable amount of "established" technology was also
financed. Moreover, legislation in some areas still gives the Government entire responsibility for
certain investments.
66.       The Loan would supprt a limitation of investments financed by the FDA under the
program to those specifically furthering one of the four objectives listed in para. 64. To this end, the
ASIL II would support several reforms in the FDA program. First, a permanent monitoring system
of FDA investments would be established to ensure that they do, in fact, meet these objectives.
Second, to improve the targeting of the program and to reduce financing of truly established
technology, ceilings would be imposed limiting the number or amount of each type of investment that
an individual could obtain with FDA grants for agreed items (e.g., one unit of equipment per farm).
These ceilings would be introduced for those grants considered to further investments in new
technologies (para. 64) as they would prevent farmers from obtaining repeat financing for the same
investments (i.e., established technology). The ceilings would serve an additional purpose in that they
would direct a higher share of program funds towards small farrmers and permit a larger number of
farmers to benefit from the program. Finally, the Loan would support a modification of the legal
framework that currently gives the Govermnent the entire responsibility for financing milk collection
centers. This reform would permit the private sector to benefit from FDA financing for the purpose
of such investments and would begin the process of reducing the Government's financial commitment
in this area.
Livestock
67.       Animal Health. The Government seeks to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the
animal health system. Considerable progress has been made under the ASALs and the ASIL 1, but
private services still cover less than 50 percent of the livestock population and Government services
are limited by competing demands on the livestock budget. The Government's medium-term
objective is to promote private sector participation in the supply and funding of animal health
services. The privatization program started in 1985 and currently 114 private veterinarians (25
percent of the total) are practicing, covering 48 percent of the cattle and 36 percent of the sheep
populations. The ASIL H would support an increase in the number of these private veterinarians to
140 by 1995, covering 60 percent of cattle and 45 percent sheep. The Government intends to
continue supervising the control of epizootic diseases, but seeks to increase the financial participation
of beneficiaries in overall disease control. The ASIL II would also support preparation of a detailed
action plan on producer group participation and on increasing the level of cost recovery in overall
disease control.
68.        Genetic Improvement. As for animal health, tlie Government is aiming to improve the
quality and efficiency of the genetic improvement system for dairy cattle. The present system is still
heavily dominated by the public sector and burdened with cumbersome and lengthy administrative
procedures. This is due to the fact that certain activities are still dominated by the public sector (e.g.,
dairy controls). Under ASIL I, the Government started to transfer artificial insemination (Al)



- 24 -
activities and bull stations to the private sector. By the end of 1992, 13 cooperatives had taken over
partial responsibility for Al, covering 70 percent of inseminations. Also 46 bull stations (covering 20
percent of the cattle population) had been transferred to the private sector. The ASIL II would
support a full transfer of the responsibility for all Al and bull stations to private cattle breeders
associations. For associations established before January 1, 1995, this transfer would take place after
they dad been in existence for five years, and for those established after that date. the transfer would
occur after four years. The ASIL Il would also support a reduction in overall public expenditures on
Al to 25 percent of total costs for those Al stations transferred to private cattle breeders associations.
Finally, the Loan would support transfer of the responsibility for herd books to the cattle breeders
associations.
69.       Animal Feed. The Government seeks to raise the efficiency of animal production, but
the current quality of concentrate livestock feed is unreliable, and quality control needs to be
improved. However, existing quality control norms were issued in 1948 and need to be updated,
among other things, to reflect the requirements of a modern poultry industry. New standards have
been proposed by the Livestock Directorate. The ASIL II would support the presentation of texts
establishing these quality norms to the Council of Government by the end of 1995.
70.        Prices and Transf on. In keeping with the mandate of the sector adjustment
program, the Ministry of Agriculture seeks to improve its understanding of comparative advantage in
different production systems so as to improve resource allocation. Lack of data about economic
efficiency and comparative costs of different livestock systems hampers DE decision-making for
policy interventions. The ASIL II would support execution of a study to evaluate the economic
efficiency of different livestock systems.
71.       Maintenance and Improvement of Pastoral Resources. The maintenance and
improvement of the Moroccan rangelands are jeopardized by poor management an unclear defmition
of user rights on collective land. the Ministry of Agriculture aims to improve the situation by
emphasizing the management of the ranges through demarcation of special action zones and through
increased participation of pastoral groups in the management of the ranges. The ASIL II would
support development of a strategy that would: (i) put more emphasis the definition and allocation of
user rights, using the traditional socio-territorial organization as the basis; (ii) increase the financial
participation of the producers in maintaining investments in infrastructure and range improvements;
and (iii) channel investment into proven improvement in range management techniques exclusively
through producer organizations.
Agricultural Education and Training
72.       As discussed in para. 44, the continued liberalization and privatization of the Moroccan
economy has shifted the demand for graduates from the public sector to the private sector, requiring a
major change in educational needs. Moreover, the existing agricultural educational system does not
adequately reach the rural population who also have training needs. With the help of the FAO, the
Ministry of Agriculture has begun an innovative overhaul of its educational system to train students in
skills needed by the private sector. One of the unique features of this program is the attempt to
match the output of the training/education system with the needs of private employers in agriculture
through the implementation and use of an employment "observatory" and an employment exchange.
The observatory generates information about the demand for skills in the agricultural sector and the
exchange serves to match new graduates with employment opportunities. Finally, the program is



- 25 -
improving the links between education and job placement for graduates by re-orienting programs
toward training farm managers and managers of farm enterprises in the private sector. The ASIL. I
would support (i) implementation of training sessions for trainers of agricultural employers and
workers; (ii) institutional improvements (e.g., permanent establishment of units, or celtules, involved
in program which would be made Departments); (iii) introduction of training programs for farm
managers based on results from the observ.aiory; and (iv) ratification of a strategy for the higher
education system (IAV, ENAM and ENFI) that would reflect the structural changes taking place in
the economy.
Forestry and Soil Conservation
73.         The steady deterioration of the environment and the resource base (para. 5) has made
action in this area imperative. The Bank's Forestry 1f project supports some key reforms in this area,
including inter alia: (i) greater incentives for the private sector to establish forest plantations; (ii) a
more efficient price structure for wood pulp; and (iii) better planning for natural resource
management. The ASIL 11 would suppo.t reforms to make further improvements in the incentive
structure for the rational use of forest resources; and to raise revenue to manage and protect the
forests. The first reform would ensure that those who benefit financially from the harvest of forest
products pay the costs of managing and protecting the forests. According to a 1976 law, the revenues
from sales of forest products go to the local commnunities. As the law is currently applied, they
receive gross revenues while the costs of protection and management are supported by the
Government. This gives communities incentive to maximize exploitation of resources while costs of
replanting are borne by the Government. The ASIL II would support inter-ministerial discussions
between MAMVA and the Ministry of the Interior to consider the possibility of granting local
communities only the net revenues from the sales cf forest products (gross revenues less appropriate
costs).
74.        The second reform supported by the ASIL If would levy a fee on users of forest pastures
to reduce overgrazing that impedes natural regeneration of the forests. A 1917 law requires user fees
for surplus animal grazing (above household domestic needs) but this law is not enforced and inflation
has eroded the adequacy of tariff levels. Several pilot projects in Morocco have implemented
successful pasture management programs based on a user fee system. Under the ASIL II, the
Government would develop a proposal to make the user fee system applicable and would propose a
new level of fees. The Government would also prepare a necessary decree to amend the existing law
and would submit this decree to the SGG.
Small- and Medium-Scale Irrigation
75.        With the support of the Bank's Second Small- and Medium-Scale Irrigation Project
(SMSI II), the Government is striving to increase the efficiency of its investments in SMSI. To this
end, it is improving its investment programming and attempting to increase the financial participation
of beneficiaries. While all investments made under the SMSI II project are made according to
economic, social and environmental criteria established under the project, the ASIL II would support
systematic application of these same criteria to all rehabilitation projects in the Government's portfolio
(not just those under SMSI II). The ASIL II would also support the creation of water user
associations (WUA) in all perimeters selected for rehabilitation. These WUA would assume
responsibility for maintenance and contribute financially to investment costs in those schemes.



- 26 -
Plant Protection
76.        The Ministry of Agriculture's crop protection services are generally perceived as being
quite effective and well organized. Nonetheless, there are two areas where action is needed. The
first and most important involves eliminating the threat to local populations and the general
environment of pesticide contamination. Large quantities of outdated or banned chemicals and
poisonous baits are stored throughout the country under poor storage conditions. Several studies have
been undertaken by foreign consultants to evaluate the situation. The ASIL 11 would support
preparation of an action plan based on a compilation study to address the problem of pesticide storage
and initial steps to implement the plan.
77.        Second, the Government also seeks to increase the efficiency of crop protection services
through decentralization of operations. Currently, equipment and vehicles for plant protection are
stored only in Saie. This centralization leads to long delays in response time to urgent needs, as well
as high costs of mobilization. The Ministry of Agriculture has already developed a decentralization
program to disperse equipment to regional centers throughout the country. The ASIL II would
support implementation of the program.
Extension
78.        With the support of the Research and Extension Project from the Bank, the Government
has introduced an improved extension system on a pilot basis in a limited area. The Government now
has an ambitious program to extend this system to additional zones and to introduce a number of
related reforms, including: (i) completing the transfer of non-extension activities from extension
agents to the private sector (such as input supply); (ii) improving the quality of field staff;
(iii) strengthening the role of the subject matter specialists in each DPA/ORMVA; (iv) intensifying
and diversifying extension activities; and (v) establishing a monitoring and evaluation system.
Widespread application of the new system, however, is hampered most importantly by the inefficient
organization of the Ministry of Agriculture's field services which have a surplus of low level staff and
a lack of skilled staff; and by the lack of a technical career stream in the civil service that would
attract qualified personnel. The ASIL II would support the development of a plan and issuance of a
regulation for the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture's field services.
Crop Production and Infrastructure
79.       There are two key constraints to improving the returns to crop production: poor quality
of inputs and poor access to markets (primarily from a lack of farm-to-market roads). The poor
inputs are due, in large part, to the absence of quality standards and a monitoring system for input
quality. Standards for farm chemicals and equipment need to be defined and a monitoring system
established. The ASIL 11 would support execution of a study by the end of 1995 that would
determine what kind of regulation and standardization is necessary for fertilizers as a first step to its
implementation.
80.       The lack of appropriate farm-to-market roads can be attributed to several causes,
including priorities in the Ministry of Public Works' (MOPW) road programs that differ from the
Ministry of Agriculture's, and insufficient funding at the local level for road maintenance. Of
primary importance is the need to integrate farm-to-market road needs for agriculture into the national
road program executed by the MOPW (an inventory has already been made by the Ministry of



- 27 -
Agriculture). Therefore, the ASIL II would support the preparation of plans for a rolling five-year
road program and financing plan on farm-to-market roads, in collaboration with the MOPW and the
local communities.
Research
81.       The Bank and the Government agree on priorities in crop and livestock research which
are supported by the on-going Research and Extension Project. The two key constraints to effective
implementation of the national research program. are related to personnel and budget. Regarding
personnel issues, the majority of research scientists are seconded from the Ministry of Agriculture and
do not see INRA as their employer or source of long-term career growth. Better scientists can obtain
higher remuneration and career growth at universities. INRA needs to establish appropriate personnel
policies that would allow for effective career development of scientific research staff and the
consequent strengthening of the institute's capacity to carry out its mandate. The ASIL II would
support publication of a regulation that aligns the remuneration schedules of research scientists with
those of university teaching/research staff.
82.       Regarding budget issues, the ASIL II would support decentralization of the financial
management system at remaining research centers (Tangiers, Oujda and Agadir).
Land Issues
83.       Issues associated with land reform and land development have long been a concern in
Morocco. Land is continuously being subdivided as a function of Mosleir inheritance traditions
which results in smaller and smaller plots. The size of these plots can inhibit the use of productivity-
enhancing mechanization and eliminate gains from economies of scale. There is currently no existing
facility that encourages lending for the purpose of allowing co-heirs to buy out one another on a
voluntary basis to maintain plot size. There is also an insecurity of land tenure which reduces the
ability of farmers to borrow and gives them little incentive to invest. This is due to the significant
backlog in land registration and cadastral services as well as to a code on contracts and obligations
that does not specifically treat rural leases (the lack of a minimum duration for leases is a particular
problem). Finally, farmers on collective lands have usufruct rights but do not have the individual
titles that would encourage them to invest their own capital in the land. This is a particular problem
in irrigated areas where capital costs are significant. The Government has undertaken numerous
efforts to improve the situation, including voluntary land consolidation to repackage small, dispersed
plots into more efficient land structures. The Loan would finance studies to prepare for land
consolidation efforts and some access roads to the new plots (para. 45). The Loan would also support
Government action in three areas: (i) reopening ministerial discussions for granting individual
property rights to farmers on collective lands and beginning the preparation of a draft law;
(ii) preparing new texts to clarify relationships under rural leases; and (iii) executing a study on the
feasibility of developing a credit window at CNCA to facilitate land purchases from co-heirs.

III. Project Execution
A. Project Cost and Financing
84.       The total project cost is equivalent to the overall investment program of the Ministty of
Agriculture for the four years, 1994-97, and estimated at DH9435 million (US$993 million
equivalent) of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at some US$417 million, and taxes
and duties at US$125 million. Of the total, some US$113 million is covered by donors (including the
Bank under other projects). The proposed ASIL 11 of US$121 million would finance just over twelve
percent of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture for those years, excluding taxes and
duties. Retroactive financing of up to ten percent of the loan amount ($US12 million) would be
provided and would cover payments for eligible expenditures made during the months for 1994
preceding loan signing (mid-1994). The budget items selected for financing total close to $US 185
million and are shown in Table 2 above. A financing plan for the whole program is shown below in
Table 12. Cofinancing for the Government's overall agricultural investment budget could come from,
inter alia, the Bank (through other projects), the European Community, Kreditanstalt fu-r
Wiederaufbau (KfW, Germany), Caisse francaise de developpement (CDF, France), IFAD and the
African Development Bank.

Numbers may not add due to rounding
B. Proiect Implementation
85.       The Ministry of Agriculture would have overall responsibility for project execution. The
implementation of project investments would be made by the various directorates concerned. The
Director of the DPAE, who is responsible for the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture,
would be the Project Coordinator. Within the budget envelope of the Ministry of Agriculture, he
would ensure that project priorities are respected in the annual allocation of budget funds and that
project selection criteria acceptable to the Bank are applied. He would also monitor other aspects of
the Loan agreement with the Bank. Under the ASIL I, the Director of the DPAE named an assistant
to take charge of the day-to-day implementation of the project. Coordinators have also been named in
each of the Ministry of Agriculture's directorates to carry out tasks for which they are respectively
responsible.
86.       The implementation of the various project investments and reforms iould generally, and
to the extent possible, follow procedures normally used for such functions. Each director in the
concerned directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for executing project
operations inscribed in his budget and pursuing necessary measures to effect the policy reforms in his
subsector.



- 29 -
C. Environmental Screning
87.          The ASIL 11 would support the establishment of an Environmental Management Unit
(EMU) within the Ministry of Agriculture (at the cabinet level) which inter alia would have the
responsibility for undertaking environmental screening of projects, arranging for environmental
impact assessments if appropriate, and monitoring impact results from the investments. The
coordinator of the unit has been named and has begun implementing a work progran agreed upon
with the Bank. Procedures and guidelines for the environmental screening and analysis are being
developed in close coordination with the EMU, financed by the Mediterranean Environmental
Technical Assistance Program (METAP), which is being established at the Secretariat of the
Environment in the Ministry of the Interior. Development of the methodology for the environmental
assessments, as well as financing for training staff in the unit and in the different directorates of the
Ministry of Agriculture, will be provided under the Bank's Environmental Management Project (Loan
3647-MOR) approved by the Board on September 14, 1993. Official establishment of the unit would
be a condition of effectiveness of the ASIL II.
D. Procurement
88.             The proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table 13 below.

Numbers may not add due to rounding.



- 30 -
Implementing Agencies
89.       Procurement of items financed under the loan would be carried out by the some 400
agencies (the same as under the ASIL I) implementing the project, including the twelve central
directorates,"9 the 35 DPAs, DCFCC, and the institutes of higher educationti. These agencies have
demonstrated their capacity to handle procurement matters efficiently under previous Bank loans,
including the ASIL I. As the project coordinating agency, the DPAE would collect from the Central
Treasury all data on payments made to the various agencies concerned. The DPAE would classify
payments according to the categories presented in the Loan Agreement and would send invoices for
the appropriate amounts to the Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Finance for transmission to the
Bank. For procurement contracts requiring prior Bank review (based on established thresholds as
described in para. 94 below), the individual agency concerned would send documents directly to the
DPAE for eventual review by the Bank. The DPAE would also be responsible for the diffusion of all
information involving bidding documents or procurement procedures.
Bidding Documents
90.       In accordance with the Bank policy involving loans negotiated after May 1, 1993, the use
of standard bidding documents is mandatory for ICB contracts financed by the Bank. Under the
ASIL I, documents for all types of contracts (not just those to be financed by the Bank) were prepared
by the Ministry of Agriculture and approved by the Bank. These documents, appropriately updated,
would be used for international competitive bidding (ICB) contracts procured under the ASIL II as
well as for all local competitive bidding (LCB) contracts.
Civil Works (US$49.9 million)
91.       Civil works contracts greater than US$3 million would be awarded through ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Experience with other Bank projects in Morocco has shown that
foreign contractors have no interest in small and scattered works. Most civil works contracts would
fall into this category, i.e. less than US$3 million, and would be awarded through LCB procedures
that are acceptable to the Bank. For small works in remote areas, not exceeding the equivalent of
US$2 million in total, the work would not be of interest to contractors and it would be more practical
to use the Ministry of Agriculture's own staff and resources (force account) that are experienced in
this type of work and are reasonably efficient.
Goods (US$28.0 million)
92.       Goods procured through contracts valued at US$400,000 or more each would be awarded
through ICB in accordance with Bank giidelines, although very few contracts are likely to exceed this
amount. Contracts for goods estimated to cost less than US$400,000, not exceeding the equivalent of
US$3.3 million in total, would be awarded under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, since
previous experience shows local bidding to be competitive. Procurement of miscellaneous supplies
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent, not exceeding the equivalent amount of US$8 million in total,

would be made by individual agencies on the basis of local shopping with quotations from at least
three suppliers. Procurement of essential veterinary drugs (US$3.7 million) by direct purchase would
be allowed (although LCB and ICB would not be precluded) because in most instances, the drugs
must be approved by the Government, often specifically adapted to local conditions, and prices are set
by administrative fiat in any case. This practice has proven efficient in the past. Investments
supported by FDA would be procured by private sector operators which normally follow competitive
bidding practices.
Consultant Services (US$11.3 million)
93.       Consultant services financed under the proposed Loan are virtually exclusively for the
purpose of undertaking studies (e.g., agro-economic, land consolidation, agrarian reform, feasibility
for irrigation, etc.). These consultant services would be procured under the Bank's Guidelines for the
use of consultants (August 1981). It is expected that the majority of the studies would be carried out
by joint ventures of foreign and local consultants with local consultants providing the majority of the
inputs.
Prior Bank Review
94.       Procurement for all contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$1 million or more
for civil works, and US$500,000 or more for goods, would require the Bank's prior review. Prior
review by the Bank would be necessary for all consultant services in which the contract amount is
greater than or equal to US$100,000. For consultant contracts below this threshold (JS$100,000) in
which the studies to be undertaken are critical or specific in nature (i.e., those included in Annex 3c),
prior review by the Bank would also be required.
95.       For the most part, the Loan would disburse against selected budgeta!- line items in their
entirety rather than against individual contracts, with each line item possibly inchl - , numerous
different contracts or parts of different contracts. For investments the institutes of higher education,
however, only certain contracts within the relevant line items have been selected. Prior review,
therefore, would be required for all procurement contracts executed by those agencies to ensure that
only the selected investments are financed by the Bank.
96.       Procurement procedures for all contract amounts (including those less than the above
thresholds) for works, goods, and services must be acceptable to the Bank. Because of the small and
scattered nature of the contracts and the multitude of actors involved in the procurement process, it is
not expected that a large percentage of contracts would be subject to prior review under the proposed
ASIL II. To help the Ministry of Agriculture and the numerous entities involved comply with Bank
guidelines, the Bank would make an ex-post review for all documents related to Bank financing (for
goods and works) for the first two contracts procured under LCB for each directorate. All other
procurement would be reviewed ex-post on a selective basis; thus the beneficiaries would be required
to retain all procurement documentation. A Bank procurement specialist would participate in annual
supervision missions for this purpose.

E. Disbursements
97.       Disbursements under the project would extend over five years and would be completed
by December 31, 1998.21 This would allow one year for commitments carried over from the final
project year (1997) to be fully disbursed. Since commitments for line items in the 1994-97 budgets
would all have to be made by December 31, 1997 to be eligible for financing, there should be no
problem in finalizing project disbursements in the five-year period. A schedule of disbursements is
included in Annex 5.
98.       As discussed in para. 95, the proposed ASIL 11, unlike traditional loans, would disburse
against budgetary line items. The percentage of these line items that would be financed by the Loan
would vary depending on the amount of taxes they include. These percentages are presented in
Table 14 below.
99.       Since there would be close to 400 executing agencies for ASIL II investments, it is
essential to establish an accounting monitoring system for Bank disbursements that would rely on the
standard Moroccan public accounting system. Moroccan accounts provide certified statements of
expenditure for all payments by budgetary line item and executing agency. Disaggregation by
contract and amount of contract is possible at the level of each executing agency only. There is still
need, however, to provide the auditors (and the Bank) with the usual supporting documentation
related to specific contracts. Thus, all disbursements would be made against the certified statements
of expenditure with all supporting documents examined at the time of the audit.
100.      To ensure the efficient and timely implementation of the investment program, a Special
Account would be established. The authorized allocation (initial deposit) to be deposited in the
Special Account in Dirhams (approximately four months of disbursements) would be the equivalent of
US$12 million (DH1 14 million). To the extent possible, loan disbursements would be channelled
through the Special Account except that any large expenditure (amounts greater than 10 percent of the
initial deposit), which would cause it to be significantly depleted, would be submitted for payment
directly to the Bank. To the extent possible, all withdrawal applications would be submitted for a
minimum amount of US$2.5 million equivalent. Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account would be submitted on a monthly basis or when the amounts withdrawn exceed about one
third of the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. Replenishment applications for expenditures
financed through the Special Account would be accompanied by: (a) a statement of transactions on the
Special Account since the previous application, with the balance certified by the Treasury; (b) a
reconciliation showing that the balance represents the amount deposited in the account less payment
awaiting Bank reimbursement.
2The proposed Loam would therefore close by June 30, 1999 (six months after project completion).

which have been adjusted to allow for a 10 percent share of funds to remain unallocated.
b\ Disbursement Rates refer to percent of lin?. item expenditures to be financed. The
disbursement rate for FDA line items is 95% provided that total ASIL 11 financing for this
component does not exceed the agreed limit of 35 % of the total loan amount (para. 53).
F. Accounts. Audits and Progress Reports
101.        Under the ASIL I, the project coordinating unit (DPAE) set up a system to monitor
budgetary commitments and expenditures including those for the project. Under the ASIL 1, the
Government submitted an official audit of the project accounts, statements of expenditure and special
account, and the Bank asked for an additional examination of the supporting documents for statements
of expenditure to confirm their accuracy and verify if ASIL I loan proceeds had been used for their
intended purposes. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance prepared a detailed presentation of payment
orders for all expenditures financed by the ASIL I as of December 31, 1993, and the auditors
produced a complementary audit report satisfactory to the Bank. The experience gained in preparing
these reports should allow the audit process to proceed smoothly under the ASIL If.
102.        Independent auditors acceptable to the Bank would audit project accounts annually along
with the Special Account and the statements of expenditure used to justify disbursements under the
proposed Loan. Audited financial statements would be submitted to the Bank, with the audit report,
within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were obtained at
negotiations.
103.        The DPAE would be responsible for coordinating and presenting annual progress reports
of project activities detailing the achievements under each component.
G. Supervision and Sector Dialogue
104.        On the basis of the annual progress report (made available to the Bank by December of
each year), comprehensive annual reviews by the Bank and the Government would be undertaken
each year as part of the Loan. These reviews would also confirm the detailed proposals of the draft
budget for the subsequent year. A policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government on the
overall action program would be also be held at that time, including discussion of progress on the
measures detailed in the Development Action Plan and accompanying matrix and detailed discussions
of the tariff level. The Government's proposed expenditures for Bank financing in the subsequent



- 34 -
year, based on the draft budget, would be examined and eligible projects selected for incorporation
into the program. Financing for the following year would depend on (i) agreement on project
selection; and (ii) compliance with the action program. The Bank's allocation of Loan funds for
subsequent years to individual directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture would be contingent on
progress achieved by those directorates in carrying out the reform program for which it has
responsibility. A major review would be held at the end of 1995 in order to agree on measures for
the action program for the remaining time for the project.
105.      The project would be supervised twice a year during its implementation, once to conduct
the annual review and sector dialogue, and a second time about six months later. 1The annual review
should take place toward the end of the year when the draft investment budget is available, but not yet
finalized.
106.      Estimated supervision inputs into key activities are indicated in Annex 6. Supervision
requirements are estimated at 5 staff weeks in FY94, 31 in FY95, 16 in FY96, 10 in FY97, and 6 in
FY98 totalling 68 staff weeks over the five-year project implementation period. The project would
need somewhat intensive supervision to ensure the success of the agricultural reform program and to
carefully evaluate the progress of the numerous investments financed. However, some staff savings
would occur because field supervision would be carried out during the supervision of other relevant
projects in the division's portfolio and for preparation/appraisal of a possible third ASIL.
IV. Benerits. .Justification and Risk
A. Benefits
Economic Benefits
107.      Since the ASiL II would cover all of the Ministry of Agriculture's investment program, it
is not possible to undertake a formal economic evaluation of the project. Nonetheless, all investments
selected meet a minimum ERR or other social or environmental objectives. In general, ICORs in the
agricultural sector are below those for the economy as a whole (indicating that investments in
agriculture generate higher output than other investments in the economy in general), and public
investments in the sector are an efficient way to generate national growth. Typical ERRs for
Government investments include 15 percent for area development and land consolidation, 21 percent
for destoning, 39 percent for forestry investments, 16 percent for range development and 15 percent
for small-scale irrigation2. ERRs have also been calculated for models representing some of the
major investments supported by the FDA. The results include: 43 percent for irrigation equipment,
18 percent for tractors and equipment and 14 percent for sheep and stables. These categories, in
addition to destoning (ERR=21 %) represent the bulk of FDA investments. For the majority of
activities under the FDA, the economic and/or social return is higher than the financial return.

- 35 -
Production and Incomes
108.      The vast bulk of the investments go for purposes that directly or indirectly are intended
to increase agricultural productivity and, therefore, farm incomes. For example, improved animal
health, nutrition and genetic quality raise the yield of livestock products; agricultural education
increases the productivity of participants; destoning raises land productivity; land consolidation
increases possibilities for economies of scale; mapping and cadastres afford land security that
increases private investment; promotion of technology raises crop yields; area development projects
provide supporting infrastructure; agricultural research is aimed directly at raising yields and reducing
riskiness of crops; plant protection reduces crop losses; small-scale irrigation provides infrastructure
for increasing output and reducing its variability.
Efficiency
109.       Whereas the intent of most investments under the Loan is to raise national income,
particularly in the agricultural sector, the primary intent of reforms in the action program is to
increase efficiency: efficiency of the investments themselves or efficiency in the allocation of
resources in the economy. The benefits from these actions could take the toim of reduced costs for
services, for example, as the result of the privatization of a particular service such as animal health,
or as the result of deregulation of a market such as cereals, or as the result of fewer rejections by the
CED of budget documents.
Equity
110.       All of the project's investments would go to the rural sector which accounts for 50
percent of the population and includes the majority of the country's economically disadvantaged.
Over three-quarters of the investments under the proposed Loan would be in non-irrigated areas
where the poor tend to be concentrated.
Environment and Natural Resource Base
Ill.       As described in paras. 49 and 71, the project supports investments to promote the
conservation and protection of the natural resource base, especially the forests and ranges. It also
supports actions to improve the incentive structure for use of natural resources to reduce the threat of
contamination from pesticides. Finally, the Loan would establish an Environmental Management Unit
to ensure that no investments in the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture have a negative impact on
the environment.
Development Indicators
112.       While the expected impact of the investments financed by the Loan can be assessed
within the framework of traditional cost-benefit analysis (giving due consideration to social and
environmental concerns), the expected benefits of the action program are less easily quantifiable. For
example, liberalizing storage margins should lead to more efficient inter-temporal levels of storage
during the year and higher remuneration levels for research scientists should boost morale and
increase their motivation. However, these effects are difficult to measure precisely. Nonetheless,
Annex 7 lays out fairly quantifiable outcomes from the reform program that would indicate that the
actions supported by the Loan have had their intended impact.



- 36 -
B. Risks
113.      One possible risk is that the Government would not make adequate budget funds available
for the selected investments during the project period. Annual reviews during the budget cycle will
minimize the risk that overall budget levels fall short of planned expenditures. In the event of a
shortfall, however, design of the ASIL fH is flexible enough to permit substitution of alternative
investments meeting the selection criteria. There is also a risk that individual reforms in the action
program would not be implemented as agreed, however the overall program is very much "owned"
by the Government, particularly the subsector reforms, and these the status of these actions would be
carefully assessed and discussed with the Government as part of regular supervision and the annual
reviews.
C. Environmental Impact
114.      The proposed Loan has been classified as a Category B project since, overall, it would
have limited environmental impact. No pesticides or herbicides would be financed (although
improved storage warehouses and safer application equipment would) and it is not anticipated that
there would be any resettlement issues from the land consolidation component. As discussed in
para. 87, an EMU would be established with the support of the project to carry out environmental
screening and to arrange for environmental impact assessments when necessary. A base-line
environmental screening was conducted by EMTEN to ensure that projects submitted for financing do
not have any negative impacts. This screening has determined that certain supplemental
documentation would be required for a small number of projects before disbursements could be made
for the associated budgetary line items. In particular, the Government would need to certify that
(i) all investments in cold storage contain no chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); and (ii) all investments in
storage depots for agricultural chemicals are an adequate distance from population centers and are
constructed according to safety standards for such units. The EMU should be fully functional for
assessing projects proposed for financing during subsequent years. In any case, the effects of ASIL II
are likely to be positive, especially in the areas of reforestation, soil conservation, erosion control and
better handling and disposal of agricultural chemicals.
V.  Aments and Recommendation
Assurances and Agreements
115.      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would:
(a)      implement the Development Action Plan and the reforms detailed in the
attached policy matrix according to the specified timetable (Annex 3);
(b)      introduce a tariff equivalent system for all cereals with protection levels less
than or equal to their maximum levels allowed under GATT by April 1, 1995
(para. 58);
(c)      put in place tariff equivalents for cereals not exceeding 90 percent of the
maximum levels allowed under GATT1 for 1995 by April 1, 1996 and for
subsequent years (para. 58);



- 37 -
(d)       ensure that tariffs for cereals will remain fixed except under certain
circumstances (para. 58);
(e)       ensure that all investments under the FDA are intended to further one or more
of the following objectives: (i) introduction of new technology; (ii) promotion
of investments with positive externalities; (iii) provision of transitional means
for the Government to reduce its contribution to the investment; and
(iv) transfer of income to the poorest farmers (paras. 64-66); and
(f)       submit to the Parliamen.t a draft law for deregulating the domestic marketing
system for cereals (except bread wheat) upstream of the mills, including
elimination of: trader licenses; fixed margins for storage, transport and resale;
and restrictions against certain types of grain procurement by millers and
other agents (par.. 57).
Conditions of Effectiveness
116.       As conditions of Effectiveness of the proposed Loan. the Government would:
(a)       obtain approval by the Council of Government on mechanisms for
deregulating the domestic marketing system for cereals (except bread wheat)
upstream of the mills, including elimination of: trader licenses; fixed margins
for storage, transport and resale; and restrictions against certain types of grain
procurement by millers and other agents (para. 57);
(b)       issue a regulation to permit the private sector to invest in milk collection
centers under FDA (para. 66); and
(c)       officially establish the Environmental Management Unit in the Ministry of
Agriculture under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 87).
Recommendation
117.      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$121
million to the Kingdom of Morocco. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1998.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT                      Page 1 of 5
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT LOAN
Annex 3a: Development Action Plan
1.         The primary objective of the current agricultural policy agenda is to achieve optimal use
of productive resources. This will be accomplished by: (i) targeting public investments towards
priority projects; (ii) improving basic infrastructure and promoting on-farm investment; and
(iii) encouraging the private sector to invest more in agriculture. The agenda also aims to: (i) ass
the country's food needs through improved allocation of resources, in particular by shifting resources
towards products in which Morocco is competitive, while striking the proper balance between
economic costs and the need to ensure food security in the country; (ii) boost farmers' incomes
through productivity enhancing investments and improved marketing channels for inputs and outputs;
(iii) improve forward and backward linkages for agric-ultural production through better organization of
markets and liberalization of marketing channels; better transport, storage and processing facilitite
(iv) promote agricultural exports through joint ventures, transfer of technology and the creation of
free-trade zones; (v) generate employment opportunities by channeling investments toward subsectors
which have a direct impact on production and a multiplying effect on employment; and (vi) promote
environmental protection and natural resource preservation by establishing a policy framework that
seeks to protect the environment and preserve the natural resource base. These priorities are
discussed in more detail below.
krigation
2.         The Government is taking a three-pronged approach to irrigation policy, in the context
of the National Irrigation Program, which involves: (i) taking advantage of the existing hydraulic
infrastructure by providing irrigation equipment in areas that could be served by existing dams;
(i:) rehabilitating and modernizing operations in run-down, large-scale hydro-agricultural schemes and
in traditional small- and medium- scale irrigation schemes; (iii) promoting the efficient management of
irrigated perimeters at the technical, legislative, institutional and accounting levels, and encouraging
the optimal use of water allocated to irrigation.
3.         Important accompanying measures involve: (i) ensuring environmental preservation
through optimal use of soil and water resources in order to yield sustainable and profitable
agricultural production; (ii) prolonging the life-span of infrastructure and irrigation equipment by
increasing beneficiary participation in its management and maintenance via water user associations;
and (iii) providing the necessary agricultural support services to achieve the desired levels of
productivity and competitiveness.
4.         Furthermore, the Government will update water tariff levels and irrigation water charges
so that users progressively cover full operations and maintenance costs and part of the investment
costs. This will ensure the sustainability of hydro-agricultural investments and will make the use of
irrigation water cost efficient.

Improving natural resource inanagement
5.         The Government's focus for improving natural resource management includes:
(i) protecting and developing natural forests with measures to prevent deforestation, soil erosion and
desertification; (ii) maintaining the forest cover through forest demarcaLion and through limits on the
use of forest resources based on economic rationale; (iii) increasing the regeneration of natural forests
and establishing plantations; (iv) modifying legislation for forest grazing lands which would ensure the
financing of forest regeneration and improvements in grazing lands; (v) studying the protection,
conservation and development of forests.
Plant protection. suppression of fraud and technical controls
6.         The Government's focus for crop protection includes: (i) combatting migrating pest
attacks on crop lands and national forests; (ii) improving forecasts of parasite attacks by involving
farmers in the observation process so that they can better protect their own crops; (iii) assisting
farmers in detecting and identifying pests responsible for crop damage and in searching for adequate
means to combat them; (iv) improving phyto-sanitary controls including: (a) controlling imports, to
prevent the introduction of parasites that could damage Moroccan agriculture; (b) controlling exports,
in order to guarantee importing countries that Moroccan agricultural products meet their phyto-
sanitary requirements; (c) enforcing controls within the country, to prevent the spread of diseases and
dangerous insects across regions; (d) certifying seeds and plants; (e) ensuring control on foodstuff
quality; and (f) reviewing pesticides in order to authorize their use.
Agricultural Extension
7.         Rural development efforts are primarily intended to increase farm productivity and
farners' revenues. To this end, it is essential to develop and implement an agricultural extension
system that would allow for a more efficient transfer of technology to farmers (both men and
women). Farmer organizations will be promoted to ensure their active participation in agricultural
development and ultimately to reduce and eliminate government intervention in this subsector. To
achieve these objectives, the Government will implement an action plan which involves:
(i) reorganizing institutional structures at the field level and decentralizing staff to allow for closer
contact with farmers; these measures will be supported by an intensification and diversification of
extension actions, the implementation of a monitoring-evaluation system and the execution of
improved budgetary procedures; (ii) strengthening retraining programs and improving the caliber of
extension personnel; and (iii) developing farmer organizations, which will progressively take over
many development activities.
Agricultural Education and Training
8.         The Government's agricultural education and training program seeks to adapt the system
to accommodate current socio-economic changes in the country. The agricultural education system
must now respond to these changes with revised programs to produce graduates with managerial
profiles adapted to the very different needs of the private sector.
9.         To bring about these changes, the Government is committed to a program that consists
of four principal components: (i) monitoring the evolving agricultural labor market (employment
observatory); (ii) adapting training programs to make them more responsive to new employment



Annex 3a
Page 3 of 5
- 48 -
requirements; (iii) developing a national strategy for training, placing and monitoring graduates to
help them become farmers and entrepreneurs; and (iv) providing continuous education for rural
residents (e.g., farmers and wage labor).
Agricultural Research
10.        INRA's programs will be concentrated in the four following areas: (i) ensuring the
sustainability of its on-going priority programs (olive trees, oilseeds, soft wheat, forage crops, red
meat and arido-culture); (ii) strengthening research on date palms, fruit trees, citrus, rangelands, and
food conservation techniques; (iii) implementing a technology-transfer system in conjunction with
extension services; (iv) reinforcing support services such as seed multiplication, preservation of
genetic resources, and techniques for food storage.
11.        These actions will be supported by three accompanying measures: (1) the continuous
refinement of priority research programs and the implementation of a system of monitoring-evaluation
and annual programming, (2) the application of the statute for research scientists and technicians that
aligns their remuneration schedules with those of university teaching staff.
Crop production
12.         The Government's objectives for crop production fall into three principal areas:
(i) improving forward and backwird linkages for agricultural production; (ii) intensifying agricultural
development; (iii) promoting vertical integration in each subsector to exploit the benefits of
liberalization and privatization.
13.        The realization of these three objectives will be based on an action program which
involves: (i) implementing quality standards and monitoring input and agricultural equipment use at
the farm level in conjunction with other relevant services (DPVCTRF and the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry) (ii) investing in basic infrastructure in rural areas; (iii) strengthening the capacity for
conducting studies, evaluation, and monitoring by the DPV and the external services responsible for
agricultural development; (iv) supporting farmers in the area of marketing, in particular for export
crops (e.g. introducing collection points for products and supporting private investments in cold
storage packing plants through the FDA) and establishing a commercial information system on
internal and external markets; (v) supporting applied research structures in the various subsectors, and
involving these agencies in the programming and financing of research and the transfer of technology;
(vi) preparing studies to define different agro-pedo-climatic - es that would allow for improved use
of agricultural areas; and (vii) promoting and strengthening professional associations in priority
production areas, and reinforcing their tools for intervention (e.g., providing back-ups for managers,
training managers).
Land Policy
14.         Unresolved land issues adversely affect agricultural productivity and farmers' revenues.
The Government has three basic objectives to improve land policy, including: (i) improving the
structure and promoting actions to improve the feasibility of farms which are too small and too
fragmented to be profitable; (ii) revising land legislation to provide better land security for farmers;
and (iii) pursuing a policy of land development and conservation to enhance land values.



Annex 3a
Page 4 of 5
15.        These objectives will be realized through the following actions: (i) introducing land
t.tling in land reform areas; (ii) generalizing the registration of agricultural land; (iii) mapping State
lands in the private domain; (iv) introducing new legislation to improve the legal status of collective
lands in rainfed and irrigated lands; (v) introducing and funding a credit window to facilitate
voluntary land transfers between co-heirs; (vi) improving legislation for rural leases; and
(vii) promulgating the law for the creation of zones in rainfed areas.
Livestock
16.        The Government's agenda in the livestock subsector consists of five principal elements,
including: (i) continuing efforts to privatize veterinary services through contracts with private
veterinarians and a transfer of bull stations to private producer groups; (ii) promoting the participation
of producer groups covering the costs of disease controi; (iii) shifting public services toward a role
that concentrates on regulation, monitoring and controls; (iv) conserving and improving Moroccan
grazing lands through the demarcation of special action zones and the participation of pastoral groups
in the management of grazing lands; and (v) liberalizing and deregulating prices and marketing
channels for milk and meat.
Planning and Economic Affairs
17.        Budget Execution. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Development is
presently implementing several reforms to improve the execution of the budget, including:
(i) implementing a computerized system of credit management and delegation at the DPAE with the
goal of extending it to the other services of the Ministry; (ii) centralizing the responsibility for the
delegation of funds at the DPAE and accelerating the pace of delegations over that of previous years;
(iii) improving the implementation of credits and the introduction of a unique program and budget for
each DPA; and (iv) distributing and implementing standardized bidding documents and a guide for
their use to ensure the preparation of budget documents that conform with the structure existing at the
time.
18.        Trade Liberalization. The Government intends to continue the program of liberalization
and deregulation which began during the 1980s to better integrate agriculture into national and
international markets; to improve the efficiency of production systems, in particular through an
improvement in productivity, and of forward and backward linkages in their sector.
a.   External Trade: Under the 1992 Law on External Trade, the Government will
completely liberalize imports, including basic staples such as cereals (soft wheat,
hard wheat, barley, corn), oilseeds, sugar, meat and milk. For all of these
commodities, the Government will introduce a system of tariff equivalents and
will aim not to not increase the level of protection for all cereals above the current
level.
b.   Internal Trade. With the support of the SAL II, the Government is currently
implementing an important system of deregulation and privatization for oilseeds,
sugar, milk and meat. The intention is to extend this program to the cereals
subsector, with the exception of soft wheat which will remain regulated because of
the consumer subsidy on flour. The Government intends to eliminate the
consumer subsidy and deregulate soft wheat markets in the context of favorable



Annex 3a
Page 5 of 5
^ 50 -
economic conditions and to replace it with programs that are more efficient and
better targeted towards disadvantaged groups. If economic circumstances prevent
an elimination of the subsidy before the end of 1994, the Government will
proceed with the deregulation of soft wheat markets upstream of the milling level
according to the structure existing at that time.
Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)
19.        The FDA has four main objectives: (i) introducing technologies that are not widespread
in the country; (ii) promoting investments that generate positive externalities (e.g., soil conservation,
water-saving devices); (iii) providing a transitional means for the Government to reduce its budgetary
share of investments before completely privatizing them; and (iv) improving the revenues of the
poorest farmers.
20.        Funds are self-targeted to small farms through the choice of equipment and services
eligible for financing. The Government intends to limit investments financed under the FDA to those
that specifically further these objectives and to introduce a monitoring system to ensure that the
financing has the desired effect. Moreover, the Government intends to further strengthen the self-
targeting of FDA funds through a refinement of investments eligible for financing and through the
introduction of ceilings. Finally, the Government will subsidize new investments so as to encourage
private investment in those areas and to compensate for the reduced role of the State.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT LOAN
Annex 4: The Action Proeram According to the Six Pillars
of the Country Assistance Strat=ey
1.         The Action Program by and large addresses the current agenda in each subsector. The
actions selected as priorities for support by the Loan are consistent with the objectives for the sector
and with the six pillars of the Country Assistance strategy as discussed below.
Consolidation of Adjustment and Reform
2.         Two elements of the adjustment program would be further pursued under the Loan:
deregulation of output marketing and reduction of Government subsidies. Deregulation effort- would
focus on the cereals market, the only market still subject to estrictions after reforms under the
ASALs and the SAL 11. Reduction of subsidies would include actions to raise the share of costs
covered by beneficiaries in the area of animal health. Also, user fees would be introduced for access
to forest rangelands.
Private Sector Development
3.         The Loan supports a number of efforts in this area, including actions to stimulate
additional private investment and actions to directly privatize certain activities. Examples of measures
to stimulate private investment include: reforms to the FDA and measures to improve security of
land tenure and individual land ownership. Examples of measures to privatize services currently
provided by the Government include: transfer of animal health services to private veterinarians and
transfer of artificial insemination centers for genetic improvement to producer groups. Finally, the
Loan also supports a major change in the agricultural education system to begin training students for
employment in the private sector instead of for careers in the civil service.
Public Sector Management
4.         Efforts to improve public sector management under the ASIL 11 include reforms to
improve the investment (budget) process and reforms to redefine the role of the public sector.
Reforms in the public investment process were an important component of the ASIL 1. The ASIL 11
would consolidate gains in this area, most notably with further improvements in budget execution
(dissemination of guides and checkdists for document preparation, introduction of monitoring systems,
training for operators, computerization of the system).
5.         The Loan would support redefinition or strengthening of the public sector in three areas:
(i) decentralization and improved institutional operations at the field level; (ii) improved inter-
ministerial coordination; and (iii) improved quality control. The Government is currently pursuing a
policy to decentralize responsibility within the Administration alongside its policy of divesting



Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
- 57 -
responsibility to the private sector. The Ministry of Agriculture has traditionally been very
centralized with poor institutional organization at the field level. The Loan would support a
reorganization of MARA's field services. Consistent with this emphasis on decentralization, the Loan
would also support a reform to regionalize equipment and operations staff of the plant protection
services. Additionally, the Loan would support improved inter-ministerial coordination of investment
programming. In particular, the Loan would seek harmonization of the Ministry of Public Works'
program for location of rural infrastructure (mainly roads) and Ministry of Agriculture's program for
the location of area development efforts. Finally, the Loan would support a strengthened role for
Ministry of Agriculture in assuring quality control, in particular for improving quality standards for
livestock feed.
Promotion of Outward Orientation
6.         The ASIL II would also consolidate gains in liberalizing external trade begun under the
ASALs and strengthened under the SAL 11. In particular, it would support the conversion of the
existing reference price system for cereals, and the associated distortions caused by the safeguard
clause, to a system of tariff equivalents.
Environment and Water Resource Management
7.         The Loan would introduce several measures to encourage more rational use of forest
resources, notably user fees for grazing on forest pastures as discussed in para. 1, and a contribution
from the revenues derived from sales of forest products to the upkeep and protection of the forests.
The Loan would support implementation of an action plan designed to eliminate the danger from
pesticides stored under hazardous conditions and the development of a strategy for protecting the
ranges. Finally, as a condition of effectiveness, the Loan would introduce an Environmental
Management Unit that would undertake environmental screening of projects ard assure that
appropriate impact assessments are undertaken.
Poverty Alleviation
8.         The Loan would introduce several key reforms to the FDA program to ensure that funds
are much more targeted toward small farmers.
