Agricultural Investment Loan Project (ASIL II) will be to\n            support a well-conceived investment program in\n            Morocco's agricultural sector. The ASIL II will finance\n            specific critical investments in: agricultural education,\n            livestock, crop production, plant protection, land policy\n            programs, rainfed land improvements, forestry, extension,\n            small- and medium- scale irrigation, and planning. The loan\n            will also finance an Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)\n            which promotes private investments in: land improvements;\n            irrigation improvements; increased use of small-scale farm\n            equipment; livestock intensification; phyto-sanitary\n            protection; and increased tree planting. The package of\n            policy actions includes: a) liberalization of internal and\n            external trade; b) reforms in the budget execution process;\n            and c) reforms of the FDA; and d) subsectoral reforms. The\n            ASIL II will also support the establishment of an\n            Environmental Management Unit which will have the\n            responsibility for undertaking environmental screening of\n            projects, arranging for environmental impact assessments\n            when appropriate, and monitoring impact results from investments."}, "docdt": "1994-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
