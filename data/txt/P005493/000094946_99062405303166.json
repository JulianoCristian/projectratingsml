unsatisfactory, with substantial negligible objectives,\n            concerning irrigation costs recovery, output pricing, and,\n            public expenditure priorities. However, the project was\n            successful in moving the agricultural policy agenda forward.\n            The Bank failed to deliver appropriate preparation and\n            supervision of the project, due to several staff changes,\n            making a sustained dialogue difficult. Conversely, the\n            performance of the borrower was marginally satisfactory, in\n            that, policy reforms and project actions, \"owned'\n            by the borrower, were accomplished with diligence and\n            method. Regardless of the outcome, it is worth noting that\n            most of the reform program was implemented, thus providing a\n            positive impact for future rural sector development. The\n            lessons learned show that project objectives need to be\n            realistic, clearly defined, and above all, agreed upon with\n            the borrower. Sector or sub-sector investment operations\n            need a coherent focus on policy and institutional reforms,\n            with increased participation by the borrower in its\n            formulation. Systematic measures for development and impact\n            indicators, need to be in place, specifically, at the design\n            stage (mandatory in Bank projects since 1997). Procurement\n            practices, disbursement procedures and auditing, need to be\n            addressed early on, and explicitly agreed with the borrower.\n            Finally, a sustained dialogue is paramount for a successful operation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
