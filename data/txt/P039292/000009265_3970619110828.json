by\n            supporting small-scale projects, which are identified and\n            implemented with a high degree of community participation.\n            The project will consist of three components. The community\n            projects' component will include projects of the\n            following types: water and sanitation, health, economic\n            infrastructure, education, social services, and\n            organizational strengthening. The microenterprise credit\n            component will provide credits to community based\n            microenterprises. The institutional support component will\n            help develop a viable, autonomous management, finance the\n            administrative and operational costs of the organization\n            while establishing operational capacity through technical\n            assistance, studies and training."}, "docdt": "1997-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
