Loan Administration Change Initiative - Amendments to Loan 
Agreement
Dear Sir:
We refer to the Loan Agreement dated May 14, 1997 (the Loan Agreement) between 
Belize (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(the Bank) for the above-captioned Project and to our recent discussions regarding the 
inclusion of the Project in the Bank’s Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI).
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank has decided to include the Project in 
LACI and hereby agrees to the following amendments to the Loan Agreement. 1.
Section 1.02
A new paragraph (h) is added to Section 1.02 of the Loan Agreement to read as 
follows:
"(h) "Financial Management Report" means a periodic financial management report 
prepared by the Borrower, in form and substance acceptable to the Bank, which (i) 
describes physical progress in Project implementation, including the status of 
procurement, and (ii) sets forth (A) the sources and applications of funds for the 
Project (including expenditures incurred for the Project, showing separately those to 
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan), (B) the amounts deposited into and paid 
out of the Special Account and (C) a forecast of expenditures to be incurred for the 
Project."
2.
Section 4.01
Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:
"Section 4.01.  (a)  The Borrower shall cause SIF to maintain a financial 
management system, including records and accounts, and to prepare financial statements 
in a format acceptable to the Bank, adequate to reflect the operations, resources and 
expenditures related to the carrying out of the Project.
(b)
The Borrower shall cause SIF to:  (i) have the records, accounts and 
financial statements referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section and the records and 
accounts for the Special Account for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with 
consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Bank, by independent 
auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in 
any case not later than four months after the end of each such year, (A) certified 
copies of the financial statements referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section for 
such year as so audited, and (B) an opinion on such financial statements, records and 
accounts and a report of such audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail 
as the Bank shall have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other 
information concerning such records and accounts and the audit thereof, and concerning 
said auditors, as the Bank may from time to time reasonably request.
(c)
For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Loan 
Account were made on the basis of Financial Management Reports or statements of 
expenditure, the Borrower shall cause SIF to:  (i) maintain or cause to be maintained, 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section, records and separate accounts 
reflecting such expenditures; (ii) retain until at least one year after the Bank has 
received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the 
Loan Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and 
other documents) evidencing such expenditures; (iii) enable the Bank’s representatives 
to examine such records; and (iv) ensure that such records and accounts are included 
in the annual audit referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and that the report 
of such audit contains a separate opinion by said auditors as to whether the Financial 
Management Reports and statements of expenditure submitted during each fiscal year, 
together with the pro
cedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to 
Page  2
support the related withdrawals."
3.
Schedule 1  Paragraph 4
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:

and works contracts, as the case may be, procured in accordance with the provisions of 
Section I, Parts B.2 (other than those for which prior review of the respective 
contracting is required under Section I, Part C.2 of Schedule 4 to this Agreement),

provided, however, that the Bank may at any time revise said amount by notice to the

With respect to each request for deposit made on the basis of a Financial

Expenditure Period following said withdrawal, minus (ii) any amount as shall have been 
shown by said report to have been paid out of the Special Account for expenditures 
which said report shall have failed to show are eligible expenditures.  With respect 
to each request for deposit made on the basis of other documentation and evidence, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and shall have 
been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special 
Account for eligible expenditures."
(c)

shall, promptly, upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding 
amount."
