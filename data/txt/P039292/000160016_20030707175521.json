The overall performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory. Some of\n            the many lessons learned from this project include the\n            following: 1) Poverty Targeting: The agreed allocation by\n            District and nationally, by level of poverty of the\n            communities, followed intensive discussions with the\n            Government on poverty and political issues and was,\n            unavoidably, a compromise. As a result, the allocation to\n            the poorest communities  was smaller than seems justified\n            and agreed. This experience reconfirms the importance of\n            giving  significant attention during project preparation to\n            the criteria to be used for the poverty targeting formula,\n            and to the need for the implementing agency to help the\n            poorest communities prepare sub-project proposals.  Still,\n            the principle of poverty targeting was established, and\n            received increasing political acceptance. 2) Emergency\n            Response: Following Hurricane Keith, the Social Investment\n            Fund (SIF) was among the very few national agencies able  to\n            respond quickly and well to the communities' emergency\n            repair needs, confirming the critical role that  social\n            funds can play in this area. With the help of the Bank and\n            Honduran consultants, the SIF drafted an emergency\n            operational  manual, allowing for temporary project cycle\n            exemptions, and thus speeding up sub-project processing.\n            This experience confirms the need to draft and agree upon\n            emergency procedures at the start of the project,  when such\n            a project is located in a country subject to hurricanes or\n            other disasters. 3) Output vs. Participation: The SIF, like\n            demand-driven social funds elsewhere, is under dual\n            pressures, on  the one hand to produce quick results in the\n            form of high quality, cost-effective social infrastructure,\n            and,  on the other hand, to achieve these results using an\n            intensive participatory approach. The latter is  unavoidably\n            more time-consuming, but the risk of not investing ample\n            time in empowering communities to  analyze and prioritize\n            community needs, plan, and implement the sub-projects\n            financed by the SIF is that  funds are spent in ways that\n            are not considered to be the highest priority in the\n            beneficiary communities and  that communities fail to\n            maintain these facilities once they are built.\n            Under-investing in participatory  processes is, more\n            importantly, a missed opportunity for civic education. 4)\n            Loan Allocations for Softer Project Aspects: Although the\n            legal document provided for a dedicated loan  allocation for\n            community training and there was agreement at negotiations\n            on sector allocations, including  social program activities,\n            the community training went largely unused and the social\n            program activity was  largely abandoned during project\n            implementation because it went against the idea of the\n            project being  \"fully demand-driven.\" In both\n            cases, the SIF management and Bank staff probably should\n            have  considered more carefully the implications of these\n            decisions, although it is clear that the Hurricane Keith\n            impact played havoc with some of the original project design\n            features. 5) Working with Nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs): The SIF could have established a stronger\n            collaboration with NGOs if it had  created an ongoing\n            consultation mechanism with NGOs to review for example, the\n            SIF Operational Manual  and make revisions to better adapt\n            it to non-infrastructure type-activities, such as\n            capacity-building and social service sub-projects. An\n            upfront workshop for NGOs interested in submitting proposals\n            that outlines all the rules and regulations that the SIF\n            lenders require might also have ensured that the NGO\n            proposals were more complete, and could have reduced the\n            time the SIF staff spends gathering additional sub-project\n            information from NGO applicants."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
