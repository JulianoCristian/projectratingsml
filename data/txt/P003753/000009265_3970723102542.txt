FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1236-IND)
PROJECT COXPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.        The US$130 millioc loan (1236-IND) for the Fourth Highway Project
was approved by the Board April 6, 1976, signed April 15, 1976, and made
effective August 13, 1976. A total of US$127.76 million was disbursed as of
July 13, 1983, at which time the loan was closed and a US$2.33 million
balance was cancelled.
2.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the East Asia
and Pacific Regional office based on the following materials: appraisal
report, supervision reports, communications files, consultants' reports and
Government reports on economic re-evaluation of selected roads. No mission
was undertaken for this PCR.
3.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, the PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft completion
report was sent to the Borrower for comments. Replies received from the
Directorate General of Highways and the Ministry of Finance have been
reproduced as annexes to the report.

A Project was under continuous supervision by the Bank's Resident Staff in
Indonesia until September 1979 (field visits, correspondence, supervision
reports, procurement matters and contract modifications). Approximately 20%
of net man-years per year was spent on such supervision. The senior engineer
who carried out those tasks returned to Bank Headquarters in September 1979.
Thereafter, supervision was undertaken by headquarters staff.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1236-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.        The Fourth Highway Project had its origin in the preceding highway
projects which included feasibility and detailed engineering studies for
improving key roads in the country, thus, providing a basis for the project
under review. At the time of appraisal in 1976, a vast amount of the
Indonesian road system was considered to be in need of substantial improvement
and the project was hence designed largely to address the problem of priority
betterment works.
2.        The project's objectives are reflected in the principal components:
(a) about 1,100 km of road construction for betterment (and supervision
of these works by consultants);
(b) screening - feasibility studies of about 7,000 km of roads for
betterment;
(c) detailed engineering of about 4,100 km of roads for betterment;
(d) detailed engineering for a 70 km multi-lane highway from Jakarta to
Cikampek;
Ce) studies and other measures to strengthen the highway organization;
(f) studies of vehicle weights and dimensions, road user charges and
bighway legislation; and
(g) procurement of equipment for a training program and traffic data
collection.
3.        At appraisal the project was estimated to cost US$234 million equi-
valent, mostly for construction of road betterment works. Of this the World
Bank was to finance US$130 million equivalent and the Government US$104 mil-
lion equivalent.
4.        The first package of betterment works (550 km) was originally expec-
ted to be completed in December 1979 but was actually completed in September
1981, nearly two years late. The second package of betterment works (about
550 km), initiated somewhat later than the first, was likewise somewhat
delayed. The principal cause of the delay was the concentration of project
activities in the early stages of implementation which taxed the Directorate
General of Highways beyond its capabilities, even with consultants' assist-
ance. Other causes of delay were management weaknesses of Indonesian



- vi -
contractors and the need to correct many deficiencies in road designs.
Despite these difficulties, the quality of construction was good, in general,
and the costs reasonable (paras. 3.01-3.06, Table 1).
5.        Total cost of the completed project amounted to US$242 million as
compared to US$234 million estimated at time of appraisal. However, cost
savings were realized following devaluation of the Rupiah and, due to the low
actual construction costs (per km) in relation to appraisal estimates, these
savings enabled the DGH to undertake a construction program about 26% larger
than that originally planned (paras. 3.10-3.11, Table 2).
6.        A large input of technical assistance provided DGH with the support
necessary to implement the greatly expanded road construction program under
the Project.  The technical assistance strengthened the highway institutions,
particularly DGH, through training, advisory services and special studies of
key policy issues (para. 4.01).
7.        Traffic levels on the various roads, for which betterment works were
undertaken, have increased even more rapidly than was reflected in the high
growth rates anticipated at time of appraisal. Some moderation of these high
rates has begun, however, and will probably continue in the future. Nonethe-
less, the economic returns on the project roads based on re-evaluation are
found to be satisfactory, with rates of return on representative roads varying
from 16 to 63% (paras. 5.03-5.04, Tables 4 and 6).
8.        Compliance with most of the covenants of the loan agreement has been
adequate. The performance of the borrower was generally satisfactory; the
principal difficulties occurred in the early stage of implementation but
thereafter efficiency in handling the heavy workload improved (paras. 3.15-3.16).
9.        The performance of consultants and contractors was generally satis-
factory although the local contracting industry clearly needs strengthenirg.
The study of this industry, financed under the project, is expected to lead to
appropriate measures toward its further development. However, the other
studies financed under the project - road user charges, vehicle weight and
dimension control - have only recently begun to generate some steps towards
improvements, after an initial period of lack of interest on the Indonesian
side (paras. 3.17-3.18).
10.       In summary, the project has been successful in providing major
improvements on badly deteriorated and heavily used main roads on the three
principal islands of Indonesia.  The betterment program constituted a timely              S
and economic approach enabling postponement of full reconstruction of the
roads to a more appropriate time. Also, the technical assistance provided
under the project strengthened the DGH, the agency primarily responsible for
highway planning, construction and maintenance.



INDONESIA
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1236-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Indonesian road system, consisting of about 115,000 km in the
mid-1970s, was the predominant means of transport on the various islands.
Much of the system was in poor condition because of heavy, and rapidly
growing, traffic as well as deferral of maintenance and reconstruction of
major roads. These conditions could be traced back to the economic stagnation
of the late fifties and sixties when road works were seriously neglected.
Under the First Highway Project (Credit 154-IND, 1969) some 3,000 km of high
priority roads were rehabilitated and the capabilities of the highway adminis-
tration were strengthened. The Second and Third Highway Projects (260-IND,
1971 and 388-IND, 1973, respectively) financed reconstruction of road links
located on Sumatera and Sulawesi. All of the first three projects made signi-
ficant contributions to institutional development in the sector as well as to
road improvements. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering included in
the Second and Third projects formed the basis for the construction element of
the Fourth Highway Project.
1.02      This completion report is based on a review of Bank files in
Washington. The Loan Agreement contains no requirement that the Borrower pre-
pare a Froject Completion Report. DGH did, however, provide the Bank with
certain information requested for preparation of this PCR.
fI. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin of the Project
2.01      The Fourth Highway Project had its origins in preceding IDA Highway
Projects which included feasibility studies and engineering for roads sub-
sequently incorporated in the betterment program. The Second Highway Project
included detailed engineering for 700 km of the national highway between Medan
and Padang, much of which was improved under this program. Similarly, a
feasibility study and detailed engineering of the 300 km Bandung-Cilicap road,
financed under the Third Highway Project, provided the basis for betterment of
96 km of that road under the Fourth Highway Project.
2.02      The initiative was taken by the Resident Bank staff in Indonesia
(RSI) in December 1972 in defining a betterment program for a Fourth Highway
Project. Under the proposal, consideration was given to selection of specific
road sections from a list of candidates prepared by the Directorate General of
Highways (DGH) in September 1972. The improvements were to have a short
economic life (5 to 10 years) after which the project roads were to be
replaced by new roads or undergo major reconstruction and upgrading. In view



-2-
of the poor condition of the roads to be improved and the heavy traffic
demands on them, betterment works were expected to have high economic returns.
B. Project Preparation
2.03      Initially, and briefly, the DGH undertook, with some limited techni-
ca] assistance, to prepare the project itself, but it soon realized that it
would have to depend heavily on consultants. Funds from the Third Highway
Project were then used to finance teclnical assistance for this preparation.
A U.S. consulting firm was appointed by DGH and given the task of studying
some 2,300 km of roads with a view to selecting roads for the betterment works
based on economic and technical evaluation, and preparation of the necessary
final engineering and tender documents. In the early stages of this work,
Bank staff found the results too general and pressed for better quality;
later, the preparation, after long delays, improved but at the time of
appraisal in April/May 1975, was still considered somewhat deficient. More-
over, the DGH had only vague plans for overall road development. A month fol-
lowing the appraisal mission, an Indonesian delegation visited Washington to
define the project more precisely in collaboration with Bank staff.
C. Appraisal of the Project
2.04      As approved by the Board, the project consisted of (a) construction
of about 550 km of specified works on roads in Sumatera, Java, Bali and
Sulawesi; (b) construction of an additional 550 km of road works on roads to
be selected; (c) screening-feasibility studies and detailed engineering for
roads; (d) strengthening of DGH's organization through technical assistance
and training; (e) studies of vehicle weights and dimensions and road user
charges and highway legislation; (f) strengthening of provincial public works
departments; and (g) study of the highway construction industry in Indonesia.
2.05      Uncertainty concerning the construction cost estimates prepared
during appraisal led Bank staff to insist that Government obtain some bid
prices prior to Board presentation and, accordingly, this was done. In the
meantime, many revisions were made in the cost estimates. These frequent
changes in the estimates, along with review of numerous actions of DGH and its
consultants, required a hieavy input of effort by Bank staff over an extended
period of time.
2.06      In addition to the project's principal aim of improving various
roads, a significant further objective was to achieve improvements in the
organizations responsible for road planning and development. Thus the project
included a large and varied program of consulting services. Rapid expansion
of the acitivities of the DGH in the mid-seventies placed heavy strains on the
organization's limited staff and thus it seemed timely to make a special
effort to assist in institutional development.
2.07      In general, the project identification, preparation and appraisal
concentrated on the right issues. The focus on road betterment works was
timely since large elements of the main roads were in extremely poor condition



-3-
and traffic demand was heavy and growing rapidly. Under these circumstances,
normal maintenance would not adequately serve the needs of road users and full
reconstruction at that time of so large an aggregation of poor roads was
clearly impractical. Therefore, the betterment program was an appropriate
element of road development strategy. Moreover, the large and rapidly growing
burden of highway administration made it appropriate to direct substantial
resources towards institution-building.
2.08      In contrast with previous projects, the Fourth Highway Projef:t
represented a new departure in several ways. It included a detailed review of
the overall program of DGH. In addition, the project ti) assisted in the
establishment of DGH regional offices to evaluate, design and supervise
construction of betterment works according to uniform national criteria; (ii)
supported a large scale and complex program of major betterment projects;
(iii) included assistance to strengthen virtual'y all functions of DGH; (iv)
helped initiate studies of other institutions concerned with highways such as
provincial public works agencies and consultants and contractors engaged in
highway works; and (v) provided for studies of highway laws, road user charges
and vehicle weights and dimensions.
D. Loan Negotiations
2.09      Negotiations for the loan were completed on February 19, 1976 with
no major difficulties. During the negotiations, agreement was reached on,
inter alia, the terms of reference for certain technical assistance included
in the project and on an initial implementation schedule for the project.
E. Board Presentation, Loan Signirg and Effectiveness
2.10      The project was presented to the Board on April 6, 1976, some five
weeks after negotiations. Signing of the loan documents occurred on
April 15, 1976 and the loan became effective on August 13, 1976.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION .AND COST
A. Physical Implementation
3.01      Implementation of the project, in the early stages, was slower than
expected, mainly because of the large number of project activities required
in the initial months when the capabilities of the DCH were limited. As
indicated in Table 1, most of the consultants to the DGH began their assign-
ments within four months of the expected starting dates; some were slow in
adjusting to their assignments and not sufficiently responsive to the needs of
the DGH. The start-up problems that caused early delays were probably una-
voidable, given the rather ambitious schedule of activities established in the
project.



-4-
3.02      Construction of the betterment works, for a number of roads, was to
begin in July 1976 but the actual start of construction was delayed until
November or December of that year. More significant was the small proportion
of work accomplished by the expected date of completion. One reason for the
limited accomplishment was, of course, the slow performance of the DGH in
carrying out the many preliminary actions required before construction could
begin. In addition, the amount of time required to carry out the civil works
was, in a number of cases, substantially greater than scheduled. For example,
the W/C Java Border - Cilicap works were delayed by 20 landslides and the
necessity for installing more culverts than anticipated in the design. Land-
slides and design changes were also responsible for about four months delay in
the completion of the Padang-Sawatambang road works.
3.03      One of the principal reasons for long construction periods on
certain roads was weak management of a number of contractors. Some of the
Indonesian contractors had limited experience on major civil works and thus
had difficulties in undertaking the work assigned expeditiously. One
Indonesian firm in fact was unable to perform and defaulted.
3.04      Another cause of delay in construction was the practice of making
frequent changes in the design of works even though the intended purpose of
some changes was to reduce construction time. In many cases deficiencies in
design needed correction and thus additional engineering work also caused
delays. Design standards were in some instances reduced, as a means of expe-
diting construction, but without adequate analysis of the economic conse-
quences. In a significant number of instances, the Bank was not given an
opportunity to review proposed design changes; this tendency became more pre-
valent after September 1979 when the Bank discontinued assigning transport
specialist staff to the RSI. In some instances, however, where the Bank felt
that the changes were unsound and unacceptable, the original standards were
reinstated even after the award of contracts.
3.05      Procurement for civil works followed Bank guidelines reasonably
well, although there was a tendency to apply rather low standards in prequal-
ifying construction firms. As a result, most of the contracts for civil works
were awarded to Indonesian firms or Indonesian/foreign joint ventures. In
accordance with Bank procedures, 7 1/2Z preference was allowed local firms in
the evaluation of bids.  Undoubtedly, the project provided major business
opportunities for local firms and the experience gained by them has had the
beneficial effect of strengthening the local construction industry.
3.06      In the latter stage of project implementation, some road sections
winder the betterment program were shifted from the Fourth Highway Project to
the Fifth Highway Project. For example, the Padang Sidempuan-Jembatan Merah
road (85 km) was transferred in this way because the initial construction
contract for the betterment works had to be cancelled and it seemed certain
that new bids could not be obtained in time to permit completion of construc-
tion before the end of 1984, two years after the extended closing date. This
transfer did not require a change in the project description since, without
this particular road, the betterment works in the Fourth Highway Project would
still total at least 1,100 km.



-5-
3.07      In a similar manner, some road sections were transferred from the
Fifth to the Fourth Highway Project. For example, the Tarutung-Padang
Sidempuan, Prabumulih-Muara Enim and Ujung Pandung-Pare Pare roads were so
shifted in order to utilize available funds in the Fourth Project loan during
the months immediately prior to the anticipated closing. Since work on these
road sections was not complete at the closing date, the sections were then
transferred back to the Fifth Highway Project for completion. The transfer of
project components between these two major projects enabled the DGH to achieve
flexibility somewhat comparable to that obtained in sector loans. The
arrangement appears to have been successful.
3.08      The total length of roads improved under the betterment program was
larger than the 1,100 km target established in the project. As indicated in
Table 2, a total of 1,392 km were improved or 26Z more than the project
objective.
3.09      The screening and feasibility study, carried out by New Zealand
consultants, evaluated some 7,800 km of roads for improvement. Training of
local staff was an important product of the consultants' work. Significantly,
a permanent organizational unit for this type of project evaluation was subse-
quently created in the DGH based on the consultants' initial work. The other
studies included in the project were carried out successfully, some under the
Fifth Highway Project, and steps toward implementation of various recommenda-
tions in the reports are currently being taken. Progress reporting on the
project has been generally satisfactory.
B. Project Costs
3.10      The total cost of the project was US$241.9 million, some US$7.9 mil-
lion (or 3%) more than estimated at appraisal, as indicated in Table 2. Road
betterment costs for the first package of roads proved to be lower than
anticipated and, as a result, some savings were realized and these funds were
utilized for other project purposes, primarily for betterment of additional
sections of road. More significant sources of savings were attributable to
the devaluation of the Rupiah at various times during project implementa-
tion. In some cases, road standards were reduced, frequently without formal
Bank agreement, to achieve cost reductions. Contingency allowances in the
project were adequate.
3':.      Betterment works accounted for US$185.4 million of project costs, or
77% of the US$241.9 million total. Consulting services comprised US$39.5 mil-
lion of the total and components without Bank financing constituted US$17.0
million. The actual costs of these major components are similar to the
appraisal estimates, as can be seen from the following:



-6-
Actual      Appraisal
-     US$ million -
Road betterment works                     185.4            178.8
Consulting services                        39.5             38.2
Other components                           17.0             17.0
Total                                241.9            234.0
Although, in general, the composition of the project as implemented was com-
parable to the project as appraised, there were some changes from the original
plan, as noted above. Significantly, about 25% more civil works were carried
out than anticipated, largely as a result of the depreciation of the Rupiah
during project implementation. Such changes (in either direction) in projects
of this kind, involving mainly a sector approach to lending, are to be
expected and acceptable.
C. Disbursements and Closing Date
3.12      Actual disbursement of the loan occurred over a considerably longer
period than anticipated, as indicated in Table 3. On December 31, 1980, the
original closing date, only 56% of the loan had been disbursed. The principal
reason for slow disbursement was, of course, the delay in project implementa-
tion as explained above. In addition, for a time the Government experienced
undue delays in making payments to contractors and these delays had the effect
of slowing withdrawals of loan funds. Once Government procedures were
improved in this regard, disbursements were expedited.
3.13      Under the loan agreement as signed, disbursements were made on the
basis of 60X of total project costs in all categories. Toward the end of the
project implementation, the Government requested an increase to 87.5% for
category I, costs of road betterment, to enable use of available loan funds
more quickly and thus avoid cancellation of a large amount of the loan on the
closing date. However, it was decided by mutual agreement instead to acceler-
ate the withdrdawal of loan funds by transferring project components from the
Fifth to the Fourth Highway Project, as noted above. Depreciation of the
Rupiah in 1982 and 1983 made it difficult for the Government to utilize all
the available funds in Loan 1236-IND before the final closing date.
3.14      The original closing date of December 31, 1980, was extended to
December 31, 1982, at the Government's request. Actual closing occurred on
July 13, 1983, at which time the Bank cancelled US$2.33 million of the loan.
D. Performance of Borrower, Consultants and Contractors
3.15      The performance of the borrower was generally satisfactory.  In the
early stages of project implementation, DGH had difficulty in coping with the
greatly expanded workload occasioned by the Fourth Highway Project. After



-7-
some months of rather difficult conditions, consultants' performance improved
and the DGH was better able to handle its workload. One of the more serious
shortcomings of the DGH was the failure at times to obtain Bank review of
design changes. Another problem was that of slow payments to contractors over
a period of several months. Overall, however, the borrower managed the major
undertaking with reasonable efficiency.
3.16      Borrower compliance with loan conditions was generally acceptable.
The Section 3.01 (d) requirement for an implementation review by Government
every six months was not regularly met although some review meetings were
held. Similarly, the Section 4.04 requirement regarding collection of traffic
data was only partially satisfied. Compliance with other provisions, however,
was generally satisfactory.
3.17      The performance of the various consultants varied, but was generally
good. In the early stages of project implementation, as noted earlier, the
principal DGH consultants, that is, those concerned with management, monitor-
ing and screening and evaluation, were somewhat slow to adapt to the situa-
tion, but after a few months of experience performance improved. Supervision
work by consultants was carried out satisfactorily.
3.18      Contractors performed acceptably in general, although several of
them had some initial difficulty. One of the firms defaulted and most of them
required somewhat more time to complete the work than was provided in their
contracts. Nontheless, quality was good and costs were reasonable. Manage-
ment problems were serious in a number of the Indonesian firms; some of them
alleviated these problems by obtaining expatriate assistance.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01      The impact of a particular project on institutional development is
difficult to assess even with detailed knowledge of the institutions
involved. Nevertheless, it seems evident that the technical assistance compo-
nent of the project was effective in enabling the DGH to manage a major
increase in work load. Undoubtedly, the local staff in DGH improved its capa-
bilities as a result of the training provided by the consultants and through
observation of the results of consultants work. There are indications that
DGH is better able to plan and administer its highway program as a result of
the technical assistance in the Fourth Highway Project.  The various studies
undertaken under the project provided substantial data, findings and recommen-
dations that are in various stages of implementation (with some modifications)
and are contributing to the strengthening of institutions concerned with both
roads and road transport.



-8-
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      Economic rates of return were calculated during the appraisal for
several road betterment works on several roads totalling about 550 km. Rates
of return were recently recalculated by DGH for certain project roads and the
results are shown in Table 6; the roads selected are considered reasonably
representative of the overall betterment works accomplished under the project.
5.02      The 251 km of roads for which economic rates of return have recently
been derived constitute 18% of the 1,392 km of roads improved under the proj-
ect. Among the three selected roads is one linking Padang and Sawahtambang
which connects the capital of West Sumatera with the Trans-Sumatera Highway
and traverses an area experiencing moderate economic growth. The second road
connects the West Java border with Cilicap on the southern coast of Central
Java. The third road links Wonorejo and Jember in East Java. The roads re-
evaluated are thus geographically dispersed and serve areas with diverse
economic conditions.
5.03      Rates of return for particular sections of the 83 km Padang-
Sawatambang road (Table 6) vary from 16 to 33%, the differences reflecting
largely the widely varying traffic volumes (Table 4); these rates are somewhat
higher than the 13-26% calculated at time of appraisal. On the 107 km West
Java Border-Cilicap road, the re-evaluated rates of return vary from 44-51%
for particular road sections compared with 25% overall at time of appraisal.
The recently calculated return for the 61 km Wonorejo-Jember road is 63%,
which reflects high levels of traffic as indicated in Table 4.
5.04      Among the factors explaining the relatively high rates of return for
betterment works are the following: (1) rapid general economic growth contri-
buting to a high rate of traffic growth; (2) low fuel prices stimulating rapid
traffic increases; (3) availability of a number of qualified local contractors
which had the effect of holding down construction costs. In future, condi-
tions may not be as favorable for traffic growth as in the period to 1983
because beginning in that year the rate of general economic growth declined
somewhat and fuel prices increased significantly as a result of Government
policy changes. Notwithstanding these indications of some moderation of
traffic growth, the economic returns from the road betterment works, based on
re-evaluation, are good and there is no doubt that the improved road
conditions will continue to have positive effects on the general economy of
Indonesia.
VI. THE ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK
6.01      Bank staff had an important role in the project from its inception
to its completion. During the course of project implementation the Bank head-
quarters sent 11 supervision missions to Indonesia for the Fourth Highway
Project and the performance was satisfactory. In addition, transport specia-
lists from the Resident Staff in Indonesia were involved in more or less con-
tinuous supervision of the project until September 1979 when the transport
unit in RSI was discontinued. The Bank continues to play an important role in



9-
helping to improve the highway sector through further loans, the most recent
being the Highway Betterment Project for US$240 million approved in April
1984, with continued emphasis on institution building and training.
6.02      In addition to strengthening DGH through technical assistance and
training to help improve its highway planning capacity, an objective which has
now been substantially achieved, the Fourth Highway Project also had, among
its objectives, revision of the law on vehicle weights and dimensions and
review and increase in the level of road user charges, particularly the
elimination of the implicit subsidy in fuel prices. Considerable progress on
both policy objectives has been achieved in the last two years:  fuel prices
have been substantially increased in a series of steps and regulations on
vehicle weights and dimensions have been issued.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The physical components of the project were carried out satis-
factorily although implementation required about two years more time than
planned.  Given the large size and complexity of the project along with
institutional limitations, the Bank was optimistic in the time required to get
things moving at the start of the project and the delay that occurred in
project implementation was, therefore, unavoidable. With a new concept
project such as this, a more realistic timetable should have been set.
7.02      The road betterment works financed by the project were economically
well justified as indicated in the high economic returns estimated for the
project components that were re-evaluated. Moreover, the improvement of key
road sections was an appropriate element in the Government's transport devel-
opment stra-cgy. The betterment program constituted a timely and economic
approach enabling the deferral of full reconstruction of the roads to a more
appropriate time. Unfortunately, the usefulness of the program has been
diminished by (a) the fact that the works were underdesigned for the traffic
volumes roads carry ; and (b) inadequate maintenance which will reduce the
life of the works.
7.03      The technical assistance provided under the project was essential
not only to enable the DGH to carry out the road betterment works but also to
strengthen the DGH which is responsible for a wide range of important activi-
ties in road transport.
