  with restoring infrastructure assets, production levels, and\n            food grain stocks. This is the first part of International\n            Development Association's three-part strategy to help\n            Bangladesh respond to the 1998 floods. The project will\n            provide assistance for: 1) the agricultural sector, to\n            ensure that farmers have adequate supplies of seeds,\n            fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs for planing the\n            next boro rice crops; 2) additional food grain imports in\n            order to maintain and augment food grain stocks that will\n            otherwise be depleted with the partial loss of two rice\n            crops; 3) the manufacturing sector, in order to enable\n            manufacturers to import machinery, spare parts, and other\n            raw materials; and 4) additional imports of fuel, cement,\n            and other construction materials that are needed for relief\n            operations and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1998-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
