satisfactory, and sustainability is likely, with modest\n            institutional development impacts. Both performances by the\n            Bank, and Borrower, are rated highly satisfactory, based on\n            the component ratings for lending, supervision, and\n            outcomes, and, on project preparation, implementation and\n            outcomes, respectively. But regardless of success, lessons\n            suggest that: 1) the endemic nature of natural hazards in\n            Bangladesh, call for a disaster preparedness to be included\n            as a central part of the country assistance strategy, to\n            explore if the operation of investment projects,\n            particularly infrastructure financing, could include\n            built-in clauses for a pre-negotiated flexibility on rapid\n            disbursement, should catastrophic events occur; 2) flexible,\n            but stringent fiduciary, and procurement framework should be\n            established in fast-track, emergency operations, to prevent\n            implementation delays based on governance issues. The\n            implementation of financial management systems in this\n            project, through reporting requirements, proved useful in\n            taking corrective measures, and allowed flexibility for\n            emergency procurement procedures; 3) the timely emergency\n            assistance generated considerable goodwill to ease\n            resolution of differences on difficult development issues;\n            and, 4) program finance for disaster recovery should be\n            explored, to be treated as a recurrent expenditure, in cases\n            such as Bangladesh."}, "docdt": "2000-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
