                         The Project has been moderately successful in achieving its development objectives.

                         With respect to Governance, the Ministry has succeeded in advancing a set of initiatives, which, taken as a whole, provide institutions with additional autonomy and accountability. At
                         the institutional level, University Councils have been established and are playing an increasingly large role in determining the direction of their respective institutions. In addition, it is
                         becoming common for institutions to submit annual financial reports and otherwise to improve their financial transparency. Progress on governance is expected to be sustained going
                         forward. With respect to quality, independent accreditation agencies are in place and working and more and more institutions now have and use internal quality assurance systems.
                         In many cases, institutions have converted their former internal training departments into full-fledged quality promotion offices. In addition, the use of credit-based programs has
                         become widespread and the levels of cooperation with foreign tertiary education institutions is robust. Progress with respect to finance has been slightly slower than for governance
                         and quality: disbursement of student loans and financial benefits has been quite successful. However, while both government allocations to tertiary education and institutional shares
                         of overall financing coming from tuition have increased in absolute terms, their progress has lagged slightly with respect to the overall rate of growth of resources in the system.
