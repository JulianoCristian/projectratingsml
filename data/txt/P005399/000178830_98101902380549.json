exchange cost of projects in industry in\n            general, and at least $14 million would go to\n            export-oriented industrial projects. The principal\n            objectives of the project are: (a) the provision of foreign\n            exchange needed to finance efficient projects undertaken by\n            manufacturing and service companies; this is a continuation\n            of the line of credit provided to BNDE under previous Bank\n            loans; (b) the promotion and financing of efficient\n            export-oriented projects (minimum 20 percent of the loan\n            component); the selection, evaluation, promotion and\n            follow-up of these projects, as well as other studies to be\n            undertaken, will help to develop BNDE expertise in this\n            field; and (c) the further strengthening of BNDE,\n            particularly in the areas of project supervision, collection\n            of arrears, as well as activities in support of\n            export-oriented industries."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
