sustainability as\n            likely, institutional development impact as modest, Bank\n            performance as unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. Moldova was a relatively new borrower.\n            Simultaneous preparation of multiple projects for a new\n            client country as overly ambitious, and, in the end, led to\n            costly project preparation with limited development impact.\n            Project design should be kept simple. There should have been\n            clear distinctions between public and private investments.\n            Initiating investment projects in an unstable environment is\n            risky but particularly so when support is given to\n            state-owned entities where major restructuring is looming.\n            High quality, state of the art equipment given to\n            non-reformed institutions in the public sector did not\n            necessarily improve the overall effectiveness of the\n            research institutes. Research should be funded by the\n            government, rather than requiring research institutes to\n            divert their efforts to commercial activities. When a loan\n            from an international financial institution is being\n            utilized, repayment matters should be addressed up front,\n            with cost recovery and repayment terms and conditions\n            clearly defined in the project document and properly\n            monitored during implementation. A public investment should\n            be clearly defined up-front, and specify appropriate cost\n            recovery rates. Support for research should have clear\n            linkages to the farming community."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
