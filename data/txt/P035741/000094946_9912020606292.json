Environmental Program\n            which seeks to improve environmental quality in priority\n            areas by increasing the effectiveness of environmental\n            institutions at local, state, and national levels in Brazil.\n            The project will focus on institutional strengthening, i.e.,\n            monitoring, licensing, and coastal zone management (CZM) and\n            the identification and prioritization of environmental\n            problems. It will strengthen decentralized environmental\n            management at a State and municipal level through two\n            components: 1) institutional strengthening and 2)\n            environmental assets. The institutional strengthening\n            component will support innovative activities to strengthen\n            and improve licensing procedures at a state level; improve\n            State-level water quality monitoring systems by financing\n            the upgrading of existing monitoring systems or installing\n            new monitoring systems in water basins where there are\n            actual or potential conflicts in water use; and support CZM\n            of up to 15 coastal states. 2) The environmental assets\n            component will provide technical assistance to States to\n            support a participatory process of priority-setting and the\n            adoption of improved policies and other measures to achieve\n            the priorities identified."}, "docdt": "1999-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
