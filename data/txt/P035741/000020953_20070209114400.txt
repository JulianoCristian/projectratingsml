6. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

6.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance).

Country Background:

Decentralization of services as part of GOB's economic stabilization plan ­ Since 1994, the GOB had
focused on economic stabilization, including control of inflation, control of public expenditures, debt
reduction, improved efficiency in public sector services, and privatization of state-owned enterprises in
key sectors. As part of its reform program, the Federal Government stressed decentralization of
government services in the areas of health, education, public sanitation, and others. The 1988 Federal
Constitution, mandated Federal-State and Federal-Municipal revenue transfers but in some sectors did
not create specific responsibilities for service delivery by States and Municipalities. In the
environmental area, the Constitution created "concurrent responsibility" for environmental protection
by States and Federal Government creating some ambiguities regarding institutional responsibilities.

1998 Financial Crisis - The financial crisis that struck Brazil in late 1998 had an impact on the
environment because the Government made deep budgetary cuts on a number of proposed and existing
environmental projects in the Ministry of Environment (MMA). Since then, the economy gradually
stabilized and the environment surfaced again as a priority for GOB. In addition, the crisis accentuated
GOB's need for fiscal discipline and institutional effectiveness, exerting pressure on ministries and
agencies to deliver concrete results.

Sector Background:

The Ministry of Environment (MMA) officially adopted a policy of decentralization of environmental
management. NEP II represented a priority and strategic program for the Ministry of Environment's
decentralization policy due to its innovative design and national approach. Minister Marina Silva, who
took office in 2002, presented her program of government as having four major pillars: (a)
decentralization, (b) strengthening the national environmental system (SISNAMA); (c) social control,
and (d) transversality.

Environment has been a growing priority in Brazil because of: (i) growing public awareness of
environmental issues and the need for improved environmental management; (ii) increasing
government sensitivity to domestic and external criticism of poor natural resource management; and
(iii) growing recognition in both the public and private sectors that better environmental management
provides a competitive edge to Brazilian business. Environmental problems in Brazil have nevertheless
continued to increase in severity. The main sector challenges encountered were:

                                                   3

Lack of clear and defined responsibility for environmental protection/management (federal x state x
municipal levels) ­ Even though the Brazilian Constitution establishes that the federal, state and
municipal governments are all responsible for environmental matters ­ each with its specific
attributions ­ in practice the Law (Lei Complementar) that would regulate such attributions has not yet
been drafted. In fact, the system created overlapping responsibilities and lacunae among the three
levels. Even at the federal level, the precise limits of action and attributions of the principal federal
enforcement agency (IBAMA) and MMA were far from clear.

Weak environmental management capacity of public agencies (particularly re. legislation,
monitoring and enforcement) ­ Brazil is a large country with 27 states at very different stages of
management capacity in terms of legislation, monitoring and enforcement capabilities. A study carried
out in 1997 entitled "State and Federal Environmental Demands Survey" concluded a weak capacity
of the public sector - particularly the state environmental agencies - to manage environmental issues
and foster sustainable development.

Rationale for Bank Assistance:

Bank's considerable experience on environmental matters and the successful implementation of the
First National Environmental Project - The Bank has a substantial history of working on
environmental matters in Brazil but only since the early nineties on more direct policies and
institutional issues. The First National Environmental Project (NEP-I, Loan 3173-BR), was one of the
early Bank stand-alone environmental projects worldwide, basically aimed at strengthening capacity
at the federal level and protecting key endangered ecosystems at a national level. The National
Environmental Project II ­ Phase I (Loan 4524-BR) of a three phase adaptable program loan (APL),
which is under review here, basically intended to continue efforts of the first NEP by solidifying the
national environmental management system.

The Bank also had considerable experience in Brazil and elsewhere in the design of decentralized,
demand-driven municipal development and natural resource management project components -
including the highly successful matching grants (PED) component of NEP I - and in the design and
implementation of social funds for rural poverty alleviation. While the latter operations aimed at
strengthening municipal governments or poverty alleviation rather than environmental protection, such
projects shared many characteristics with NEP II by combining Institutional Strengthening goals and
components with the financing of priority investments identified by local stakeholders.

The Second National Environmental Program (NEP-II) seeks to improve environmental quality in
priority areas by increasing the effectiveness of environmental institutions at local, state and national
levels in Brazil. The PDO of Phase I of the program (the project) is to "strengthen decentralized
environmental management at a State and Municipal level through two components implemented in
parallel fashion: (a) Institutional Strengthening and (b) Environmental Assets.

The first phase of the Program supported the adoption of policy improvements and the enhancement of
performance through the strengthening of decentralized environmental management. These policy
improvements would allow the states to qualify to receive grants for the implementation of
Environmental Assets subprojects to address concrete environmental issues identified in a priority-
setting exercise. The indicators for the project were measured in terms of:

    · Adoption of policy reforms through the fulfillment of eligibility criteria (See matrix in Section
        8.2);
    · Building consensus at the State level on environmental priorities and development of strategies
        for addressing them in twelve states;
    · Implementation of subprojects under the Environmental Assets component in at least three
        States;
    · Qualification of at least twelve States for matching grants in Phase II;
    · Modernize and update environmental licensing systems in at least ten States;
    · Increased transparency and accountability of environmental institutions through improved
        licensing procedures (including the use of new instruments such as compliance agreements,
        self-regulation, tradable permits and other innovative environmental management instruments)
        in at least ten states;
    · Implementation of improved and decentralized water quality monitoring (WQM) systems and
        dissemination mechanisms of relevant data to decision makers and the general public in a
        timely fashion in at least five States;

6.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

Since the project aimed at attaining measurable improvements in environmental quality in specific
regions, the beneficiaries identified were the populations adversely affected by pollution or other forms
of natural resource and environmental degradation ­ particularly the poor. Other beneficiaries
                                                    5

included: (i) local communities; (ii) States, municipalities and other entities (e.g. river basin
committees); (iii) local governments; (iv) NGOs; (v) the private sector; and (v) research institutions.

The participatory nature of the Environmental Assets subprojects ensured active involvement of the
poor in the design and implementation of the subprojects, as well as municipal and state government
agencies responsible for environmental protection and public health.




6.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project comprised the following three components: (A) Institutional Strengthening Component;
(B) Integrated Management of Environmental Assets; and (C) Project Coordination.

Part A: Institutional Strengthening Component
Strengthening of institutional capacity at the state level, focusing primarily on the following
instruments of environmental management:

1. Environmental Licensing (including enforcement and post-license monitoring capabilities). This
subcomponent supported the development of new and/or strengthening of existing state environmental
licensing systems and adoption and applicability of innovative instruments to turn the licensing
procedures into more efficient and transparent, through development of specific sub-projects.

2. Water Quality Monitoring. This subcomponent supported improvements in WQM systems in
participating states through the development of WQM models, water-quality information systems for
decision makers and the general public and through the development of specific WQM subprojects:

3. Coastal Zone Management. This subcomponent strengthened the national shoreline management
system through a series of studies (including classification of shoreline types, fragile coastal habitats,
and socio-economic analyses of coastal and on-shore marine biodiversity), and subprojects aimed at
developing environmental zoning activities and management plans.

Part B: Integrated Management of Environmental Assets
The Environmental Assets (EA) component provided technical assistance to States through MMA and
supported a participatory process of priority-setting and the adoption of improved policies, laws and
regulations and other measures to improve their overall capacity for environmental management and to
address the state's key environmental priorities. In addition, participating states designed and
implemented EA Subprojects aimed at improving environmental quality.

Part C: Project Coordination Component

                                                      6

This component supported the PCU which carried out overall project management, monitoring and
evaluation, institutional coordination, financial management, procurement and other necessary
administrative activities required by the Project.

6.6 Revised Components
N/A

6.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

There were three amendments to the Loan Agreement. The first amendment (June 18, 2003) extended
the Closing Date of the Project from June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2005 and cancelled an amount
equivalent to US$2,318,500.00 from the Loan at the request of MMA. This amendment was solicited
based on: (a) changes of State officials and limitations on the ability to sign operating agreements
(convênios) with participating States during electoral periods, causing delays and affecting the
disbursement patterns; and (b) states took longer than anticipated to qualify for matching grants and in
implementing sub-projects. The first cancellation of loan proceeds was a result of the fiscal austerity
package implemented by the Ministry of Finance which led to severe budgetary restrictions on all
Federal projects in Brazil and which reduced budget allocations to MMA, affecting the resources
destined to NEP-II. As a result, project implementation was adversely affected by the limitation of
resources available to finance core activities and components as initially programmed, leading to a
reduction in the scope of activities. Other investments in various sectors also experienced similar
budgetary constraints.

The second amendment (May 25, 2005) extended the closing date of the project from June 30, 2005 to
June 30, 2006, bringing cumulative extensions to 3 years. This extension requested by the Borrower
was granted to allow: (i) the completion of ongoing Environmental Assets subprojects in qualified
states; (ii) finalize key environmental licensing and monitoring activities; and (iii) allow time for the
transition and preliminary preparation of phase 2 of the program.

The third amendment (June 27, 2005) cancelled an amount US$3,681,500.00 from Loan proceeds at
the request of MMA. This cancellation followed the rearrangement of scheduled activities to be
completed within the approved closing date (June 30, 2006).

Consequently, the cumulative cancellations to the project were equal to about US$6 million. These
reductions in the overall budget implied a reduction in scope and scale of EA subprojects. For
instance, due to limitations in budgetary allocations, MMA was able to finance 10 EA subprojects in 9
states out of 21 states that qualified for grants during Phase 1. Delays in achieving eligibility, in some
cases, also contributed to the inability to finance EA subprojects. Still, it is worth noting, that the
number of EA subprojects financed under NEP-II far exceeds the pre-established goal of at least 3
subprojects established at appraisal. The reduction in loan allocation in US Dollars was partly offset
by a revaluation of Brazilian currency after appraisal.

7. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

7.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations identified,
and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

NEP II was prepared following the successful implementation of the First National Environmental
Project (NEP-I), from which three important lessons were drawn: (i) Borrower commitment and
capacity need to be ensured (Borrower's capacity to implement projects was limited during NEP-I and
there appeared to be difficulties to increase the Borrower's motivation to implement environmental
education and protected areas components); (ii) project components for which there is no clear demand
from the end users or beneficiaries are unlikely to succeed; and (iii) institutional strengthening without
clear output objectives related to the goals of the institution is unlikely to succeed.

These lessons were taken into account in the design of NEP II. A decentralized demand-based
component became the centerpiece of NEP II. Under NEP II, the process of achieving eligibility was
strengthened and made more flexible. While for NEP I all the States were required to fulfill the same
eligibility requirements to access matching grants, under NEP II, participating States were allowed to
qualify for matching grants at three different levels with correspondingly different amounts of
resources. Also, rather than a uniform set of requirements, States could select from a list of ten
different areas of environmental protection and demonstrate their capacity at any of three levels for
each criterion1. The size of the grant made available to the States was determined by the total number
of points earned by a State in the fulfillment of the eligibility criteria: Class I (5-9 points) entitled a
state to a grant of US$2.0 million; Class II (10 -18 points) entitled a state to a grant of US4.0 million;
Class III (19 - 27 points) entitled a state to a grant of US$8.0 million2. The principal risks identified at
appraisal are presented in Table 1 below (see next page). The risk rating is shown at its appraisal value
then at its ex post value. The final column provides an assessment of how realistic the risk rating was
and what was the outcome.

The Risk Ratings, in general, when confronted with the actual experience of the project, often
overstated the risk involved. A few of the risks were understated, however, namely those that are
associated with insufficient budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance to MMA. As detailed
elsewhere in this report, budgetary allocations and releases for the project consistently fell short of
expectations in spite of the fact that the project's financial performance was exemplary since the

1 For instance, under the Forestry Resource Management criteria, level one was achieved by presenting evidence of having
adopted State Forestry Legislation and the regulations needed for its implementation. Level two was achieved by providing
evidence that the means to effectively enforce forestry legislation were in place. Level three was achieved by presenting
evidence that time-bound and enforceable action plans and programs were in place for the effective and comprehensive
management of forest resources, involving both the setting and fulfillment of quantitative goals of forest management.
States earned one, two or three points for achievement of the corresponding level of eligibility, classifying them into 3
levels.

project consistently utilized about 98% of the total funds made available by MMA over its years of
operation. This is considered one the best record of any MMA program under recent execution. With
regard to participatory processes, the priority-setting exercise and the subsequent implementation of
subprojects in participating states provided excellent opportunities for civil society to participate in the
setting of priorities and in the design of subprojects. In most States, NGOs participated fully at all
stages of the process, with strong encouragement from the Ministry of Environment.

                                                        minimize the likelihood of instability. There were some

                                                        when new officials took charge but they were unsuccessful.

States use political rather than          N-M ­>-L      This risk was overestimated. The clarity of the criteria and

States find it difficult to agree on       N   N        While the priority-setting activity sparked lively debate in
priorities.                                             several states, reaching agreement on priorities was not very

7.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken, as
applicable).

Coordination and overall implementation: The implementation of key activities began well before
loan effectiveness, demonstrating the commitment of MMA to the objectives of the project. These
activities included a preliminary assessment of the licensing and environmental management systems
in the States to determine their strengths and weaknesses and potential areas for intervention. The
project PCU has been kept staffed with highly qualified personnel who managed to establish an
effective `bridge' between the States and MMA on strategic issues regarding environmental policy
issues and project implementation.

Challenges in Implementation: The project never was considered at risk or in peril of not achieving its
DO, and thus it did not require any major restructuring in its design. However, there were a number of
challenges experienced during project implementation which were addressed accordingly.                     These
included:

    (i)     Delays in the signing of contracts due to slow administrative procedures by UNDP. MMA
            has relied on UNDP as a service provider for letting contracts. MMA met with UNDP to
            seek to make the process more efficient. In addition, the project began planning in advance
            for contracts (through the POA) taking into account potential delays encountered through
            UNDP's procedures;
    (ii)    Risks of continuity in project implementation due to staff changes in the coordination of the
            project. MMA accepted the Bank's recommendation by appointing a new project
            coordinator the NEP-II team familiar with the key stakeholders and with the overall
            execution of the project and thus avoiding disruption in project implementation;
    (iii)   Personnel changes in State administrations leading to loss of institutional memory;
    (iv)    Limitations on the ability to sign operating agreements (convênios) with participating States
            during electoral periods, causing delays and affecting the disbursement patterns.
    (v)     Few states (AC, MG, PE) had minor deviations of the procurement guidelines. MMA
            provided procurement training courses to all participating States, and issued warnings to
            States that did not comply with the Bank's procurement guidelines;
    (vi)    Reduced budgetary allocation, impoundments and budget freezes from the Ministry of
            Finance to MMA occurred each year since implementation began as a result of fiscal
            stabilization programs and currency fluctuations. The MMA and the Bank agreed on two
            cancellations of loan proceeds in the order of US$6 million, and adjustments in the scope
            and scale of phase 1. The latter implied a risk for MMA of losing credibility by not being
            able to provide resources in a timely fashion for the implementation of subprojects in the
            States. In spite of these reductions, States are willing and interested in participating in
            Phase 2 of the program;
    (vii)   Lack of reliable baseline data to measure actual changes in environmental quality through
            the implementation of subprojects at the state level;

                                                     11

    (viii) A flexible methodology provided by MMA for determining the State's environmental
            priorities which was not closely monitored sometimes led to arbitrary decisions (e.g.
            selecting priorities that matched well the expected size of the matching grants rather than
            the most pressing environmental problem in the state.

7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project PCU established a monitoring and evaluation system to track the implementation of project
activities and determine the attainment of DO.            The project team has closely followed project
implementation against the project indicators from the logical framework in the PAD and has
periodically reported on the attainment and progress made in each project component. In 2004, MMA
launched a publication highlighting the report of activities and level of implementation of the project
during the 2000-2004 time period, and held a high level workshop where the key outcomes of NEP-II
were presented and testimonies of key beneficiaries were highlighted (the workshop was hosted by the
Minister of Environment with the participation of both Country Director and Sector directors from the
Bank). The amount of information generated on the specific outcomes by component activities in each
state demonstrates a high level of monitoring and assessment both on technical aspects (including the
multiple activities in the participating States) as well as on overall management and administrative
aspects (including procurement and financial management). The Bank has also carried out multiple
supervision missions (two to three per year) were it has reviewed progress in project implementation
from the reports and presentations provided by MMA.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project, as implemented, triggered environmental and social safeguard policies to a limited extent.
The only specific safeguard policy triggered was OP4.01 (Environmental Assessment). In addition,
framework documents were prepared during the lending phase that which served as basic guidelines for
subproject screening and evaluation. Framework documents were prepared by the project team for
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) but these policies were
not triggered. Subprojects were screened both by the individual States and by the PCU before being
financed.    The main subprojects that required environmental assessment were sanitary landfills
financed under the Environmental Assets Component in Bahia and Pernambuco States.                    These
subprojects were evaluated and licensed by their respective State Environmental Agencies, fulfilling
Bank requirements for EA.

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present operation,
Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-
up operation, if applicable)



                                                        12

The project was the first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) consisting of three phases for a
total amount of US$150 million. Due to delays experienced in the transitional period, Phase 2 could
not be financed immediately following the close of Phase 1. As described in Annex 1, the Project has
exceeded by far the targets set for Phase 1 and has fulfilled the triggers for Phase 2 much earlier than
anticipated.   This was largely a consequence of the enthusiastic reception of the project by the
participating States. The success of the project design and the consequent strengthening of the National
Environmental System (SISNAMA) of which the States are the building blocks, have motivated the
Ministry of Environment (with the endorsement of the Association of State Environmental Agencies
(OEMA) to secure authorization to prepare Phase 2 of the project from the Inter-ministerial Committee
on External Finance (COFIEX).

8. Assessment of Outcomes

8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Brazil for the period 2004- 2007 lays stress on four
pillars: equity, sustainability, competitiveness and macroeconomic fundamentals. NEP-II design has
contributed primarily to addressing sustainability and competitiveness. The CAS makes reference to
the lack of a clear regulatory framework in Brazil, particularly as regards water supply and sanitation.
One aspect of the regulatory framework that has drawn considerable attention in Brazil concerns the
requirements for environmental licensing that apply to nearly every productive enterprise that has a
potential environmental impact. NEP-II made significant contributions to the efficiency and
transparency of the environmental licensing system in several different states. For instance, before the
project began, only five states had computerized environmental licensing systems in place (RS, PR, SP,
BA, and PE). Thereafter, through NEP-II, 7 more states developed their respective licensing systems
(SC, MG, GO, MT, AC, PB & CE). The State's commitment to the project's objectives has been
noteworthy.

Among the major achievements under this subcomponent (Environmental Licensing) were the
preparation and adoption of new licensing systems by the State of Minas Gerais, Ceará and Paraíba,
and the adaptation of existing digital systems (based mainly on a software package and procedures that
originated in the State of Bahia) for use in other states. The specific requirements are available on each
State's website and proponents can prepare the required documentation and submit it for review at their
own pace. This has made the environmental licensing process more efficient and agile in these states,
addressing a major demand in various economic sectors, especially energy and manufacturing. In
addition, a total of 12 states (Acre, Bahia, Ceará, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Paraíba,
Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina & São Paulo) made improvements in their licensing
system by adopting digital systems, decentralizing and/or deconcentrating licensing procedures,
developing new operational manuals, training their staff, making the process more transparent by
posting data on the internet. These activities have contributed to making environmental licensing more
agile and more transparent at the State level. In summary, strengthening environmental licensing
contributes not only to sustainability but also to competitiveness in a global environment in which the
                                                       13

environmental impact of productive systems is increasingly taken into consideration by producers,
consumers and governments.

NEP-II also focused on sustainability by contributing to the growth and development of WQM systems
and specific projects in ten states3. These projects have basically focused on structural, technological,
capacity building, and social participation in WQM. The standardization (across states and river
basins) of basic WQM parameters and the development of strategic monitoring systems is an essential
requirement for the management of river basins, particularly those that are threatened by particular
problems such as agricultural runoff, intensive livestock systems, industrial wastes and others pollution
sources.

NEP-II also contributed to the further development of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) systems at a
state level, building on previous work under NEP I. This work created tools useful for managing
coastal zones where the majority of Brazil's population lives and where there are multiple challenges to
the stability and sustainability of natural resources arising from urban waste, shipping, erosion and
agricultural runoff, aquaculture, resort development and others. The integrated planning approach
embedded in the CZM methodology has enhanced the ability of States to deal with a wide array of
issues along Brazil's coast in a comprehensive fashion. This includes integrated planning exercises
being carried out jointly between MMA (with NEP assistance) and the Coastline Project (Projeto Orla)
under implementation by the Federal Property Office (Departamento de Patrimônio da União).

The project also made numerous contributions to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals
Number 7, namely, "To Ensure Environmental Stability." The contributions have come in various
forms, first in the strengthening of monitoring, licensing and planning systems under the Institutional
Development Component, and second in the advancing of environmental policies in the States through
fulfillment of the eligibility criteria in the policy matrix, and finally from investments made to directly
improve environmental quality in the states that received grants for subprojects. It is noteworthy that
many of the investments made were in areas of environment that have a direct relationship to human
health and well being such as solid waste management, river basin management, water quality
improvements, etc.

8.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4)

The overarching program development objectives which seek to improve environmental quality in
priority areas by increasing the effectiveness of environmental institutions at local, state and national
levels in Brazil have been met. Likewise, the PDO specific for Phase 1 of the APL which aims to
"strengthen decentralized environmental management at a State and Municipal level through two
components implemented in parallel fashion: (a) Institutional Strengthening and (b) Environmental
Assets" have been satisfactorily attained.

In spite of two cancellations of loan proceeds and delays in implementation of some activities, the
project has not only met the key performance indicators, but in all instances surpassed them (see Table
3 below in Section 8.4 and Annex 4 for additional detailed information). For instance, prior to the
project, only four states had any kind of computer system for environmental licensing (RS, PR, SP,
BA). By the end of phase 1, seven more states had developed digital licensing systems (SC, MG, GO,
MT, AC, PB & CE) which has made the licensing process more transparent and efficient. Likewise,
before NEP-II, most states had not carried out an assessment to identify their most critical
environmental priorities. By the end of the project, 25 out of the 27 states had carried out identification
of key environmental priorities and 21 States had qualified for matching grants by fulfilling eligibility
criteria leading to improved policy reforms (the initial target was for 12 states qualifying). Likewise, it
was foreseen that by, the end of Phase 1, three states would be implementing environmental quality
subprojects. At the end Phase 1, 9 states were implementing subprojects. As illustrated in Table 3
below and in Annex 4, NEP-II contributed to the implementation of 43 specific interventions in 17
States4 leading to improvements in decentralized environmental management.

The two core components had measurable and observable outcomes. For instance, the implementation
of the Institutional Strengthening Component led to the development and improvement of key tools for
environmental management in states and municipalities. The environmental licensing process in Brazil
has become largely bureaucratic and pro forma for a variety of reasons including the lack of clear
regulations, failure to set priorities, poor quality environmental analysis and the lack of post-license
monitoring. Thus, even where environmental licenses were issued with clear conditions, there was
frequently no follow-up on compliance.                  The environmental licensing subcomponent therefore
contributed significantly to making the licensing a more effective tool for environmental management
by standardizing procedures, and making licenses more transparent and enforceable in the participating
states. As illustrated in Annex 4, twelve states managed to either develop and/or improve their
environmental licensing systems, surpassing the initial goal of 10 states.




4This number includes interventions in the three Institutional Strengthening subcomponents as well as the Environmental
Assets subprojects.

                                                            15

The WQM subcomponent did not in itself improve water quality but it laid the basis for correctly
diagnosing water quality problems and taking effective action to mitigate the problems and improve it
in several river basins. Specific complementary actions to improve water quality were taken in the
Araguaia (Mato Grosso), Ipojuca (Pernambuco), Paraguaçu (Bahia) and Tietê (São Paulo) basins under
the Environmental Assets component. These rivers comprise one of the primary sources of water for
the capitals of the respective States; the WQM work allowed State governments to make choices
among alternative basin management strategies, and to monitor the impact of specific measures taken.

In the State of Bahia, for example, the actions selected included reducing burning as a means of
clearing and reducing pesticide use, while in Pernambuco the measures included developing sanitary
landfills and protecting the fragile stream head areas.          In São Paulo, the measures included
encouragement of organic agriculture and reduction in pesticide use in the Tietê headwaters. In Mato
Grosso, the EA component financed erosion control in the Araguaia and Taquari headwaters and the
results were tangible and visible because the growth of some enormous gullies was arrested. An
important lesson is that baseline data must be collected before a subproject is implemented in order to
measure the impact of the actions taken. In nearly all cases, the states selected specific environmental
parameters that could be measured directly or indirectly. The outcome/impact indicators and output
indicator for the WQM subcomponent established that at least five states would have improved
licensing procedures implemented. As illustrated in Table 3 below and Annex 4, by the end of the
project ten states had established WQM systems through the support of the project.

The CZM subcomponent contributed to strengthening the national shoreline management system
through a series of studies (including classification of shoreline types, fragile coastal habitats, and
socio-economic analyses of coastal and on-shore marine biodiversity), and subprojects aimed at
developing environmental zoning activities and management plans. At the end of the project, 11 states
improved their planning capacity for CZM (see Table 3 below and Annex 4 for a detailed description
of activities per State).

Likewise, the Environmental Assets (EA) component contributed not only to the improvement and/or
adoption of crucial environmental policies in states through the fulfillment of the eligibility criteria (see
Table 2 below), but also to the definition of priorities and to the implementation of EA subprojects. For
example, from the outset of the project, nearly all of the States (with the exception of Pará, Amazonas
and Rondônia) carried out environmental priority-setting exercises with the assistance and
methodology provided by MMA. One benefit of this exercise is that it allowed some States to identify
common regional environmental problems such as the one produced from livestock wastes in the three
southern states (RS, SC, PR).

Participation in the EA component was voluntary, and States selected criteria for which they presented
evidence to a ministerial supervisory commission which evaluated their adoption of policy
improvements. Thus, fulfillment of eligibility criteria under the EA component served as an incentive
for States to carry out policy reforms in environmental management. States could qualify at any of
three Levels for each criterion. For each criterion, the attainment of the next higher level required the
State to demonstrate increased capacity to manage environmental resources. States earned one, two or
                                                    16

three points for achievement of the corresponding level of eligibility5. The total points earned by a
state would palace it in one of three Classes, corresponding to different Matching Grant amounts. Class
I (5-9 points) entitled a state to a grant of US$2.0 million; Class II (10 -18 points) entitled a state to a
grant of US4.0 million; Class III (19 - 27 points) entitled a state to a grant of US$8.0 million. Table 2
below illustrates the level of fulfillment for each eligibility criteria, and class attained by each of the
participating states by the closing of the project.




5For example, under the Forestry Resource Management criteria, level one was achieved by presenting evidence of having
adopted State Forestry Legislation and the regulations needed for its implementation. Level two was achieved by providing
evidence that the means to effectively enforce forestry legislation were in place. Level three was achieved by presenting
evidence that time-bound and enforceable action plans and programs were in place for the effective and comprehensive
management of forest resources, involving both the setting and fulfillment of quantitative goals of forest management.

Under the EA component, eligible States could prepare subproject proposals with assistance from
MMA, based on the pre-identified priorities. The priorities identified and subprojects approved
included the following: (i) water quality and livestock wastes (Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul &
Parana); (ii) protection of critical watersheds (São Paulo, Goiás, Bahia, Minas Gerais and
Pernambuco); (iii) natural resource conservation involving erosion control and sustainable tourism
(upper Araguaia basin in Mato Grosso); and (iv) protection of the Caatinga biome (the gypsum
producing region of Pernambuco).

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for the Second National Environmental Project is satisfactory based on the
design which has contributed to building the key pillars outlined in the CAS for the period 2004-2007
(particularly regarding sustainability and competitiveness).         In addition, Phase 1 of the NEP-II
surpassed all performance indicators and fulfilled the triggers that would allow the program to move to
its second phase, in spite of cancellation of loan proceeds and delays in its implementation.
Furthermore, NEP-II has allowed for the consolidation of key aspects of environmental management in
participating states and municipalities with regards to environmental licensing, WQM and coastal zone
management.      Likewise, NEP-II promoted the adoption and improvement of key environmental
policies (through the fulfillment of the eligibility criteria for the EA component), and to improvements
of environmental quality through the implementation of specific interventions aimed at addressing the
participating state's environmental priorities. The table below illustrates the overall fulfillment of key
indicators by closing of the project.

As highlighted in the tables above, NEP-II contributed to the implementation of 43 specific
interventions in 17 States. In addition, it has also played a key role in the following:
    (i)     strengthening environmental policy at the state and local level (i.e. supported management
            models for solid waste management in urban centers, infrastructure, environmental
            awareness and education campaigns, coastal economic-ecological zoning);
    (ii)    strengthening key instruments of environmental management established in the National
            Law of the Environment (No. 6938/81), particularly with regard to developing State
            environmental licensing, and WQM systems which help establish the National System of
            Environmental Information (SINIMA);
    (iii)   developing sustainable environmental quality subprojects (such as swine waste treatment,
            conservation of soils and water resources, sustainable agriculture, etc.);
    (iv)    establishing strategic alliances and inter-institutional articulation among States and key
            agencies.

The states' commitment to the project's objectives has also been noteworthy, and there are numerous
outcomes from NEP-II that have been praised and recognized by MMA, including open
communication among states to share experiences in the fulfillment of eligibility criteria (contributing
to a healthy competition) and the design and implementation of subproject activities.

8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Many of the State subprojects proposed under the Environmental Assets Subprojects contributed to
important improvements in quality of life for the poor. This is particularly the case with regard to the
solid waste management plans, and the river basin management studies and action plans carried out on
the key watersheds that supply water to the capital cities of the States of Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas

                                                          20

Gerais, São Paulo and Goiás (see Section 8.1). The studies and plans prepared for these River Basins
are designed to reduce contamination of water supplies arising from erosion, pesticide use, burning of
fields, solid-waste disposal and other sources. Actual works and basin-management programs were
carried out in São Paulo, Bahia and Pernambuco. Additionally, the project supported the development
of WQM systems in all of these states as well as in Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. In
the latter three states, the project supported pilot activities designed to reduce water and soil
contamination caused by intensive livestock production on small farms. These subprojects helped to
reduce the exodus of small farmers to urban areas, and ultimately improve the water quality conditions
on some key watersheds in these states. The project also supported a number of activities aimed at
increasing the social benefits of ecotourism in the Araguaia River Basin in Mato Grosso as well as
reducing some of the negative social impacts of tourism in the region.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
     (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and Institutional Development)

First, the project generated great commitment by States for the fulfillment of eligibility criteria and
great demand for the financing of EA subprojects. While this it itself exceeded the performance
indicators set forth at the launching of the project, it also allowed to fostering of a solid working
relationship and articulation between the States and MMA, which was not fully articulated prior to
NEP-II.

Secondly, by strengthening of               the National Environmental System (SISNAMA), MMA has
internalized many of the products and outcomes and has developed a strong ownership of NEP-II,
particularly for the following activities: (i) the National Plan for Environmental Licensing; (ii) the
WQM Plan; (iii) Coastal Zone Management; (iv) the development of Solid Waste Management Plans;
and (v) the reference data for the Environmental Management System (SIGAB) and for the National
Environmental System of Information (SINIMA). NEP-II has been mainstreamed within the Ministry
as the primary vehicle for articulation between the States and the Federal Government on
Environmental Matters MMA will finance the operating costs of the PCU during the transition phase
in preparation for Phase 2 of the program.

In addition, as per Table 4 below, the project has contributed to institutional change in various ways in
nearly all of Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District.

Perhaps the most significant activity from an institutional perspective was the Environmental
Licensing subcomponent of the Institutional Development Component, which led to the creation or
strengthening of Environmental Licensing Systems in 12 States. Two states (Bahia and Minas Gerais)
have led the others in the development of computerized systems for tracking the progress of the
licensing process and opening the way for the use of licensing as an environmental management tool.
The systems developed were adapted for use in 9 states (AC, BA, CE, GO, MG, MT, PB, RS, SC)
making the process simpler and faster for licensees and more transparent for the public at large.

Fulfillment of the criteria on the Environmental Assets Eligibility Matrix also promoted considerable
institutional growth through the adoption of new legislation and regulations in several states and
through the development of institutional capacity for environmental management in several sectors
including: (i) water resources; (ii) forestry; (iii) pollution control; (iv) WQM and other areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

The project had a number of very positive collateral benefits. It is worth noting that NEP-II has
contributed to a number of institutional partnerships involving State Environmental Agencies,
municipalities, NGOs, universities, research centers and training centers, water-resource management
agencies, tourism agencies, regional development agencies, agricultural development agencies and the
private sector. For instance, NEP II has served as a platform for significant sectoral agreements and
environmental mainstreaming including: (i) an agreement between the Itaipú Binational Power
Company and the Ministry of Environment (MMA); and (ii) an agreement between MMA and the
National Water Regulatory Agency (ANA), whereby ANA has agreed to host one of NEP-II's key
products: the website on water quality in Brazil. This website, financed by NEP II, includes up-to-date
monitoring data on several key river basins in Brazil, using a uniform methodology and set of
measures. This is the first nationwide instrument of its type in Brazil. Most of these partnerships
involve mutual or coinciding interests and they do not depend exclusively on NEP-II funding to
persist. In fact, it is important to recognize that NEP II has also served to leverage funds by requiring
state matching resources which in some cases, have exceed the value of resources contributed by NEP
II.

Another notable unintended benefit was that through the identification of environmental priorities
promoted by NEP-II, the three southern states (Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul)
identified a common problem: the pollution to key watersheds from livestock wastes. In addition, to
getting support from the Institutional Development and from the EA Components to address this

                                                             22

regional issue, in 2002 the Bank managed to secure resources (US$539,000) through the Bank
Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) Trust Fund to complement activities under the WQM
subcomponent under NEP-II. In particular, the project financed through the BNPP focused on two
specific activities: (i) developing a decision making tool for use by State licensing agencies and other
decision makers and (ii) on the development of a tool for monitoring environmental quality in
watersheds heavily impacted by intensive livestock production. The activities promoted through this
project benefited from the participation of a wide range of specialized technicians from state
environmental agencies responsible for the environmental licensing. This ensured a high level of
discussion and analysis regarding the proposed methodologies and procedures. Furthermore, there is
currently demand from other states and by MMA to apply the methodology developed by this project
in key watersheds of other states which suffer from severe pollution. The outcomes of this project have
been presented to MMA, State representatives, environmental agencies from other states and
association of swine producers in 2005, and will be published in monograph form jointly by MMA and
the Bank.

8.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

In October 2004 MMA held a high level workshop where the key outcomes and experiences of NEP-II
during the 2000-2004 period were presented. This workshop also served to hear the opinions of key
beneficiaries (including association of solid waste collectors, swine producers, municipal and state
representatives, etc.) who benefited from activities promoted by NEP-II and to have exchanges among
participating states. An independent assessment of phase 1 (the National Environmental Program-
PNMA-II Activities Report 2000-2004) was published for the workshop, summarizing the key
conclusions and status of implementation of the project (available in project files). The workshop was
hosted by Minister of Environment and had the participation of country and sector directors.

9. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Satisfactory

The risk to development outcome for the project is rated as "satisfactory" for the following reasons:

    · Institutional Development. Activities promoted under the project have helped to strengthened
        the technical and administrative capacity of State Environmental Agencies (OEMAs) to carry
        out specific environmental management tasks more efficiently (particularly with regards to
        environmental licensing, coastal zone management and environmental quality monitoring).
        This enhanced capacity has been tested and incorporated into the OEMAs daily operations,
        despite changes in state administrations. Thus, there is minimal risk that the outcomes of the
        project will not be maintained and continued after project closure.

    · Awareness raising. Several of the project's activities and partnerships have contributed to
        raise environmental awareness and generate an informed public opinion, which is likely to
        maintain pressure on states to keep addressing the most critical environmental issues. This
                                                        23

         awareness is also likely to enable the role of civil society, universities and NGOs in
         maintaining pressure on state governments and on MMA to keep an adequate environmental
         management.

     · Enhanced local demand. The demand by States to participate voluntarily in NEP-II has
         exceeded initial expectations and has demonstrated the value of promoting decentralized
         environmental management in Brazil through concrete incentives. NEP-II has confirmed that a
         change to the `top-down' approach of environmental management by focusing on enhancing
         sub-national and local capacity to deal with environmental issues renders concrete benefits,
         including: (i) creating local ownership in the process of identifying, prioritizing and addressing
         critical issues; (ii) promoting environmental awareness and enabling the local decision making
         process; (iii) enhancing local technical and administrative capacity; (iv) allowing states to
         engage in a healthy competition with one another (and enhancing bilateral technical exchanges)
         regarding the fulfillment of policy reforms through the project's eligibility criteria; All of the
         above reflect that the approach started through NEP-I and enhanced through NEP-II is robust
         and likely to be sustained with low risks of being derailed.

     · Commitment by MMA. The acceptance and recognition of NEP-II by MMA has grown strong
         through time (in spite of changes in administration) to the point that it now features as one of
         the most prominent programs and key vehicles by which the Ministry of Environment
         articulates with the States. It has also contributed to the development of key policies at a
         national level (i.e. strengthening the SISNAMA), and many of its key activities WQM, coastal
         zone management, etc.) have been internalized by MMA. In addition, NEP-II has been the best
         performing project within MMA from a financial perspective, spending about 90 percent of the
         allocated from effectiveness through the end of 2005 . Given these characteristics, MMA chose
         to endorse and support phase 2 of NEP-II for financing in 2005 over other programs
         demonstrating the high institutional value which has been vested in NEP-II.               MMA's
         commitment is therefore an ensuring factor of the sustainability of the project's outcomes.

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

10.1 Bank
a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned in section 7.1, the Bank prepared NEP-II based on the lessons from the implementation
of the First National Environmental Project (NEP-I). The team leader during the preparation of NEP-II
was the team leader and an integral member during the implementation of NEP-I, allowing for
continuity with the project's PCU at MMA and for a full integration of the experiences and lessons
into project design. Project preparation also benefited from the active participation from country office

                                                     24

staff which served to provide the required local technical support and as a sounding board on key
issues happening in the country which could affect project preparation.

The team carried out 8 missions during the preparation period and developed and maintained a close
working relationship with the counterparts at MMA which facilitated the preparation process. The
team also carried out a series of workshops (Brasília, Rio de Janeiro, and Recife) with representatives
from leading NGOs to get their feedback and reach a consensus on critical aspects of project design.
These workshops also served to determine the States' interest and willingness to participate in the
project, and to establish the project's performance indicators. The project team also held three separate
workshops with State Environment Secretaries to discuss the project design and make adjustments in
the eligibility criteria.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision of the project was continuous and intense, in part because of the relatively innovative
aspect of this project and the need to keep track of the various implementation sites where the project
was implemented. In all, a total of 14 supervision missions were conducted over the 7 years of project
implementation. In addition, there was an active correspondence and constant communication between
the Bank and the PCU on virtually all issues of implementation. Aside from project management, all
project implementation was carried out by the participating States. Although the supervision budget
for the project was low, supervision missions were conducted regularly and they often included visits
to specific states to observe project implementation and to discuss the project with the States that were
implementing it. These visits included site visits to the States of Bahia, Pernambuco, Mato Grosso,
Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul.

For each supervision mission, a complete monitoring report was presented by the PCU that included a
narrative description and assessment of each project component, subcomponent and activity, with
indicators of project completion, disaggregated and aggregated financial indicators, procurement and
disbursement indicators and discussion of general and specific problems. This was greatly facilitated
by the careful attention to project monitoring by the PCU and by the designation of specific team
members accountable for each project subcomponent in each participating state.

During implementation, there was one overall supervision mission of procurement which reviewed a
set of procurement transactions carried out by a random selection of states and by the PCU itself. In
addition, for most of the implementation period, the TTL was procurement certified and kept close
watch on procurement matters. No serious problems were detected although there were a few cases in
which States had reverted to local rather than Bank procurement guidelines. Disbursement and
financial management were monitored by the team itself and, again, thanks to the careful accounting
and reporting procedures by the PCU, this task was made simple. The project financial audits were
submitted on time and in accordance with the Loan Agreement. No major issues were uncovered by
the audits. FMRs were submitted at regular intervals and they were reviewed by the project team.
                                                   25

In summary, the quality of Supervision is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory based on the mix of staff expertise and skills both
during preparation and in supervision and by the time dedicated to ensuring compliance with
procurement, financial management, safeguards and technical aspects during implementation, in spite
of budgetary limitations. Furthermore, there has been little disruption in the continuity of the task
teams between lending and supervision. In the life of the project since preparation began, there have
only been two task managers. The current TM participated throughout preparation and supervision,
and the former TM became an integral team member during the last phase of project supervision. This
has guaranteed a solid technical and administrative continuity by the Bank, which has also fostered a
strong working relationship with the client and key stakeholders. In addition, the Bank team carried
numerous missions and field visits which guaranteed a constant and efficient supervision. In addition,
the Bank managed to secure additional financing through a BNPP-TF, which complemented specific
project activities in Brazil's three southern States. The Bank team also acted swiftly during critical
times when the GOB requested a cancellation of loan proceeds and extensions to the closing date, and
constantly alerted management and the borrower of potential risks during project implementation.

10.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory, based on the generally excellent
performance of the project staff and the support provided by the Ministry, and State governments.
However, because the difficulties caused by the reduction in allocation of resources by the Ministry of
Finance leading to the cancellation of loan proceeds, and to a reduction in the scope of project
activities, the project cannot be rated as fully satisfactory. While, on the one hand, GOB has been
supportive and committed to NEP-II, including the Secretariat for International Affairs of the Ministry
of Planning (SEAIN), on the other hand, the GOB failed to provide the necessary resources to NEP-II.

In addition, there were frequent delays in disbursement of resources to participating states because of
rules prohibiting payments to states in financial default with the federal government. This signified
that eligible states could not receive the resources to which they were entitled in a timely fashion.
These controls were imposed by the Federal government to promote fiscal discipline, however, with
regard to the actual implementation of NEP-II it had some negative consequences, particularly because
often the state environmental agencies would be deprived of funding because another state agency was
in arrears in its remittances to the federal treasury.

The performance by the participating states is considered satisfactory in that they quickly picked up on
the eligibility criteria matrix as a mean to carry out reforms and policy improvements and in

                                                      26

committing to the execution of specific subprojects and activities. Similarly, states provided local
counterpart resources and technical staff which supervised the activities carried out under NEP-II.
Notwithstanding some delays in qualifying for subprojects and the cases where States employed local
rather than the agreed procurement guidelines, the overall performance by states was highly positive.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Support for NEP-II oscillated through project implementation but evolved and grew with time. As
highlighted in section 9 above, MMA recognized the impact and value-added of NEP-II and used it
effectively to strengthen its own policies (i.e. SISNAMA) and to build a good working relationship
with the States. For the most part, MMA supported the PCU and is committed to a continuation of the
second phase of the program. In spite of changes in administration and staff, MMA worked closely
with the Bank to ensure a satisfactory implementation of the project and the fulfillment of its DO.




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In spite of the significant reduction in the project's size from its approval to closing and the delays
experienced in the execution of some of the project's activities overall borrower performance is
considered satisfactory. The budgetary constraints which resulted from the austerity package from the
Ministry of Finance, not only affected NEP-II, but other investments in various sectors as well. The
implementing agency oscillated through time but it evolved in demonstrating its commitment to the
achievement of project objectives and performed satisfactorily within the budget limitations imposed
by externalities outside its control.     It is also worth underscoring that the project PCU had an
exemplary performance in that it managed to coordinate 43 subprojects and activities in 17 states, and
to build efficient partnerships, often under adverse conditions. Moreover, the PCU managed to spend
98% of the resources allocated to the project; a record unmatched by any other project executed by
MMA in the same time period. The rating is also based on the growing commitment by MMA and
participating States to the program (which provided enthusiasm, dedicated staff and counterpart
funding), in spite of recurrent changes in administration. Lastly, the rating is given based on an
analysis of the projects results which demonstrate that there is a great awareness of environmental
issues and an enhanced capacity at the State level for environmental protection.

11. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Among the lessons learned from this project was the reaffirmation of the viability of a decentralized
approach to environmental management. By transferring decisions and implementation down to the
                                                    27

State level, the Federal Government was able to accomplish several important goals: (1) leverage
policy and regulatory change at the State level; (2) generate enthusiasm, energy and counterpart
funding for state selected priorities; (3) build capacity for environmental management at the State
level. The project demonstrated that there is a great deal more interest and capacity for environmental
protection at the local level, especially when state-level entities are allowed to set their own priorities
and develop their own way of approaching the problem. The project also demonstrated that states are
quite willing to have their capacity and performance evaluated objectively, especially when the
financial incentive to support state-defined subprojects is added. This was initially a sensitive question
during project preparation, but the team learned that judgments made using an objective scale with
clear criteria were acceptable to the states. Most state officials actually welcomed the opportunity to
have their capacity evaluated externally because it gave them leverage for policy changes within their
governments.

Another lesson learned is that, even in a nominally decentralized system, there may be some
resistance by central government (i.e. MMA) to allow decentralized decision making. Often this
resistance comes indirectly in the form of fiscal controls. In Brazil, during project implementation,
there were several occasions on which financial transfers could not be made to eligible states in a
timely fashion because of alleged financial defaults in the states' obligations to the Federal
Government. While these controls are important from the perspective of fiscal discipline, they were
sometimes counterproductive in terms of achieving voluntary compliance with national objectives in
the environmental area. Often, the fiscal issue was outside the area of control of the State agency. For
example, during project implementation, a federal regulation barred federal financial transfers to a state
in which any agency was in arrears to the federal pension system (INSS). If for example, a state-run
public utility was alleged to be behind in its tax remittances, all other state agencies eligible for federal
transfers were penalized including those dispensing critical services.

An important lesson learned was the importance of building an effective communications
component into the project. During project implementation, there were times when the project
received less funding out of the budget allocated to MMA than other programs that were narrower in
scope and performed worse than NEP2. This may have been partly a function of how well the project
communicated with its various constituencies. The lesson learned that the success of a project may
often depend on its capacity to identify key stakeholders and to communicate with them effectively, in
both directions. It is noteworthy that the project enjoyed the continuous strong support of the National
Association of State Environmental Agencies (ABEMA) throughout the entire implementation period.

The lack of a comprehensive baseline to measure actual improvements in environmental quality
through the implementation of subprojects at the state level is an important lesson from NEP-II. While
many activities developed under NEP-II had means to measure its evolution, for the most part States
had not developed solid baselines which could have improved project monitoring and establish the
basis for comparing overall improvements in environmental quality at the end of a specific
intervention.


                                                     28

An additional lesson concerns the delays encountered in the signing of contracts due to slow
administrative procedures by UNDP. MMA has relied on UNDP as a service provider for letting
contracts, which often experienced delays affecting project implementation. Thus, the value added of
the administrative services rendered to MMA by UNDP for the implementation of project activities
comes into question for future Bank financed projects, and the need to further develop the
administrative (i.e. procurement and financial management) capacity within MMA to stop relying on
external service support. On the other hand UNDP also offers certain benefits regarding financial
management for which MMA benefited.

Lastly, an important lesson for subsequent phases is related to the flexible' methodology provided by
MMA for determining the State's environmental priorities which was often not closely monitored
and which opened the door to arbitrary decisions (e.g., selecting priorities that matched well the
expected size of the matching grants rather than the most pressing environmental problem in the state).

I ­ INTRODUÇÃO

O Programa Nacional do Meio Ambiente II ­ PNMA II é direcionado para o aperfeiçoamento e
fortalecimento do processo de gestão ambiental no âmbito do Sistema Nacional de Meio Ambiente -
SISNAMA, nos três níveis de governo, visando alcançar resultados efetivos de qualidade ambiental
e, conseqüentemente, uma melhor qualidade de vida para a população brasileira.

           O presente relatório refere-se às atividades do Programa em sua Fase 01, com uma
síntese das ações desenvolvidas no período de junho de 2000 a junho de 2006. O PNMA II, objeto
do Acordo de Empréstimo nº 4524 BR, firmado entre o Governo Brasileiro e o Banco Mundial, foi
efetivado em 11 de julho de 2000 e encerrado em 30 de junho de 2006.

III ­ AVALIAÇÃO DOS OBJETIVOS, DO DESENHO E DA QUALIFICAÇÃO

3.1 ­ Objetivos originais (segundo o Appraisal Report)

Objetivo Geral:
       Estimular a adoção de praticas sustentáveis entre os diversos setores cujas atividades
impactam o meio ambiente e contribuir para o fortalecimento da infra-estrutura organizacional e de
regulamentação do poder publico para o exercício da gestão ambiental nos pais, melhorando
efetivamente a qualidade ambiental e gerando benefícios socioeconômicos.


                                                49

Objetivos Específicos:
    a) Implementar projetos de gestão integrada, com caráter replicável, que sirvam como modelos
        de desenvolvimento sustentável;
    b) Aprofundar o processo de descentralização da gestão ambiental, fortalecendo a capacidade
        operativa dos estados e municípios;
    c) Estimular a adoção de soluções inovadoras e a formação de parcerias entre o poder público e
        a sociedade civil, para a gestão ambiental;
    d) Desenvolver e implementar sistemas de monitoramento ambiental, voltados para a geração
        de informações que auxiliem a tomada de decisão;
    e) Desenvolver ações para aumentar a eficácia do processo de licenciamento ambiental,
        integrando-o com os demais instrumentos de gestão ambiental;
    f) Fortalecer a capacidade de gestão ambiental integrada da Zona Costeira brasileira.

Considerações: Os objetivos se apresentaram claros e realistas, sendo inclusive definidos de forma
a atender às demandas dos estados, que foram identificadas por intermédio de um processo
participativo de consultas. Estas demandas se originaram de um levantamento efetuado para atender
a este fim, em 1997.

Por ter sido configurado no formato APL, modalidade indicada para programas de longo prazo, o
PNMA II foi subdividido em 3 fases, com estimativa de execução em 10 anos. Os objetivos foram
definidos para serem cumpridos ao longo de todo o período proposto para o APL. Assim, os
resultados alcançados na Fase 01 foram adequados aos recursos disponibilizados para o Programa,
à complexidade do desenho, à estratégia de implementação e à capacidade técnica dos executores.

O MMA, instituição executora e órgão central do SISNAMA, contribuiu para o alcance dos objetivos
do PNMA II, devido a sua ampla experiência na implementação de projetos, que envolvem as esferas
federal, estaduais e municipais, bem como a sociedade civil organizada.


3.2 ­ Objetivos revisados

Os objetivos não foram revisados.

3.3 ­ Componentes originais

O PNMA II está estruturado em dois componentes técnicos: Gestão Integrada de Ativos Ambientais e
Desenvolvimento Institucional e um componente administrativo de Coordenação e Articulação.

A)      Gestão Integrada de Ativos Ambientais: este componente tem por objetivo estimular as
        Unidades da Federação à prática de ações sustentáveis visando à conservação e melhoria de
        ativos ambientais prioritários e à geração de benefícios socioeconômicos.
Considerações: o desenho do componente, principalmente após ajustes de sua estratégia,
enfocando a articulação plena com os projetos financiados pelo Componente Desenvolvimento
Institucional, se mostrou adequado para estimular nos estados a gestão integrada de recursos
ambientais, alcançando melhorias de qualidade ambiental em áreas prioritárias. Por outro lado, o
                                                   50

processo de qualificação ao Componente contribuiu para impulsionar avanços e melhorias na gestão
ambiental estadual.

       B) Desenvolvimento Institucional: tem por objetivo o fortalecimento dos órgãos estaduais
de meio ambiente - OEMAs na utilização de instrumentos essenciais para o processo de gestão
ambiental no País. Os instrumentos trabalhados no âmbito do Componente são: licenciamento
ambiental, monitoramento da qualidade da água e o ordenamento territorial da zona costeira, cujas
ações são desenvolvidas no âmbito dos subcomponentes Licenciamento Ambiental, Monitoramento
da Qualidade da Água e Gerenciamento Costeiro.
Considerações: o desenho do componente mostrou-se adequado ao fortalecimento dos
OEMAS/SISNAMA, permitindo aprimorar a capacidade técnica e operacional para a utilização de
instrumentos de gestão ambiental no País.

       C) Coordenação e Articulação: este componente visa proporcionar apoio ao MMA na
implementação do PNMA II, mediante o fortalecimento da capacidade técnica e gerencial para a
execução das ações do Programa. Além disso, tem por objetivo promover a articulação entre as
Unidades da Federação, fortalecendo o Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente - SISNAMA.
Considerações: o desenho do componente mostrou-se adequado, favorecendo as ações de apoio
na implementação do Programa e nas articulações necessárias. Porém, um sistema de comunicação
e de divulgação dos resultados deve ser estruturado na Fase 02.

3.4 ­ Componentes revisados:

Os componentes não foram revisados.

3.5 - Contexto Inicial:

O desenho do PNMA II guarda relação direta com os objetivos da política do Banco Mundial e do
Governo Brasileiro, podendo ser destacados os seguintes aspectos:

   -    o estabelecimento de prioridades ambientais na Fase 01 visou otimizar o uso dos recursos
        financeiros e apoiar a tomada de decisão no processo de identificação de projetos potenciais
        a serem desenvolvidos no Programa. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo foram utilizados
        como subsídios para a configuração dos projetos estaduais;
   -    o cumprimento de critérios de elegibilidade buscou incentivar a introdução de melhorias nos
        sistemas estaduais de gestão ambiental. Os critérios foram baseados nos principais
        instrumentos e princípios de gestão ambiental em aplicação no País (gestão de recursos
        florestais, gestão de recursos hídricos, gestão de resíduos sólidos, instrumentos econômicos
        para a gestão ambiental, licenciamento ambiental, monitoramento ambiental, gestão de
        áreas naturais protegidas, descentralização da gestão ambiental e participação na gestão
        ambiental);
   -    os projetos estaduais implementados na Fase 01 do PNMA II tiveram caráter demonstrativo,
        visando identificar as melhores soluções técnicas e modelos inovadores de gestão ambiental
        que pudessem ser disseminados para outras áreas que apresentem questões ambientais
        semelhantes;
   -    a implementação do subcomponente Licenciamento Ambiental, conforme atestado por
        avaliação realizada junto aos executores, trouxe significativos benefícios para as instituições
                                                  51

         estaduais licenciadoras, para a qualidade da prestação do serviço público e para os
         usuários, mediante agilização do processamento administrativo de obtenção de licenças. O
         incremento de tecnologia gerencial, representado pela informatização das áreas de
         licenciamento dos órgãos estaduais de meio ambiente, forçou a racionalização operacional
         dessas áreas e desses órgãos e conduziu à elevação do grau de eficácia material da
         licença, especialmente para atender as mudanças da legislação e as suas interpretações,
         que incidem diretamente nos órgãos governamentais e de maneira indireta aos órgãos do
         sistema financeiro, pois ao concederem empréstimos aos empreendedores, podem ser
         responsabilizados por projetos danosos ao meio ambiente.

Os resultados alcançados pelo subcomponente Monitoramento da Qualidade da Água podem ser
distribuídos em três linhas:
   -     estruturação, implantação e operacionalização de redes de monitoramento (instalação de
         300 estações de amostragem) em bacias prioritárias estaduais, assim consideradas pela
         complexidade do uso do solo e da água presentes, ocorrência de conflitos, ou importância
         estratégica no abastecimento de água de grandes centros urbanos;
   -     integração de instituições (agenda azul e agenda marrom) em um trabalho conjunto, em que
         se associam dados de quantidade e de qualidade das águas, simultaneamente à
         disponibilização das informações geradas para os usuários;
   -     capacitação e treinamento de gestores públicos e representantes da sociedade civil.

A integração de instituições e a associação e disponibilização de seus dados de quantidade e
qualidade de águas poderá contribuir para tornar mais eficazes as ações de licenciamento,
fiscalização e outorga nas bacias hidrográficas.

A articulação das informações geradas nas redes estaduais de monitoramento, para fins de
disponibilização e compartilhamento de dados foi viabilizada pelo Portal de Monitoramento da
Qualidade da Água, desenvolvido pelo PNMA II e cedido à Agência Nacional de Águas ­ ANA. O
acesso a essas informações auxiliará os comitês de bacias hidrográficas na elaboração de
diagnósticos, planejamento de ações de monitoramento, preparação de Planos de Bacia,
contribuindo para maior eficiência da gestão de recursos hídricos e estímulo à participação social
nessa atividade.

O apoio do componente Desenvolvimento Institucional, através do componente Gerenciamento
Costeiro, entre outros resultados:

   -     aperfeiçoamento técnico e operacional de suporte à gestão costeira;
   -     integração com os sistemas de gestão ambiental, recursos hídricos e Unidades de
         Conservação;
   -     fomento ao planejamento e desenvolvimento urbano;
   -     ordenamento da maricultura, com ênfase na carcinicultura do Nordeste;
   -     promoção de ações integradas no setor de turismo;
   -     estratégias para promover gestão ambiental integrada.

O Gerenciamento Costeiro contribui, dessa forma, para o fortalecimento dos órgãos estaduais e
municipais, através da geração da realização de diagnósticos socioambientais consolidados em

                                                 52

propostas de zoneamento ecológico-econômicos - ZEE, incluindo diretrizes de ordenamento de usos
e ocupações das áreas litorâneas.


IV - Alcance de objetivos e produtos.

4.1 ­ Resultados/ alcance de objetivos:

       O Programa em sua primeira fase alcançou os seguintes resultados:

        (i)   fortalecimento do Sistema Nacional de Meio Ambiente ­ SISNAMA, com o ganho de
              capacidade dos órgãos estaduais de meio ambiente para aplicar os instrumentos da
              política ambiental e com a cooperação interinstitucional;
        (ii)  modernização dos sistemas de licenciamento ambiental em 12 Unidades da
              Federação, que incluiu o fortalecimento de sua base técnica, com ênfase nas
              seguintes ações: informatização; qualificação de pessoal; atualização de normas
              legais e de procedimentos administrativos. Também foi priorizada a articulação da
              atividade de licenciamento com as de monitoramento e de fiscalização ambiental,
              resultando em melhoria da qualidade da prestação de serviço público que reforçada
              em sua eficiência, gera economia de tempo e de recursos para os usuários e para o
              serviço público;
        (iii) implementação de sistemas de monitoramento da qualidade da água em 10 estados,
              com mecanismos de disseminação de informação para os tomadores de decisão e
              para o público em geral e que, de forma inovadora, estimularam a integração da área
              de meio ambiente com a de recursos hídricos. Além disto, foi apoiada a organização
              de bancos de dados e sistemas de informação estaduais sobre a qualidade da água;
        (iv)  fortalecimento da atuação de órgãos estaduais e municipais para a gestão da zona
              costeira em 17 estados litorâneos e o desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação de
              gerenciamento costeiro, contribuindo para disciplinar a utilização e ocupação das
              faixas litorâneas;
        (v)   avanços nas políticas ambientais estaduais, particularmente na formulação de
              legislações específicas para a gestão de resíduos sólidos e de recursos hídricos,
              promovendo a melhoria na capacidade para a gestão ambiental do País;
        (vi)   melhoria da qualidade ambiental em áreas estaduais prioritárias, promovida por meio
              do estabelecimento de novos modelos de gestão ambiental, que incluem a articulação
              da política ambiental com políticas setoriais, a integração entre os instrumentos de
              gestão ambiental, e uma maior participação social, garantindo maior efetividade e
              sustentabilidade às ações implementadas;
        (vii) disponibilização de informações referenciais sobre a gestão ambiental no País,
              integradas ao Sistema Nacional de Informações sobre o Meio Ambiente ­ SINIMA.
              Dentre estes, destacam-se:
                 Diagnóstico sobre a gestão ambiental nas Unidades da Federação, disponibilizado
                 em um bancos de dados na Internet (www.mma.gov.br/port/pnma/sigab/-
                 arquivos/consulta/main.cfm);
                 implantação de um Sistema nacional de informação sobre a qualidade da água -
                 Portal de Qualidade de Água - em articulação com a Agência Nacional de Águas ­
                 ANA;
                                                53

                  estruturação de banco de dados sobre o licenciamento ambiental nas Unidades da
                  Federação (www.mma.gov.br/pnma2dila) e apoio à implementação de um Portal
                  sobre o Licenciamento Ambiental ­ PNLA no País (página de abertura do MMA);
                   disponibilização de ferramentas inéditas (modelagem) de apoio ao licenciamento
                  ambiental e à gestão de bacias hidrográficas - Sistema de Apoio à Decisão na
                  Gestão de Bacias Hidrográficas ­ SAD.


        4.2 ­ Produtos por componentes:

Os produtos de cada um dos componentes do Programa estão apresentados nos Anexos 01, 02, 03,
04.

    4.3 ­ Impactos do desenvolvimento institucional:

O PNMA II tem sido incorporado gradualmente pelo MMA no seu marco de gestão, demonstrando
seu caráter estratégico e sua utilidade e permeabilidade ao nível estadual e local. Como exemplos, o
PNMA II tem provido apoio às seguintes atividades do MMA:
             Programa Nacional de Capacitação de Gestores Municipais;
             Formulação da Política Nacional de Resíduos Sólidos e das estratégias de gestão;
             Elaboração do Plano Nacional de Recursos Hídricos;
             Grupos de trabalho sobre licenciamento ambiental e suinocultura;
             Propostas de redução de gases de efeito estufa, por meio de utilização de mecanismo
             de desenvolvimento limpo aplicados à suinocultura.
Uma equipe independente, contratada pelo agente financiados, produziu um Relatório de Avaliação
qualitativa e revelou um panorama geral positivo, com base em dados recolhidos nas 17 Unidades da
Federação em que o Programa está em implementação6. Alguns pontos constantes do relatório
produzido por essa equipe de avaliação7 devem ser destacados:
             "O PNMA II introduziu novidades relevantes no modo de relacionamento do MMA com os
             Órgãos Estaduais de Meio Ambiente - OEMAs e estes se beneficiaram de uma desejável
             mudança em seu papel frente a outros organismos de governo e a atores locais.
             Destaque deve ser dado a dois aspectos: a implementação de uma matriz de critérios de
             elegibilidade e classificação hierárquica para o enquadramento no Programa; e a adoção
             do conceito de ativos ambientais como vetor de materialização do componente principal".
             "Embora resultados já sejam verificáveis, há um consenso entre os atores estaduais de
             que muito pouco tempo transcorreu para que os frutos dos investimentos do PNMA II
             tenham se materializado de forma integral e definitiva. A expectativa de continuidade é
             grande e o grau de satisfação dos protagonistas revela notável adesão aos princípios e
             práticas adotados pelo Programa."


6Foram entrevistadas, nos 17 estados, 142 pessoas entre Secretários de Governo, Coordenadores estaduais
    do Programa, Executores descentralizados e Representantes de organizações parceiras. Na ocasião,
    foram também visitadas áreas de execução dos projetos. Para cada Unidade da Federação foi produzido
    um relatório contendo os pontos de vista dos entrevistados.
7Avaliação da Primeira Fase do PNMA II ­ Documento Síntese (MMA, 2004).

                                                     54

            "... o papel mobilizador do Programa vem resultando em um duplo processo: o aumento
            do grau de liderança dos Órgãos Estaduais de Meio Ambiente e a convergência de
            recursos por parte de diferentes organismos para as ações do Programa. Esse aspecto
            último aspecto constitui elemento deflagrador de novas práticas nos estados, ao permitir
            que com relativamente pouco investimento do PNMA II, as partes envolvidas passassem
            a mobilizar aquilo que cada um dispõe - pessoal, equipamentos, infra-estrutura e
            recursos financeiros. A idéia de romper com a cultura do "não" para passar a uma prática
            do "como" vem encontrando na implementação do PNMA II um instrumento propulsor."


   V ­ Principais fatores que afetaram a implementação e os resultados:

   5.1 ­ Fatores que afetaram positivamente

   O PNMA II contou com agência executora, arranjo institucional e desenho estratégico, que
   possibilitou cumprir todos os gatilhos de desempenho definidos pelo BIRD, sendo que alguns,
   inclusive, foram superados.

   A implementação das ações do Programa, em alguns estados, logrou impactar positivamente
   outros setores, com isso, levando os estados a alavancarem recursos complementares
   provenientes de outras fontes, assim como, também, mobilizar outros setores e parceiros.

   5.2 ­ Fatores que afetaram negativamente

Foram considerados os seguintes fatores:

      - Instabilidade das equipes técnicas e administrativas: as mudanças das equipes
   técnicas, tanto a nível federal quanto a nível estadual acarretaram morosidade, visto que
   demandam tempo na internalização dos projetos e dos procedimentos administrativos e
   financeiros pertinentes às ações financiadas com recursos internacionais.

      - Corpo técnico e administrativo insuficiente e pouco experiente: as carências das
   equipes técnicas e administrativas estaduais, tanto no que diz respeito ao número de técnicos
   disponíveis para os projetos quanto a pouca experiência e capacitação para execução dos
   mesmos, acarretando lentidão na execução das ações.

      - Desenho complexo do Programa: a qualificação dos estados mediante o estabelecimento
   de prioridades ambientais e o cumprimento dos critérios de elegilibidade mostrou-se, na prática,
   um processo de implementação complexa, que envolveu coleta e análise de vasta
   documentação/legislação ambiental e se estendeu por prazos maiores do que os inicialmente
   previstos. A formulação e a execução de projetos estaduais envolvendo arranjos institucionais
   capazes de assegurar a participação e integração das diversas instituições nas ações propostas
   também tem sido fatores de atrasos. As instituições não têm experiência prévia em executar
   projetos envolvendo parcerias.

      - Formato APL: o PNMA II foi o primeiro Programa, no Brasil, financiado na modalidade
   Adaptable Program Loan, o que necessitou um esforço maior, por parte da Coordenação
                                                55

    Nacional no MMA, de adequações relacionadas às metas e aos recursos e prazos, os quais
    foram subestimados em relação à complexidade do desenho do Programa.

    5.3 ­ Custo e financiamento:

    O Anexo 05 apresenta o quadro financeiro da Fase 01.

    VI ­ Sustentabilidade:

O Programa Nacional do Meio Ambiente II ­ PNMA II, em sua Fase 01, apoiou a execução de 43
projetos estaduais, nas áreas de fortalecimento institucional e gestão integrada de ativos ambientais,
para que os resultados destes projetos pudessem, numa segunda fase de realização, produzir
resultados efetivos de melhorias de qualidade ambiental. As ações desta primeira fase demonstram
que o Programa possui um desenho estratégico, que caminha para o alcance da sustentabilidade,
pois, foram observados fatores significativos como:
         · O PNMA II é atualmente considerado estratégico dentro do Ministério do Meio Ambiente,
            como base para o fortalecimento do Sistema Nacional de Meio Ambiente ­ SISNAMA.
         · O PNMA II foi incorporado, de forma permanente, na estrutura organizacional do
            Ministério do Meio Ambiente ­ SECEX/DAI.
         · O PNMA II está inserido no Plano Plurianual de Governo ­ PPA, inclusive contando com
            orçamento para 2007.

    VII ­ Performance do financiador:

    7.1 ­ Banco Mundial - BIRD

O Governo brasileiro, em sua avaliação, considerou satisfatório o apoio do BIRD, na qualidade de
agente financiador e de parceiro no período de implementação do Programa. Seus representantes
colaboraram, de maneira participativa e integrada, com a Coordenação do Programa, inclusive, no
acompanhamento in loco dos projetos executados pelos órgãos ambientais dos estados brasileiros.


    VIII ­ Lições Aprendidas:

Dentre as lições aprendidas destacam-se:

- definir e implementar estratégia de comunicação e de divulgação das ações realizadas pelo
Programa;
- promover a Gestão Compartilhada, definindo claramente o compromisso e responsabilização entre
as partes, no planejamento, execução e sustentabilidade das ações, estimulando a co-
responsabilidade pelas decisões tomadas garantindo, portanto:
    a) a profissionalização da gestão da cooperação;
    a) envolvimento das diferentes instâncias institucionais,
    b) a interlocução permanente entre as instituições, por meio de redes de informações eficientes.
    c) o compartilhamento de pensamentos, experiências e competências.


                                                 56

- aprimorar o Planejamento Sistêmico: o planejamento deve ser considerado como o momento
estratégico e decisório, construído com a participação de todas as instituições e instâncias envolvidas
na relação de cooperação e entre estas e outras instâncias do MMA que possam contribuir. Sem que
haja segmentação e/ ou compartimentalização das áreas técnicas e administrativas.
- privilegiar na Fase 02, as ações de fortalecimento dos níveis municipais e da União.
- orientar para que as equipes técnicas estaduais possam se dedicar exclusivamente às ações do
Programa.
- realizar treinamentos de Organização e Métodos, Planejamento e Gestão para todos os executores
envolvidos.
- incorporar na metodologia de desenho dos projetos a concepção do Marco Zero (definir
indicadores).
- inserir todos os órgãos e entidades participantes dos projetos, especialmente, do Componente
Ativos Ambientais como signatários dos convênios.
