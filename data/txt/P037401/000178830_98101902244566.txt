INTERFNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION A_DT DFVELOP_EN1T
REPORT AND RECOMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDE7IT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
IWITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRELAND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, with the guarantee of Ireland, for
the equivalent of US$30 million to help finance the provision of industrial
credit in support of the Government's efforts to reduce regional imbalance
and to promote small-scale industries. The loan would bear interest at 8.5
percent per annum and would be repaid according to a schedule reflecting the
comnosite amortization schedule of the sub-loans financed, but not to exceed
15 years, including three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMIY
2.        The last economic mission visited Ireland in September-October 1971;
its report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Ireland' (R72-
180) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 13, 1972. Since then,
the Bank has obtained updating economic information from the International
Monetary Fund and during the appraisal mission of February-March 1975.    Annex I
contains country data.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        Since the mid 1960's, Ireland's GNP has grown at an average annual
rate of 3.6 percent. With a slow increase in population, per capita income
has risen by about 3 percent per year, reaching a level of US$1,770 in 1973.
The dynamism of the industrial sector has lessened the country's dependence
on agriculture and has resulted in a more balanced mix of these twjo sectors.
Agriculture now accounts for about 20 percent of GDP while the share of in-
dustry is about 34 percent. The increasing role of industry is also reflect-
ed in the composition of exports: industrial exports grewq from 35 percent of
merchandise exports in 1965 to an average of 58 percent in 1970-74. The open-
ness of the Irish economy has made it highly dependent on external markets,
and its links with the United Kingdon are particularly strong. Exports and
imports.of goods and non factor services accounted, respectively, for 35 per-
cent and 42 percent of GNP in 1973. Real exnorts grew at an average annual
rate of about 8 percent in 1965-73; although imports rose slightly faster in
the same period, invisible earnings and transfers enabled Ireland to maintain
the current deficit in the balance of payments at about 3 percent of CNP until
1973. The deficits in the current account balance have been financed by long-
and medium-term capital inflows , mostly from the UJnited Kingdom and other
European countries.



- 2 -
4.         Economic growth brought a substantial reduction in traditional
emigration flows and, since 1972, there has been a small net immigration. As
a result of this trend and of natural growth, population, which increased at
an average annual rate of 0.5 percent in 1960-70, has since been increasing
by about 1.2 percent per year. About one fourth of the labor force is em-
ployed in the agricultural, sector, while industry absorbs over 30 percent.
Unemployment has been high and has ranged between 6.5 percent and 10 percent
in the period 1968 to early 1975. The economy has not been able to provide
for sufficient jobs to absorb the increase in the labor force as well as those
who migrate from the rural areas. Many of the newly established, export-
oriented industries have tended to be capital intensive.
5.        Despite the significant growth rate and structural changes in the
economy, regional imbalance in development has persisted.     In 1971 Dublin
County alone accounted for about 45 percent of the national industrial output
and employment, while its per capita income was 30 percent above the national
average. In the same year, per capita income of the poorest region, Donegal,
was only 59 percent of that of Dublin and unemployment there was the highest
in the country (13 percent).
Recent Develpments
6.         Recent developments in Ireland hlave been dominated by the country's
entry into the European Communities (EC) on January 1, 1973, and by the energy
crisis and worldwide recession. Participation in EC has brought significant
changes. Access to the enlarged market offered by EC has provided a new
stimulus to exports of goods and non-factor services, whiclh, in real terms,
grew by over 10 percent in 1973 and by 5.5 percent in 1974. Dependence on
the United Kingdom market has been reduced:    in 1974 the United Kingdom ab-
sorbed 56 percent of Irish exports and provided 47 percent of its imports, as
opposed to 61 percent and 52 percent, respectively, in 1972.     At the-same time
Irish industry faces increasing competition frorn the other l.C countries, and
some traditional sectors (especially textiles, footwear and printing) ihave
been particularly affected by imports from third countries as Ireland adjusts
to the common external tariff of EC. The total elimination of tariffs applied
to other EC countries is to be completed by January 1, 1978. In the agricul-
tural sector, incomes and p:rices have risen substantially since the application
of the EC Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).    Ireland has also gained access to
new official sources of external financing, such as the European Investment
Bank, and there has been encouragenment of private capital inflows. Since 1973,
direct foreign investment has risen steadily as firms seek to utilize Ireland's
relatively cheap labor and to benefit from industrial incentives, as well as
access to EC markets.
7.        Notwithstanding the new development opportunities offered by EC,
economic conditions in Ireland deteriorated markedly in 1974. Under the im-
pact of the recent deterioration in the international economy and the decline
in domestic demand, the rate of growth of real GNP fell from almost 7 percent
in 1973 to 0.2 percent in 1974. As demand declined, unemployment reached 10
percent, while the volume of. industrial production grew by only 2 percent.
Despite the application of the CAP, the decline in world beef prices caused



- 3 -
agricultural incomes to fall by about 15 percent.    IHigher import prices for
oil and other basic products, together with the fall in beef prices, caused
the current account deficit in the balance of pavments in 1974 to rise by over
220 percent to i 300 million (about US$712 million), thus reaching about 10
percent of GNP; higher oil prices account for almost two-thirds of this
deficit. Hlowever, increased public external borrowings and other capital
inflows allowed Ireland to raise its level of external reserves by about 15
percent to US$1,158 million, equivalent to about 4 months imports. The rate
of inflation accelerated to 17 percent in 1974. While this sharp rise in
prices was largely due to external forces, domestic factors have contributed
additional inflationarv pressures, which have increased in the first months
of 1975. In particular, wages have risen faster than productivity; Irish labor
costs are still lower than those of its main trading partners, but there is
cause for concern about the future competitiveness of exports if the present
trend in waaes is maintained. In the past, monetarv authorities concentrated
their efforts on the regulation of the growqth of the monev supply. In recent
montlhs, however, the Government has been concerned by the acceleration of
inflation and is placing more emphasis on other measures to control the rise
in domestic prices (i.e. control on the prices of essential products and
limitation on increases in wages).
Economic Objectives
8.         The Government's main concern is the promotion of growth and employ-
ment. While no long-term program has been prepared to follow the Third Pro-
gramme for Economic and Social Development which was completed in 1972, Irish
authorities have established the folloxwing goals: more balanced regional
development; expansion of exports; provision of employment opportunities:
rationalisation and modernization of small-scale industry; and adjustment to
free trade conditions. Industry is expected to maintain its leading role in
economic development. Regional industrial plans are being revised and imple-
mented by the Industrial Development Authority, a Government agency created
in 1950.
External Finance
9.        Direct Foreign investments reached USS50 million in 1973 and were
estimated at about UIS$140 million in 1974: they are expected to continue their
upward trend.   In order to finance budget deficits arising from expanded pub-
lic expenditures, central Government external borrowings increased from US$29
million in 1970 to an estimated US$379 million in 197/'. A further rise is
expected in 1975. Outstanding public and publicly guaranteed foreign debt
reached US$1,284 million, about 1° Percent of ,nD, at the end of 1974; out-
standing Bank lending accounted for 9.5 percent of public foreign debt. The
public debt service ratio in 1974 was 3.7 percent.
10.       In the recent past, Ireland has been forced to borrow at shorter
maturities and higher interest rates than before. Irish authorities are con-
cerned about the tightening of capital markets and the difficulties of obtain-
ing long--term financing. Entry into EC has ensured Irish access to new sources



-4-
of capital, but the official funds available have fallen short of Ireland's
expectations.   Grants and subsidies from TC, amounting to USM10g, million in
1973 and USS129 million in 1974, were mainly for the Common Agricultural
Policy and intervention prices.    Loans from the European Investment Bank rose
from US$27 million in 1973 to US$58.5 million in 1974, but are still a small
proportion of total external capital requirements. The Regional Fund, ap-
proved by EC members to finance regional development in the less-developed
areas, will provide Ireland (the whole countrv is considered a less-developed
area) with i 35 million (about US$77 million) in 1975-77. including E 4 mil-
lion in 1975.
Prospects
11.       Despite its preseni: problems, Ireland has reasonably good prospects
to continue its economic expansion once there is recovery from the existing
worldwide recession; demand and investments are expected then to pick up
again. In 1975, improved prices are likely to result in a rise in the value
of agricultural exports, but industrial exports willl remain largely constrained
by the limited prospective economic recovery of other EC members. Imports in
1'75 are expected to rise at a much lower rate than in the past, reflecting
the limits imposed on demand by the present recession. The current account
deficit is thus expected to decline to about USS385 million in 1975. Industrial
exports are expected to improve from 1976 onwards.
PART II - BANK GROITP OPERATIONS
12.       The Bank began lending to Ireland in 1969 with the objectives of
assisting the country to overcome its immediate capital constraints, helping
to finance investments in priority sectors such as power, and supporting re-
forms in sectors which were critical to Ireland's development, i.e. education,
agriculture and industry. Annex II contains a summarv statement of Bank loans
as of June 30, 1975 and notes oni the execution of ona7oing projects.
13.       Between 1969 and 1972 the Bank made three loans for power develop-
ment, totalling $49.5 million. They have helped the Electricitv Supply Board
(ESB) to meet the increasing demand for electric power, which grew at 10 per-
cent annually in the 1960's and early 1970's, and to support industrial growth
and the Government's countrywide program for electrification. ESB has since
been able to diversify its financial sources, and to use external loans and
supplier credits to supplement Government and other domestic funds.
14.       Two education loans, totalling $38 million, were made in 1971 and
1974. Their purpose was to assist the Government in reforming general sec-
ondary and vocational education, secondary level technical education, and



-5-
higher level technical, agricultural and commercial education, and to expand
the adult training program. The traditional educational system was character-
ised by an over-emphasis on academic subjects, a disproportionate number of
uneconomically small schools and poor utilization of teachers. The Bank loans
are helping to finance a new comprehensive secondary school system, which will
provide training for a large proportion of the skilled workers and technicians
required at all levels through 1986.
15.       In 1973 a loan of $25 million was made to the Agricultural Credit
Corporation (ACC) to promote livestock development. It provides credit and
technical assistance intended not only to raise agricultural output and income
but also to eliminate institutional obstacles to agricultural development.
Long-term farm planning has been established and, for the first time, commer-
cial banks have made long-term loans to farmers. This loan has helped the
sector to utilize the incentives offered by CAP.
16.       The first loan to provide credit for industrial development was
approved in 1971; it amounted to $10 million and was implemented by the
Government-owned Industrial Credit Company, Limited (ICC). The proposed loan
would be a follow-up operation. It would have the goal of further supporting
Ireland's efforts to promote industrial development and to reduce both un-
employment and the regional imbalance in development. Implementation of the
first loan started in late 1971 and the pace increased in mid-1972 when the
prospects of entry into EC stimulated a recovery in industrial investments;
it was fully committed in December 1974, but the final date for presenting
applications for subloans was postponed to December 1975 to permit the use
of un-used balances pertaining to a member of subprojects.
17.       Given Ireland's relatively high income level and expected access to
capital markets, no further lending to Ireland is proposed.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
18.       The industrial sector has been a dynamic factor in Irish economic
growth since the early 1960's, when the policy emphasis shifted from import
substitution to export promotion. About 35 percent of industrial output is
now exported. Export industries have grown faster than others, and chemicals,
glass, clay, cement, plastics, electronics and other predominantly export
products now account for 44 percent of industrial output. A considerable part
of indus,trial investment has been financed by external capital.
Industrial Policies
19.       Both large and small scale industries are expected to play a role
in industrial development. Large-scale industries provide a focal point for
industrial growth, while the smaller firms provide industrial services and
contribute to development in the less-developed areas, where large-scale



-6 -
industries could not be accommodated. Particular emphasis is given to small
industries, which are expected to provide employment at low capital cost per
job and to contribute to local entrepreneurship.
20.       Since 1969 the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) has prepared
and implemented regional industrial plans which establish investment targets
and help create jobs in the various regions. It also administers the incen-
tives devised by the Government for the promotion of industrial development.
Upon entry into EC, Ireland agreed that its industrial incentive scheme would
be reviewed and kept in line with EC policies. The main incentives are grants
for investments in fixed assets and training, implemented under four programs:
new industries, small industries, modernization, and research and development.
The Small Industries Program was established in 1967 to promote viable, labor
intensive projects; the average cost of fixed assets per job created by these
projects in the fiscal year 1973/74 was US$5,000, compared to an average of
US$19,000 for the new large and medium-scale enterprises which received IDA
grants. The requirements to qualify for assistance under this program ensure
that projects have good prospects for growth, are competative, and are not
established in sectors where there is already sufficient capacity. Other
incentives include tax relief on profits arising from exports of industrial
goods, allowances for accelerated depreciation, and the provision of pre-
fabricated factories (for purchase or rent) and industrial estates. The
incentives are usually higher for the less-developed areas (the Designated
Areas) than for the rest ol the country. Special programs are applied in
certain areas. The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. is a state-
sponsored organization in charge of the administration of the industrial and
warehousing estate wqithin the Shannon airport area. Another state-sponsored
organization, Gaeltarra Eireann, is responsible for the creation and develop-ent
ment of industries in the Irish-speaking areas of the country.
21.       A quantitative evaluation of the grant system is expected to be
available by the end of 1975. Surveys carried out: by foreign consultants in
1966 and 1971 showed that the grants and the tax reliefs were effective as
major incentives in attracting foreign investment.. The prevailing view in
Ireland is that the economic and social gains thalt could be associated with the
establishment of grant-aided industries have represented a satisfactory return
to date on the Government!s allocations for financing the scheme, and that
these incentives should be continued. Nevertheless, the policy in relation
to grants is being kept under review. The goal is to reduce or phase out
incentives where this is found to be feasible; hoxwever, the geographic situa-
tion of Ireland, and the relative underdevelopment in much of the country,
have so far been factors supporting the maintenance of the system.    Criticism
of the lack of linkages between grant-aided industries and the rest of the
economy, and of their high capital-labor ratio, has led IDA to become more
selective in the approval of grants. Criteria for selection of industries now
include use of domestic resources, employment creation, export prospects and
impact on less-developed areas. Thus the industrial sector is not only ex-
pected to keep its dynamic role in growth, but also to contribute directly to
the reduction of unemployment and regional imbalance.



-7 -
22.       A long-established and well-developed banking system provides short-
and medium-term financing to the industrial sector. M4ajor UK and North
American banks are represented, and banks from other EC countries have begun
to establish in Ireland.   The commercial banks provide mostly short-term
financing, while merchant banks offer loans with maturities of up to seven
years. The Industrial Credit Company is the only institution which provides
industrial credit for periods of over seven years and is therefore the major
source of long-term financing. Interest rates are determined by market
forces and are strongly influenced by those in the United Kingdom. The Stock
Exchange is not an important source of funds for Irish industry; a large
number of firms are small and medium size family enterprises which have not
been able to offer attractive securities. The Irish Stock Exchange has been
overshadowed by the British Stock Exchange, with which it amalgamated in
1973. In addition to the financial institutions, there are a number of
organizations and institutions which provide the industrial sector with vari-
ous services, such as export promotion, training, research and technical
assistance.
23.       The first Bank loan for industrial credit in Ireland helped finance
industrial expansion by supporting investments in subprojects throughout the
country. The experience of the first loan has been satisfactory; the average
economic rate of return of a sample of large projects financed by ICC with
Bank funds was 20 percent. The institution-building impact of the loan has
been less significant than in most other DFC operations because ICC is a
well established and mature institution. Nevertheless, association with the
Bank has brought an improvement in ICC's project appraisal and supervision
procedures. The proposed second loan would complement the effect of the first
loan by supporting the structural changes necessary for a more balanced in-
dustrial development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed project, which is summarized in Annex III and described
in detail in the report "Appraisal of the Industrial Credit Company, Limited
Ireland" dated (July 1975), was appraised in February/March 1975. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington, in July 1975. The Irish delegation was led
by Mr. Michael O'Reilly, Director of Finance of the Department of Finance,
and included representatives of that Department and of ICC.
Purpose of the Project
25.       The project would provide funds to ICC for lending to specific
investment projects in the industrial and distributive trade (with the excep-
tion of retail outlets) outside Dublin County. It would support Ireland's
objectives of a more balanced regional industrial development, promotion of
small-scale enterprises and employment generation.



-8-
Description of ICC
26.       The Industrial Credit Act of 1933 created ICC to provide long-
term financing for the industrial sector. Later, ICC's responsibilities were
extended to the distributiorn sector. Its five major fields are now: indus-
trial term loans, distribution loans, hire-purchase and leasing, shipping
finance and equity investments. The Government owns virtually all the paid-
up capital of i 8.8 million (about US$19 million). It has also provided a
considerable part of ICC's resources for onlending, although the share of
government loans in ICC's total resources has declined from 52 percent in
1971 to 49 percent in 1975. ICC has been successful in attracting domestic
savings; deposits with it have grown by about seven times in the past four
years and now account for 14 percent of its total resources. The Bank loan
approved in 1971 was the first foreign long-term loan extended to ICC. Since
then the company has tried continuously to obtain external financing but,
with the exception of a loan for b 2.5 million (about US$5.6 million) from
the European Investment Bank, it has not been able to attract long-term ex-
ternal finance on reasonable terms.
27.       ICC's objectives are:   to provide a wide range of services to encour-
age the development of the industrial and distribution sectors; to develop the
capital market through its underwriting and issuing house services; and to
assist in the rationalisation of the industrial and distribution sectors. ICC
works closely with IDA, County Development Officers, local Chambers of Com-
merce, and other financial institutions, including merchant banaks, which pro-
vide joint financing for many of ICC's projects. ICC's share in fixed invest-
ments in manufacturing industries has risen from 6 percent in 1960-70 to 8
percent in 1971-74. Projects financed by ICC created 1,350 new jobs in 1973
and 738 in 1974. The company has contributed to the development of the capi-
tal market and to the mobilization of domestic savings; its services on
mergers have also supported structural changes in the Irish economy.
28.       ICC's Board of Directors is composed of seven members appointed by
the Government. Management is in the hands of a General Manager and two
Assistant General Managers, and there is considerable delegation of author-
ity from the Board. The Government does not influence ICC's day-to-day opera-
tions. The staff is highly qualified and the institution is operating effi-
ciently.
ICC's Policies and Procedures
29.       In line with Government's objectives, ICC is embarked on the promo-
tion of employment and regional development. ICC's policies are: to provide
the services needed for the fulfillment of its objectives; to acquire appro-
priate security for the loans it provides; to achieve appropriate standards
of professional and personal competence by its staff; to use advisory and
consultancy services when it is appropriate to do so. ICC now intends to
increase its participation in financing projects outside Dublin County and
small-scale development enterprises. ICC's Strategy Paper, approved by its



-9-
Board on July 30, 1975, accordingly sets new targets for industrial lending
in the period 1976-78. The share of projects outside Dublin County in new
industrial financing is expected to be 70 percent in 1976-78, as opposed to
55 percent in the recent past. Another target is the utilization of 30 per-
cent of its industrial lending in 1976-78 to provide financial assistance to
small-scale enterprises.
30.       ICC's lending rates are in line with market interest rates.     Since
August 1974, ICC's base rates for term lending have been between 14.5-15.5 per-
cent; rates on some recent loans have been as high as 17 percent. Appraisal,
supervision and procurement procedures are satisfactory. ICC uses the serv-
ices of consultants for the specialized, technical aspects of appraisal.
31.       In the past, ICC's profitability was quite low as a result of the
low spread on its loans, the poor performance of equity investments and low
debt leverage in its financial structure. There has been a steady improvement
in all these factors and profitability rose to 8.4 percent of its average net
worth in 1974 from 3.5 percent in 1971. Outstanding industrial and distribu-
tion loans amounted to 63 percent of ICC's total portfolio of L 36 million
(about US$84 million) in 1974. The rest of the portfolio was composed of
shipping and hire purchase loans. Total principal of the loans affected by
arrears reached 4.5 percent of the total term loan portfolio. ICC has made
adequate provisions to cover possible losses.
Audit
32.       ICC's annual financial statements are audited by Coopers and Lybrand,
an internationally reputed firm of chartered accountants. Unqualified cer-
tified statements on ICC's accounts have been included in the audit reports.
The quality of audit is satisfactory to the Bank.
Projected Operations and Resources
33.       In line with its policy of taking a more active role in industrial
development, ICC expects to raise its share in fixed investments in the indus-
trial sector to an annual average of 10 percent in 1976-78. Projecting an
average growth of operations in current prices of 20 percent per year through
1978, ICC's estimated resource needs in the period February 1975-October 1978
amount to b 97.8 million (about US$215 million). ICC expects to get L 58 mil-
lion (about US$128 million) from Government loans, additional deposits and its
own cash generation and L15 million (about US$33 million) from the EIB and the
United Kingdom Export Credit Guarantee Department. The proposed Bank loan
would cpver some 55 percent of ICC's potential resource gap in this period,
and ICC is expected to make extensive efforts to raise the rest of the funds
in international capital markets.
Terms of the Proposed Loan
34.       The proposed loan would be made on the Bank's normal terms and con-
ditions applicable to DFC loans, including a standard commitment charge; the
repayment period would not exceed 15 years, including a grace period of three



- 10 -
years, and the amortization schedule would reflect the composite of sub-loans.
The loan would be used to finance the foreign exchange component of ICC's
loans and equity investments during the period 1976-78, in industrial and
distribution projects (with the exception of retail outlets).
35.       The interest rate on sub-loans would be based on the market interest
rates. As under the first Bank loan, the Government will bear the foreign ex-
change risk. Nevertheless, ICC would continue its efforts to pass on the
foreign exchange risk to those final borrowers who are able to assume it; the
incentive would be interest rates lower than those prevailing in the market.
However, in view of the trends in the exchange rates of Ireland and its main
trading partners, it is unlikely that many sub-borrowers will choose this
alternative. In particular, small enterprises, which would receive a con-
siderable part of the proceeds of the proposed loan, cannot be expected to
assume the foreign exchange risk. ICC's net spread on the proceeds of the
Bank loan would be fixed at 4 percent, which is expected to be adequate, al-
though a more active participation in the financing of small enterprises will
bring additional risk. Any excess spread would be paid into a Development
Fund, which ICC would administer for the promotion of regional development
and small-scale development enterprises, under a program to be agreed with
the Bank.
36.       ICC hopes to use 70 percent of its resources for industrial lending
in 1976-78 to finance projects outside Dublin County. It will also use the
proceeds of the proposed loan only to finance subprojects in such regions,
except as otherwise agreed with the Bank. Since Dublin County has been
seriously affected by the recent recession, and by increasing competition from
other EC members, which have particularly hampered the growth of some indus-
tries in this area, the targets mentioned above may be amended from time to
time in the light of the developing situation.
37.       ICC will also allocate 30 percent of its total industrial lending in
the period 1976-78, and 40 percent of the total proceeds of the proposed loan
to the financing of small-scale development enterprises. These are defined as
having fixed assets of not more than L 400,000 (about US$900,000) and employ-
ing not more than 100 operatives. This definition and the percentages above
may be amended from time to time, in the light of economic developments, as
agreed between the Bank and ICC.
38.       In view of ICC's sound portfolio and adequate provisions and proce-
dures, the ratio of debt to equity would be increased from 3:1 under the first
loan to 6:1. ICC's free limit for sub-projects would amount to US$500,000
equivalent, with no aggregate free limit.
Procurement
39.       ICC's procurement requirements are satisfactory.   Large clients gen-
erally use competitive bidding and medium and small clients either seek offers
on the international market before presenting their selection to ICC or are



able to otherwise justify their selection.   ICC would include an assessment
of procurement methods in projects submitted for financing under the proposed
loan.
Disbursement
40.       Certificates issued by the auditors of the borrowers are usually
the basis for ICC's disbursements of its loans. ICC also ensures that its
disbursements are made after the sponsors' equity participation and a propor-
tional contribution from other sources of finance. ICC has been obtaining
detailed invoices and other documentation only for projects financed under
the first Bank loan. In view of the very high standard of professional audit-
ors in Ireland, and in order to enable ICC to use the proposed loan for small
industries without an excessive workload, it is recommended that for the pur-
poses of disbursements for such types of sub-projects the Bank should accept
certificates issued by reputable firms of public accountants acceptable to
the Bank and countersigned by ICC. The documentation would be retained by the
sub-borrowers and would be available for inspection by the Bank.
Economic Impact
41.        The proposed loan would assist ICC in achieving the objectives which
it shares with the Government to promote regional industrial development and
small-scale development enterprises. In an effort to reduce regional im-
balance, priority would be given to projects in the areas outside Dublin
County, while the promotion of small enterprises would assist in providing
employment at relatively low capital cost per job created, thus sustaining
the more intensive utilization of the domestic labor force and entrepreneurial
skills.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Industrial Credit
Corporation, Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Ireland and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors separately.
43.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement conform
to the normal pattern for DFC projects. The special features described in
paras. 36, 37 and 38 of this report are reflected in Sections 3.03, 3.04
and 3.05 of the Loan Agreement.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

satisfactory pace.



ANNEX II
Page 2 of 3
Loan 726 Second Power Project: US$20 million Loan of March 3 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
This project consists of the supply and installation of a single
250 mw oil-fired thermal generation unit and associated equipment. The loan
is expected to be fully disbursed by October 1975, and is on schedule.
Loan 744 Industrial Finance Project: US$10 million Loan of June 2, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Implementation of this loan to the Industrial Credit Company for
industrial development was slow until mid-1972 due to a general slowdown in
economic activity. Investment has picked up since Ireland joined the European
Community. The closing date has been recently postponed to June 30, 1976, to
account for some cancellations of sub-projects due to the recession in 1974,
but supplementary applications are expected to be received before the end of
1975.
Loan 785 Education Project: US$13 million Loan of August 9, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
This loan assists in financing the construction of secondary com-
prehensive and secondary technical schools, and a regional college; it also
provides for technical assistance from specialists in education planning and
construction. Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. In March 1975,
there was some reallocation of components between this loan and 959-IRE, the
second loan for education, in order to avoid delays in implementing the first
loan arising from problems in the finalization of legal requirements for the
College of Commerce in Dublin, which was to be financed under this loan.
Loan 804 Third Power Project: US$15 million Loan of March 3, 1972
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This project provides for installation of another 250 MW generating
unit at the Tarbert Station on the Shannon River. Implementation is proceed-
ing satisfactorily.
Loan 921 Agricultural Credit Project: US$25 million Loan of July 27, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan provides credit and technical assistance for livestock
development. The borrower (Agricultural Credit Corporation) sub-lends to
farmers and commercial banks, which also sub-lend to farmers. This loan be-
came effective on October 29, 1973, and implementation has been very satis-
factory; commitments are ahead of schedule, and institutional reforms concern-
ing commercial banks' lending to farmers and long-term farm development have
been achieved.

Loan 959 Second Education Project: US$25 million Loan of January 30, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan assists in financing the construction of secondary compre-
hensive schools, industrial training centers, a National Institute of Higher
Education, a technical teacher training institute, the Faculty of Agriculture
of University College, Dublin, and supporting facilities at the Lyons and
Thornfield experimental stations. It also provides for financing to expand
regional technical colleges and the establishment of computer equipment for
the third level institutions. Some of these components have been recently
transferred to Loan 785-IRE, while the College of Commerce of Dublin, which
was originally under Loan 785-IRE, will be financed by this loan. Implementa-
tion is proceeding satisfactorily.
