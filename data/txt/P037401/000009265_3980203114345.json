Some of the\n            quantitative targets of the loan, such as percentages of\n            allocations to regional development outside Dublin and of\n            loan funds to small-scale industrial projects, were not\n            fully achieved. However, flexibility on the part of the\n            Borrower and the Bank was justified in light of economic\n            developments. High unemployment in Dublin County caused the\n            development of industry there to continue to be a major\n            policy goal, which in turn forced the Government to change\n            its priorities in 1977. The groundwork undertaken during\n            this project supported the Borrower's financing of\n            small-scale enterprises and succeeded in meeting its\n            objective of employment generation. The Borrower's\n            financial performance was satisfactory and arrears are not a\n            major problem. This project was one of the last Bank\n            operations in Ireland. Along with the First Industrial\n            Credit Project, this project contributed to active and\n            worthwhile relationships between the Irish Government, the\n            Industrial Credit Company, Ltd. (ICC), and the Bank. The ICC\n            has developed into a mature and efficient institution thanks\n            in part to the Bank projects."}, "docdt": "1983-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
