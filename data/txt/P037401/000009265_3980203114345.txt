PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IRELAND - SECOND LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
(LOAN 1160-IRE)
HIGHLIGHTS
The objectives of Loan 1160-IRE were to support the government's
efforts in reducing regional imba1.._es in the country's industrial
development; and to encourage employment through the establishment of
small-scale industrial projects (para. 4.01). Overall these objectives were
substantially met.
To increase regionalization of industry in Ireland, ICC agreed to
endeavor to allocate about 70% of its resources during 1976-1978 to projects
outside Dublin. In addition, ICC agreed that all of the Bank's loan would be
used to finance projects located in those regions subject to the following
reservations: (i) Both the Bank and ICC recognized that there has been a need
for increased industrial development in the Dublin area, particularly since
there was high unemployment in Dublin County. Developmene of industries in
Dublin County therefore continued to be a major policy goal for ICC; and (ii)
the above percentages and amounts might be revised from time to time by ICC in
agreeiment with the Bank (para. 4.02). To support the development of
small-scale enterprise operations, ICC agreed to expand its small-scale
enterprise development operations and allocate about 30% of its resources to
their development.  At least 40% of the proceids of the Bank loan Viuld be
used to finance small-scale development enterprises (para. 4.03).
Most ot the objectives of the loan were achieved.  While ICC
industrial commitments targets to regions outside Dublin were met in 1976 and
1977, the allocation of approvals dropped to 49% in 1978. In addition, about
78% of the Bank loan, rather than 100% envisioned during negotiations, was
allocated to subprojects outside Dublin. The rise in ICC's approvals in
Dublin County during 1977-78 reflected a change in Government policy at the
time. Due to the high level of unemployment in Dublin County, in 1977 the
government removed restrictions on investments in the County and provided
grants to projects located ixi this area.  ICC's policy was changed
accordingly, and the Bank agreed, on an exceptional basis, to approve loans
for investment in Dublin County.  Given the changes in economic conditions,
the flexible policy adopted by ICC and the Bank toward investment in Dublin
County was appropriate (para. 4.04).
The basic objective of assisting small-scale industry was met.
(para. 4.05 and 5.03). ICC allocated 30% of its funds during 1976-78 to
small-scale enterprises, and improved its organization to handle increases in
business in this sector.  The Bank loan made significant contributions to the
development of small-scale enterprises in a variety of sub-sectors, even
though only 30% rather than the targeted 40% of the loan was allocated to
small-scale enterprises. The groundwork undertaken during this project,
however, led to continued support of ICC's financing of small projects in
later years -- in 1980, 52% and in 1981, 40% of the value of ICC's industrial
investment was allocated to small-scale enterprises.  The project also
succeeded in meeting its objective of employment generation. Under the
project, 4,493 jobs were created, which represented 23% of new employment
creation in industry during the period 1976-80 (para 4.08).
ICC's financial performance was satisfactory (para 3.06) and arrears
are not a major problem with 3.6% of portfolio affected by arrears as of
July 31, 1982.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IRELAND - SECOND LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
(LOAN 1160-IRE)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Industrial Credit Company, Ltd. (ICC) was established in 1933 to
underwrite capital issues and to provide long- and medium-term capital for
industry by way of loans, loan guarantees and direct equity investment. Its
operations were later expanded to cover hire-purchase and leasing facilities,
and financial consultancy services. It has two wholly-owned subsidiaries -
Mergers, and Shipping Finance Corporation (SFC). 14ergers operates as a
consulting service.for business consolidation, take-over negotiations and
related consulting matters. SFC handles shipping loans funded by special
allocation from the Government for shipping financing.
1.02     This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the performance under
the second Bank loan to ICC (Loan 1160-IRE) approved in August 1975 and is the
second PCR covering Bank's operations with ICC 1,. This PCR is based on
detailed sub-projects data provided by ICC and covers one of the last Bank
operations in Ireland.
II. THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
A. Economic Development 1976-81
2.01     Following the 1975 recession, the Irish economy expanded rapidly
during the three years 1976-78 followed by steady decline in growth in the
aftermath of the 1979 oil price increase.  During 1977-78 the lrish economy
had the fastest growth rate in Western Europe with a GNP growth of 5.7% per
annum. This rapid growth was based to a large extent on the performance of
the industrial sector and more particularly on manufactured exports with
volume growth rates of the order of 20% per annum. The index of industrial
production increased at about 9% per annum during this three year period. The
fastest growth rates were recorded in metals, engineering and chemicals.
2.02     Grcwth in gross fixed capital formation was quite high during the
period reaching 19.8% in real terms in 1978.  Machinerv and equipment
investment rose by 20.5% and building and conscruction investment rose by
19.0% in real terms in that year. Inflation fell from 18% in 1976 to a more
acceptable level of 7.6% in 1978. Industrial growth during the 1976-79 period
was spurred by generous 0overriment grants to attract new industry to the

country and substantial incentives to exporters. These incentives encouraged
many foreign export-oriented firms to locate in Ireland particularly those
wishing to exploit the EEC market.
2.03     From 1979, the Irish economy's growth rate steadily declined,
averaging 2.2% during 1979-81. The index of industrial production growth fell
to 1.4%. This lower growth rate reflected the slowdown in the world economy
after the second oil price shock. Deteriorating international terms of trade
for agriculture and a drop in agricultural production due to weather
conditions were other factors. Inflation increased rapidly during this period
from 13.2% in 1979 to 20.4% in 1981.
B.  Employment
2.04     High levels of unemployment and the large-scale emigration of workers
have been a historical pattern in Ireland. Since the 1960's shifts in the
structure of employment have included a steady decline in the share of
agriculture, a relatively slow and uneven expansion in manufacturing and
construction and a rapid rise in the public sector.  A modest increase in
employment in manufacturing, building and construction, commerce, insurance
and finance was achieved during the period 1969-80 as follows:
% of Total Employment
Structure of Employment                  1969          1980
Manufacturing                            19.8          20.9
Building and Construction                 7.6           8.9
Commerce, Insurance and Finance          16.0          17.3
During the period 1976-78 manufacturing employment grew by 1.1% per annum.
The industrial sector was targeted to be the leading sector for employment
generation during 1979-81, with projected growth of 4.4% per annum but due to
the slowdown in the economy no employment growth was achieved.
2.05     During the period 1974 - 1981 unemployment remained at high levels as
shown below.

Unemployment levels in Dublin County area were as follows:
(Percentage of labour force)
1976     1977      1978      1979     1980
10.2      9.6       8.9      7.3       7.7
The high level of unemployment in Dublin County during 1976, caused the
Government to cancel restrictions on investments in the County in 1977 and
extend grants and incentives to projects located in this area. ICC, following
this policy change, increased its lending and investment in the County (para
4.04).
III. THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY CAPITAL
A. Ownership
3.01     ICC was promoted as a development bank in 1933.  The first public
issue of shares was underwritten by the Government. This issue, and two
subsequent issues, failed to attract public interest and the Government took
up most of the shares. The Government now holds over 99% of ICC's equity.
The Minister of Finance nominates the Chairman and six members of the Board.
During the period 1976-81 six of the seven Board members were changed,
reflecting resignations and changes in Government.  The Government, however,
does not involve itself in the day-to-day operations of ICC.
B. Organization and Staff
3.02     ICC's top management has remained unchanged since the Bank's
appraisal of this loan in 1975. Mr. Frank Casey has been ICC's General
Manager since 1969 and Managing Director since 1979. He is assisted by two
General Managers, Messrs. Heelan and Ryan. The manageinent team is
professionally well qualified and experienced in development banking. ICC
continues to be a sound and well-managed institution, providing finance and
services mainly to small- and mediumrsized industries.
3.03     Operations by ICC and its subsidiaries are handled by sixteen
divisions, including four branch offices, each headed by a divisional
manager.  The various divis-ons are operating afficiently.  During the 1975-81
period, ICC undertook a mauagement reorganization to more effectively control
the increased volume and variety of activities undertaken. The number of
sections in the Securities Division, which is responsible for follow-up of
projects, were increased to cope with the increased number of small borrowers
which required close monitoring. A new division was also established,
responsible for publicity, information and research which has produced useful
market studies and updates ICC's five-year plan. Staff increased from 134 in
1975 to 325 in 1981.
3.04     In view of Ireland's serious unemployment situation (paras 2.04 -
2.05), ICC became more active in promoting small-scale industry. In July 1977



-4-
ICC's Board approved a new Policy Statement which, inter alia, provided that
in the case of the industrial sector, ICC would allocate not less than 60% in
number aaid 30% in value of its investments to small-scale development
enterprises, i.e., firms of up to 100 workers with total fixed assets not
exceeding i 400,000. IGC expanded the services it provides Irish enterprises
to include working capital loans, hotel project financing, energy conservation
loans, and leasing of industrial premises.  ICC also provided management
service to Foir Teoranta, the State reconstruction finance company, which
assists in the restructuring of firms in financial difficulties.
C.  F-.nancial Performance
3.05     ICC's operations summary, consolidated profit and loss account and
balance shcats, projected and actual, are in Annexes I through VI.  ICC's
level of operations during the five years 1975-79 were substantially higher
than projected at appraisal, with disbursementa in 1979 at £ 66.2 million
(UStl27,,0 million)  aboit 55% over projections.  A substantial part of this
ircrease was due to inf'ation. Net profiL rose steadily during the five years
1977-81, increasing hI- about 200% to E 3.1 million (US$6.0 million) ir. 1981.
-e-urn rn average equLty increased by 76% to 14.4% in 1981, substantially
h. gler tttan prDjected.  Administrative expenses as a percentage of total
ass9to rose sharplt  from 1.5% in 1979 to 2.3% in 1980 and 2.8% in 1981.  This
percentage is still acceptable given the substantial part of the portfolio
invested -n small loans.
3.06     Total &ssets of ICC increased by about 260% during the five years
1977 81. Substantial progress was also made in diversifying ICC'e sources of
ftunds during this period.  Excheq-.er advances fell from 58% of ICC's borrowing
Ii 1976 to 23% in 1981 and deposits as a percentage of borrowing increased
from 25% to 41% during the sase period.  Borrowing from the European
Investment Bark (EIB) commenced in 1978 and accounted for about 29% of ICC's
borrowing i.n 1981.  'The Bank's share of resources fell from 9% in 1976 to 6%
in 1981.  T.e foreign exchange risk on all ICC's borrowings is covered by the
Governrent.  The long-term debt-quity ratio at 6.4:1 in 1981 compared to the
Loan re-airement of 9;1 should enable ICC to expand its borrowing to meet its
needs fcr the next two years without further equity contribution from the
Government. ICC's financial performance during tile 1976-81 period was
satisfaccory particularly in the light of the difficult economic conditions in
Ireland in recent years.
D.  Timpact of ICC on Investment and Industra
3.07     ICC's total disbursements, including World Bank funds, as measured
against total gross domestic fixed capital formation (GDFCF) has increased by
17% during the five years 1976-80.

1981 generally reflect the changes in overall industrial production by
sub-sectors (Annex XII). The largest increase was in metal products sector
which increased from 6.5% to 13.8% of portfolio reflecting the sector's rapid
growth of 6.9% per annum during this period. The major declines in the
portfolio were in ship construction, textiles, footwear aud clothing, and
furniture and wood products.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The Bank's objectives for Loan 1160-IRE were; (i) to meet the
shortage of external resources for Ireland's development; (ii) to support the
Government's efforts in reducing regional imbalances in the country's
industrial development; and (iii) to encourage employment through the
establishment of small-scale industrial projects. These objectives were in
line with the Government'& 3trategy for ecornomic development.  Greater
regionalization of industrial development, narticularly in the less developed
western region of the country, has been a long-term objective of the
Government with a view to reducing migration from the area. ICC was aware of
the need to increase assistance to industry in the less developed regions and
to further this objective they were making efforts to increase their
investments outside Dublin County. With a more balanced industrial
development and greater emphasis on small-scale industries a higher level of
employment generation was projected.
4.02     To further the policy of greater regionalization of industry,
agreement was reached that ICC would give priority to the development of
industrial enterprises in the less developed regions of Ireland. To this end,
ICC would endeavor to allocate about 70% of its resources for industrial
projects during 1976 through 1978 to projects located outside Dublin County
(Supplementary Letter). This policy was included in ICC's Strategy Paper
which was approved by its Board on July 30, 1975. In addition, it was agreed
that the entire proceeds of the Bank loan would be used for the financing of
projects located in such regions subject to the following reservations: (i)
both the Bank and ICC recognized that there has been a need for increased
industrial investment in the Dublin area, particularly since there was high



-6
unemployment in Dublin Counity caused by the worldwide recession and the
increasing competition from abroad as e result of the freeing of tracle in
recent years.  Development of industries in Dublin County therefore continued
to be a major policy goal of ICC; and (ii) the above percentages and amountn
miglht be revised from time to time by ICC in agreement with the Ban'i,
(Suppleiementary letter) .
4,03      To support the development of small-scale industry, ICG agreed to
endeavor to expand its small-scale development enterprise operationrs and
allocate about 30% of its resouxces for industrial projects for the £inancing
of small-scale development enterprises, defined as firms with total fixed
assets of no more than £ 400,000 and employing no more than 100 workers,
during FY1976-78 (Supplemnentary Letter). At least 40% of the proceeds of the
Bank loan would be used to finance small-scale development enterprises.
B.  Project Performance
4.04     Regional Development.  An analysis of ICC's industrial comntitments
was available only for 1976-77. Based on these figures, the torgets of
commitments outside Dublin County of 70% were achieved. ICC's industrial
comnitments outside Dublin County represented 79% for 1976 but fell to 63% in
1977, giving ain overall weighted average for the two years of 69% (Annex
VII). An analysis of approvals for industrial and distribution loans for
1976-78, however, showed a lower percentage ofapprovals outside Dublin at 56%
in 1916, 63% in 1977 and 49% in 1978 makii,g a weighted average of 54% for the
tnree year period (Annex VIII). The low level of approvals of 499% in 1978
would indicate that ICC did not failly meet the industrial loans target of 70%
outside Dublin County in 1978.  In the case of the Bank loan, 78% was
committed outside Dublin County compared to 100% envisaged at negotiations.
The rise in ICC's approvals in Dublin County during 1977-78 reflected a change
in Government policy at the time.  Due to the high level of unemploynment in
Dublin County (para 2.05), in 1977 the Government removed restrictions on
investments in the County and provided grants to projects located in this
area. ICC's policy was changed accordingly, and the Bank agreed, on an
exceptional basis, to approve loans for investment in Dublin County.  Even at
the time of negotiations of the loan, ICC felt that it would be difficult to
meet the targets for industrial investment outside Dublin.  Given the change
in Government policy, the flexible policy adopted by ICC and the Bank toward
investment in Dublin County was appropriate.
4.05     Small-Scale Industrial Projects.  Overall ICC made substantial
progress in the financing of small-scale industries as agreed under the Bank's
loan.  ICC's revised Policy Statement, issued in July 1977, required that 60%
in number of projects and 30% in value of its investments would be allocated
to small-scale enterprises.  In 1977, 92% of its operations were with small
industries and the number of boTrowers exceeded 555 compared to 456 in 1976.
In FY1976-78, ICC's investment in industrial/distributional loans by size
shows a higher concentration of small loans than in previous years. Loans
from £ 1-150,000 averaged 53% of investnients during FY1976-78 coTapared to an
average of 42% for FY1973-74 for loans in the range of £ 1-200,000
(Annex IX).  Also the percentage of loans over £ 500,000 declined from 53% in



-7-
FY1974 to 18% on average during the period FY1976-78.  During FY1979-81
financing of small-scale projects continued to be high with over 90% in number
of investments going to small-scale finms. the percentage of total investment
in small-scale projects was high, representing 52% in FY1980 and 40% in
FY1981. The Bank's objectives of increasing ICC financing for small-scale
industries was fully achieved and ICC now has considerable experience in this
area and a full package of financial facilities to service this sector.
4.06     During the life of the project 1976-81, ICC's loan portfolio showed
little change by geographical distribution. Loans allocated outside Dublin
County have fluctuated arouind 55% of the total, being 54.6% of total in 1974,
50.2% in 1976 and 54.3% in 1981 (Annex X). The major change in distribution
during this time has been to loans located in Cork County, which increased
from 12.8% in £974 to 16.a% of total loans in 1981.
4.07     Sub-Projects Financed under Bank Loan.  Over 170 sub-projects were
financed by the Bank loan covering a broad range of industries (Annex XI).
Twelve of the sub-projects were above the free limit of US$500,000 and
represented about 33% of the loan funds. About 120 of the sub-loans were
provided to small-scale industries defined ats enterprises with assets of no
more than £ 400,000 and fewer than 100 workers. The funds allocated to these
sub-projects represented about 30% of the Bank loan; the target of allocating
40% of Bank funds for small-scale enterprises was not fully met.
4.08     Employment Generation.  The project was successful in its meeting its
objective of employment generation. Under the project, 4,493 jobs were
created, which represented 23% of new employment creation in industry during
the period 1976-80. This was a substantial increase in the level of
employment generation in industry by all ICC activities in 1973 and 1974 of
15% and 18%, respectively.  The average investment cost per job in real t^rms
rose only slightly from £ 7,790 in 1974 to £ 8,033 from 1976-80, reflecting
this emphasis on employment generation.
C. Bank's Role
4.09     As ICC was a well managed and long established development bank, the
Bank's major role under the second loan was to provide long-term foreign
exchange resources and to focus ICC's efforts on reducing regional imbalance
in the country's industrial development. Other Bank input was limited but
useful. During the appraisal and supervision of the two loans, Bank staff
reviewed with ICC a number of areas where improvements in its operations might
be implemented. These areas covered (i) improvement in sub-project appraisal
reports; (ii) increased equity participation; and (iii) co-operation with
other Irish development agencies, In the area of project appraisal the Bank
recommended that greater analysis of the financial and marketing aspect be
undertaken and that ICC recruit economists and engineers to participate in the
evaluation of projects. Improvement in the analysis of the financial and
marketing aspects of the appraisal reports were quickly implemented. On the
question of economic evaluation of projects, ICC's opinion was that in an open
economy like Ireland, projects which were financially viable were generally



-8-
economically viable. ICC did recruit economists for the Publicity and
Research Division (Para 3.02) but not for sub-projeet evaluation.  While the
ICC position was often justified in .'he case of export projects, the Bank
still feels that an additional contribution to Ireland's industrial
development efforts could be made by ICC if an econoaic evaluation of its
larger projects were undertaken. Economic stud-es might also be made to
identify the sub-sectors covered by small-scale industry that have the
greatest economic impact on development, particularly in jobs creation and use
of local resources, so that projects in these sub-sectors would be given
priority in promotion. ICC still prefers to use consultants for the technical
evaluation of larger projects as they feel that it would not be possible to
fully utilize the number of engineers required to cover the wide range of
industry they finance. Apart from the reservation noted on the economic
evaluation of the projects, ICC was able to improve its appraisal standards to
a high and fully satisfactory level.
4.10     In the later 1960's and early 1970's ICC suffered losses and low
yield on its equity investment and was reluctant to expand further in this
area. The Bank recommended to ICC to expand further its equity investment as
a tool to assist its promotional efforts. While ICC was receptive to this
proposal and its equity investment increased gradually up to 1981, however,
equity investment did not keep pace with ICC's overall expansion and equity
investment as a percentage of ICC's total assets fell from 2.3% in 1976 to 1.1%
in 1981.
4.11     Substantial progress has been made in improving cooperation with
other Irish development agencies. During the past six years, ICC in
conjunction with other agencies has developed a considerable number of
financial packages to meet the needs of Irish investors. ICC works closely
with the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) in promotion of projects and
has financed the construction of advanced factories with IDA. Special finance
was made available for the construction and upgrading of hotels in conjunction
with the Tourist Board. A study of exporters' financing problems and the
establishment of an export working capical facility was undertaken with the
Export Promotion Board.  In 1981, a pilot scheme was started to make loans
available with minimum formality to small manufacturers and craftsmen in
Western counties.
D. Cancellation of Part of Bank Loan
4.12     Commitment of the loan was slow in 1976 due to economic conditions.
This continued in 1977 when the economy began to expand as interest rates on
term loans were lower than ICC's cost plus spread on Bank funds. The loan was
eventually committed on schedule but due to later cancellations of projects
and cost savings, $2.1 million of the loan was not disbursed and had to be
cancelled. Cancellations of credits to subborrowers under this loan were high
as borrowers were using ICC's credit as a back-up and cancelled it later if
cheaper resources became available. Cancellation of part of Bank loans to
DFCs has become a frequent problem in recent times due to cancellation of
projects after commitment dates have passed and cost savings resulting mainly
from the appreciation of the US Dollar relative to other currencies.  If
current monetary conditions prevail, this issue may call for a study of
possible remedial action Bankwide.

V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project's objectives of (i) supporting Ireland's efforts to
reduce regional imbalance in industrial development; and (ii) to support the
expansion of smrall-scale industrial projects were in line with Government
policy and were appropriate. These objectives were substantially met.
5.02     Some of the quantitative targets of the loan - regional development
outside Dublin (para 4.04), and allocation of 40% of the loan to SSI (para
4.04) - were not fully achieved. There were good reasons, however, to modify
these objectives in light of economic developments, particularly with respect
to regional goals. The high unemployment levels in the Dublin region caused
the Government to change its priorities in 1977. Given the changes in
Government policy, the flexible policy adopted by ICC and the Bank towards
investments in Dublin County was appropriate.
5.03     ICC reached the objective stated in Loan 1160, of allocating 30% of
its funds during 1976-78 to small-scale enterprises. It spent considerable
effort to outline a policy for small-scale development in 1976 and to
strengthen its organization to handle the increases in business in this
sector. While the Bank loan made significant contributions to the development
of small-scale enterprises in a variety of sub-sectors, the target of
allocating 40% of the loan to small-scale enterprises was not achieved. The
groundwork undertaken during this project, however, led to continued support
of ICC's financing of small-scale enterprises in later years. ITn 1981,
small-scale enterprises accounted for 90% in number and 40% in value of ICC's
industrial investment in 1981. The basic objective of assisting small-scale
industry was met.
5.04     During the seventies, the two Bank loans to ICC have covered a decade
of active and worthwhile relationships between the Irish Government, ICC and
the Bank. ICC has developed, during that period, as a mature and efficient
institution thanks to its sound management and, in part, to the catalystic
effect the Bank loans had on ICC operations and policies. While Bank's
operations in Ireland have been discontinued, ICC and Bank officials continue
to exchange views. It is particularly gratifying to acknowledge ICC
willingness to assist from time to time other development institutions
associated with the Bank Group in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

Dear Mr Kapur:
Apologies for the delay in replying to your letter of 19th July 1983
enclosing the above report in draft.    The absence on leave of key
personnel and pressure of other work prevented my replylng to you
before now.
I enclose a memorandum setting out our comments on the draft report.
These are mostly factual changes.    If you would like further information
or clarification, please let me know.
I would like to express our appreciation of the, generally favourable tcr1e
of the report.   We have benefited considerably from our relationship with
the World Bank.    Arising from the comment in the final sentence of the
draft report, I confirm our willingness to assist other development banks
either by receiving missions or by making available members of our staff
on assignments.     We would be very pleased to discuss this further with
you or any of your calleagues.
I look forward to receiving a copy of the final report in due course.
With best regards,
Yours sincerely

PIAe      Paragraph
4        3.05           In third line, should "four" be changed to "five"?
Por 1979 diabursmeents, the conversion rate used appears
to be $1.30 Instead of $1.92 average stated in basic data
sheet.
For 1981 net profits, the conversion rate used appears
to be $1.29.
The return on average equity increase should read 76% ins >.ad
of 80%. The figure for profit before tax In 1981 used in
the report (Annex V) is incorrect;  see comment on Annex V
below.
4        3.06           The increase in total asaets over the 5 years 1977-1981 is
shown at 260% Instead of 270%.
In line -, delete "resources" and insert "borrowing".
5th sentence: EIB facilities are available to finance fixed
assets only.
6th sentence: We have been unable to check this statement as
we are not sure what definitions were used.
8th sentence: We calculate that the ratio long-term debt/equit
in 1981 should be 6.4:1 and not 7.3:1.
4        3.07           D. Impact of ICC on Investment and Industry:
ICC's total disbursements as measured against total gross
domestic fixed capital formation increased by 17% during
the five years 1976-1980. In the table on page 5, the
second column, total GDFCF, is in constant 1975 prices,
while ICC disbursements (column 3) are in current prices.
In current prices the table reads as follows:
ICC
Year          Total GDFCF       Disbursements   Share
£000              £000
1976          1,130.4            26.4             2.3%
1977          1,374.1            30.3             2.2%
1978          1,832.6            38.7              2.1%
1979          2,372.4            66.2             2.8%
1980          2,638.9            71.1             2.7%
Source: Table A5 and ICC Annual Reports.
5        3.08           The Central Statistics Office Index of Industrial Production
for Metals and Engineering rose by 6.9% between 1976 and 1981.
6        4.05           It appears to us that the  third sentence should read "In
r                                    1977, 92% of Its operations were with small industries and
the number of borrowers exceeded 555 compared to 456 in
1976".
6        4.05           In the tenth line, loans in the range £l-200,000 were 30%
of industrial loans in 1974 and 52% in 1973.
7        4.05           In the fourth line, the percentage of total investment
in small scale projects was 45% in FY 1979, 62% in
FY 1980 and 40% in FY 1981.

13       IV            The 1980 approvals figure for Property on Lease should be
changed from "32" to "82".
14       V             The figures shown for 1979 are the original figures: these
were subsequently restated as indicated in the attached
Schedule.   See also the 1980 Report and Accounts.
For 1976 the detailed interest figures are:
Interest on Exchequer Advances          2,802
Bank & Other Interest                   2,218
5,020
14       V             The figure of profit before tax for 1981 should be
"4,535" instead of "4,339".
15       VI            The heading "Fixed Assets" does not seem appropriate.
"Provisions and equipment" should read "Premises and equipment".
The figures for loans etc for 1976 are as follows:
Loans less provisions                   51,022
Investments at cost less provisions   2,593
Hire-Purchase contracts less
provisions                      9,783
Property and equipment on lease          3,930
67,328
The 1979 figures shown are the original figures. As
indicated above, they were subsequently restated;  see
attached schedule.
In 1976 the figure for bank loans should read "3,933"
instead  of "4,933";  the figure for deposits should
read "15,708" instead of "14,708".
We calculate the long term debt/equity ratios as follows:
1976     1977      1978      1979      1980      1981
3.3:1    3.8:1    3.7:1    4.4:1    5.6:1    6.4:1
.28       XI            Page 9 of 10:   No 72 should read "Oth r land transport
(urban transport, road transport etc)".
