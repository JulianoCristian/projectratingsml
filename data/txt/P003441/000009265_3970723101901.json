Central Anhui Province by developing water\n            resources, reducing flood damage, developing rural\n            infrastructure & agricultural support services, &\n            improving Anhui's overall capability to plan &\n            manage irrigation & flood control schemes. The project\n            would rehabilitate & complete existing irrigation\n            facilities on 320,000 ha in the Pishihang area. It would\n            provide flood protection to 170,000 ha, more reliable\n            irrigation to 220,000 ha & improved drainage to 23,000\n            ha in an area surrounding Lake Chao. The project would also\n            upgrade other rural infrastructure, strengthen support\n            services, & provide agricultural credit to encourage\n            diversification into livestock, fisheries & forestry.\n            Main features include construction of control structures,\n            bridges, drainage culverts, etc., & excavation to\n            increase canal capacity in the Pishihang area, excavation of\n            flood channels, construction of control gates & pumping\n            stations in the Chaohu area; improvement of rural roads\n            & power facilities; provision of chemical fertilizers;\n            construction of buildings & provision of laboratory\n            equipment & vehicles to extension, research &\n            training facilities."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
