INTERNATIONAL BAN;K FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT MID RECOb2VENDATION OF THE PPESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BRAZIL FOR THE
SANTOS PORT PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Brazil in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $45
million for the Santos Port Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.      The development of transportation is very important for the
growth of the Brazilian economy. The rapid expansion of production
and markets and the opening up of vast areas in the interior require
a large investment in transportation facilities. About one-fourth
of the Federal and State Governments' investment expenditure is for
transportation. Concurrently with large investments, the Government
is improving the management of the railway, port and highway agencies,
their finances and their investment planning.
3.      In 1965 the Bank participated, through a technical assistance
grant of $1.5 million, in the financing and supervision of the first
phase of a Transport Survey comprising the railroads, coastal shipping,
the ports of Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife and highways in four
states. A second phase of the Survey covering highways in the remaining
principal states was partly financed by the UIDP and USAID and the Bank
acted as executing agency.
4.      There has been a continuing exchange of views between the Bank
and the Government on the implementation of the Survey recommendations
and organizational reform in the transport sector. In connection with
the last two highway loans the Bank received from the Government so-
called "Plans of Action", outlining programs of reform and reorganiza-
tion for various parts of the transport sector. The Government is
implementing these programs. In the railways, where the problems of
organization, operations and investment priorities are most complex,
a serious effort is under way to reduce uneconomic operations, to
improve investment planning and to improve management and operations.
In highwiays the Government is basing its investments on economic priori-
ties and is improving its planning. Concurrently, it is delegating
maintenance and construction to state highway departments. In ports,
the Government is initiating specific measures to improve management,
investment planning and the tariff structure. These measures include:



- 2 -
a) a program tn transform the Departamento Nacional de
Portos e Vias Navegaveis (DNPVN) into an agency responsible for policy
formulation, investment programming and tariff policy as well as for
the Government's financial participation in individual ports; and
b) specific measures to decentralize port management and to
introduce commercial accounting, costing and managerial systems and
training at major ports.
5.      The Port  of Santos Project is a part of the Government's
program of investment and reform. It was appraised by two missions
which visited Brazil in August/September and December 1970 Negotia-
tions on the proposed loan began on April 22, 1971 and were conpletpd on
April 29, 1971. The Government was represented by Messrs. Zaven
Boghossian (Director General of DNPVN and leader of the negotiating
team), Arno Markus (DNPVN), Walter Dieckmann (representing Companhia
Docas de Santos, Concessionaire of the Santos Port) and Jayme Alipio
de Barros, General Counsel of the Ministry of Finance.
6.      The proposed loan would increase the total of loans to Brazil
to $998.4 million (net of cancellations). The following is a summary
statement of Bank loans to Brazil as of April 30, 1971:

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.     An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of Santos Port Project,
Brazil'; (PTR-79a) is attached.
11.     The Port of Santos serves the Center-South of Brazil - the main
industrial and economic area of the country. For years the port has
been unable to cope iiith the increase in traffic, resulting in frequent
congestion. To remedy this situation the Government has formulated a
five-year development program (1971-75) for the port, based on the



Transport Survey and later studies. The Project is a part of this
program, which in general seems well-conceived;   during
negotiations the Government has agreed to consult the Bank before
undertaking major new projects in the port outside the 1971-75
program.
12.     A major purpose of the Project is to provide corn storage
and container facilities on the left bank of the estuary, including
road and rail access to these facilities, dredging equipment for
maintenance dredging of the channel and related consulting services.
Brazil's exports of corn have increased in recent years and prospects
are for continued growth. Santos handles about half of Brazil's corn
exports. HoTwever, the lack of handling and storage facilities is a
critical bottleneck in corn movement through the port. Corn exports
through Santos are expected to increase by some 135% between 1970 and
1980, reaching 1.4 million tons in the latter year. Equipmrent presently
used in the port has an average ship loading rate of some 70 - 80
tons/hr while the Project facilities are expected to attain a rate of
1,200 tons/hr.  This would reduce the time needed to load a 20,000 ton
ship from the present 13 days to about 2 days. WNrith the increase in
efficiency and lowering of transportation costs, Brazilian corn ex-
porters should be able to obtain better prices than at present.
13.     Another feature of the Project is to provide a two-berth
container quay. W4orldwide shipping trends indicate that increasingly
general cargo aill be moved in containers; yet the Port of Santos
does not have container facilities. It is estimated that the movement
of containerized general cargo through the port will reach some 1.5 - 2
million tons by 1980. The twio container berths included in the Project
are designed to handle this traffic, thereby eliminating the need to
construct additional conventiona'l cargo berths (about one every year
from 1974) for the foreseeable future.
1h.     An important part of the Project is the provision of management
consultants to assist the Government in implementing its reorganiation
program for the port sector as described in Part I above. The Project
also includes technical assistance to help the Government to prepare a
long-term investment program for the port sector.
15.    Vlarious port charges and taxes on port users add up to
a fairly high charge on the traffic moving through the Brazilian ports
and comprise mainly the port tariff and a port improverment tax levied
on imports and coastal traffic. Forty percent of the yield on the port
improvement tax in a particular port is available only for investment
in that port, while the remaining 60 percent forms part of the general
budget of DNPVN and is available for port investments throughout
Brazil. At the present levels of tariffs and including the 40 percent
of the port improvement tax received at Santos, the total net revenues
from the port will be sufficient to meet not only the domestic resources
needed for the Project but also the full cost of the other parts of
the Santos development program.



- 5 -
16.     There is a possibility that DNPVN receipts from the port im-
provement tax will be in excess of the financing requirements of
the entire port sector in Brazil if the current high rates of port
tariffs and port improvement tax are continued and if investment
programming and implementation are not improved. Since the port charges
izpose a burdan on coastal shbpiring, vis-a-vis r.ead and rail
transportation, there is a need for review and perhaps for revision
of the structure as well as the level of port charges and the port
improvement tax. During negotiations the Government has agreed to
study the tariff structure and other charges in the Port of Santos
and to introduce new simplified and coordinated port charges by the
end of 1973, taking into account the cost of various port services
and the need to cover a reasonable portion of investment requirements.
Furthermore, as explained above, the Project provides for the formula-
tion of a long-term investment program to improve the utilization of
resources in the entire port sector.
17.     Total project cost is estimated at $78.5 million equivalent.
The proposed Bank loan of $45 million would finance 57 percent of the
project cost and about a quarter of the program of which the Project
is an integral part. The Bank loan would comprise the following:
a) Civil Works - $1h.5 million for financing the foreign
exchange component, estimated at 40 percent, of the construction of
port and railway facilities included in the Project;
b) Ecuipment - $14.6 million for financing 100 percent of
equipment to be submitted to international competitive bidding;
c) Consulting Services and Training - $6.7 million re-
presenting the estimated foreign exchange component; and
d) Contingencies Related to a), b) and c) Above - $9.2
million.
18.     The proposed Bank loan would include up to $0.5 million of
retroactive financing to reimburse payments to management and engineering
consultants incurred after September 1970.
19.     Brazilian manufacturers of equipr.ent would be given a 15 percent
margin of preference. Mos-t of the equipmient included in the Project is
not manufactured in Brazil. However, insofar as some orders for equip-
ment are placed wqith Brazilian manufacturers, there may be a small amout
of local expenditure financing. The justification for such financing
in Brazil has been considered and approved by the Executive Directors
on previous occasions, based on the structure of the Brazilian economy
and its requirements for external assistance.



- 6 -
20.     The loan would be made to Brazil.  The equivalent of $38.16
million would be provided to Departamento Nacional de Portos e Vias
Navegaveis (DNPVHi) which is responsible for the execution of the port
works. The Federal Railways (RFFSA) and Sorocabana (a railway owned
by the State of Sao Paulo) would receive the equivalent of $6.84
million to carry out related railway works. Prior to the effective-
ness of the proposed loan the Federal Government would enter into sub-
sidiary lo)an agreements, acceptable to the Bank, with RPFSA and Scro-
cabana covering the implementation of the parts of the Project for
which these agencies are responsible. The overall port planning
study would be carried out by GEIPOT, a unit within the Mlinistry of
Transport dealing with transport coordination and studies.
21.     The Port of Santos is currently operated by a private concession-
aire, Companhia Docas de Santos (CDS), whose concession expires in
1980. During loan negotiations the Government has agreed that a new
entity acceptable to the Bank would be set up to take over the opera-
tion of the port at that time.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.     The draft Loan Agreement betwqeen the Bank and Brazil, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The Loan Agreement contains the provisions usual in port
projects.
PART V - THE ECONO0MY
23.     An Economic Report on Brazil (INH-203a) dated January 22, 1971
has been distributed (R71-39). Some of the recent developments were
summarized in my Report and Recommendation on the Sao Paulo Water
Supply and Pollution Control Project (P-927) dated May 6, 1971.
24.     A basic data sheet is annexed.



- 7 -
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIIENT
25.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECO1,ENDATION
26.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
