Consultancy\n            fees are provided for supervision of project works as well\n            as feasibility studies for a follow-up project. The project\n            includes a training component, directed mainly towards\n            operational staff. The project will benefit well over a\n            quarter million urban poor through provision of additional\n            connections, public standpipes and sewers. Direct benefits\n            of wholesome water supplies and shorter waiting times at\n            public hydrants will be supplemented by indirect\n            environmental and public health benefits."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
