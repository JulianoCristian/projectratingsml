of the Community Action\n            Program Project for Niger were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, Global Environmental Objective (GEO) outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: bottom-up development based on a\n            community-driven development (CDD) approach can be achieved\n            in a context like Niger if supervision is careful and\n            benefits from a dedicated team. The process is particularly\n            difficult if public services and institutions outside the\n            main cities are limited or non-existent (as was the case in\n            Niger). For a new program in such a challenging field as\n            community-driven development, it is necessary to have modest\n            expectations at the beginning. In Niger, the Community\n            Action Program had an outreach target of 20 percent of the\n            communes (districts) for the first four years. For an\n            emergency program the intended outcome is that the effects\n            of the crisis are minimized and recovery from the disaster\n            can start. For an avian flu attack the outcome would be that\n            information is quickly shared with responsible authorities\n            and that deaths are avoided or at least minimized. Thus the\n            original outcome indicators in the Project Paper were\n            correctly conceived when they largely concentrated on the\n            reaction and reporting times by the local population and\n            then by the authorities responsible for surveillance and treatment."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
