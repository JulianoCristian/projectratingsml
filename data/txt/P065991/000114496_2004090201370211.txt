Allocation.

(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the Recipient shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide such additional evidence as the 
Association may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Association 
shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Association shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the Special Account shall be 
made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as 
the case may be. 
(b) 
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account or any of the 90-Day Advance Accounts
 
will not be 
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Recipient shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such outstanding 
amount.
