THE COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM PROJECT SUPPORT - AVIAN FLU  
 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
SUMMARY 
The proposed changes consist of (i) a six-month extension of the Grant closing date from 
June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010, (ii) the reallocation of the Grants proceeds amongst 
the categories of expenditure
;
and (iii) the revision of the Component’s outcome  
indicators to make them measurable and in line with the Region’s core indicators.  
The initial seven months delay in project effectiveness and the political situation in 2009 
and 2010, which resulted in a military coup on February 18, 2010 and the Bank 
automatically triggering the OP.7.30, slowed down progress in implementation of project 
activities. In addition, the Category of expenditure (4: Compensation Fund) was not used 
as there was no avian flu upsurge in the country since the project became effective on 
July 21, 2008. The proposed changes will allow the Government to complete activities 
already initiated while including new activities which take into account the increasing 
threat of A/H1N1 and the needs for consolidating the country preparedness to effectively 
respond to major A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 crisis. 
In spite of progress made, it is unlikely that the funds will be fully disbursed, and works 
for the rehabilitation of quarantine areas in selected hospitals will be completed without 
an extension of the closing date beyond June 30, 2010. Furthermore, the Bank exercised 
the OP 7.30 following the military coup on February 18, 2010, shortly after the Bank 
completed a supervision mission, and disbursement on operations resumed recently on 
April 30, 2010.  
PROJECT STATUS 
The additional Financing for the Community Action Program Support Project (Grant # 
H346-NIR,) is the Component F of the First Phase of the Community Action Program 
(CAP1, P065991) which included an IDA Grant (Grant #H250-NIR, the original Project), 
a
blended GEF Grant (P107841) which closed both on June 30, 2008, and a PHRD Grant 
(TF056567) closed on December 31, 2008. The Implementation Completion and Results 
Report (ICR) for the Original project and the associated GEF and PHRD Grants were 
prepared and approved in draft, pending closing of the Additional financing for 
submission of the final ICR to the Board.  
The Grant in the amount of SDR 2,900,000 for the Additional Financing for Component 
F
of
CAP1was approved by the Bank on December 18, 2007, and signed on February 12, 
2008. It became effective on July 21, 2008 aimed at contributing to Niger preparedness to 
address Avian Flu threat, and was initially planned to close on June 30, 2010. The 
proposed changes are only related to the Additional Financing for Component F of the 
original project. 
Despite important delays at project’s start, the Component recorded steady progress in 
implementation and in achieving its development objective before February 2010. 
Page  6

Indeed, as of January 30, 2010, 21 percent of the Grant proceeds had been disbursed 
mainly to (i) improve the capacity of the relevant personnel in the ministries in charge of 
public health, veterinary services and environment, as well as at central, local 
administration and communities levels; (ii) strengthen avian flu surveillance networks in 
terms of communication through adequate tools for the communities and those involved 
in the poultry sector; (iii) enhance the functioning of the National Avian Flu Committee 
and its decentralized (regional and local) surveillance Committees; and (iv) develop and 
implement a communication plan which contributed to raising awareness on A/H5N1 and 
A/H1N1 both at national and local levels. Furthermore, more than 35 percent of the funds 
are committed with contracts that are worth US$1.7 million already signed. Disbursement 
is likely to pick up as soon as the Bank lifts OP.7.30, which was triggered following the 
military coup on February 18, 2010. 
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
·
Results/indicators
:
there are no changes in the performance indicators as 
identified in the initial project paper of the Component. However the intermediate 
result indicators have been modified  in the last ISR to reflect the project current 
context -with no outbreak of A/H5N1 and with the emerging swine flu (A/H1N1), 
including baselines and targets (see annex) 
 
·
Components
:
The Government requested the extension of Component F closing 
date, the reallocation of the proceeds and to redirect part of them, mainly but not 
exclusively from the Compensation Fund which has not been mobilized so far to 
other priorities in line with the PDO. The extension of the closing date will allow 
the Government to fully implement activities undertaken in 2009 which have been 
delayed for the following reasons: (i) delay in project effectiveness, (ii) 
cumbersome national procurement and environmental impact assessment 
procedures, (iii) non familiarity with Bank operations which resulted in important 
delays in submitting reports for Bank no objection, and the (iv) the tense political 
situation which resulted in a military  coup  on February 18, 2010 and the 
triggering by the Bank of its Policy dealing with de facto Governments (OP. 
7.30). To address procurement issues, the Bank requested weekly update on 
pending procurement of goods, works and selection of consultants and action to 
escalate if necessary to the Ministry’s top officials, i.e. the Minister or the 
Secretary General of the Ministry of Livestock and Animal Industries. A 
consultant has been also hired by the Permanent Unit to improve the project 
performance on procurement. As of April 29, 2010 about US$1.2 million worth of 
Withdrawal Applications related to the procurement of goods and services have 
been submitted for disbursement. Furthermore, rehabilitation and construction 
works for quarantine facilities in four selected hospitals (Niamey, Zinder, Maradi 
and Tahoua) for which the procurement process is near completion (evaluation 
report submitted for Bank no objection) cannot be completed by June 30, 2010.

The latter will strengthen medical services capacities for H5N1 surveillance and 
control
.
An extension of the closing date will allow the Government of Niger to: (i) 
complete aforementioned pending activities and (ii) together with  the reallocation 
of the proceeds from untapped categories of expenditure to replace the out dated  
Freeze-Dryer of  the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Niamey with a new one in 
compliance with the international standards, and estimated to cost about 
US$800,000; (iii) upgrade the central laboratory in order to enhance its 
performance in terms of production poultry and other animal related vaccines; (iv) 
strengthen the national animal diseases surveillance system and improve related  
communication capacities; and (v) continue support to the environmental 
monitoring of wetlands and migratory wild birds.  
 
·
Financing
:
There is no change in project costs, financing plan, and disbursement 
arrangements. However, the funds will be reallocated to cover the identified 
priority activities in the six month extension period.   
o
Audit
:
There is no pending audit, and the report for 2009 is due by end of 
June 2010.

Implementation schedule
:
The Government provided a detailed and revised 
budget, implementation and procurement plans up to the new closing date. The 
documents were revised and the new version submitted to the Bank following a 
review of the draft versions by a Bank supervision team in January 2010. The 
documents are attached to the Government request.
