the Global Environmental\n            Facility (GEF). Its development objectives aim at sustained\n            poverty reduction and improved local governance through\n            empowering communities and local governments, to improve\n            natural resources and ecosystem management, and to raise the\n            levels of health, education, and food security, thereby\n            stimulating economic growth. These goals will be achieved\n            through local-level capacity building efforts and\n            implementation of demand-driven micro-projects. The CAP\n            explicitly aimed at supporting Niger's emerging process\n            of decentralization by given communities the responsibility\n            and resources for local development and by providing local\n            governments with the means and administrative capacity to\n            support the communities to which they are accountable. The\n            global environmental objective of the project is to promote\n            community-based integrated ecosystem management as a means\n            of reducing the region's vulnerability to\n            desertification and poverty, while fostering the multiple\n            global environmental benefits such as reduction of\n            vulnerability to climate change and conservation of\n            biodiversity and agro-biodiversity."}, "docdt": "2003-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
