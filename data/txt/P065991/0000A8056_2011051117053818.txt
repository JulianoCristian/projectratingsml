                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR of the Additional Financing (Component F-Avian Flu) of the first phase of the Niger Community Action Program (CAP1 - P105362, the Original Project ) which
                         closed on June 30, 2008. CAP1 blended GEF (P107841) and PHRD (TF056567) which supported mass planting of Acacia senegal in Niger also closed on June 30, 2008 and on
                         December 31, 2008 respectively. This update only captures activities related to the Component F, all other sections remaining as in the last sequence before closing of the Original
                         Project.
                         Overall, the Component has performed well towards the closing of the Grant Agreement, as regard the implementation progress; and the development objectives were met. Indeed
                         steady improvements have been recorded regarding the implementation of the component since last ISR of April 2010. Disbursement of the grant proceeds moved from 21% in
                         January 2010 to 83% in December 2010 (not accounting for pending commitments) thanks to (i) close monitoring of the action plan agreed during the January 2010 supervision
                         mission, through weekly updates and Bank and Project teams virtual meetings and discussions of the implementation and procurement plans, and (ii) tight follow up of major pending
                         commitments and contracts. However some activities considered during the restructuring/extension of the closing date in June 2010 ware not completed, including the replacement of
                         the freeze-dryer (Lyophilisateur) of the Niamey Central Veterinary Laboratory (LABOCEL), which is critical for the country's ability to produce veterinary vaccines . The implementing
                         unit focused its effort on completing core activities such as the training of veterinary and medical staff in targeted areas in connection with A/H5N1 and A/H1N1, and the
                         establishment of isolation centers provided with adequate equipment in of 3 regional health centers in Maradi, Zinder and Tahoua, and the upgrading of the central veterinary
                         laboratory (LABOCEL) facilities in Niamey and its regional branch in Zinder.
