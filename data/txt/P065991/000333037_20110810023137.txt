1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design 1

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The countries of the Sahel are among the poorest in the world, and by most
measures Niger was, and still is, the poorest of these, ranked by the United Nations as
number 174 of 177 in the world. Two-thirds of the people live in poverty; at the time of
appraisal the per capita GDP (US$180) had fallen to less than half of what it had been two
decades earlier. The Government of Niger understood that poverty was not simply the
result of low income levels, but caused by widespread lack of access to food, clean water,
natural resources, medical care, education, financing, and other economic and social
services.

2.      At appraisal, the biggest obstacle to promoting rural development in Niger was the
agro-ecological resource base, characterized by fragile and degrading arable land, low
rainfall, and periodic droughts. A combination of rapid population growth, southward
migration in response to droughts, and few opportunities for employment outside
agriculture increased pressure on the limited amount of fertile land. Ninety-nine percent of
cultivated lands were rain-fed, meaning that crops and farm incomes were vulnerable to
erratic rainfall and droughts. Farmers lacked the technologies, credit, and organization to
access ground and surface water and to share successfully its use. In 1965 one-quarter of
Niger was arable; by 2002 only one-eighth was arable--and during that period the
population almost quadrupled. Eighty-five percent of Niger's population was pressed into
a corridor about 100 to 150 kilometers wide north of the Nigerian border. Given the
encroachment of the Sahara and an obvious downward trend in rainfall, there is perhaps
no country in the world more at risk from desertification than Niger.

3.      Biodiversity. The flora and fauna of the Sahel are well adapted to cope with the
erratic and harsh weather there, but the agricultural species are much more vulnerable to
the climate change. Increasing pressure on the diminishing natural rangelands and water
resources in the south decreased the availability and productivity of these natural resources,
and overexploitation of natural species used as food, fodder, household energy, medicinal
plants, veterinary products, and construction material led to a loss of biodiversity.

4.      Agriculture and food security. Agriculture and livestock production provided most
of employment, food, and income for Nigeriens. Of the national actively employed
population, 84 percent of men and 97 percent of women were involved in growing crops
or raising livestock. Despite the large share of public investments devoted to rural

  The first phase of the Community Action Program (CAP1) was prepared as an Adaptable Program Loan,
consisting of three successive, 4-year grants, and as a collaborative effort between the World Bank and the
Global Environmental Fund (GEF). CAP1 was effective in December 11, 2003 and was extended to June 30,
2010 to include a component to fight Avian Influenza, and then extended again until December 31, 2010.
Although original components of CAP1 were closed by June 30, 2008, this ICR was completed during the
Mid-Term Review of the second phase of the Community Action Program (CAP2) in May 2011. Because
the Avian flu component was implemented following completion of the main project, a supplemental ICR
mission was organized in March 2011 and has produced a detailed report on this component with details
included in Annex 3.
                                                    1
development (53 percent over the period 1991-97), the agricultural GDP grew at an
average annual rate of only 0.9 percent in real terms in the period 1966-96, mainly from
increasing the area under cultivation. Considering the population growth, this meant an
annual decline in per capita agricultural GDP by about two percent, and a widespread
increase in the number of food-insecure households. Yields for the staple crops -- millet
and sorghum - were low and declining.

5.     Health. Statistics on the health of Nigeriens were dismal and still are. One out of
four children died before their fifth birthday. Life expectancy was very low (44 years for
males). Four out of five births took place outside health facilities, and two thirds of
women received no prenatal care. The maternal mortality rate in Niger was the highest in
the world. Forty-three percent of children under five suffered from malnutrition. Rural
communities largely depended on traditional medical products coming from the declining
and degrading natural rangelands.

6.       Other factors. Other factors relevant for the project design included very low
primary school enrollment rate, especially for girls; a lack of clean water and sanitation
facilities; poor transport infrastructure from producers to consumers; and limited-access to
rural finance following the collapse of the main rural finance institutions. In addition,
while plans were far advanced for decentralization of public-sector management, the
district-level administration common in most other countries was lacking. This fact alone
made it difficult to promote sustainable local development.

7.      The Government's strategy to attack poverty and related macroeconomic and other
problems was based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2002. On the
environmental side, the Government had completed the National Environmental Plan for
Sustainable Development in 1998. The plan represented a consensus of the Government,
the private sector, and the civil society.

8.      In its Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the World Bank fully aligned itself with
the Government’s poverty reduction programs. In particular, the Community Action
Program provided local investment funds that would encourage communities2 to engage in
income-generating activities while trying to preserve the natural resource base and
ecosystems. As improved social services are priorities for communities, the project was
expected to finance schools, health centers, water supply, disease prevention efforts, and
other such micro-projects through a demand-driven planning. In addition, the project
recognized that poverty reduction would need a greater role from communities, NGOs,
and civil society in the definition, implementation, and execution of local development
efforts and therefore focused on building local capacity to do so.

9.     For the Global Environmental Fund (GEF), the project was to help the
Government achieve its environmental goals, especially a concept known as “community-
based integrated ecosystem management” (CBIEM). This concept, which is included in
GEF's OP 12, is defined for this program as harmonized management of the cultivated

  / The term “community” covers, especially in the project and program names and both in PAD and this
document, the local government areas (communes) and lower-level target units, village clusters (“grappes”).
In providing grants, the village clusters are called communities, separating them thus from communes.

areas, natural rangelands, water resources, and urban areas to maintain or recover a
balance as seen from local, national, and global ecosystem perspectives.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.    The original PDO, as described in the PAD, was to establish and operationalize
decentralized, participatory, and transparent financing mechanisms that empower poor
communities and local governments to take charge of their own development.3

11.      The key performance indicators were as follows:

      (a) 75 percent of communities in targeted communes carry out needs assessments and
          produce feasible development plans;

      (b) 60 percent of targeted communities directly executing project-supported micro-
          projects;

      (c) 75 percent of targeted communes (local Governments) receive training and are
          actively involved in local development.


1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.     The original GEO, as described in the PAD, was to promote community-based
integrated management of ecosystems and natural resources as a means of reducing the
region's vulnerability to desertification, while fostering multiple global environmental
benefits. The key indicators were: (a) trends in the condition of natural resources; (b)
trends in the removal of barriers to CBIEM, such as changes in land cover, in the levels of
degradation of land and water resources, and in the sources of carbon sequestration and
biodiversity; and (c) trends in the different categories and effectiveness of initiatives to
reduce vulnerability to climate change.
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

13.      The PDO was not revised. The key performance indicators were defined more
precisely at midterm to better measure the achievements and to match with the approach in
the Bank’s use of the new results framework rather than the old logical framework. In
addition, in 2008 the avian flu component was added to the project and included its own
set of indicators (see Annex 2). The new key performance indicators were as follows:


3
  In the original Grant Agreement, the PDO and GEO were combined, and read as follows: “The objectives
of the Project are to: (i) assist the Recipient to design and implement decentralized, participatory, and
transparent financing mechanisms that enable Communities and Local Governments to carry out their own
development plans; and (ii) promote Community-based Integrated Ecosystem Management, and foster
multiple global environmental benefits.”
                                                    3
      (a) Percentage of communities (village clusters) that have elaborated a feasible
          community development plan (the reference number of communities was not
          specified at appraisal, but it was defined early during implementation as at 150,
          and then at midterm as at 178 village clusters, and including those 12 village
          clusters that were included in the pilot phase);

      (b) Percentages of communities that have implemented at least five CAP-supported
          micro-projects from their Local Development Plans (the reference number of
          communities was 178 village clusters);

      (c) Percentages of communes that have implemented at least three CAP-supported
          micro-projects from their Communal Development Plan (the reference number of
          communities was 54 communes).


1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
14.     The GEO was not revised. However, the indicators were modified to be: (i) the
area of marginal lands under cultivation of annual crops; and (ii) the area of marginal land
being protected and/or actively recovered.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

15.     The target population of the project were the poor and vulnerable within the
selected 54 communes and 178 communities (village clusters) where they live. However,
because the tools to address poverty are multiple, there were several other beneficiaries.
Key central institutions for implementing the PRSP were to benefit from improved
governance in central ministries through the integration and the implementation of the
existing cross-sectoral, institutional and legislative frameworks and through the
monitoring and evaluation system. Because the program also included the environment,
beneficiaries were in zones where there was a high need for achieving global
environmental benefits through CBIEM.

16.    Beneficiaries for the new avian flu component, added in 2008, were the local
populations, mostly rural poor, who were to be helped through actions for the prevention
and control of HPAI outbreaks in Niger. Among the beneficiaries were consumers of
poultry products and the population at large, because a vast outbreak of avian flu--not to
speak of the likely panic arising in such a case—would have seriously affected health (see
Annex 3).


1.7 Original Components (as approved)

17.      Originally the Project had five components:

  (a) The Community Support component (US$3.5 million) was aimed at introducing
      decentralized and participatory planning procedures and implementation
      competence by developing the capacity of Community Based Organizations
                                      4
    (CBOs) to design, to carry out, and to manage microprojects. This component was
    to be implemented in all villages or village clusters (communities) in a selected
    sample of communes in all eight regions (about 15-20 percent of the total
    population) using a participatory approach. NGOs or other facilitators were to help
    communities conduct needs assessments and draft local development plans (LDPs).
    Especially through the capacity building efforts and experience by using the learn-
    by-doing approach of this component, the project was an essential instrument to
    support the project development objective (PDO) of establishing and
    operationalize a transparent mechanism for transferring funds for local
    development, and the environmental objective of increasing the people’s
    knowledge about the need for integrated ecosystem management.

(b) The Local Governance Support component (US$3.75 million) was aimed at
    strengthening administrative and fiscal aspects of integrated local development and
    supporting central government activities that facilitate decentralization, which was
    in its infancy, thus helping achieve the objectives of empowering local
    administrations. The component, encompassing in this phase 54 communes (about
    20 percent), had two sub-components:

       Local governance, which included selecting for project support local
        governments in each of the eight regions, and
       Policy and institutional reforms, under which the project was to assist the
        central government bodies responsible for decentralization and land tenure
        issues to accelerate the process of decentralization.

(c) The Local Investment Fund (US$26.6 million). Admitting that poverty reduction
    is impossible or very slow to reach the local level in the poorest countries without
    financial resources, the project was to set up a Local Investment Fund as the
    financing facility for the program. It was to channel small capital grants to
    communities and local governments for financing microprojects. A central
    principle of the CAP was that communities and communes would decide to use the
    LIF for any microproject they consider important, as long as it was part of the
    development plan prepared locally in a participatory fashion. One-half of the
    available GEF funds (US$2.1 million) were to be blended with the IDA funds
    under this component.

(d) The Poverty and Environmental Monitoring (M&E) component (US$4.99
    million) had three purposes: (i) to measure , poverty trends, to set up baselines
    for the PRSP, to monitor national trends in Niger's ecosystems and management of
    natural resources, and to monitor trends in community access to social and
    economic services; (ii) to monitor the CAP and provide timely feedback to
    communities and program management on relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and
    impact of program interventions so that rapid corrective action could be taken
    when necessary; and (iii) to strengthen local communities' capacity to analyze and
    manage their own integrated process for local development and ecosystem
    planning.

(e) The Support to Project Management component (US$4.99million). Institutional
    arrangements for project implementation consisted of a Steering Committee, a
                                      5
       National Coordination Unit (Cellule de Coordination National--CCN), and
       Regional Coordination Units in each of the eight regions of the country. In addition,
       there were regional Approval Committees for microprojects. The component also
       contained significant resources for capacity building because of the recognized
       weaknesses in competencies of both the public and nongovernmental sectors, the
       latter of which were to help carry out the program. The GEF funds were to cover
       various aspects of program management to help coordinate crosscutting CBIEM-
       related activities, including communication initiatives on environmental programs.

1.8 Revised Components (Avian Influenza)

18.    A supplementary grant equivalent to US$4.5 million was added in 2008 (toward the
end of the CAP’s implementation) to finance a new Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI) prevention and control component. This could not come from the original project
(which was expected to be fully disbursed for the original components), but was an additional
grant under the World Bank OP/BP 13.20. This new Component F was expected to be
implemented in two years (that is by June 30, 2010) but the completion period was extended
by six months to December 31, 2010. The avian flu component included the following
subcomponents:

  (a) Support for the recipient country’s veterinary services related to HPAI,
      particularly: (i) enhancing prevention and preparedness capacity; (ii) strengthening
      disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity; and (iii) strengthening control
      programs and outbreak containment plans;

  (b) Support for the recipient country’s human health services for HPAI, particularly:
      (i) strengthening national public health surveillance systems, and (ii) strengthening
      the health system response capacity;

  (c) Improvement of public awareness and communications on HPAI, particularly:
      (i) supporting information and communications activities, and (ii) improving
      collaboration with the recipient country’s partners and stakeholders, about HPAI;
      and

  (d) Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of avian influenza-related
      activities.

19.    A separate and detailed review of the Avian flu component is found in Annex 3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.    Project preparation and background analysis were as sound as could be expected at the
time of appraisal and benefited in particular from: (a) lessons already learned from other rural
development projects, in particular CBD/CDD projects, in Niger and elsewhere, (b) from a


                                             6
community-driven development project preceding this project, and (c) from a pilot operation
(see Box 1).

21.      Lessons from other programs
                                                Box 1: The CDD context: The community-driven
included sustainability, decentralization,      development (CDD) approach built on a rich history of
institution building, monitoring and            innovations in participatory development, originally
evaluation,     and     community        and    experimented outside the Bank. The CDD programs
development funds. The Natural Resource         also reflect lessons from earlier efforts by the Bank in
Management Project (PGRN) that was              support of community-based development (CBD)
                                                initiatives in the Bank’s client countries. There are
about to be completed provided an excellent     several CDD operating principles that are markedly
source of guidance in community-driven          different from CBD program mechanisms which were
programs, decentralized management of           conceived in response to perceived shortcomings in
natural resources, and the role of              earlier CBD efforts. Particular differences were in
stakeholders in conserving biodiversity. The    CDD design features for institutional arrangements,
                                                the role of local government, and broader governance
preparation process included pilot activities   linkages. In 2003, soon after the CAP in Niger started,
in the field, managed by eight international    the CDD portfolio comprised iterative and evolving
and national NGOs. This was an important        programs that built on lessons from across the
part of the preparation process as it           portfolio. In these programs particular focus was on
provided lessons on which to design the         sustainability, local leadership challenges, and M&E.
                                                The total number of Bank projects that included a
implementation phase. In addition, they         CBD/CDD component had increased from 5 percent to
established institutional linkages with         25 percent during the period 1989 to 2003. Most
NGOs and donors which were expected to          African countries had some type of CDD projects.

22.     Designing     the    project    was
challenging because it encompassed a major task in Niger’s public administration while trying
to kick-start local development. The design involved a wide range of activities, including
capacity building for planning and budgeting processes, transfer of financial resources to
communes and communities, financial management and procurement systems, decentralization,
policies and regulations for natural resource management, natural resource and agricultural
extension, and so on.

23.     Even in retrospect, and based on the lessons from other programs and the overall
assignment of local-level development, the objectives and approach selected for the program
appeared appropriate. The program was to: (a) be long-term; (b) cover multiple sectors; (c)
ensure active participation of communities; (d) rely on decentralized financial management; (e)
put strong emphasis on monitoring and evaluation; (f) provide financial mechanisms to satisfy
basic needs while actively promoting activities that will ensure long-term viability of
ecosystems and natural resources; and (g) propose concrete steps for making local
governments or the private sector responsible for providing services previously provided by
the central government.

24.    In the pilot phase, three donors were also involved: the African Development
Foundation, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, and the European Union. Still,
because none of them were ready to co-finance the project, substantial financial resources and
experience in carrying out similar projects were needed, thus justifying the World Bank’s
intervention. The pilot activities were an important part of the preparation process, because
they helped share experiences between the donors and implementing NGOs and provided
                                            7
lessons on which to design the implementation phase. Because of the pilot phase, project
preparation was allowed to be one year longer than it would have been otherwise.

25.     The Government was fully behind the program. To support program preparation a
working group from central ministries, NGOs, and related donor-funded initiatives was
established. Besides, the Government created a multisectoral steering committee from eight
ministries to oversee the program. However, indecision about which ministry would supervise
the project (the Ministry of Economy and Finance or the Ministry of Agricultural
Development) delayed the project’s effectiveness.

26.    In essence, the risks and mitigating measures were properly assessed. One risk that had
been discussed at appraisal but not recorded as a risk in PAD was the possible disinterest of the
local populations in natural resource management issues, if no short-term incentives were
offered. In retrospect this turned out be a significant problem (see beneficiary survey results
(Annex 6) and stakeholder workshops (Annexes 7 and 8).

27.     The component F on avian flu was prepared as an emergency project (see Annex 3). In
view of the emergency nature and novelty of the avian flu component, project preparation and
background analysis were as sound as could be expected at the time the Project Paper was
prepared, particularly because the document was formulated by Bank staff who were very
experienced in Nigerien rural development and governmental administration, in collaboration
with the capable coordinator of the Cellule Permanante/Comité nationale de la lutte contre la
grippe aviaire (a multiministerial and multiagency committee to lead the fight against avian
flu). In retrospect, because little practical preparation and planning had been done before
approval, the project period – two years – turned out be unrealistic.

2.2 Implementation

28.    During the project period, there were no major changes in the project design, neither
was the project ever in a risk status. The midterm review was carried out in the third year of
the project, and it included both a self-assessment by the project and an external analysis by
the World Bank team.

29.    Many factors helped implement the project, including :

  (a) An effective dialogue and coordination mechanism was maintained between the
      Government, donor partners, and the project both in the field and at the national
      level.
  (b) Supervision missions were carried out regularly and as a combined effort of the
      Bank, the Government, and the project staff. The midterm review provided
      effective guidance and feedback to the implementing authorities. This probably
      helped offset, at least partly, the lack of a well-defined results framework during
      the first two or three years of the project (see 2.3 below).
  (c) The project benefited from an experienced project management team; essentially
      the same team that had managed implementation of the Natural Resources
      Management Project (PGRN) continued in the Central Coordination Unit (CCN) of
      this project.


                                             8
30.    Several factors adversely affected the speed and quality of implementation:

   (a) Diversity of the project components and activities required preparation of a
       multitude of manuals, guidelines, and training modules, consuming project
       resources and delaying implementation; supervision and technical support to the
       project required large missions and plenty of time to carry them out.
  (b) During the first two years, the M&E system of the project did not provide, apart
       from financial monitoring, satisfactory information to effectively gauge
       implementation progress.
  (c) During the early years of the project, Niger was hit by a locust invasion and
       drought in two consecutive years.
  (d) Throughout the project, there was lack of funds for some activities, especially
       because of delays and of failure to provide counterpart funds in a timely fashion,
       common also for other projects in Niger. These funds were needed for staff salaries,
       but also for procurement of goods and consultant services, and payment of
       operating costs. (However, the Government continues to pay the arrears
       counterpart contributions, thus allowing the project to keep the core CCN staff and
       continue with the carbon sequestration program).

31.     The implementation of the avian flu component started slowly (see Annex 3) because
of inadequate preparation in the emergency context. The operations manual, implementation
plan, budgeting, logical framework, procurement plan, etc., all had to be done before the
component’s work could properly proceed. Thus, 18 months after the component became
effective, only 21 percent of component funds had been disbursed. However, progress was
excellent after the January 2010 implementation support mission, and at the end of the
extended implementation period nearly all component funds was used.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     Design. The funds under Component D helped establishment of the project’s M&E.
The project had a satisfactory logical framework according to the World Bank guidelines at the
project appraisal. It laid out the objectives of the program, causal relationships, and underlying
assumptions about how program actions would lead to intended outcomes. The design of the
project’s M&E had two main weaknesses: (i) input indicators were sometimes used as output
indicators and some output indicators were not precise or quantitative; and (ii) the indicators
for the GEF objective were difficult to measure in practice.

33.    Implementation. Except for financial monitoring that was good from the very beginning
of the project, implementation of the M&E system started relatively slowly because of an
inexperienced M&E coordinator. After two years, a new coordinator was selected, and since
then progress in M&E implementation was generally very good. Suitable data was collected by
the project through an M&E set-up established from villages to CCN and surveys were
conducted on a regular and timely basis. With respect to the main design weaknesses: (i) CAP
was the first IDA project in Niger to complete the transition to a results-based M&E system;
(ii) new environmental sub-indicators were developed to better monitor the GEF output,
baseline data were established, and two environmental surveys were undertaken. Also, it
proved difficult to fully carry out the national-level poverty monitoring system.

                                              9
34.     Utilization. Especially after midterm, the M&E system was a very important part of the
project management and supervision missions. Qualitative evidence, coupled with quantitative
facts allowed better-informed decision making. Examples were the use of M&E results to
readjust and simplify guidelines for micro-projects to improve their mix and spread, and
halting the implementation of Component A one year before the end of the project, because an
adequate level of knowledge and know-how about micro-projects was achieved in village
clusters supported by the project.

35.     The Project Paper for the avian flu component listed indicators to measure the
performance, and a detailed logical framework was developed which served as an excellent
tool for management. Extensive training on M&E was successful in ensuring that reporting on
the component’s activities was regular. Because of the short duration of the component, there
was no formal evaluation of outcomes. However, the CAP organized in 2010 an evaluation
exercise with beneficiaries (see Annex 8).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     Safeguard policies. The Bank’s safeguard policies triggered by the project were OP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats), and OP4.12 (Involuntary
resettlement). An environmental assessment and an environmental management plan were
prepared before the project began, and a study on conservation of natural habitats was expected
at appraisal. Subsequent studies have shown an increase in land animals and birds especially in
project-supported reforestation and land management areas. In the early part of project
implementation, CCN review teams noted lack of environmental considerations in some of the
micro-projects. Although no substantive concern about involuntary resettlement was originally
expected, some micro-projects (water schemes, Acacia Senegal, and other indigenous
plantations) have resulted in actual movement of households. Thus, CCN and the Permanent
Secretariat of “Code Rural” have prepared and implemented compensation rules for such cases.

37.     The Project Paper for the avian flu component was assigned category B and it triggered
OP/BP 4.01 because of its generation of medical waste in health centers and laboratories, thus
requiring an environmental assessment. It also triggered OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management)
because of the use of chemicals in disinfecting carcasses and decontaminating burning sites,
and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) because of the potential need for land acquisition
for burning and burial sites (see Annex 3).

38.     Fiduciary compliance. The project accounts, including regional sub-accounts and
Special Accounts, were audited regularly. All audits were unqualified. The main problems
stemmed from a lack of budget control; that is, coordination between the financial accounts
and commitments for project implementation, resulting in an over-commitment, especially in
micro-project approvals, and frequent complaints by Bank missions about “IDA overruns” (in
disbursement categories). These problems were resolved toward the end of the project by
halting approval of new micro-project applications and by reallocating project funds.

39.    During the project period two Procurement Reviews were carried out. In addition,
the Bank’s procurement specialists regularly participated in supervision missions. Apart
from some advisory notes, the reviewers have made no major comments on CAP’s
procurement activities. The procurement activities have been considered as moderately

                                           10
risky in the Procurement Reviews and as satisfactory in most Implementation Support
Reports (ISRs).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.     To ensure a seamless transition from CAP1 to CAP2 under this 12-year adaptable
loan (grant) approach, and to take advantage of the fact that CAP I had achieved the
triggers and thus qualified to move to the next phase of the program, CAP2 was prepared
and appraised under an accelerated procedure in early 2008. The project was approved by
the World Bank during the first week of September 2008, with financing of a US$30
million IDA grant and a US$4.67 million GEF grant. Project costs were estimated to total
US$44.97 million, including US$10.3 million from the Government and beneficiaries.
CAP2 was co-financed with $16m from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD).

41.     For the avian flu component, the most important achievement after project
completion is the existence of the Cellule Permanante/Comité nationale de la lutte contre
la grippe aviaire, and the network of committees, focal points, and trained field agents in
three ministries. The Government is committed to continue their work, but resources are
very limited. It can continue paying the salaries of the two permanent staff and the office
expenses, but nothing more has been budgeted for, and no donor agencies are continuing
assistance for this purpose. Although there has been no new attack of avian flu in Niger,
the case for having a new project or other form of continued financial assistance is strong
(see Annex 3).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.     The objectives, design, and contribution of the Community Action Project have
retained their high overall current relevance. The project objectives of institutional
development, reduction of poverty through local investments and infrastructures, and a
contribution to reducing natural resource degradation, remain as high a priority as they
were at appraisal. This is confirmed by the Government’s Strategy to Accelerate Growth
and Poverty Reduction for the period 2008-2012. The World Bank’s current CAS
acknowledges that a key development challenge for Niger is rural development, in
particular to unlock the growth potential of the agricultural sector. During implementation,
the project adapted, as much as possible within its resources and framework, to changed
circumstances; for example, the main environmental focus became carbon sequestration
(growing Acacia Senegal and other indigenous trees), and a completely new component ,
preparations to fight against the avian flu was added.

43.     During 2009 and 2010 there were no outbreaks of avian flu. Because the networks
built up in Niger can be used against other epidemic diseases, subcomponents for helping
veterinary services, human health care, communications, and monitoring and evaluation in
the fight against avian flu (which subcomponents are applicable also for fighting other
epidemics), the objectives, design, and implementation approach are still highly relevant.


                                            11
3.2 Achievement of Project Development and Global Environment Objectives

44.    In assessing the achievement of project objectives, it is necessary to recall that the
PDO indicators were defined more precisely at midterm to better measure the
achievements and to match with the new Results Framework rather than the old Logical
Framework. Here below are the revised indicators.. The achievement of key indicators
was as follows:

Key Indicator                                     Total number of Target     Percentage
                                                  units supported percentage reached
Percentage of communities that have               178 communities 75%        100%
elaborated a feasible Local Development Plans
Percentage of communities that have           178 communities 60%                   75%
implemented at least five CAP-supported
micro-projects
Percentage of communes that have implemented 54 communes      60%                   70%
at least three CAP-supported micro-projects

45.     The achievements provide appropriate evidence that the Project Development
Objective has been met and causal linkages between the components and objectives have
been established. Without successfully setting up decentralized, participatory, and
transparent financing (resource transfer) mechanisms—as required by PDO--it would have
not been possible to have community and commune development plans and to implement
the expected number of micro-projects. All stakeholder groups and anyone contacted
(including the Departmental officials in Tillabéri and commune councils) agreed on this
conclusion in conversations with or reports to the mission.

46.     The successful achievement of the PDO stemmed largely from the success of
activities in the various components of the project. Most targets set for these were attained
or exceeded, as shown in Annex 2. These results were reached essentially with the project
interventions (other donors were active in other, more limited areas).

47.     Achievement of GEO. The goal of the GEO was to promote community-based
integrated management of ecosystems and natural resources in order to reduce the region's
vulnerability to desertification. While it was not clear at project closing whether some of
the original indicators had been achieved (for example, trends in cropping areas and
energy for household, food, and medicinal products were not measured), important
achievements were made in community-based management of natural resources. For
instance, 93 percent of the approved micro-projects included measures to safeguard
environmental and social aspects (the target was 32 percent), some 7,800 ha by Acacia
Senegal and other indigenous trees had been planted, and 9,000 ha of land area had been
improved by sustainable natural management technologies. (Outputs are presented in
Annex 2.)

48.     Achievement of objectives for avian flu component: Most targets set for the
indicators were attained or exceeded. Achieving the objectives stemmed largely from the
success of activities in the various subcomponents (building a good response against the


                                             12
avian flu required capacity building in veterinary and human health services, in
environmental surveillance, and in communications and monitoring).

3.3 Efficiency

49.     The appraisal mission did not perform economic analysis or calculate a financial
rate of return for the whole project for several reasons, in particular because the type of
project in question, with its several components, many for social development or capacity
building, does not lend itself to reliable economic analysis.

50.     The PAD analysis tried to use a conventional approach and estimated returns to
typical project investments financed under one component, the Local Investment Fund.
Thus, a cost-benefit analysis was undertaken on a sample of income-generating activities
that were likely to be among community priorities. The analyses included small animal
husbandry, petty trade, peanut oil extraction, flour milling, animal carts, and irrigated
agriculture. All micro-project investments were found to be profitable, with the exception
of growing niébe and rice, which could be made profitable only by improving farming
practices (for details, see Annex 4).

51.     In 2007 the Project Coordination Unit (CCN) and the Ministry of Agriculture
organized, with the help of consultants, an extensive study on the profitability of micro-
projects.4 This study, using NPV and IRR as the principal tools, showed that 60 percent of
micro-project investments were profitable. The remaining 40 percent would have required
improvements in their design and implementation to be profitable (nonmonetary benefits
were not counted). There were wide variations of profitability depending on the purpose of
micro-project, regions where they were implemented, and their “management” group
(women’s groups being the best). A summary of the method and results is in Annex 4.

52.     No cost analysis was done in the above-mentioned micro-project study, and even
for the Local Investment Fund component no cost-efficiency analysis was done of micro-
projects or areas to be covered by GEF activities apart from NPV and IRR calculations. It
was not possible for the ICR mission to do this analysis retroactively, partly because the
project components were related to “soft “ activities and partly because the mission did not
have information on the costs of the large number of activities carried out by the project.
However, in general terms the ICR mission noted that the projected cost of project
management exceeded the budget by more than 120 percent. There were some acceptable
reasons for this: new activities were incorporated into the project, training costs in the
field were mistakenly assigned to the management component in the early years, and there
was a lack of knowledge about the complexities of multi-sectoral local development at
appraisal.

53.    The cost-efficiency of the micro-projects, especially those for social purposes, also
needs further exploring. The micro-project study did not analyze these costs, but the
estimates of the ICR team show that the average cost of a micro-project was equivalent of

 / Evaluation de la rentabilité économique et financière des microprojets générateurs de revenus.
by CAP consultants Yeve Hassane, Doga Garbo, et Siddo Mahamadou, Septembre 2007.
                                               13
US$13,000. As most of the 1,170 village-level investments were small, it is probable that
the 375 commune-level micro-projects were substantially more expensive, but CCN M&E
activity had not collected separate information about the amounts used for commune-level
grants and community-level productive micro-projects. The mission’s review of selected
investments in the regions pointed out that funding for productive micro-projects ranged
from a few hundred US dollars for individuals to between US$5,000 and US$9,000 for
groups (for example, for flour mills, raising animals and processing animal products, and
peanut oil milling), and between US$10,000 and US$20,000 for such commune-level
investments as for cereal, animal feed, and farm input stores.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

54.    Rating: Satisfactory. Factors favoring the satisfactory rating or better include the
following:

55.    The project objective remains relevant even in the current economic and
environmental situation, particularly considering the impossibility of developing such a
large country as Niger without decentralization and improved local development capacity
(Section 3.1)

56.     The development objectives and output targets based on agreed performance
indicators were achieved and partially exceeded (Annex 2).

57.    Work to attain the GEO generated significant results, although not all targets were
achieved.

58.     A factor that prevented a higher rating for project development and output
objectives was the uncertainty about the project’s efficiency (that is, whether the results
could have been achieved less expensively), which could not be fully verified because of a
lack of relevant information in the Government’s study on project results. Also, although
NPV and IRR calculations indicated that the most of micro-project investments were
profitable, as much as 40 percent of them were unprofitable (not counting the non-
monetary benefits) and would have required better design and implementation.

59.    The ICR mission for the avian flu component also found that the overall outcome
was satisfactory, given that output targets were achieved and the component objective
remains relevant (see Annex 3).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

        (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.    The extent of the project’s impact on poverty was not measured, because the
planned poverty and environmental monitoring and evaluation system has not yet been
completed (see 2.3). However, the micro-project profitability studies and end-of-project
evaluation reports point out that poverty among the project’s beneficiaries has declined. It
is noteworthy that although the productive micro-projects under CAP may not have been
for the very poorest because participation in these micro-projects has required a
                                            14
contribution of 10 to 20 percent, even the very poorest could still benefit from the social
micro-projects and collectively managed environmental micro-projects. The Bank’s
economic sector work on the impacts of SLM programs on land management practices,
agricultural production, and poverty in Niger have also showed favorable economic
impacts of several land management practices.

61.     In 2006, CCN organized a study on the position of women and youth in project
areas. The results showed that both groups had gained recognition, particularly women.
The target of providing 25 percent of productive micro-projects to women’s groups was
reached, and the target of having women account for one-third of the members of elected
bodies at communes, communities, and micro-project committee was reached in many
places, especially where women were active enough to present themselves for elections.
Where women were traditionally more withdrawn and less educated, this target was not
attained. For youth, the project has offered new opportunities to show their initiative,
especially under the carbon sequestration program.

62.     The project had substantial impact on social development through financing
construction and equipment of schools, improving access to potable water and hygienic
latrines, developing feeder roads and marketing infrastructures, and so on. Micro-projects
for these purposes totaled 672, representing, 43 percent of all micro-projects. The statistics
on these investments are shown in Annex 2.

63.    The extent of the avian flu component’s impact on poverty was not measured,
because no actual attack occurred. However, if this had been the case, it would have
mostly affected the poor (see Annex 3).

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.     As discussed in section 3.2 above, CAP was the main financial instrument for
decentralizing public administration and services to 54 communes (20 percent of the total).
In addition, the project helped 178 communities (village clusters) develop adequate
capacity to design, execute, and evaluate integrated local development/ecosystem plans; to
improve their management capabilities; and to secure, plan, and manage financial
resources. Furthermore, the key central institutions for carrying out the PRSP benefited
from better governance in central ministries through the integration of existing cross-
sectoral, institutional, and legislative frameworks and through support to the monitoring
and evaluation systems. The opinion shared by all groups of stakeholders is that without
CAP these developments would not have been possible (see Annex 7 and 8 on
stakeholders’ workshops).

65.    Similarly, the avian flu component was the main financier for building
decentralized capacity to fight the threat of the avian flu in three key ministries and in the
regions that were perceived to be areas most likely to suffer should the virus find its way
to Niger. Besides the network created, the main institutional beneficiary was the Cellule
permanente/Comité national de lutte contre la grippe aviaire, for which the avian flu
component developed the operational tools.



                                             15
       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

66.    The large number of approved micro-projects in relation to the available
manpower and financial resources forced the project to develop a better-integrated
financial control system that will serve the follow-on project as well.

67.     A major discovery during the project was that the network built against avian flu
was also useful for other animal-human-transmissible diseases. This benefit was
recognized during the February 2010 emergence of the swine flu (H1N1 virus) in Niger
and raised discussion within the avian flu network about other possible similar uses for the
network.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68.    Stakeholder workshops. The ICR mission held workshops with stakeholders in
three groups: the public and the private sectors, the donor community, and NGOs (see
Annex 7) and in 2010 there was another stakeholder meeting on the avian flu component
(Annex 8). The lessons suggested by stakeholders are incorporated in Section 6—Lessons
learned. Highlights from workshops are as follows:

   (a) The CAP provided a platform for extensive discussions among international and
       national development partners and therefore has helped a certain degree of
       harmonization of external assistance in the rural development sector; the
       development partners have been actively reviewing and commenting on such
       documents as project-related policies and various guidelines and manuals;

   (b) Commune- and community-level investments have helped establish elected bodies
       at the communes and have reinforced the capacities and provided infrastructure
       both at commune and cluster levels. Other donor agencies have benefited from
       increased capacities and facilities. However, too little attention may have been paid
       to maintenance of facilities created at these levels, and if maintenance is not
       improved, the results may be lost when donor money is no longer available;

   (c) Various sectoral ministries have provided technical assistance to micro-projects,
       but the quality needs to be monitored, especially for water; in addition, the triple
       involvement of technical services (in preparation of a micro-project, in its approval,
       and in supervision) could be a weakness; delays and shortfalls in the Government’s
       ten percent counterpart funding have impeded the organization of field missions;

   (d) When people are struggling for survival, they do not necessarily prioritize
       environmental microprojects, which only generate benefits in the long run, over
       productive and social microprojects which tend to generate benefits in a shorter
       timeframe. The participatory planning process need to take account of this bias.

   (e) With respect to avian flu, the project was extremely influential in Niger because it
       introduced an integrated approach to the fight against the avian flu, one that has
       been successfully implemented in the key ministries and other agencies. The new
       component stimulated an entirely new level of dynamism in the ministries, their
       personnel, and local populations by providing important information, training,
                                            16
       equipment, and operational resources to stakeholders in the fight against avian flu
       and who, without the project, would have had little chances to organize protection
       against this potential calamity. The project gave a large number of people
       knowledge about and skills to fight avian flu; and it helped form coordination
       committees at the regional, departmental, and community levels to take charge of
       the avian flu-related activities.

69.    Beneficiary survey. A beneficiary survey was carried out in 2005-06. It is
summarized in Annex 6 and the full survey is available in project files (see Annex 9).
While the survey report handles all beneficiary groups, the following presents selected
observations regarding women and environmental issues:

   (a) Women’s groups in general predate CAP and are organized around contribution or
       savings and credit activity (tontines). Women have confirmed that CAP has
       energized their groups and offered new possibilities to improve their conditions
       and start new economic activities;

   (b) Although the beneficiaries of CAP are aware of the degradation of their
       environment, environmental micro-projects do not have the highest priority in
       LDPs, and the villagers have been reluctant to provide cash or in-kind
       contributions to the community to implement such micro-projects, although the
       required contributions were only from 5 percent to 10 percent of the investment.
       The reasons include the extent of poverty, which makes people favor such
       activities as cereal banks, farm input stores, and the breeding of animals, but also
       wide-spread approaches by other donors and in particular NGOs, which provide
       different kinds of material incentives to make people participate in environmental
       programs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

70.    Rating: Moderate. The moderate risk rating reflects the following assessment of
the potential sources of risks and the likely mitigating effect of existing/likely
arrangements.

71.     Capacity to continue decentralization and finance the established communes. A
concern is the limited financial capacity of the central and the decentralized public sectors
to perform their duties and provide services initiated by CAP1 funds. The mitigating
factors of this risk include the Government’s clear commitment to decentralization, the
capacity-building that has already taken place in target communes, and the fact that
communes have already been able to improve their fund raising (e.g., collection of taxes).
There is low risk that the decentralization will not continue because the Government’s
financial gap will be filled largely over the next few years by CAP2 and other donor funds.

72.    Profitability and maintenance of micro-projects: The technical review of the
micro-project facilities in 2007 showed that nearly all structures were technically well
implemented and only about 3 percent were of inadequate quality. However, the
unprofitability rate of 40 percent for productive micro-projects under Component 3 (Local
Investment Fund) raised some concerns (Annex 4): The micro-projects do have
nonmonetary benefits, but if their profitability cannot be improved, they may soon be
                                             17
closed or must find subsidy funds to continue. CAP has already been promoting better
budgeting and budget control. It is also important to maintain enough net income to ensure
good maintenance of micro-project investments, irrespective of whether they are for
productive or social purposes. In this respect, improved fund raising by communes could
provide some relief at least for social micro-projects.

73.     Capacity to deal with threat of avian flu: The review mission for this component
rated the risk as “significant” (see Annex 3), given the potential sources of risk and the
likely mitigating effect of existing arrangements to deal with the threat in future.
Resources are too limited in the post-completion phase to effectively operate the Cellule
Permanente and continue to expand the avian flu network.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

74.     Rating: Satisfactory. It was well known at the time of project design that getting
local development started in one of the poorest countries in the world would be difficult
and could not be done by single-component projects, however well coordinated or linked
with other financiers. Thus, a multi-component and multi-agency approach, while clearly
demanding, was the only option for the preparation and appraisal teams. The Bank played
a key role in helping the Government develop the strategy and the concept for Nigerien
conditions. The Bank also financed a Project Preparation Facility and helped with its
personnel needed to do analytical work and to coordinate with the Government and
potential development partners (although none of them joined as co-financiers).
Considering the poverty-reduction strategies of Government (in whose formulation the
Bank had been instrumental), the objectives of the project were fully relevant at the time
of preparation. Circumstances dictated the linking of decentralization, development of
capacity at the national, regional, and local levels, and management of natural resources
with community-driven development and financing mechanisms (funds transfer).
Moreover, a separate management/coordination unit for the project was dictated by the
total lack of field organization before the project. The long and extensive process helped
build strong commitment by the Government and approval by other donors. The risk
assessment was generally appropriate. However, project preparation was inadequate in
respect to the M&E system, especially for the environmental aspects. It was impossible to
implement this fully in the field and thus had to be changed at midterm.

75.      The review mission for the avian flu component rated Quality at Entry as
“moderately satisfactory” (see Annex 3). Bank management reacted to the potential
pandemic well and responded to the Government’s request to help by providing a
substantial amount from the very limited grant amounts available at that time. Furthermore,
the Bank treated the situation as a potential crisis, processed the additional component (in
reality, a new small-scale project) under its emergency rules, and approved the grant on
the basis of the Project Paper without insisting on an appraisal as usual. The Bank
disbursed the funds on timely basis without delays and extended the implementation
period of the component to allow sufficient time to achieve the objectives (which was
                                            18
done successfully). However, because of the urgency to get the project approved, the level
of preparedness to start project activities was insufficient. The detailed planning and
preparation of basic implementation documents, usually done at appraisal or before, were
not done. These were important steps, and doing them after the project had been approved
and became effective led to a slow start in the implementation of the component.
Especially in view of the component staff’s lack of experience in Bank procedures, the
Bank management should have provided full-time personnel experienced in Bank
operations to help the component get started, for instance, by recruiting consultants to act
as expeditors or facilitators.

       (b) Quality of Supervision

76.      Rating: Satisfactory. There were no shortcomings in the proactive identification
of opportunities and resolution of threats. Bank supervision was regular and thorough. The
nine supervision missions during the project period contained a suitable mix of specialty
skills, which was adjusted after each mission. Especially at the beginning of the project the
supervision efforts faced a lack of capacity in the region as the Bank’s decentralization
strategy had not yet been implemented. The aide-memoires were extensive and helped
keep the overall implementation process on track. The ratings in Implementation Status
and Results reports (ISRs) were generally candid, providing Bank management with
information for staff supervision and guiding CCN to pay attention to activities or
processes to be corrected.

77.     Supervision in general was very proactive and flexible. The midterm mission and
its report, for example, led to corrections of the M&E system to make it manageable and
focused on development objectives. Two elements were added to the project: (a) the very
innovative PHRD grant to promote carbon sequestration, and (b) a component to fight
against avian flu.

78.    Preparation of the follow-on project was started early to ensure continuity of the
program. It should also be noted that the extension of the closing date was not due to
shortcomings in the supervision efforts but related to: (a) a delay in effectiveness caused
by the political context in Niger; and (b) the addition of the component on avian flu. The
supervision budget was higher than average but justified given the very high travel cost in
Niger, the lack of supervision skills in-country at the beginning, and the successful
achievement of project outcomes.

79.     The review mission for the avian flu component rated Quality of Supervision as
“moderately satisfactory” (see Annex 3). The Government’s internal project completion
report evaluated the Bank’s assistance as valuable. There had been no formal
implementation support mission, although admittedly Bank staff had often been available
for the component management, and the Bank had organized training of component staff.
But a formal, well-staffed mission immediately after effectiveness would surely have
helped the component start faster than it did. When the first and only implementation
support mission was carried out in January 2010 in collaboration with the Government, it
was thorough and productive. The mission’s report gave good advice, prepared
procurement plans, and organized continued follow-up by requesting weekly progress
reports from the component management. The component’s PDO and intermediate
indicators were satisfactorily achieved.
                                           19
       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

80.     Rating: Satisfactory. The satisfactory rating of overall Bank performance is
justified by the satisfactory Bank performance at entry and satisfactory performance
during supervision. Had Bank performance for the avian flu component been better,
overall Bank performance might have justified a “highly satisfactory” rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

       (a) Government Performance

81.    Rating: Moderately satisfactory. Government contribution was important both in
the design of the project and in the success of its implementation. The Government had
prepared a poverty-reduction strategy and considered the CAP an important vehicle to
achieve its objectives in this respect. In addition, it:

   (a) Organized a multi-agency team to prepare the program, supervise project design,
       acquire the funds to prepare the program, and generally demonstrate its
       commitment to the program;

   (b) Promoted policies and legislation that supported CAP objectives and
       implementation;

   (c) Favored involvement of all donors in the design, discussion, and supervision of the
       program, and encouraged the use of its practices in other rural development efforts;

   (d) Promptly endorsed the recommendations of the supervision missions (e.g.,
       facilitating contacts with the Bank, including making fund transfers);

   (e) Retained the same experienced staff throughout the project period (e.g., by
       providing incentives) and facilitated the one change that was necessary (M&E
       Coordinator);

   (f) Ensured an early start for the transition arrangements by applying for a PPF for the
       follow-on project.


82.     However, the political context was at times difficult. In particular two Government
shortcomings offset the favorable factors just mentioned and justify the lowering of the
overall rating to “moderately satisfactory”:


   (a) Indecision about which ministry would supervise the project (the Ministry of
       Economy and Finance or the Ministry of Agricultural Development) delayed the
       project’s effectiveness;

   (b) Constant delay in paying the annual counterpart funds and failure to contribute part
       of the committed funds made it difficult to implement the disbursement categories
       where Government financing was implied. However, the Government has
       continued to pay counterpart funds after the project ended, thereby enabling the
                                            20
         project staff to continue work while waiting for the follow-on project to become
         effective).

83.     The review mission for the avian flu component rated Government performance as
“satisfactory” (see Annex 3). First, the Government contribution was important because of
the many actions taken before the component was financed. Second, the Government
directed the key ministries to collaborate in the fight against avian flu, use the limited
funds in a rational way, and appointed focal points from among its staff both in the center
and in the regions. Third, the Government also helped supervise the program and promptly
endorsed the recommendations of the supervision mission, as well as following up with
the Bank to obtain an extension to the project period and reallocation of funds. The good
performance of the Government was somewhat tarnished by the slow procurement process,
for which it had review and approval obligations, and by a lack of effort to identify donors
for follow-on support.

         (b) Implementing Agency Performance

84.     Rating: Satisfactory. The “satisfactory” rating for agency performance was based
primarily on the effective work of the Program Coordination Unit (Cellule de
Coordination Nationale, CCN) and the Ministry of Decentralization, although several
other organizations and agencies were also responsible for implementing the key activities
of CAP.

85.      The positive factors included the following:

      (a) Building up from next to nothing a functioning public-sector structure in 20
          percent of Niger’s newly established communes;

      (b) Quickly setting up the program coordination unit and field organization and
          recruiting the service providers in all eight regions;

      (c) Achieving an impressive number of outputs in many and diverse activities;

      (d) Ensuring that a major tenet of the strategy—popular participation and consultation
          with all stakeholders and donors—was strictly and conscientiously adhered to;

      (e) Carrying out numerous studies that improved understanding of the complexities of
          rural development and implementation of poverty alleviation, and validating the
          methodologies by getting key stakeholders and resource persons involved;

      (f) Successfully planning and appraising transition arrangements for the next phase of
          CAP.

86.     Operational problems were corrected gradually. These included an inadequate
monitoring system for management purposes, poor procurement archives, lack of budget
control concerning micro-project applications and available funds, and problems in
replenishing Special Accounts, which caused delays in payments to contractors. However,
the credit for achieving project development objectives offsets the problems encountered
and on balance justifies a “satisfactory” rating.

                                             21
87.     The review mission for the avian flu component rated implementing agency
performance as “satisfactory” (see Annex 3). This is based primarily on satisfactorily
attaining the PDO and intermediate indicators, for which result the implementing agency,
Cellule Permanente and the component staff had the greatest effect. The start of the
implementation was slow, but once the staff learned the procedures required by the Bank,
progress on the numerous targets set for the component was rapid. Moreover, the main
project, CAP1, and its successor, CAP2, provided valuable help in resolving particularly
procurement problems.

        (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

88.     Rating: Satisfactory. The satisfactory rating of overall Borrower’s performance is
justified on the following basis:

    (a) The moderately satisfactory rating for the Government performance is offset by the
        successful performance in project implementation, especially once the main design
        problem, inadequate M&E planning, was corrected at midterm and CCN was able
        to produce acceptable information for decision-making;

    (b) The disbursement lag was eliminated before the extended project period ended;

    (c) The development outcome objectives were essentially reached or even exceeded,
        thanks largely to effectiveness of CCN and support by government agencies,
        earning an overall satisfactory rating for PDO;

    (d) The Government and the implementing agency behaved proactively with respect to
        the avian flu component.


6. Lessons Learned

89.     The following lessons arise from a review of the CAP experience. They consider
the specific country and project characteristics while being forward-looking and relevant
to other countries and projects in the region:5

    (a) Importance of strong supervision and a dedicated team. Bottom-up development
        based on a community-driven development (CDD) approach can be achieved in a
        context like Niger if supervision is careful and benefits from a dedicated team. The
        process is particularly difficult if public services and institutions outside the main
        cities are limited or non-existent (as was the case in Niger). Success in such
        situations requires appropriate policies and laws, establishment or strengthening of
        technical services; extensive education and capacity-building programs at all levels
        from the capital to villages; and good plans based on long-term and gradual
        implementation schedules. In such a context implementation arrangements need to



5
 These lessons are in addition to the “lessons learned” listed in the August 2008 Project Document for the
second phase of the Project (CAP2).
                                                    22
         be centered in a body that is solely dedicated to the project and thinks about
         specific activities on a daily basis.

      (b) Understanding the value of environmental improvements. In promoting
          environmental improvements and SLM practices, it is necessary to understand the
          local people and their habits, concerns, and priorities. To get people interested in
          such long-term matters as natural resource management and environmental
          protection (including maintenance of trees), it is absolutely necessary to provide
          them with concrete incentives (food or cash for work) and perhaps be more
          “supply-driven.” Poor people struggling with survival always rank subprojects
          with production benefits above natural resource management subprojects in their
          priority list. To ensure adequate interest in the latter, natural resource management
          subprojects may need their own priority listing and separately allocated funds.
          Also, to improve efficiency, the public-sector environmental staff needs to receive
          incentives (transport, training, allowances). In addition, political- and higher-level
          administrators must strongly encourage elected local officials and higher-level
          administrators to view natural resource management as a high priority.

      (c) Gradually start using lessons learned. For a new program in such a challenging
          field as community-driven development, it is necessary to have modest
          expectations at the beginning. In Niger, the Community Action Program had an
          outreach target of 20 percent of the communes (districts) for the first four years.

      (d) Provision of technical services. A new and extensive bottom-up program places
          great demands on technical services, which are usually limited in the regional and
          provincial (”departmental” in Niger) levels. To be able to respond to demands
          from the communities, manpower, competencies, and mobility of both the public-
          sector services and those of NGOs need to be strengthened.

      (e) Micro-projects and women. Participating in micro-projects improves the status of
          women in society. In establishing and running micro-projects in Niger, women
          proved to be more energetic and responsible in their commitments for financial and
          in-kind contributions, as well as better at making their micro-projects profitable
          than were men, mixed groups, or commune administrations. It is not clear,
          however, whether the better profitability of women’s projects might be attributable
          to their selection of activities with which they are traditionally more familiar (for
          example, batik coloring, small business and raising small animals).

90.      For the avian flu component, the following lessons were learned (see also Annex 3):

      (a) Ministerial collaboration. A concerted effort is useful to bring the different
          ministries together for a common course of action. Perhaps as its biggest
          achievement, the avian flu component succeeded in building new, collaborative
          networks at all four levels (central, regional, departmental, and local communities)
          to fight avian flu.

      (b) Special nature of an emergency program. The slow start in carrying out this
          component revealed some special requirements. In an emergency, extraordinary
          measures are needed. While it is important to process loans or grants rapidly to

                                               23
         bring the necessary resources to where they are needed, it is equally important to
         make sure that there is sufficient knowledgeable personnel to get the program
         started without delay.

      (c) Appropriate indicators. For an emergency program the intended outcome is that
          the effects of the crisis are minimized and recovery from the disaster can start. For
          an avian flu attack the outcome would be that information is quickly shared with
          responsible authorities and that deaths are avoided or at least minimized. Thus the
          original outcome indicators in the Project Paper were correctly conceived when
          they largely concentrated on the reaction and reporting times by the local
          population and then by the authorities responsible for surveillance and treatment.
          Because, fortunately, no H5N1 virus reappeared in Niger, the emphasis was shifted
          to indicators that measured attainment of objectives set for different activities.

 / Financial information is from CAP. The amounts do not correspond exactly with the appraisal estimates,
because the grant was in SDR and there has been a substantial change in the exchange rates between dollar
and SDR. (On November 11, 2008 the disbursements were 99.99% for IDA and 99.76% for GEF.)

3.      In the environmental sector, the project incorporated during its latter part an
activity of planting Acacia Senegal trees (and similar other indigenous trees) that gained
great enthusiasm among the villagers under a program of carbon sequestration, under the
Kyoto environmental agreement. The target for years 2006 and 2007 was planting 9,000
ha, of which 7, 800 ha were planted (87 percent). The work happened in 82 micro-project
sites (part of the 2,525 sites mentioned above), and required establishment of 110 tree
nurseries.

                                                29
4.      Out of the 1,564 implemented micro-projects, 375 were at the commune level and
1,171 at the communities’ level (village clusters--“grappes”). Preparation and planning of
micro-projects accelerated over the project years, except for the last year, when the total
finances of the project were nearly exhausted. The rate of implementation of micro-
projects in years 2004 to 2006 was as follows: 93, 394, 980, and 79, respectively.

5.      Only about 88 percent of funds reserved for the component in PAD were used for
this component, because dollar devaluation reduced the overall project funds and because
the project management component required more funds than anticipated. Many micro-
projects approved were canceled in Tillabèri, Dosso, Maradi, and Tahoua regions.

Component D—Poverty and Environmental Monitoring

6.      Monitoring of project financial and physical activities started immediately after the
start of the project. It contained preparation of a manual (Système Intégré de Gestion du
PAC) and installation of two computer programs (Tompro and Tecpro) to integrate the
financial and physical aspects of monitoring. However, in the beginning the system did
not provide adequate information for the management to learn whether the project was
advancing at the required speed. At mid-term, the systems were improved and changed to
follow both the physical and financial outputs and project outcomes. (CAP was the first
Nigerien project to change to Results Framework.)

7.      Subcomponent National Poverty Monitoring System. At the national level, CAP
provided funds to several governmental agencies (SP/SRP, SE/SDR, DGEPD, and
SIGNER) for training, defining of indicators, and collecting of data and information. In
2006 and 2007, CAP, in collaboration with ICRISAT and IFPRI, carried out two
studies.One study on the impacts of the recommended natural resource technologies and
another on outlining of a M&E system that suits into the realities of Niger.

8.     Subcomponent Community-Based M&E. The monitoring and evaluation system for
following local-level project activities has been implemented to provide an extensive set
of data and information. During the final year of the project, 91 percent of the 54
communes benefiting from the project collected data and information satisfactorily
manner and sent them regularly to their Regional Coordination Unit. Respectively, 74
percent of the 278 village clusters benefiting from the project collected data and
information satisfactorily manner and sent them regularly to their Regional Coordination
Unit.

9.      Beside preparation of the manuals, installation of computer systems, and extensive
training at different levels from the Steering Committee to local villages, the project has
prepared:
    - Four annual, consolidated work plans,
    - 54 baseline analysis of communes;
    - Eight base-line analysis of GEF-funding sites;
    - Eight regional baseline analysis of village clusters;
    - Two special studies on intermediary results;
    - Two special mid-term studies;
    - Five evaluation studies of the performance of intermediary and support organizations,
                                             30
      -   Four sub-sector studies (sustainability of natural resource management; methodology
          for communal M&E, public-sector expenditures in 2001-2006; and harmonization of
          programs and plans of natural resource management); and
      -   Two audit reports on environmental and social microprojects financed by CAP.

10.    The funds used for the component Poverty and Environmental Monitoring were
equivalent to US$3.8 million, that is, 90 percent of the original allocation of funds for the
component.

Component E—Support to Project Management

11.       Financing of Component E has facilitated the following outputs:

      -   Establishment of the project management office and carrying out the coordination,
          administrative, financial, audit, procurement, logistics management, and M&E
          functions of the project;
      -   Establishment of effective regional coordination offices and provision of funds for
          their operations and the micro-projects in communes and village clusters;
      -   Outsourcing of field operations to NGOs and engaging consultants and various
          agencies for fieldwork and studies; making memorandums of understanding or
          contracts with nearly 20 government and private agencies;
      -   Provision of funds and guidance to project-linked public-sector agencies;
      -   Carrying out an extensive communication program, including radio programs in
          local languages, international radio programs, TV programs; newspaper articles,
          pamphlets on various topics; translation of manuals and documents into local
          languages and French, training of community organizers in communication
          techniques, etc.;
      -   Supervision of fieldwork and organizing the external support missions;
      -   Keeping the donor community well-informed about CAP activities; and
      -   Organizing mid-term review and related studies and preparation of the final
          evaluation of the project.

12.    In addition, the project has incorporated new activities and funding, such carbon
sequestration and fighting against the avian flu (the latter is not reviewed in this report).

13.    While GEF funds have been largely blended within the micro-projects, the
following other outputs were recorded:

      -   Evaluation of the National Civil service personnel responsible for GEF sites (as
          recommended by the mid-term review);
      -   Organizing a workshop to train CAP agents and service providers in environmental
          and social safeguards;
      -   Production of communication documents on environmental matters in local
          languages;
      -   Preparation of education modules on environmental protection;
      -   Subject-matter support to the preparation of modules for training of trainers;
      -   Review of technical world list to be included in database of land use in Niger; and
      -   Preparation of several methodological tools for environmental procedures, natural
          resources manual, intervention plans in GEF sites, databases, etc.
                                                31
14.    The funds used for the Project Management Component, including the
communication activities and national-level studies, were US$9.7 million, that is, 22
percent of the project costs and more than double of the original allocation of funds for
this component.

15.    These and other outputs were attained by using FCFA 958 million, that is, 85
percent of the subcomponent allocation. To achieve the outputs listed above, it was
necessary to purchase equipment, to develop the necessary tools, such as training modules
and training guidelines for teachers and instructors in different topics, including
environmental education, bio-security, active surveillance, committee work, etc., and
prepare technical manuals on operational procedures and environmental protection issues.

that is, 122 percent of the subcomponent allocation, because most of the equipment and
hospital materials cost more than originally estimated. Training costs were very close to
the projection at 101 percent of the funds reserved for it.

             Annex 3. Supplementary Annex on Avian flu Component

Context

1.      Of the actively employed population in Niger, 84 percent of men and 97 percent of
women were involved in growing crops or raising livestock. The poultry subsector,
estimated at 30 million birds, is very important in Niger despite its predominantly
traditional production. Since the January 2006 outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) in northern Nigeria, Niger has faced a serious threat of spillover. The
first outbreak in Niger, which occurred in Magaria and Boko Mai Gao departments (at the
border with Nigeria), resulted in the culling of 17,891 birds; some 1,950 affected
households were compensated with FCFA 18,871,000 (US$37,700 equivalent), by French
development aid. If such an outbreak were to happen again and without compensation,
mostly very poor households would suffer a significant loss.

2.     Following a Government-organized rapid assessment mission of veterinary
services in March 2006, the performance of the veterinary services was evaluated in
accordance with the World Organization for Animal Health/Office International des
Epizooties (OIE) guidelines. The evaluation mission concluded that the veterinary services
in Niger were particularly weak in human resources management, data and statistics
management, legal and regulatory aspects, laboratory capacity, and financial and logistical
resources. The mission recommended that restoring the capacity of veterinary services
should have a high priority if these services were expected fulfill their expected mandate
in conformity with standards of OIE

3.      The Ministry of Animal Resources, the Ministry of Public Health, and the Ministry
of Environment and Control of Desertification, in collaboration with other concerned
Government agencies and the donor community, prepared in February 2006 a National
Emergency Plan for Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza (NEPPCAI) to address
outbreaks of HPAI in the country. This plan, consolidated in April 2006, had 21 areas of
intervention and its overall cost was estimated at US$24 million. The plan was multi-
sectoral, covering animal health, human health, and communications, and it promoted
partnership between animal and human health agencies to facilitate control of zoonotic
diseases while also addressing potential adverse environmental impacts.

4.     When the first NEPPCAI was prepared, the Government requested support from
the Bank to respond to the threat of avian influenza. The organizational and institutional
arrangements set up to respond to the HPAI issue--and, more specifically, the National
Emergency Plan -- proved the Government’s serious commitment to fight HPAI. The
March 2006 evaluation of the performance of the veterinary services implied the same
level of commitment. But, as mentioned, the human and material capacity of Niger to
meet the challenge that HPAI presented was questionable.

5.      When the Niger Government requested financial assistance from IDA, it was well
known that, despite considerable efforts made in Nigeria to contain the HPAI outbreaks,
the relatively high density of poultry production in Niger and the various sources of
poultry importation posed a substantial risk of HPAI reoccurrences. It was feared that
Nigeria would be a source of new outbreaks in Niger given the two countries’ long and
porous border of about 1,500 kilometers.
                                           36
6.      Consistency with CAS. At the time the avian flu component for CAP1 was
designed, the Country Assistance Strategy of 2003-2007 was still current. It was expected
then that the PRSP II would strongly inspire the upcoming CAS. The HPAI activity was in
line with the CAS, which made clear the need for strategic forecasting for natural disasters,
including animal disease outbreaks comprising epizooties. A well-designed and fully
implemented HPAI preparedness and control component was needed to prevent heavy
losses of poultry, and thus to avoid compromising poultry’s initial role as a “stepping-
stone” in asset accumulation and poverty alleviation among the poorest. Under the IDA 13
guidelines for allocation of grants, the CAS 2003-2007 provided Niger with a significant
amount of future funding in the form of IDA grants.

7.      Beneficiaries: The ultimate beneficiaries for the new avian flu component were the
local populations, mostly poor people and those living in rural areas, who were to be
helped through appropriate actions for the prevention and control of HPAI outbreaks in
Niger. The closest beneficiaries were expected to be commercial and “backyard” poultry
farmers, but the Project Paper identified as intermediate beneficiaries identified also
veterinary and public health service workers and laboratory staffs, whose work would be
greatly facilitated by the funding that Component F entailed.

8.      The beneficiaries were also to include the consumers of poultry products and the
population at large, because a vast outbreak of avian flu--not to speak of the likely panic
arising in such a case—would have seriously affected them. Public concerns about
consuming poultry and information about personal safety measures against the avian flu
virus were to be addressed through the information and communications activities planned
under Component F. Besides increasing public awareness and participation in HPAI
control and prevention, it was also important to ensure full compliance with environmental
and social safeguard regulations.

Component Details

9.     The proposed additional grant was planned to help pay for a new HPAI prevention
and control component, which would include the following subcomponents:

   (a) Support for the recipient country’s veterinary services related to HPAI,
       particularly: (i) enhancing prevention and preparedness capacity; (ii) strengthening
       disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity; and (iii) strengthening control
       programs and outbreak containment plans;

   (b) Support for the recipient country’s human health services about HPAI,
       particularly: (i) strengthening national public health surveillance systems and (ii)
       strengthening the health system response capacity;

   (c) Improvement of public awareness and communications on HPAI, particularly: (i)
       supporting information and communications activities and (ii) improving
       collaboration with the recipient country’s partners and stakeholders, on HPAI; and

   (d) Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of avian influenza-related activities.

                                            37
10.     Funding the new component, equivalent to US$4.5 million, did not come from the
original project (which was expected to be fully disbursed for the original components),
but was an additional grant under the World Bank OP/BP 13.20. The component was
expected to be completed in two years, that is, by June 30, 2010, but the completion period
was extended by six months to December 31, 2010.

11.     Objectives of Component F. Although the World Bank grant to fight avian flu
resulted in a new component, it did not change the PDO; on the contrary, the incremental
component was to contribute to the first set of outcomes of CAP1, which were to design
and implement decentralized, participatory, and transparent financing mechanisms that
enable communities and local governments to carry out their development plans. The new
component was also to concentrate on enabling communities and local governments to
take appropriate action for the prevention and control of HPAI outbreaks in Niger. For this
purpose, the avian flu component added seven new performance indicators for accurately
measuring achievement of the component’s envisaged outcomes. 9

12.     The proposed activities were to enhance the impact of the original development
objectives of the CAP1 by helping communities and local governments to carry out their
own development plans and to promote community-based integrated ecosystem
management, because the HPAI activities will help the country to prevent or mitigate any
avian flu outbreak and help communities restore their poultry subsector as an income-
generating activity, if avian flu outbreak.

13.      Indicators of Component F. Expected outcomes and outcome indicators as
presented in CAP1 remained unchanged. The following intermediate outcomes indicators
were introduced to monitor the new CAP’S HPAI subcomponents (the revised Project
Implementation Manual was to consider these changes, and to gather baseline data during
the first two months of the additional financing):

14.        Animal Health subcomponent:

     Animal disease control and prevention systems are strengthened:
      - Time for farmers to report suspicious deaths to veterinarians (private and public);
      - The response time (official Veterinarian Services) after a declared outbreak to cull
         the birds is established;
      - Farmers get appropriate and on-time compensation for culled birds; and
      - Birds are culled in accordance with the environmental plan guidelines.
15.        Human Health subcomponent:

     HPAI surveillance system and preparedness abilities are strengthened:
      - Time to report suspicious sickness to officials; and
      - The officials’ response time (quarantine measures) following a report of a
        suspicious sickness.

16.        Social Mobilization and Strategic Communication subcomponent:

          Increased awareness and participation in HFAI infection control and prevention:
          Use of good health practices among key people in commercial farms, markets, and
           laboratories.

17.     When the component was restructured for extending the completion period for the
avian flu component in May 2010, some intermediate indicators were modified. No avian
flu attack had taken place during the implementation period of the component, and some
indicators were meant to measure the reaction time for such an attack at different levels.
Thus, some indicators were removed, as was the one dealing with good health practices by
poultry handlers and respective laboratories. Instead, the following indicators were
introduced:10

          H5N1 surveillance committees at the local, departmental, and regional levels are
           fully operational;
          Personnel of the Veterinary Services and of the Ministry of environment are
           trained in H5N1- and H1N1-related areas;
          The Central Veterinary Laboratory in Niamey has increased its capacity for
           production of vaccines;
          Public health service personnel are trained to handle H5N1 and H1N1; and
          Key regional and departmental health centers are functional and equipped with
           isolation facilities.

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     The component F of CAP1 on avian flu was an emergency project. Considering
that there were no other such projects in Niger, direct guidance on its formulation could
not be obtained in the country, However, there was already a large avian flu project in
Nigeria, as well as substantial information on the Internet (WHO Website and others), and
the small component preparation team used both of these resources effectively. Also, the
Government had two years earlier prepared an emergency plan (essentially, the material
and training requirements), and UNICEF and WHO, among others, had helped prepare
and partly implement an information plan. In view of the emergency nature and novelty of
the avian flu component, project preparation and background analysis were as sound as
could be expected at the time the Project Paper was prepared, particularly because the
document was drafted by Bank staff who were very experienced in Nigerien rural
development and governmental administration, as well as the coordinator of the Cellule
Permanante/Comité nationale de la lutte contre la grippe aviaire (a multiministerial and
multiagency committee to lead the fight against avian flu) and the Bank’s head office staff.

19.    The Project Paper carefully considered the environmental implications of the avian
flu component, as well as the safeguarding policies. The planners also considered the risks



10
     / Project Restructuring Paper, Annex 1.
                                               39
involved in successful implementation of the component. Considering the newness of the
project, the ICR mission judged most of the risks identified to be appropriate, except for
the financial management risks, which were overestimated, since the component was a
part of the Community Action Program that already had good financial management. The
concern about the Government’s commitment was perhaps unnecessary; the Government
was fully behind the program. Two years earlier besides setting-up the Cellule
Permanente, the Government had a multisectoral steering committee from eight ministries
to oversee the CAP. The avian flu component, being entirely financed by the World Bank,
did not require financial commitment from the Government beyond maintaining the staff
in the Cellule Permanente.

20.     One risk that escaped the planners was the potential tardiness in getting the project
started. Because of the perceived emergency, the grant was approved on the basis of the
Project Paper without an appraisal, and Niger was not ready to start implementation of the
component immediately. However, the overall design of the component—objectives,
components, and organization—was appropriate, especially the aspect that it was linked
closely to the existing CAP1, which ensured, for instance, the accounting and financial
reporting would experience no problems during the component’s implementation period.
But because so little practical preparation and planning had been done before approval, the
project period—two years--was unrealistic.

Implementation

21.     During the project period there were no major changes in the component design,
and the project was never in a risk status. However, the implementation period of two
years turned out to be too short and it was extended by six months. Because of the short
implementation period, there was no midterm review. As the new Bank procedures require
a formal restructuring when the completion period is extended, such restructuring was
carried out in May 2010 based on the January 2010 supervision mission. The restructuring
also included some reallocation of funds among components.

22.      Many factors facilitated implementation of the project:

     The danger of a potential pandemic was well understood and the Government
      maintained its strong commitment to the project, participating in its supervision,
      facilitating communication with the Bank and funds transfer from the Bank, as well as
      providing guidance through the National Committee for the Fight against Avian Flu
      and the Steering Committee of the CAP.
     Although there was only one formal implementation support mission, Bank staff,
      especially those of the Niamey Country Office, were available for advice and guidance
      throughout the implementation period.
     The project benefited from a committed staff and access to the experienced
      management team of CAP1 and later CAP2, for instance, in financial management and,
      to some extent, in procurement (the component office was in the same premises with
      these projects). The monitoring and evaluation system, which had a detailed logical
      framework with indicators that was implemented early, helped implementing the
      program in regions and departments.


                                             40
23.     However, as already mentioned, implementation of the avian flu component started
slowly. The main reason was that because this was an emergency project, the usual plans
and preparations that are done at project preparation or appraisal were not completed and
partially not even started when the component was approved or became effective The
operations manual, other manuals, identification of requirements and preparation of a
detailed implementation plan, annual budgeting, logical framework, procurement plan,
and so on--all had to be done before the component’s work could properly proceed. Thus,
18 months after the component became effective, only 21 percent of component funds had
been disbursed. However, progress was excellent after the January 2010 implementation
support mission, and at the end of the extended implementation period nearly all
component funds had been used (see Annex 1).

24.       Other factors also adversely affected the speed and quality of implementation:

     The component’s staff was unfamiliar with World Bank procedures, particularly the
      procurement regulations and the review procedures requiring the Bank’s no-objections.
     The distances to the areas that were perceived as critical in preventing and controlling
      avian flu were huge (the distance from Niamey to Tahoua Region is 550 km, to Maradi
      Region 700 km, and to Zinder Region 900 km).
     A tense political situation resulted in a military coup in February 2010 and temporarily
      halted the Bank’s operations in Niger.
     All the focal points at the central ministries and in the respective administrative units
      in the regions and departments were responsible for other, often very demanding, tasks,
      and they sometimes found it difficult to focus on the avian flu program. 11

Monitoring and Evaluation

25.     The funds under Component D of CAP1 had helped establishment of the main
project’s M&E, which provided the basis for the M&E of the new avian flu component.
The Project Paper provided a basis for the missing logical framework by suggesting a list
of indicators to measure the performance of the component, but further work was required
to make it serve as a management tool. The component management organized a
stakeholders’ workshop to identify the requirements that the project was expected to
finance and prepare a detailed logical framework. Another workshop and various reviews
validated it and the World Bank gave its no-objection. The logical framework laid out the
objectives of the program, causal relationships, and underlying assumptions about how
program actions would lead to intended outcomes. As a minor deviation from the norm for
these project frameworks, the ICR mission noted that the framework was not solely for the
avian flu component of the project but also included all the activities of the Cellule
Permanente pour la Lutte contre la Grippe Aviaire, and that some activities had been
financed by other donors.

26.     M&E implementation. Although the size of the country and even the “passive
surveillance” area 12 posed significant challenges for M&E, the organized training--



11
     / Other problems are mentioned in Annex 6 (Stakeholders’ views).
                                                     41
including extensive training material and model forms, and field arrangements--was
successful and reporting became soon regular. The reporting was based on standardized
monthly monitoring forms filled in by the agents of the three key ministers at the
community level. The forms were first collated at the departmental level and then at the
regional level. The regions sent them monthly to the M&E Unit at the center, which
reviewed them, verified information when necessary (the cellular phones purchased and
distributed under the project were of special help), and used the results as a basis for
quarterly and annual reports of the component. The system worked so well that it
continued even when the M&E Coordinator moved to CAP2 in June 2010 and was able to
use only a small part of his time for the avian flu monitoring, but the quarterly reports and
the internal component completion report came out on time. (See the summary of the final
report in Annex 7).

27.      M&E utilization. At the beginning of the implementation, the project organized a
baseline survey, which gave a basis for comparing the outputs to the before-project
situation. Because the logical framework was very detailed, containing tens of indicators
for each subcomponent, it was an excellent tool to enable management to see what
happened in the center and the field. Especially after the Bank’s implementation support
mission in January 2010 it helped speed up the activities under the component and monitor
their implementation. Qualitative evidence, coupled with quantitative facts, allowed for
well-informed decision-making.

28.      Because of the short duration of the component, there was no formal evaluation of
outcomes. However, the internal review on the knowledge and awareness level of
beneficiaries the M&E Unit of the Component F of CAP1 organized in 2010 may be
considered an evaluation exercise. No report on this study was completed, but the
statistical results were incorporated in the Government’s Project Completion Report
(Rapport Interne d’Achèvement de Composante Grippe Aviaire du Programme d’Actions
Communautaires Phase 1) under the section “Mobilization of social and communication
strategy.” (For more, see Annex 6—Beneficiary surveys, and Annex 10—the summary of
Government’s completion report).

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.    Safeguard policies. In the Project Paper, the component was assigned the
environmental category B and it triggered OP/BP 4.01 because of its generation of
medical waste in health centers and laboratories, thus requiring an environmental
assessment. It also triggered OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management) because of the use of
chemicals in disinfecting carcasses and decontaminating burning sites, and OP/BP 4.12
(Involuntary Resettlement) because of the potential need for land acquisition for burning
and burial sites.

   / “Passive surveillance” means that the veterinary and environmental agents and health-sector personnel
observe, in the context of their duties, if there are dead birds or people with apparent influenza. “Active
surveillance” was organized in regions that were perceived more risky for an H5N1 virus attack, and there
trained agents visit a large number of observations posts according to a regular schedule (also getting an
incentive allowance).
                                                    42
30.      To address potential adverse environmental and social impacts, the main project
(CAP1) had prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which was disclosed in
Niger and at the Bank’s Infoshop on July 27, 2007. The EMP discussed the potential
adverse impacts of the relevant components of CAP1 and proposed mitigation and
monitoring measures as well as monitoring indicators. However, the EMP did not address
the potential adverse impacts of civil works carried out for implementing the avian flu
component (especially rehabilitation of laboratories, hospitals, and cold-chain facilities,
initially not considered in the proposed activities to be financed from the proceeds of the
additional financing). Therefore, the following safeguard mechanisms were provided for
in the Financing Agreement of the avian flu component:

   (a) The Recipient will, prior to contracting any civil works, (i) prepare an assessment
       of the potential impact of the proposed civil works and mitigation measures in a
       manner satisfactory to IDA, (ii) organize consultations with stakeholders, also in a
       manner satisfactory to IDA, and (iii) include in bidding documents and contracts
       for implementing civil works provisions satisfactory to IDA for the prevention or
       mitigation of the negative impacts of such works on the environment and the
       population;
   (b) The Recipient will send to IDA for review the bidding documents and contracts for
       implementing civil works to ensure that safeguards-related commitments have
       been complied with satisfactorily to IDA; and
   (c) The Recipient will see to it that the safeguards-related commitments/prior reviews
       are reflected in the Project Implementation Manual. These conditions were
       complied with before or during component implementation.

31.    As for involuntary resettlement to ensure that potential adverse social impacts are
addressed effectively, the Recipient was to carry out the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) that had been prepared and disclosed for the ongoing CAP. The RPF was re-
disclosed in Niger on September 4, 2007, and at the Bank’s Info shop on September 10,
2007. In practice, this disclosure was not needed, because there was no avian flu attack
during implementation of the component.

32.    Fiduciary compliance. The project accounts, including regional subaccounts and
Special Accounts, were audited for the partial year 2008 and full year 2009. Both audits
were unqualified. The auditors’ management letter contained no recommendations beyond
emphasizing the importance of internal control (without making any complaint in this
respect).

33.     During the project period one formal Procurement Review was carried out as part
of the supervision mission and concluded in January 2010. The conclusions were
discussed with the Permanent Unit and included in the mission aide memoir. Furthermore,
Bank’s procurement specialists regularly reviewed the documents requiring the Bank’s
prior-review, and the Procurement specialist in the Niamey country office participated to
the weekly follow up meeting in the last two quarters of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010
to help address the lagging disbursement and speed up the implementation of project’s
activities. The procurement specialist of the ICR mission did a thorough review of the
procurement activities. In practice, procurement was slow, especially in the beginning of
the implementation period, and the procurement activities were considered as moderately
satisfactory in most ISRs.
                                            43
Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.     The most important element for operation of the avian flu component after project
completion is the existence of the Cellule Permanante/Comité nationale de la lutte contre
la grippe aviaire, and the existence of the network of committees, focal points, and trained
field agents in three ministries. The Government is committed to continue their work, but
resources are very limited. It continues paying the salaries of the two permanent staff
(Coordinator13 and Permanent Secretary) and the office expenses, but nothing more has
been budgeted for, and no donor agencies are continuing assistance for this purpose.

35.     Although there has been no new attack of avian flu in Niger, the case for having a
new project or other form of continued financial assistance is strong. There are at least
four arguments for this:

      (a) With the limited grant funds available, the avian flu component under CAP1 did
          not cover the whole country with active surveillance or training agents for
          prevention and control, let alone for treatment if an attack were to occur. It is
          probable that the avian flu network will survive a couple of years without external
          assistance, but after that it will start crumbling.

      (b) The equipment will age; there is no money for operations; committees, focal points,
          and field agents will lose interest in surveillance and reporting and slide back to
          their other duties when no incentives are offered for the extra work; members of
          trained committees, focal points, and field agents whom the avian flu component
          trained will change, but no new training can be arranged, and so forth.

      (c) The planned benefit of using the network for diseases other than avian flu will be
          lost (the network was used in 2010 for the swine flu epidemic).

      (d) The avian flu virus has not died and it is capable to mutating and reappearing in
          new forms. Thus a new attack is always a possibility.


Assessment of Outcomes

36.     The avian flu component was designed as a response to the highly pathogenic
H5N1 virus that was capable of transferring from birds to humans. The virus is one of the
most lethal currently existing; of the nearly 500 known cases where the virus has infected
humans, more than 300 people have died; that is, the mortality rate is more than 60 percent.
The perceived threat of a new outbreak of H5N1 in Niger--combined with Niger’s weak
veterinary and human health services, lack of funds for communication and environmental
protection plans--constituted the rationale for additional World Bank financing for Niger,
which was then provided under the new avian flu component of the existing CAP.




13
     / The Coordinator is the same as for the avian flu component.
                                                      44
37.     However, the only known cases in Africa during 2009 and 2010 were in Egypt
(that is, quite far from Niger), and it would be easy to downplay the current danger,
especially as new vaccines against avian flu are being developed. At the same time, H5N1
may cause more than one influenza pandemic as it is expected to continue mutating in
birds regardless of whether humans develop herd immunity to a future pandemic strain. In
addition, because the networks built up in Niger can be used against other epidemic
diseases, the avian flu component is still highly relevant. In addition, because the avian flu
component, as planned, contained complementary subcomponents for helping veterinary
services, human health care, communications, and monitoring and evaluation in the fight
against avian flu (which subcomponents are applicable also for fighting other epidemics),
the objectives, design, and implementation approach are still highly relevant. Linking the
new avian flu component to the existing Community Development Program was a
practical solution 14 because this project was active in the same areas, which were to have
become the priority areas of the fight against avian flu.

38.     The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy and the Government’s Rural
Development and Poverty Alleviation Strategies remain the same as in 2008 when the
component was formulated, and thus they still support the component rationale as a tool to
rural development and improved health services in rural areas.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives

39.     In assessing achieving the objectives of the avian flu component, it is necessary to
note that the Project Development Objective of the main project CAP1, which was
formulated into a brief sentence with several elements (see Section 1), does not allow for
direct estimation of its achievement even with the indicators listed in the original PAD.
Thus, this section evaluates the attainment of the Component’s objectives based on the key
indicators as they were adjusted at restructuring to better measure the achievement and to
match with the approach in the Bank’s use of the new Results Framework rather the old
Logical Framework. 15

40.    The achievement of key indicators for the avian influenza component were as
follows (each key indicator had several sub-indicators—see Annex 2):

Key Indicator :16                  Achievement of indicator by the end of 201017    ICR mission’s evaluation of
                                                                                    achievements

14
   / The other alternative would have been to link it with the Agro-pastoral Export Promotion Project, but
that project had a poor implementation record and was about to close.
15
  / The original Component F indicators (see Section 1.9) were closer to the real outcome/PDO to be
expected from the component, but as they were based on reaction and reporting times by poultry farmers and
the participants of the surveillance system for which no standards had been established (or such standards
would not have been feasible in the highly variable conditions in Niger), they were abandoned and replaced
by more practical intermediate indicators. (See also the recommendation under Lessons Learned.)

41.     The achievements provide appropriate evidence that the Component’s objectives
have been met and that causal linkages between the components and objectives have been
established (building a good response against the avian flu required capacity building in
veterinary and human health services, in environmental surveillance, and in
communications and monitoring). The successful achievement of the objectives stemmed
largely from the success of activities in the various subcomponents. Most targets set for
the indicators were attained or exceeded, as shown in Annex 2 (Outputs by Components).
These results were reached essentially with the interventions of the avian flu component of
CAP1. (Among the other donors, the European Union was particularly active in the same
areas during the implementation period, but with smaller resources, several other donors
were active before the avian flu component started.)

Efficiency

42.      The appraisal mission of CAP1 did not perform economic analysis or calculate a
financial rate of return for CAP1, primarily because the type of project in question (which
had several components, many for social purposes or capacity building) does not lend
itself to reliable economic analysis. Similarly, there was no attempt in the Project Paper to
calculate economic or financial returns because there were no data or examples about how
these returns could be computed for an avian flu pandemic. Consequently, no economic
and financial return analyses were attempted for this ICR.

43.    As for cost efficiency, the fact that all procurement above the limit set under CAP1
(US$50,000) was carried out on a competitive basis provides a certain degree of
confidence that the costs of various items procured were economical in Niger conditions.20


18
 / However, the purchase of a new freezer-dryer (lyophilisateur) and some other items were delayed so
much that they could not be procured during the project period.
19
  / The production capacity of veterinary vaccines has increased, but avian influenza vaccine is not being
produced because the Government decided it is cheaper to cull the infected poultry.
                                                      46
Justification of Overall Outcome of the Avian Flu Component

44.    Rating: Satisfactory. Factors favoring the satisfactory rating or better include the
following:

    The project objective is relevant even in the current situation, because avian flu still
     exists in Asia and elsewhere in Africa (Egypt), it mutates rapidly, and it is highly
     pathogenic with potentially dire human and economic consequences. Moreover, the
     surveillance networks and the prevention and treatment methods built in Niger are
     useful for control of other diseases transmittable from animals to humans (Section 3.1).
    The development objectives and output targets were satisfactorily achieved (Section 3
     and Annex 2).
    The World Bank and Government administration showed appropriate flexibility, for
     example, by revising the indicators (and monitoring them effectively) and reallocating
     funds among the disbursement categories when it turned out that no avian flu attack
     actually occurred (Section 2.3).

45.     Some factors that prevented a higher rating for project development and output
objectives were as follows:

    Contrary to the procurement plans, an important element for the central veterinary
     laboratory, a new freezer-dryer, was not procured during the project period (however,
     the old one is still in use and can be maintained for some time) (Section 3.2).
    The future of the network built with the help of the avian flu component remains
     uncertain, because no donor funds have been committed for its upkeep (Section 2.5).

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

46.      The extent of the avian flu component’s impact on poverty was not measured,
because no actual attack occurred. If one had occurred, it probably would have most
affected the poor, who try to improve their income by growing poultry (in Tahoua, for
instance, 90 percent of poultry growers have fewer than 200 birds), or who work as
slaughterers, pluckers, and poultry handlers. The planners of the component had taken this
possibility into account in costing the component and had reserved US$50,000 for
compensating the potential losses of the poultry farmers.21 Women and children also had
been considered when planning the fight against the disease because of their role as
primary domestic handlers of poultry. During implementation of the component and
earlier, with support from other donors, they received training in prevention and sanitary
measures.




20
   / Procurement was supervised by the Bank’s Country Office, and the cases of procurement below the
prior-review limit were inspected during the January 2010 implementation support mission and by the ICR
mission in February 2011.
21
  / The poultry farmers who lost their birds during the 2006 attack of avian flu in Magaria and Boko Mai
Gao departments were compensated for their losses by French development aid.
                                                    47
Institutional Change/Strengthening

47.     As discussed in section 3.2 of the main ICR report, CAP I was the main financial
instrument for decentralizing public administration and services to 15 percent of the rural
communes in Niger. Similarly, the avian flu component was the main financier for
building the capacity to fight the threat of the avian flu in three key ministries and in the
regions that were perceived to be areas most likely to suffer should the H5H1 virus find its
way again to Niger. The opinion shared by all groups of stakeholders was that without the
financing by the World Bank and to some extent by other donors, most notably EU, this
development would not have been possible (see Annex 6—Stakeholders’ workshops).
Besides the network that now appears broadly approved as a near-formal arrangement, the
main institutional beneficiary was the Cellule permanente/Comité national de lutte contre
la grippe aviaire, for which the avian flu component brought operational tools. As for the
future and to sustain the readiness of the network (not to talk about its expansion), more
assistance is needed.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

48.     A major discovery during the project was that the network built against avian flu
was also useful for other animal-human-transmissible diseases. This benefit was
recognized during the February 2010 emergence of the swine flu (H1N1 virus) in Niger
and raised discussion within the avian flu network about other possible similar uses for the
network.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

49.     The ICR mission on the avian flu component of CAP1 organized three stakeholder
workshops/meetings and as well as individual sessions with stakeholders. The first
meeting was with the National Committee in charge of the fight against avian flu, the
second with focal points from the regions that were the main beneficiaries of the project
assistance (Tahoua, Maradi, and Zinder), and the third with representatives of the
international donor community. In addition, the ICR mission interviewed many high
officials and focal points of the involved and benefiting ministries and other agencies (see
Annex 6). This section presents highlights from workshops/meetings:

   (a) The project was extremely influential in Niger because it introduced an integrated
       approach to the fight against the avian flu, one that has been successfully
       implemented in the key ministries and other agencies. But in a crisis , it is easy to
       underestimate the financial and manpower resources needed for an effective,
       countrywide response;

   (b) The project stimulated an entirely new level of dynamism in the ministries, their
       personnel, and local populations by providing important information, training,
       equipment, and operational resources to people who were stakeholders in the fight
       against avian flu and who, without the project, would have had little chances to
       organize protection against this potential calamity;

   (c) The stakeholders particularly appreciated the construction or rehabilitation of new
       laboratories, health centers, and isolation facilities, and their own role in
                                             48
       identifying the critical areas for these facilities. The project gave many people
       knowledge about and skills to fight avian flu; and it helped form coordination
       committees at the regional, departmental, and community levels to take charge of
       the avian flu-related activities. The stakeholders also greatly appreciated the
       diagnostic material, medicines, incinerators for medical waste, refrigerators,
       information technology, communications equipment (for example, 500 cellular
       phones for surveillance and communication), bought by the project;

   (d) The Government people involved in the project were inexperienced with the
       project activities and especially with the procedures of the World Bank. There was
       not enough expertise among those involved in the project even to write
       specifications for the requirements for this special project. Consultant assistance in
       preparing specifications for goods and services to be procured was too little or too
       late; and

   (e) In the environmental sector, agents and veterinary service people suffered from the
       fact that the frontier between Niger on the one side and Nigeria and Burkina Faso
       on the other side is very long, “porous,” and difficult to guard. More vehicles (cars
       and motorcycles) were needed and more agents should have been trained.

50.     Beneficiary survey. No formal end-of-the-project survey of beneficiaries was
prepared. Benefits would have accrued to the population if an avian flu attack had
occurred during the project period, but fortunately no attack occurred. However, the
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Component F of CAP1 organized in 2010 an
internal impact review that may serve as a knowledge and awareness survey of
beneficiaries. Its main conclusion was that the awareness of the population of the
existence of the disease, its symptoms, and measures of prevention had increased from 64
percent to 91 percent during implementation of the avian flu component (see Annex 3).

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome of the Avian Flu Component

51.    Rating: Significant. The significant risk rating reflects the assessment of the
potential sources of risks and the likely mitigating effect of existing/likely arrangements:


   (a) As described in Section 2.5, the most important element for post-completion
       operation of the avian flu component is the existence of the Cellule
       permanante/Comité national de lutte contre la grippe aviaire, and the existence of
       the network (reseau) of committees, focal points, and trained field agents in three
       ministries. However, the resources available are too limited to effectively manage
       the Cellule Permanante and to continue or even expand the avian flu network. The
       Government should start actively seeking donors who would like to come to
       Niger’s assistance. (During the actual avian flu attack in Niger in 2006 it was
       relatively easy to get commitments, though relatively small and of short duration,
       from many donors, such as FAO, UNICEF, WHO, USAID, European Union,
       French development aid); and

   (b) A mitigating factor is that the network appears so well established that it may
       continue working for one or two years even with minimal funding, as long as

                                            49
           budgets allow the continued payment of the salaries of the two permanent staff
           (Coordinator22 and Permanent Secretary), the office expenses, and some operating
           costs. Thus the Government and donors have some time to start a follow-on
           activity. Another mitigating factor is the Government’s clear commitment to
           protect its people against this calamity (as expressed by several high authorities to
           the ICR mission).

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

52.      Rating: Moderately satisfactory. Bank management reacted to the potential
pandemic well and responded to the Government’s request to help by providing a large
amount from the very limited grant amounts available. It also provided Bank staff to work
with the Coordinator of the Cellule Permanente to prepare the Project Paper. Furthermore,
the Bank treated the situation as a potential crisis, processed the additional component (in
reality, a new small-scale project) under its emergency rules, and approved the grant based
on the Project Paper without insisting on an appraisal as usual. The Bank’s activities in
other respects were also satisfactory; the Bank disbursed the funds on timely basis without
delays and extended the implementation period of the component to allow enough time to
achieve the objectives (which was done successfully).

53.     However, because of the urgency to get the project approved, the preparedness to
start project activities--was not sufficient. The detailed planning and preparation of basic
implementation documents, usually done at appraisal or before, were not done (see
Section 2.2). These were important steps, and doing them after the project had been
approved and became effective led to delays in the start of implementing the component.
Especially in view of the component staff’s lack of experience in Bank procedures, the
project should have included provisions to ensure availability of full-time personnel
experienced in Bank operations to help the component get started, for instance, by
recruiting consultants to act as expediters or facilitators. 23

Quality of Supervision

54.     Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The Government’s internal project completion
report evaluated the Bank’s assistance as valuable. The adage that “all’s well that ends
well” applies well to this avian flu component/project. After 18 months of the two-year
implementation period, only 21 percent of the component funds had been used,24 and there
is no denying that the Bank’s support for implementation initially had been light. There
had been no formal supervision/implementation support mission, although admittedly



22
     / The Coordinator is the same as for the avian flu component.
23
   / The ICR mission checked the workload of the resident mission staff supposed to help the avian flu component
get started, and found it excessive in the second part of 2008 because the staff were working on an emergency food
supply project, among other obligations. Also, when an overworked staff has to choose among priorities, a small
program, such as the avian flu component, is bound to be ranked below much bigger programs.
24
  / The low disbursement percentage did not give a true picture of the progress; much training took place, and
because almost all of it was provided by the project and Government personnel, it was inexpensive.
                                                      50
Bank staff had often been available for the component management, thus providing
“continuous supervision” (paraphrasing the term “continuous audit”), and the Bank had
organized training of component staff. But a formal, well-staffed mission immediately
after effectiveness would surely have helped the component start faster than it did (for an
explanation, see the footnote in Section 5.1 (a)).

55.     It is to the credit of the Bank staff that they upheld their confidence in the avian flu
program, did not use the low disbursement rate as a measure of progress, and did not rate
this program as a problem project or take other drastic steps. When the first and only
implementation support mission was carried out in January 2010 in collaboration with the
Government, it was thorough and productive. The mission’s report gave good advice,
prepared procurement plans, and organized continued follow-up by requesting weekly
progress reports from the component management. All this worked out as expected (by
then the component staff had learned the “Bank’s ways”), progress was excellent, and the
component’s PDO and intermediate indicators were satisfactorily achieved (see Annex 2).
The ratings in Implementation Support Reports (ISP) were adequately candid, providing
Bank management with information to guide the staff.


Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

56.    Rating: Moderately satisfactory. Whereas the overall achievement of PDO and
intermediate indicators would point out a rating of “satisfactory” for the Bank’s
performance, the rating is lowered to “moderately satisfactory” because: (a) Bank
management did not follow up the accelerated approval process with more personnel to
get the program started equally fast: and (b) the supervision effort during the initial
months immediately after the component became effective was less than optimal.

Government Performance

57.      Rating: Satisfactory. First, the Government contribution was important because
of the actions taken before the Bank-financed component (establishment of the National
Committee to Fight the Avian Flu; mobilization of the donor community for assistance;
preparation, with their help, of a communication plan and an early list of requirements;
establishment of the Cellule Permanente, etc.). Second, the Government directed the key
ministries to collaborate in the fight against avian flu, used the limited funds in a rational
way (and according to the allocation suggested by WHO), and appointed focal points from
its staff both in the center and in the regions. Third, the Government also helped supervise
the program and quickly backed the recommendations of the supervision mission, as well
as following up with the Bank to obtain an extension to the project period and reallocation
of funds. The good performance of the Government was somewhat tarnished by the slow
procurement process, for which it had review and approval obligations, and by a lack of
effort to identify donors for follow-on support.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

58.    Rating: Satisfactory. The “satisfactory” rating for agency performance is based
primarily on satisfactorily achieving the PDO and intermediate indicators, for which result
the implementing agency, Cellule Permanante and the component staff had the greatest
                                            51
effect. As mentioned, the start of the implementation was slow, but once the staff learned
the procedures required by the Bank, progress on the numerous targets set for the
component was rapid. Moreover, the main project, CAP1, and its successor, CAP2,
provided valuable help in resolving procurement problems.

59.      The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit also played several valuable roles. When at
effectiveness there were no detailed plans for the component, the M&E Unit and
component management organized a large workshop for stakeholders to prepare
implementation plans and monitoring indicators for all subcomponents (as well as for the
Cellule Permanante), thus providing a blueprint for the whole implementation period.25
The unit also successfully organized the field monitoring and reporting, a very challenging
job considering the large operational area and many stakeholders involved. Regular
reports from the M&E system helped the component management and the Bank staff to
follow the progress and improvements. The ICR mission noted that the M&E staff
prepared the limited impact assessment internally without external technical assistance and
without preparing a written document (sees Annex 3). Financial management and
reporting were good throughout the implementation period (with guidance from the CAP
staff), and the audit reports were unqualified.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

60.     Rating: Satisfactory. The satisfactory rating of overall Borrower’s performance is
justified on the grounds that the Government performance was satisfactory and that the
PDO and key implementation indicators were reached. The Government’s slow
procurement process and the tardiness of the implementing agency in getting the program
started kept the project from meriting a rating higher than “satisfactory.”

Lessons Learned

61.    The implementation completion report of the main project (CAP1) contains several
lessons learned, and this report provides three additional lessons:

     Ministerial collaboration. A concentrated effort (like a project approach) is useful to
      bring the different ministries together for a common course of action. Perhaps as its
      biggest achievement, the project/avian-flu component succeeded in building new,
      collaborative networks at all four levels (central, regional, departmental, and local
      communities) to fight avian flu. The networks included the staffs of the ministries of
      agriculture and animal services, health, and water and environment, plus many other
      participants from the public and private sectors on the coordination committees (all of
      whom were trained to fight avian flu). Also, the project brought the veterinary and
      human testing laboratories into the networks. The general view of the stakeholders was
      that now Niger was able to detect, treat, and monitor not only avian flu but also similar
      animal-conveyed diseases, including swine flu.




25
     / Some indicators were changed after the January 2010 supervision mission.
                                                     52
   Special nature of an emergency program. The slow start of implementing the avian flu
    component revealed some special requirements. In an emergency situation,
    extraordinary measures are needed. While it is important to process loans or grants
    rapidly in order to bring the necessary resources to where they are needed, it is equally
    important to make sure that there will be enough knowledgeable personnel to get the
    program started without delay. In the case of Niger, when no appraisal and related
    detailed planning occurred, the Bank should have recruited “expeditors” experienced
    in Bank procedures and the Government should have appointed full-time staff instead
    on relying on part-time persons, often already overburdened with other duties.

   Appropriate indicators. For an emergency program the envisaged outcome is that the
    effects of the crisis are minimized and recovery from the disaster can start quickly. For
    an avian flu attack the envisaged outcome would be that information is quickly passed
    to responsible authorities and that deaths are avoided or at least minimized. Thus the
    original outcome indicators in the Project Paper were correctly conceived when they
    largely concentrated on the reaction and reporting times by the local population and
    then by the authorities responsible for surveillance and treatment. Because,
    fortunately, no H5N1 virus reappeared in Niger, the emphasis was shifted to indicators
    that measured attainment of objectives set for different activities. However, now that
    the information, surveillance, and treatment network is ready, it would be advisable to
    test its effectiveness. Such testing could be arranged by an exercise in which the field
    would be informed that a bogus test would be done in an unspecified region, but
    without informing which one. Such testing, if repeated from time to time, would
    probably help maintain alertness among the stakeholders. (The component
    management is already developing this idea.)

                     Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

1.      The appraisal mission did not perform economic analysis or calculate a financial
rate of return for the whole project for several reasons. The project in question, with its
several components, many for social purposes or capacity building, does not lend itself to
reliable economic analysis. First, benefits of the capacity-building components (support to
communities and local governance for poverty and environmental monitoring) cannot
easily be quantified in monetary terms. Second, because the investment component—
Local Investment Fund--was demand-driven, the types of subprojects and the ratios
between them could not be known in advance. Third, many of the benefits from
anticipated investments (for example, in natural resource management, education, and
health) similarly defy quantification.

2.      The PAD analysis tried to use a conventional approach and estimated returns to
typical project investments financed under one component, the Local Investment Fund.
Thus, a cost-benefit analysis was undertaken on a sample of income-generating activities
that were likely to be among community priorities.

3.      In retrospect, because the project was focused largely on process-type
improvements about institutional arrangements and capacity building, it might have been
appropriate also to estimate the cost-effectiveness of resources spent on components other
than the Local Investment Fund (through unit-rate norms, service standards, and other
yardsticks as appropriate). But because this approach was not used in the PAD, and
because relevant information on both output and cost sides was lacking, this approach
could not be undertaken at the ICR stage.

4.      For these reasons, no economic or financial analyses were tried during project
implementation or at completion. Also, even if the micro-project investments during
project implementation had matched with those projected at appraisal (they did not), the
ICR mission did not try to repeat the estimates made at appraisal because in implementing
CAP, the investment were not those projected in PAD (and PAD did not include any
details about assumptions, prices, adoption rates, and the like). However, the project has
used consultants to carry out profitability analysis on many micro-projects. Thus, the
following text presents separately the projections at appraisal and at closing the project.

Cost-Benefit analysis at appraisal

5.      The objective of the study at appraisal was to analyze typical income-generating
activities that were likely to be selected by communities as micro-projects of CAP. These
activities, which included crop farming, livestock production, and petty trading, were
commonly carried out by Nigeriens, and represented sources of income for most Nigeriens.

6.      Methodology. The appraisal team carried out a desk-study to assess the capacity of
selected micro-projects to achieve the financial objectives of CAP. The instruments used
were the cash flow, Net Present Value (NPV), and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). No

                                            54
correction for inflation was included in the calculations. Any activity was estimated to be
satisfactory when its NPV was greater than zero or when its IRR was more than 10 percent.
The inputs for the analysis were obtained from NGO and donor reports, including reports
from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.

7.      Results. The analyses were made on small animal husbandry, small-scale trading,
peanut oil extraction, flour milling, animal carts, and irrigated agriculture. All micro-
project investments were found to be profitable, except growing niébe and rice, which
could be made profitable only by improving farming practices.

Profitability Analysis at Project Completion

8.     In 2007 the Project Coordination Unit (CCN) and the Ministry of Agriculture
organized, with the help of consultants, an extensive study on the profitability of
productive micro-projects26.

9.      Methodology. The objectives and methodology were first validated in a workshop
that CCN organized for the consultants and key stakeholders. The study had two
objectives: (a) to find the economic and financial results of revenue-earning micro-
projects for individual and collective beneficiaries; and (b) to develop tools to follow the
cash flows, financial planning, and decision making for promoters of the scheme.

10.     The work consisted of an analysis of documentary materials, a field mission in the
country’s eight regions, and preparation of the study report. The agreed approach was to
use a sampling method that had three dimensions: (a) development of a systematic
analytical method for all the regions; (b) selection of village clusters, removing those
clusters that were inaccessible because of rains or those that did not have revenue-
generating activities; and (c) final selection of micro-projects based on their advance

classification by type of activities carried out, including micro-projects of all classes and
all regions.

11.     As a result, a sample of 145 micro-projects was selected, representing 23 percent
of the 631 revenue-generating micro-projects financed at that time. They were located in
61 village clusters (34 percent) and in all eight regions. However, only 118 of the micro-
projects selected were evaluated because of difficulties in reaching the rest.

12.       The following categories were used for classifying micro-projects:

         Agro-pastoral micro-projects for raising lambs and sheep, milk goats, and cattle,
          and processing products based on them
         Artisan work and small-scale trading (batik coloring, leather treatment, basketwork,
          sale of wood, embroidery)
         Environmental protection micro-projects (collecting household refuse, planting
          trees, setting up bio-carbon sites, stocking fish in ponds, and providing equipment
          for fishermen).
         For computing results, the principal tools were cash flow, Net Present Value
          (NPV), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR), for which the team prepared matrix
          tables to ensure consistency of the fieldwork.

13.     Finally, the team prepared a synthesis of results by region. Besides cash flows,
NPVs, and IRRs, the synthesis considered internal and external factors that explained the
level of profitability reached and estimated the nonmonetary benefits and effects.

14.     Results. The analysis was carried out separately for each of the eight regions in
Niger. The study found substantial variations in profitability both in the types of micro-
projects and in the regions where they were carried out. Table 2 presents selected
summaries of the overall results. About 60 percent of productive micro-projects were
profitable in financial terms, leaving 40 percent as unprofitable (if no improvements were
made). The nonmonetary benefits are discussed later in this annex.

15.     The most profitable micro-projects were those belonging to the environmental
protection category 27 . The large numbers of agro-pastoral micro-projects that are
unprofitable pull down the overall success rate. 28

16.     Outcomes also vary greatly with the management of the micro-projects. The most
successful micro-projects are those managed by groups of women, even when the micro-
projects are in the least profitable category, that is, agro-pastoral micro-projects. The less-
successful micro-projects are those managed by mixed groups or communities (village
clusters), which generally work like collectives with social objectives, such as
marketplaces, grain banks for food security, or production support, such as farm input and
animal feed stores.

17.     Somewhat surprisingly, ecological conditions are not clearly reflected in the
profitability results. Micro-projects in better ecological zones, such regions as Maradi and
Dosso, can have high unprofitability rates (67% and 87%, respectively), whereas micro-
projects in faraway and near-desert regions such as Agadez and Diffa have relatively low
unprofitability rates (13% and 45%, respectively). These differences can be explained at



28
  / The study by Pender and Ndjeunga also shows how the agro-pastoral micro-projects could be improved,
for instance by using organic fertilizer.
29
  / Probably the most extensive study on the profitability of natural resource management investments is the
World Bank report, Impacts of Sustainable Land Management on Land Management and Poverty in
Niger,(Pender, Ndjeunga, etc., June 2008). It reaches essentially the same conclusions, namely, that NRM
investments in Niger are or can be made profitable, noting that “overall, these investments have paid for the
costs of SLM activities from the value of increased wood and fodder production.”
                                                     57
least partly by the different types of micro-projects that were implemented in the various
regions. 30

18.    Nonmonetary benefits. The study identified many nonmonetary benefits arising
from the micro-projects (but in the longer run, nonmonetary benefits will be earned only
from productive micro-projects if they are profitable). In general, the study argues that all
micro-projects contribute to the financial and social security of participating individuals
and households and to increased employment in communities. With micro-projects, the
standard of living and the social status of beneficiaries, especially of women, rise.
Examples of nonmonetary benefits in this respect include:

        Women learn management skills and decision making (for instance, in managing
         flour mills), and most young women involved in women groups gain status and
         become more “marriageable.”
        Many more children attend schools than previously because of rotating savings and
         credit associations (Roscas, tontines) that are facilitated by micro-projects.
        Cereal banks and farm input and animal feed stores, although almost always
         unprofitable, contribute to balancing or even lowering prices, as well as improving
         food security and improving productivity.
        Raising cattle and other animals result in improved nutrition for children when not
         all the milk or meat is sold for cash.
        Animal-drawn transport micro-projects have helped construction of houses for
         some people

19.    Improvements recommended. The study noted that those micro-projects that are in
financial difficulties could be closed early if improvements are not made in the short-term.
The actions recommended are as follows:
     Revise attributing funds for operational costs and the reasons for delays in
       implementation;
     Develop measures to increase operational funds (for almost all micro-projects);
     Educate the beneficiaries in operational (profitability) accounting, market
       negotiations, marketing, and scheduling of activities;
     Strengthen the capacities of committees for monitoring the activities of
       beneficiaries, for evaluating their micro-projects, internal controls, and for
       reporting and providing feedback.

20.     Cost analysis. Because the financial analyses in PAD and in the study carried out
by CAP consultants are not compatible, additional analysis about the project’s efficiency
could have been tried by using suitable cost-efficiency criteria to decide whether the
project represented the least-cost solution to reach identified and measurable benefits. This
was not done in the CAP study. It would be difficult to do this retroactively, partly
because the project components were related to “soft “ activities (for example, developing
organizational and administrative setups and monitoring systems, and supporting capacity


30
  / The 2008 study by Pender, Ndjeunga, and others (see Annex 9, the list of reference documents) reported
that the effects of sustainable land management programs and land management practices vary widely across
agro-ecological zones, community characteristics, and household wealth status.
                                                   58
building) and partly because they either did not contain quantified targets or the targets
were set afterwards. Even for the Local Investment Fund component no estimation was
made for the number of micro-projects or areas to be supported by GEF activities.

21.     However, the ICR mission noted that the actual cost of project management was
more than 120 percent above the budget. There were some justifiable reasons for this:
New activities were incorporated into the project (promotion of cooperative savings and
credit; making communities legally approved units; avian flu; Acacia Senegal), training
costs in the field were mistakenly attributed to the management component in the early
years, and the lack of knowledge about the complexities of local development atappraisal
should have attracted the attention of the Government and the Bank early.

22.      Evaluation of the economic and financial analysis. As noted at appraisal, the type
of project does not easily lend itself to rigorous economic or financial analysis as the term
is traditionally used at the World Bank. However, a partial analysis for the micro-project
component might have been possible. In that case, on the cost side at least, the community
support component (or a part of it), as well as a part of the project management component,
should have been added. However, the types of micro-project investments demanded by
the beneficiaries would have be estimated somehow, even though it might have been
possible to distinguish micro-projects from similar projects in neighboring countries. Also,
allocating costs of other components for micro-projects in the analysis would have been
arbitrary. Thus, the decision by the appraisal team to estimate only NPV and IRR for a set
of “representative” productive activities appears reasonable. However, the estimates even
in these cases seem simplified (for example, all income-cost streams over the 10-year
periods used in calculations are equal) but this and other assumptions cannot be subjected
to post-analysis because of the lack of details in the reports.

23.     The analysis in 2007 was carefully planned and carried out. It included a plan for
the study and methodology and for their confirmation by a workshop. The sampling was
targeted to cover typical investments classified in categories of near-similar investments,
and thus the sampling size (22.5 percent of all 631 productive micro-projects at that time)
was enough. The study was carried out by experienced consultants, it included both study
of documents prepared earlier by CCN and actual visit to the project sites, and the results
were extensively recorded based on Niger’s administrative departments. For the benefit of
an ICR, estimates in the study should have been made for the same micro-project
investments as in PAD. This was not done, and thus comparison with PAD is not possible.
However, the report gives the essential information for decision-makers to decide which
micro-project investments are profitable , as well as suggestions for improvement.

No end-of-the-project beneficiary survey was prepared. However, in 2005-06 the CAP
Coordination Unit organized an internal evaluation that served as a beneficiary survey
(PAC—Evaluation Interne à mi-parcour par Pietronella van den Oever, E. Oumarou, A.
Oumarou, février 2006). 31

A.         2006 Internal Evaluation

1. Conclusion

The study concluded that the approach adopted by the Community Action Program (CAP)
had efficiently engaged the target populations in consultations and acceptance of the
program at the local, regional, and national levels was good.

2. Methodology

The methodology comprised several phases. To begin with, the study team collected and
read the relevant documents on CAP. Then the team identified the principal stakeholders
of the program, including the main local “actors” and agencies, benefiting village clusters
(grappes) and communes that were set up during decentralization, and the village groups
that had benefited from micro-projects and government services associated with CAP.

Identification of the principal groups of « actors » allowed the study team to develop
evaluation instruments that were adapted to the specific needs of selected groups,
including women’s groups. The team planned to conduct focus group studies in the field
using a questionnaire prepared by the team. The methodology was then tested during the
first visits in the field with the help of the Niamey Regional Coordination Unit of CCN.

The team presented the first draft report to a plenary workshop that was attended by a
group of CAP stakeholders and development partners, and the team considered workshop
comments when preparing the final report.

3. Contents of the review

This summary concentrates on selected topics, that is, poverty and implications to women,
environmental issues, and the local governments. Other study targets dealt with in the
study team’s report include intermediary organs or groups, that is, civil society
representatives (service providers), technical services, micro-project approval committees,
communal trainers, and student and their professors (who have helped carry out various
inquiries and studies).

4. Waging the fight against poverty and encouraging women’s involvement

In the local activities CAP grants special attention to women’s participation, as elaborated
in the manual on the rules of investment prepared by CAP. The rules reserve 25 percent of
productive investments to finance activities identified and managed by women’s groups.

The regional coordination units of CCN collect information on the number of female
members of elected bodies and of special commissions in village clusters, the number of
women elected to Commune Councils, and the number of women who took part in
different training sessions. However, the women who have official roles could not confirm
to the study team that they are effectively involved or consulted when important decisions
are taken or when priority activities are chosen into the Local Development Plans (LDP)
or Commune Development Plans (CDP).

The study showed that the extent to which women participated effectively in CAP projects
varies among regions and even among communities within the same region. In several
communities of Agadez, Tahoua, and Niamey regions, for example, women have long
been members of different management organs and often have played important roles. In
other regions, for instance in Maradi, women have been very little involved in official
functions. Even women in female micro-project groups seemed to have little knowledge of
decision-making and the priorities under the Local or Commune Development Plans.

Long before the arrival of CAP, women’s groups in Niger had participated in
contributions or savings and credit activity (tontines). Many women confirmed that CAP
had energized the groups and opened new possibilities for improving women’s lives
through new economic activities. With CAP activities, the groups often kept their social
character as well as economic character, and the spirit of mutual help was strong. For
instance, when women raise goats or breed cattle and an animal belonging to one woman
dies, the other women collect money to buy her a new one.

Obviously, women’s groups have a gift for mobilizing personal contributions so that all
members can benefit from micro-projects. The study team noted that in all cases the
women had been able to collect the necessary funds for the micro-projects in time to
receive a grant. However, it is important to note that the micro-projects undertaken by
women were generally more modest than micro-projects run by mixed or male groups.

Most of the members of women’s groups in Niger are illiterate, but they all wished for
their own children—boys and girls—“to have the opportunity to go to school so that they
could help improve the life of their parents, and live a better life than their parents.”

5. Revealing women’s potential in the fight against poverty

The ability of women’s groups to mobilize and manage funds means that they have a
potentially important role in the fight against poverty. One high-level government
administrator told the study team that «It is necessary to place much more funds in the
hands of women. They know very well how to manage money and how to grow the initial
capital, and at the same time improve the life of the family. »

The study team, however, suggested that the contribution of women to poverty reduction
could be optimized only if the following preconditions are met:

                                            63
    (a) Clean drinking water must be available close by, both to save time for women
        who now must fetch water from a distance, and to allow women to enter
        productive activities that require water;

    (b) A solution must be found to the drudgery of grinding grains. Some groups have
        received flour mills under the CAP micro-project program, but unfortunately the
        mills have not worked well or have broken down. Better maintenance and
        improved bookkeeping are needed;

    (c) The capacity of women groups must be improved. Women’s groups have
        requested literacy programs and training in simple accounting and management.


6. Fight against poverty and degradation of the environment

The degradation of land in Niger has accelerated in recent times and the environment there
is already fragile and getting worse because of increased demographic and animal stress.
In this context, CAP, with its objectives of fighting poverty through economic
development, risks confrontation with the fragile environment in Niger.

To reach economic development goals without endangering the environment, CAP should
emphasize the need to improve natural resource management, that is, CAP should insist
that each micro-project integrate environmental improvement or protection elements, and
that no investments harmful to the environment will be funded.

The environmental objectives of CAP were appropriate, but the number of environmental
micro-projects has been inadequate to meet the objectives. Although the beneficiaries of
CAP were aware of the degradation of their environment, environmental micro-projects
did not have a high priority in the Local Development Plans, and villagers were reluctant
to provide cash or in-kind contributions to the community to carry out such micro-projects.
The reasons were several, including:

      The high-level of poverty restricts people from investing in non-urgent activities
       (whereas for example, cereal banks, farm input stores, breeding animals are seen as
       urgent);

      It is difficult to mobilize people for collective activities without concrete
       incentives;

      Most environmental improvement sites are sparsely populated and in areas that are
       already badly degraded. Hence it is difficult to convince people of their potential
       (production) benefits;

      Other projects in the environmental sector, including the Special Program of the
       President, offered food and cash incentives;

      Environmental protection is costly; and

      People were expected to contribute 10 percent to 20 percent for micro-projects.

                                           64
As a result, relatively few environmental micro-projects had been carried out by
midterm.32 The rare environmental micro-projects that were implemented, especially on
common lands, showed both the difficulty of getting people to particpate in communal
work without compensation (as in Tahoua région, grappa de Bouza), and someways to get
the people to improve their environment when suitable incentives are provided (as in the
Tillabéry, grappe de Tcharga ).

With respect to taking into account the environmental concerns in financing all the micro-
projects (ref. the World Bank’s safeguarding policy), the study team noted that the key
tools (the environmental strategy paper, environmental guides, and evaluation manual) had
been given only limited distribution and were insufficiently mastered by the stakeholders
and others related to the project. The training-of-trainers courses organized by CAP had
not been offered to other members of CAP or to ONG partners. The members of the
village clusters received none of these tools.

The study team also noted that most of micro-projects had received no environmental
evaluation, and even fewer micro-projects had included measures aimed at reducing
potentially negative effects. For instance, in the Diffa region, mitigating measures had
been included in certain micro-project proposals, but they had not been carried out in
practice.

It is important for CAP to give all « actors » involved in local and commune development
plans the tools they need to analyze environmental effects on micro-projects, and put in
place appropriate mechanisms to supervise and monitor micro-projects. In addition,
adequate supervision arrangements must be made for micro-projects, even if part of
environmental monitoring has been outsourced (for example, to ROSELT or SIGNER).

7. Observations on local governance

One of the CAP components supports the decentralization process being carried out in the
country as follows.

               In the field, CAP provides some support to selected communes and their
                elected bodies; and
               At the central government level, CAP helps the Haut Commissariat à la
                Modernisation de l’Etat (HCME) prepare policies and institutional reforms to
                speed up the process of decentralization.

CAP has provided help to HCME through the Ministry of Interior and Decentralization, in
accordance with memorandums of understanding (conventions) between CAP and the
Ministry. However, in the field the study team learned of some frustration among village
clusters that had been left outside the project assistance during the first phase of the
program. According to some local politicians, « double speed » phasing was not fair.




32
     / However, at the end of 2007 their number was 434, that is, 28 percent of the total (ICR mission’s note).
                                                        65
The study team suggested that coexisting village clusters and communes as targets of
assistance cannot continue beyond the first phase of the program, but that the CAP should
direct all its assistance henceforth to the communes. Whatever the level of support, the
project must adhere to the same strict rules on the use of funds as until now.

8. Some observations on social cohesion

Wherever the study team interviewed beneficiary groups, the members of the groups
spoke about «social capital » (la vie associative). As was the case with other subjects, the
team noted that the villagers who had participated in training organized by CAP had
indeed internalized the principal elements of the training. Interviews confirmed this time
after time. As a result, there is a new sense of social dynamism among the target groups.
This dynamism allows, both in the short run and in the long run, the villagers to undertake
community-oriented activities that will have positive effects and improvement of the
living conditions in the target villages.

9. Study team’s recommendations

The report contains recommendations on both operational and policy matters. They are not
reproduced here, because they are too many and because many of them were implemented
during the latter part of the project period.

B.     2010 Impact Evaluation of Avian Flu Component

No formal end-of-the-project survey of beneficiaries was prepared. Actually, benefits
would have accrued to the population if an avian flu attack had occurred during the project
period, but fortunately no attack occurred. However, the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
of the Component F of CAP1 organized in 2010 an internal impact review that may serve
as a knowledge and awareness survey of beneficiaries. No report on this study was
completed, but the statistical results were incorporated in the Government’s Project
Completion Report (Rapport Interne d’Achevement de Composante Grippe Aviaire du
Programme d’Actions Communautaires Phase 1) under the section “Mobilization of social
and communication strategy.”

1. Conclusion

The study concluded that the approach adopted by the avian flu component had efficiently
engaged the target populations and had told them about the avian flu and its symptoms as
well as methods for avoiding it. At the baseline in 2008 64 percent of the population was
aware of the existence of the disease, its symptoms, and measures to be used to prevent it
(since the information campaigns launched by the Government and planned and financed
by UNICEF and other international and bilateral donors). At the end of 2010 this
percentage had increased to 91 percent thanks to the activities of the project and some
support from other sources such as the European Union through SPINAP, an NGO.

2. Methodology

The methodology had two phases. First, the M&E Unit distributed questionnaires to all the
field agents trained by the project, that is, staffs of the public-sector agricultural and
                                            66
veterinary services, human-health officials, and field agents of the environmental services.
They interviewed more than 1.200 individuals in the areas where active surveillance of the
avian flu was practiced. The results were first summarized at the departmental level, then
at the regional level and finally by the M&E Unit at CAP1.

Second, the component management organized a workshop for key stakeholders in which
the interview results were approved and made uniform.

The methodology used in interviews and selection of interviewees may not have been so
scientific as it would have been if a professional consulting firm or university had been
used to plan and execute the study. The method of selecting interviewees was said to be
random because it was left to field agents to decide where they carried out the interviews.
They did it mainly at marketplaces and mosques of their own choosing. However, as the
sample size was six times larger than a scientifically representative random sampling
would have required, the results were sufficiently valid to determine that the knowledge
and awareness level of the population improved substantially during implementation of
the project.

            Annex 7. Stakeholder Workshop Report (Original Project)

1. Organization of stakeholder workshops

The ICR mission organized two stakeholder workshops as well as individual sessions with
three NGOs. The first workshop included 18 ministries and public- and private- sector
organizations. (For example, in the Ministries of Agricultural Development,
Decentralization, and Environment), for supervisors or technical support personnel (for
example, in the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministries of Livestock and
Hydraulics), or for implementers (for example, in ASI, a private-sector company involved
in carbon sequestration). The second workshop included 10 organizations from the
international technical and financial donor community, including among other the
European Union (the leader of the donor community workgroup), World Bank, FAO,
Danish, Swiss, and Luxemburg development agencies. The NGO group was represented
by major agencies ARIDEL (Action pour le renforcement des initiatives de développement
local), ONG-CDR (Contribution au développement rural), and ICRISAT. In addition, the
mission interacted with the public-sector, elected officials, and beneficiary groups in
Tillaberi Department.

2. Workshop with the public and private sector

In the workshop organized for the representatives of public and private sectors involved in
the Community Action Program (CAP), the ICR mission asked each participant to make a
presentation on four topics.

The four topics were as follows:
 The role of the organization/agency in question vis-à-vis CAP;
 The main achievements during project implementation;
 The main difficulties faced during project implementation;
 The most important lessons that could have been gained from the project and its
   implementation for the follow-on project or similar projects in other countries.

Partnerships with CAP. The interrelationships among the different organizations/agencies
and CAP attending the workshop, showed the broad reach of the Community Action
Program:

      Secrétariat Permanent de la Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté (SP/SRP):
       SP/SRP has supported in the revision of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and
       definition of monitoring and evaluation linked with outcomes;

      Direction des Etudes et de la Programmation (DEP) in the Ministry of Hydraulics:
       DEP has participated in supervising the project and represented the Ministry in the
       Steering Committee. The ministry has provided technical assistance to CAP in the
       field and benefited in its promotion of increased access to clean water.

      Conseil National de l’Environnement pour un Développement Durable (CNEDD)
       was a partnership that was created to advance the Bio-Carbon Initiative Program,


                                            68
       and s a nationally designated agency (Autorité National Désignée-AND) of all
       projects belonging to Méchanisme de Développement Propre (MDP).

      Achat Services International (ASI) is a partnership that is based on the Bio-Carbon
       Initiative; ASI acts as recorder of carbon-retrieval credits.

      Direction Générale d’Evaluation des Programmes de Développement (DGEPD) of
       the Ministry of Economy and Finance has helped design the project, conduct a trial
       of M&E arrangements in a few regions, and supervise CAP.

      Direction Générale de Financement (DGF) of the Ministry of Economy and
       Finance was the interface between the project and the World Bank, and it has
       helped processing withdraw applications to the World Bank and to the
       Government..

      Secrétariat Permanent du Code Rural (SP/CR) has worked to secure land rights
       for the reforestation areas and to develop the land use and registration legislation,
       as well as participating in CAP supervision missions.

      Direction Générale pour les Collectivités Territoriales (DGCT) has assured that
       the regional administration and elected bodies provide the general guidance for the
       project operations.

      Direction de Production Animale (DPA) was a member of the project’s Steering
       Committee. It has participated in supervision missions, and its staff provides
       technical assistance to village clusters;

      Haut Commissariat à la Modernisation de l’Etat (HCME): CAP has supported
       HCME’s process of decentralization; and

      Direction Générale du Développement Communautaire (DGDC): The mutual
       interest of CAP and DGDC has been in developing the concept of communal
       planning and its advocacy. DGDC was also a member of the Steering Committee.

Main achievements. In general, the agencies and organizations that participated in the
workshop expressed appreciation for the project’s achievements in the field. In their own
work and organizations they credited several results to the project: As a summary, the
public- and private-sector partners reported that the project had:

      Organized or facilitated organization of workshops, seminars, and conferences for
       training, for study of climate change and for actions required on environmental
       problems at all levels, from the National Assembly to the private sector and local
       villages; had recruited consultants; and had provided tools for development and its
       measurement (SP/SRP; CNEDD; DGCT, DGDC);

      Acquired or facilitated acquiring of information technology and materials, and
       created policies, manuals, and documents of good quality (including a new version
       of Strategy for Reducing Poverty) (SP/SRP; );


                                            69
      Increased coverage of water points and sanitation facilities according to the
       demand presented by the local populations (DEP);

      Accelerated environmental improvements, including introduction of Acacia
       Senegal plantations and carbon sequestration (CNEDD);

      Facilitated signing of a contract with the World Bank-administered bio-carbon
       fund and creating contracts with 41 communities to establish carbon sequestration
       plantations (ASI);

      Provided management training and facilitated field visits to install field-level M&E
       (DGEPD),

       Helped establish a number of land commissions and facilitated juridical
       clarification of investments in reforestation sites (SP/CR);

      Facilitated promotion of the cattle-breeding policies of the Government through
       CAP micro-projects (DPA); and

      Facilitated evaluation of the decentralized administrations in selected regions
       (DGCT) and complementary studies on decentralization, leading to adoption of a
       frame law for decentralization and establishment of an Agency for Financing of
       Elected Bodies in the Niger Territory (HCME).

Problem areas and difficulties

The participated agencies and organizations reported no major problems in dealing with
CAP, but mentioned a few that either they or the project in their view had encountered:

      Delays and shortcomings in the Government’s 10 percent counterpart funding have
       impeded the organization of field missions (SOP/SRP; DGF);

      Local specialists of technical ministries have provided technical assistance to
       micro-projects, but the quality needs to be monitored, especially for water (DEP):

      Monitoring of bio-carbon plantations requires a lot of time because the plantations
       are far from each other; moreover, the population does not yet understand the
       effects of carbon gas despite workshops around the country (CNEDD);

      The weakening of the U.S. dollar has reduced the amount of local funds available
       for planned activities and for beneficiary groups (the U.S. dollar is a major
       currency in the SDR basket) (DGF);

      It has been impossible to attain the target number of land commissions (SP/CR);

      Slow release of funds for payments to service providers has slowed
       implementation of micro-projects; the evaluation process has not yet covered all
       regions (DGCT);


                                           70
      Triple involvement of technical services (in preparation, approval, and supervision
       of a micro-project) could be a weakness (DPA); and

      The ministry always needs financial and equipment support to participate in the
       supervision missions (DGDC).

Lessons suggested by participating stakeholders. The problem areas and difficulties just
listed imply some lessons and the need for improvement. In addition, the participating
agencies and organizations suggested the following:

      External input, such as that of CAP, has been necessary to introduce the Results-
       Based Management approach (Gestion Axée sur les Résultats—GAR) into
       monitoring and evaluation of poverty and to improve policies (SP/SRP);

      The teamwork between partners and the information flows that CAP has
       introduced have been adequate (CNEDD); The project introduced an approach that
       favored integration of activities and actors and made the partners work as teams
       (DGDC);

      CAP has been a key instrument in developing land registration and land decrees
       (SP/CR);

      Timing of CAP financing was good for communes, allowing them to establish
       themselves and get training before attempting to start preparing their development
       plans and implementing micro-projects identified in communal development plans
       (DGCT); and

      The methodological approach, tools, and documents that CAP has introduced were
       well used by partners (DGDC).


3. Workshop with the donor community

Representatives of the donor community made the following observations and
recommendations (the workshop did not attempt to reach consensus on these views and
recommendations):

      CAP I was a large program covering a substantial part of Niger and, has provided
       a major basis for introducing practical actions to support the country’s rural
       development strategy. Its objectives are still relevant in the current circumstances;

      CAP I has provided a platform for extensive discussions among international and
       national development partners and therefore has facilitated a certain degree of
       harmonization of external assistance in the rural development field; the
       development partners have been active in reviewing and commenting on
       documents as project-related policies and various guidelines and manuals,
       interesting also for their own programs;



                                            71
      CAP I has been a multi-activity package (like a brand-type program) and it has
       been collaborative, transparent, and well known in the country. It also has eased
       the entrance of donors besides the World Bank, with their own local or technical
       assistance programs, into the rural development field. However, while the general
       structure of CAP I has been well known, its details, procedures, and even results
       have remained less familiar to other development partners. During PAC II,
       information should be better disseminated and project reports and documents
       should be more widely distributed;

      Collaboration with others in the field has been adequate in many cases; for
       example, FAO has provided technical expertise in the irrigation subsector.
       However, not all programs of donor agencies have been fully compatible with
       CAP. CAP could have benefited from better cooperation with other agencies when
       program locations coincided, and better results might have been obtained if CAP
       and others had agreed on locations where complementary services could be
       provided.

      Commune- and community - level investments have helped establish elected
       bodies at the communes and have reinforced the capacities and provided
       infrastructure both at commune and cluster levels. Other donor agencies have
       benefited from increased capacities and facilities. However, donor agencies fear
       that too little attention has been paid to maintenance of facilities created at these
       levels, and that the results may be lost when donor money is no longer available
       (this concern applied also to other field-level facilities financed by external funds);

      Although CAP is a long-term program with preset development objectives, it
       should be flexible enough to take into account new developments and facilities and
       to allow a more rapid change of course. For instance, when irrigation becomes an
       apparent priority or when additional funds for the Government’s development
       programs become available (e.g., the European Union’s allocation of 20 million
       euros), CAP should be quick to adjust its components or develop appropriate
       financing instruments so that these opportunities could be seized; and

      There is an apparent controversy between the “investment” structures
       (communities or “grappes”—village clusters) and the new structure of
       “communes” (districts). It is not clear, whether CAP should support either
       structures, or whether CAP should concentrate more, if not all, of its attention to
       the communes. The communes might, as public-sector administrative units, be
       better able to look after sustainability and maintenance of village-level investments
       than the voluntary committees of village cluster.


On a minor note, donor community participants also questioned whether “multi-
supervisions” every six months, sometimes involving tens of persons from various
agencies and the project, would really improve the project, be cost-effective, and increase
“ownership,” or whether wrap-up sessions with broad participation and adequate
distribution of mission reports would be sufficient.

4. Working sessions with NGO/research representatives

The ICR mission interacted with three agencies,--ARIDEL (Action pour le renforcement
des initiatives de développement local), ONG-CDR (Contribution au développement rural),
and ICRISAT--.

ARIDEL was created by the personnel who had implemented the World Bank-financed
Natural Resources Management Project (PGRN) from 1997- to 2002. Besides natural
resource management programs, it has been active in social fields, HIV/AIDS prevention,
alphabetization, capacity building, and rural development in a broad sense for several
multi- and bilateral agencies. ARIDEL has a head office in Douchi, 27 permanent staff
and temporarily, 13 consultants and 10 resource persons. For PAC, it has been active in
four regions, implementing some 20 subcontracts for communes and village clusters.

ONG-CDR was established in 1990. Its headquarters is in Niamey and six branches in the
regions, with regional coordinators and technical advisers. It has 45 permanent staff and a
support group of 320 members. The activities in which ONG-CDR has been involved
range from research to project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, advisory work,
and communication and training. With different external financiers, ONG-CDR has been
involved, among other things, in training of preparation of 240 commune and village
cluster development plans, of which about 35 have been implemented through
subcontracts financed by CAP.

ICRISAT is an international organization that has its headquarters in India and branches in
semi-arid regions of India and Africa, including one in Niger. Although, it is essentially a
crop-research institute, in Niger, ICRISAT has been heavily involved in research of
Acacia Senegal and other indigenous tree species. It collaborated with CAP early on, but
once the carbon sequestration program became part of CAP, ICRISAT was contracted to
carry out activities relating to planting of locally adaptable trees. In these activities, it has
undertaken capacity building (collection of seeds, nursery techniques, involvement of
local people), started local programs (selection of sites and involvement of government
agencies and NGOs), technical assistance to CAP and NGOs, and supervision on behalf of
CAP.

Apart from delays in getting payments from the project for the contracts, there have been
no major problems (but a huge amount of work). The NGOs cited the following lessons:

   -   A manual for outsourcing services (“faire-faire”) would have helped speed up the
       contracting procedures with communes and village clusters (thus also speeding up the
       preparation of development plans, micro-projects, and their implementation);

   -   Although communes and communities may have been unfamiliar with competition in
       selecting the service providers--and competition might have slowed the start of field
       work—competition has allowed the communes to choose the best and least expensive
       NGOs to carry out the field activities;

   -   CAP support and financing were critical both for starting the decentralization program
       and for kick-starting local-level development. The communes that were included in


                                               73
    CAP have proved to be much more advanced, competent, and energetic than those that
    were left outside;

-   In promoting environmental improvements, it is necessary to understand the local
    people and their habits, concerns, and priorities. To get people interested in such long-
    term matters as natural resource management and environmental protection (including
    maintenance of trees), it is absolutely necessary to provide them with concrete
    incentives (food or cash for work). Similarly, to improve efficiency, the public-sector
    staff needs to be given incentives for better efficiency (transport, training, allowances);

-   Political- and higher-level administrators must strongly encourage local administrators
    to view natural resource management as a high priority. Elected officials and higher-
    level administrators (and the rest of the world) must emphasize that desertification is
    not simply a problem for some local people but a problem for the whole country and
    even the world, because leaving land to erode un-reclaimed will quickly expand the
    desert and reduce carbon absorption.

              Annex 8. Stakeholder Workshop Report (Avian Flu Component)

Organization of stakeholder workshops

The ICR mission on the avian flu component of CAP1 organized three stakeholder
workshops/meetings and had individual sessions with stakeholders. The first meeting was
with the National Committee in charge of the fight against avian flu; 12 persons from the
key ministries and public sector organizations and from international organizations
attended. The second meeting was with nine representatives (“focal points”) from the
regions that were the main beneficiaries of the project assistance (Tahoue, Maradi, and
Zinder). The representatives were from the regional offices of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Animal Services, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Environment. The third
meeting was with the international donor community; the mission met representatives of
FAO, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA),33 and the
World Health Organization. In addition, the mission met in private sessions all the
Component F staff of CAP1, key persons of the Second Community Action Program
Support Project (CAP2), the Bank’s resident mission staff who had dealt with Component
F, and high officials and focal points of the involved and benefiting ministries, that is, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Services, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of
Environment.

Methodology

After the opening discussion with the stakeholders to clarify the relationship of the
respective ministry/agency/organization to the avian flu component (hereafter called the
project), or ways in which the ministry/agency/organization engaged with the project, the
mission asked the stakeholders three key questions.

      What were the most significant results/achievements of the project?
      What were the main problems that negatively affected implementation of the
       project?
    What are the most important lessons learned from the project and its
       implementation that can help to inform the design of a follow-on project in Niger,
       or similar projects in other countries?
The views expressed in these workshops and meetings are summarized in the next section.

Main achievements

All stakeholders who were interviewed expressed appreciation for the achievements of the
project. They strongly endorsed the general approach of the avian flu component, as a
country response in case of an attack by the pathogenic H5N1 virus. They also recognized
that, in order to be effective, the approach must be a collaborative effort among several
ministries at the central, regional, departmental, and local levels and that the approach



33
   / Several others had been invited, but because their assistance in the fight against avian flu had ended,
they did not see it as necessary for them to come.
                                                      75
must be accompanied by supporting actions and activities, for example, provision of
information, training, and technical and operational support.

The stakeholders reported that the project had generated benefits in a number of areas:

   The project brought a new approach to the fight against avian flu (and similar diseases)
    in Niger, one that has been successfully integrated into the Government’s strategic
    planning and decentralization efforts. It linked donors that were active in animal- and
    human-health and environmental fields, leading them to better coordinate their efforts
    around a common set of decentralized, participatory approaches.

   The project provided sorely needed funds to help continue the work started by the
    Government and the Cellule Permanente/Comité national de lutte contre la grippe
    aviaire and supported by several international agencies with small resources, but for
    which assistance had ended. (Only the support by the European Union through
    SPINAP continued, apart from technical advice from others such as WHO.)

   Perhaps as its biggest achievement, the project helped build new, collaborative
    networks at all four levels (central, regional, departmental, and local communities) to
    fight against avian flu. The networks included the staffs of the ministries of agriculture
    and animal services, health, and water and environment, plus many other participants
    from the public and private sectors on the coordination committees (all of whom were
    trained to fight avian flu). Also, the project brought the veterinary and human testing
    laboratories into the networks. The general view was that now Niger was able to detect,
    treat, and monitor avian flu or similar animal-conveyed diseases, including swine flu.
    When there was an outbreak of a milder flu in February 2010 (H1N1--swine flu) the
    networks were able to respond to it in a coordinated manner.

   The project stimulated an entirely new level of dynamism in the ministries, their
    personnel, and local populations by providing important information, training,
    equipment, and operational resources to people, who were stakeholders in the fight
    against avian flu and who, without the project, would have had little chances to
    organize protection against this potential calamity. It also facilitated anti-flu operations
    by allowing adequate planning and financing implementation of the plans. The key
    players among the public, such as animal traders, poultry farmers, slaughterers, and
    poultry handlers, especially women and children, were trained. Vigilance was
    organized all the way from the national to the village level (in the critical areas that is,
    in regions neighboring Nigeria and Burkina Faso, where cases of avian flu had
    appeared earlier).

   The stakeholders particularly appreciated the construction or rehabilitation of new
    laboratories, health centers, and isolation facilities, and their own role in identifying
    the critical areas for these facilities. The project gave a large number of people the
    knowledge about and skills to fight avian flu; and it helped form coordination
    committees at the regional, departmental, and community levels to take charge of the
    avian flu-related activities.

   Stakeholders also greatly appreciated the diagnostic material, medicines, incinerators
    for medical waste, refrigerators, information technology, communications equipment
                                              76
    (e.g., 500 cellular phones for surveillance and communication), purchased by the
    project. Also the human-health and environmental people appreciated the technical
    training they received, as did the project staff and focal points.

   The project improved the effectiveness of the Government’s technical ministries by
    bringing in the appropriate technical resources to support and monitor avian flu
    activities at the regional, departmental, and the local levels. It financed the creation of
    manuals and documents that were widely used in training and implementing the
    project activities

   The project facilitated continuation of radio programs and information dissemination
    started earlier with help of UNICEF, USAID, and others on avian-flu related topics.

   The project allowed the environmental protection agents to contribute effectively to
    the surveillance of avian flu and other bird diseases by providing a substantial number
    of environmental agents with Global Positioning Systems (GPS), binoculars, cameras,
    vehicles, and so on, thus significantly improving surveillance, including that of
    migratory birds. All environmental respondents mentioned the cellular phones
    purchased by the project as a critical part of their communication and surveillance
    work. Also, reporting on field events became regular, and communication improved
    not only inside Niger but also in the region around Niger.

   The project financed training for environmental staff and built capacity to carry out
    systematic surveillance work in the field.

   Support from the main project, CAP1 and later CAP2, was important; there were no
    problems in the accounting, financial reporting, disbursement, or audits during the
    project.

   Arguably, the project may have helped avoid a new attack of avian flu, or at least to
    avoid any panic associated with the disease, among populations less well informed
    about this disease.

Problem areas and difficulties

Although the stakeholders were generally very satisfied with the avian flu project, they
also recognized that a number of problems arose during implementation that it would be
advisable to avoid in any eventual follow-on operation:


   Delays occurred in procurement and receipt of the promised goods and services.
    (However, most goods and services identified in the annual plans and budgets were
    delivered, albeit sometimes late.)

   The Government people involved in the project were inexperienced with the project
    activities and especially with the procedures of the World Bank. There was not enough
    expertise among those involved in the project even to write specifications for the
    requirements for this special type of project. Consultant assistance in preparing
    specifications for goods and services to be procured was too little or too late.

                                              77
   The Government and World Bank procurement procedures should have been more
    flexible (“soupple”).

   The new equipment and facilities that were provided were good, but all respondents
    mentioned that there were too few to supply all of the agents in the priority
    surveillance areas, let alone the whole country. There were shortages of medications,
    computers, transport equipment, and laboratory security systems.

   In the environmental sector, more vehicles (cars and motorcycles) were needed and
    more agents should have been trained. Moreover, the training given needs to be
    updated and supplemented with more technical training (e.g., in recognition of the
    migratory birds).

   Environmental agents and veterinary service people suffered from the fact that the
    frontier between Niger on the one side and Nigeria and Burkina Faso on the other side
    is very long, “porous,” and difficult to guard.

   Project management was slow to start some activities (e.g., procurement of a freezer-
    dryer and initiation of the study needed for restarting the aviculture in the 2006 avian
    flu disaster areas, where more than 17,000 chickens had been culled). The supervising
    ministry was slow to approve the procurement documents, and World Bank teams
    were sometimes slow to give the Bank’s no-objections.

   The original project period (24 months) was too short and the funds were too little for
    such an extensive exercise. Not all villagers were informed and trained, especially
    those outside the frontier of Nigeria and Burkina Faso.

   While the idea of “mainstreaming” the project activities in the existing Government
    organizations was good, it was often difficult to get the full attention of the officials,
    including focal points in the different ministries, because all involved had other
    pressing tasks as well. (No person, except for the project accountant, had the project
    activities as his sole duty.) Some individuals expressed the view that perhaps the
    Government was less committed to this project than it was to bigger projects.

   The project, and all other donor assistance for this work, has ended, and there is great
    concern as to whether the networks, especially the committees at different levels, can
    sustain. Some waning of interest among the committees has already been noticed and
    the meetings are tapering off. The normal Government budgets provide for too few
    funds even to pay for telephone and Internet fees and transport. (The Government
    budgets cover the office premises, electricity, and salaries of two persons—coordinator
    and permanent secretary of the Cellule Permanente and those of the focal points.)

   More funds would be needed to consolidate the achievements and reinforce the
    structures developed.




                                             78
Lessons learned

In view of the achievements of the project--and in recognition of the problem areas--the
stakeholders identified the following lessons learned:

   The project was extremely influential in Niger because it introduced an integrated
    approach to the fight against the avian flu, one that has been successfully implemented
    in the key ministries and other agencies. During the crisis (2005-06), the Government
    relatively quickly mobilized donors to provide support, but the donors’ efforts lasted
    only 1 to 2 years. However, there is a longer-term need for this kind of operation, and
    the effort will need to continue, at least to facilitate operating the organizations that
    have been established and the equipment that has been purchased.

   Like the main project, CAP1, the avian flu component provided a platform for
    extensive discussions among international and national development partners and
    therefore facilitated some harmonization of external assistance. Development partners
    regularly reviewed and commented on project-generated documents.

   In a crisis, it is easy to underestimate the financial and manpower resources needed for
    an effective, countrywide response. (The funds earmarked by the World Bank were not
    based on a needs assessment but on the allocation of a portion of the limited grant
    funds available.)

   A concentrated effort (like a project approach) is useful to bring the different
    ministries together. Collaboration among concerned ministries was generally
    satisfactory after the roles and shares of funds had been worked out. Previously there
    had been only limited linkages between the veterinary- and human-health services, and
    those were more in the field than at the central level. Some have also suggested that
    the collaboration during the project avoided duplication of effort and brought
    economic savings through use of the same facilities, for instance, for diagnostics,
    communications, and logistics.

   An impressive level of collaboration has been achieved among the implementing
    agencies. Teamwork among the partners was substantial, and the information flows
    that the project fostered allowed different development partners to feel that they were
    working toward a common goal and essentially using the same approach. The same
    can also be said of the key ministries.

  RAPPORT D’ACHEVEMENT DE LA PREMIER PHASE DU PROGRAMME
              D'ACTIONS COMMUNAUTAIRES (PAC)

                                        Sommaire

Niveau d’execution et d’atteinte des objectifs du PAC.

Le Programme d'Actions Communautaires (PAC) a pour objectif global de réduire la
pauvreté et de promouvoir le développement local grâce d'une part au renforcement des
capacités des collectivités et des communautés en matière de gouvernance locale et de
gestion des ressources naturelles, et d'autre part à l'élévation du niveau sanitaire, de
l'éducation, de la sécurité alimentaire et à l’accès aux opportunités économiques. Toutes
choses qui permettront de stimuler la croissance économique. De part sa portée nationale
et son ambition de s'attaquer d’une part à la situation de pauvreté généralisée et d’autre
part à soutenir le processus de décentralisation, le PAC ne peut s’inscrire que dans le long
terme. C’est pourquoi, l'instrument APL (Adaptable Program Loan) a été choisi dans le
cadre du PAC afin de disposer d'un horizon flexible à long terme qui permet d'atteindre
l'objectif du programme.

La première phase du PAC, conduite de 2003 à 2007 poursuivait deux objectifs de
développement à savoir i) aider l’Etat du Niger à concevoir et à mettre en place des
mécanismes de financement décentralisés, participatifs et transparents permettant aux
communautés et aux collectivités territoriales de mettre en œuvre leurs propres plans de
développement et ii) promouvoir une Gestion Communautaire Intégrée des Ecosystèmes
et générer de multiples effets positifs sur l’environnement.

Cette première phase a été financée par l'Association pour le Développement International
(IDA), le Fonds pour l’Environnement Mondial (FEM) et à travers la contribution de
l’Etat et celle des populations bénéficiaires pour un montant total de 43,8 millions de
dollars US. A ce montant initial, sont venus s’ajouter deux financement complémentaires
dont un Don PHRD de 696 600 dollars US pour soutenir l’initiative de plantation d’Acacia
senegal associé à la fixation du carbone (initiative bio carbone) entamée en 2005 et un don
d’environ 4 millions de dollars US pour le financement de la composante F du projet dans
le cadre de la lutte contre la grippe aviaire. Cette composante grippe aviaire sera mise en
vigueur à partir d’août 2008.

La stratégie d’intervention a été basée sur quatre principes fondamentaux à savoir i) une
démarche participative avec des interventions non ciblées, multisectorielles émanant des
besoins exprimées par les communautés et les collectivités, iii) le renforcement des
capacités des communautés et des collectivités, fixer des priorités, planifier le
développement au niveau locale, mettre en œuvre, suivre et évaluer des microprojets et iv)
un partenariat avec diverses institutions notamment les ONG.

Le PAC appuie 178 grappes de villages et 54 communes réparties dans les huit régions du
pays. Il faut néanmoins noter que le PAC intervient de manière simultanée dans 172

                                            80
grappes localisées dans 140 communes. Le cas le plus édifiant est celui de la commune V
de Niamey où l’intervention du PAC se fait au niveau communal et dans la totalité des
cinq grappes que compte cette commune. De manière générale, la zone compte environ 5
383 143 habitants soit 48% de la population du Niger.

Au terme de quatre années d’exécution effective de ses activités, la première phase du
PAC a enregistré des résultats satisfaisants. Ces résultats sont présentés selon la logique
d’intervention qui nous indique quel a été le niveau des fonds mobilisés, pour quelles
réalisations physiques et pour quels effets observés sur les bénéficiaires. Les résultats ci-
dessous résumés sont présentés à travers cinq parties à savoir :

   -   les niveaux des effets observés les bénéficiaires;

   -   les niveaux de performance sur la base des indicateurs de performance et
       déclencheurs de phase ;

   -   les niveaux des réalisations physiques ;

   -   les niveaux de décaissement des ressources financières ;

   -   les difficultés rencontrées et leçons retenues.

Les niveaux des effets observés par les bénéficiaires au cours de la première phase.
Les investigations menées à travers le dispositif interne de suivi des résultats et plusieurs
consultations au cours de l’année 2007 ont permis de mettre en relief les principaux
résultats observés par les bénéficiaires. Quels sont ces résultats ? du PAC a été
globalement un succès. Le projet a été géré avec rigueur et compétence et a eu un impact
indéniable sur l'amélioration des conditions des communautés. L'intervention du PAC a
couvert 54 communes et 178 grappes totalisant 4400 villages pour une population totale
estimée à 5 millions d'habitants. Près de 12 milliards de FCA ont été directement gérés par les
communes et les communautés pour financer leurs microprojets utilisant les procédures de
passation de marchés communautaires. L'analyse des données de suivi-évaluation et les
études sur les effets du projet démontrent l'ampleur des résultats impressionnants que le
projet a obtenus, parmi lesquels on peut mettre en exergue les points suivants :

En matière de renforcement des compétences des acteurs communaux et la synergie
d’actions entre partenaires, il a été noté que i) 76% des élus connaissent bien
l’organisation politique et administrative actuelle du Niger, ii) 80% des élus connaissent
leurs rôles, leurs responsabilités et leurs domaines de compétence, iii) 87% des communes
ont élaboré de règlement intérieur de leurs conseils, iv) 60% des communes ont tenu les 4
sessions ordinaires en 2006, v) 65% des conseils affichent régulièrement les procès
verbaux issus des délibérations du conseil et vi) 65% des communes ont pris des actes
répartissant les tâches entre les différents agents municipaux. Au plan de l'harmonisation et
de la synergie avec les autres partenaires, le projet a établi des conventions de partenariat
avec le LUCOP de la GTZ, le PCLCP du PNUD, et la SNV qui ont permis d'amplifier les
interventions au niveau des communes des régions de Tillabéri, Zinder, Maradi et Diffa en
faisant jouer la complémentarité des financements. Ce qui est une amorce de l'approche
programme.

                                              81
En matière de gouvernance locale, il a été observé que i) le pourcentage des communes
dont les taux de recouvrement des impôts et taxes variant de 30% à 50%, qui était de 47 %
en 2005 est passé à 70% en 2006, ii) en 2006, 60% des communes ont adopté leurs
budgets sans que ces derniers ne fassent de la part du représentant de l’Etat des
observations particulières, et on procédé au recrutement du personnel clé notamment le
secrétaire général, le secrétaire municipal, iii) le receveur municipal et l’agent état civil
ont été recrutés dans plus de 50% des communes et iv) en 2006, 70% des communes ont
satisfait à l’obligation de l’établissement des comptes administratifs. Au plan de la
décentralisation, le projet a permis de renforcer les capacités des conseils communaux en
matière de planification locale, et de gestion administrative, fiscale et budgétaire. Parmi les
acquis du projet, on peut noter l'appui à l'élaboration du guide de planification communale
adopté au plan national et servant de base à l'intervention de tous les acteurs au niveau des
communes, l'amélioration du taux de recouvrement de la fiscalité locale qui a augmenté de
plus de 20% dans plus de la moitié des communes en une année. Les études et les ateliers de
réflexion financés par le présent ont abouti à l'élaboration de trois projets de loi
fondamentaux de la décentralisation qui sont actuellement introduits dans le circuit
d'approbation, à savoir : (i) le code des collectivités, (ii) la charte de la déconcentration
(iii) le fonds de péréquation et le fonds d'appui aux communes.

En matière de gestion des ressources naturelles, il est à noté que sur la base des
données collectées à travers le suivi interne des résultats intermédiaires, i) le pourcentage
de sites ayant enregistré une diminution de l’érosion hydrique par rapport à l’année
précédente est de 88 %, ii) le pourcentage de sites ayant enregistré une augmentation de la
diversité biologique (flore, faune) par rapport à l’année précédente est de 86 % et iii)
environ 7 000 ha de plantation d’Acacia senegal ont été réalisés dans le cadre de
l’initiative bio carbone en 2006 et 2007 sur 21000 ha prévue à l'horizon 2011. A cet effet,
le projet a permis de mettre en place l'une des premières opérations du Fonds BioCarbone
(BioCf) en Afrique Sub-Saharienne. Au total près de 9000 ha de terre y compris une partie
des sites Biocf ont été aménagés avec des technologies de gestion durable des terres qui ont
permis de réduire l'érosion hydrique dans 88% des sites selon les enquêtes de suivi des
résultats effectuées par le projet.

Le projet est également intervenu dans 7 sites FEM en cours de dégradation et a eu pour
premiers effets l'engagement des communautés dans la protection et la valorisation plus
rationnelle des ressources naturelles de l'écosystème et la réhabilitation de la diversité
biologique dans 86% des sites.

Enfin, le projet a appuyé la réalisation de 2 200 foyers améliorés permettant ainsi de réduire la
consommation de bois de chauffe des familles bénéficiaires d'au moins 50%, la réalisation de
330 latrines dont plus de 50% dans les établissements scolaires et 215 dépotoirs d'ordures
ménagères améliorant de manière significative le cadre de vie des populations. Sur le plan de la
sécurisation foncière, le projet a appuyé l'élaboration et l'adoption du décret portant création
de la commission foncière communale et l'installation de 11 commissions foncières. Ce qui a
permis de commencer à délivrer les actes fonciers au niveau communal et de prévenir les
conflits sociaux.

En matière d’accès aux infrastructures et opportunités socio-économiques, il faut
souligner que i) la contribution du PAC au taux de couverture en infrastructures
hydrauliques est en moyenne de 0,79 % avec un maximum de 3,18 %, ii) la contribution
                                        82
du PAC au taux d’équipement des classes du primaire et des collèges est de 10 %, iii) la
contribution du PAC au taux de couverture sanitaire (avec cases de santé) des populations
est de 2,9%, iv) la proportion de villages ayant accès à une BC et /où des stocks sont
sécurisés par un magasin est passé de 29 % en 2004 à 38 % en 2007 et v) la proportion de
villages ayant accès à une banque d’intrants agricoles et/ où des stocks sont sécurisés par
un magasin est passé de 7 % en 2004 à 57 % en 2007.

Au plan social le projet a permis de construire 322 classes primaires et secondaires
permettant ainsi : i) à près de 15000 élèves d'étudier dans de bonnes conditions et 153 centres
d'alphabétisation pour environ 6000 adultes dont 50% de femmes ; ii) de construire 8 centres
de santé intégrés, 9 cases de santé, 6 maternités, 4 dépôts pharmaceutiques ; iii) de former
163 femmes relais et matrones permettant ainsi d'améliorer l'accès physiques d'environ
300.000 personnes aux soins de santé primaire ; et iv) enfin de mettre à la disposition des
communautés 113 puits, 55 forages et 14 mini-adductions d'eau potable permettant à près de
170.000 personnes d'avoir accès à l'eau potable réduisant ainsi la corvée des femmes qui ont pu
dégager du temps pour d'autres activités. En zone pastorale, ces ouvrages permettent à une
population pastorale d’environ 56 000 personnes d’abreuver leurs animaux.

Au plan économique un millier de microprojets générateurs de revenus ont été financés dans
le domaine agro-sylvo-pastoral et de l'artisanat qui ont permis à environ 100.000 personnes
dont 80% de femmes d'améliorer leur revenu de plus de 10%. Et en tenant compte de la taille
des familles, on peut estimer qu'environ 700.000 personnes ont bénéficié de manière directe
ou indirecte des activités du projet.

Les différents résultats enregistrés démontrent que d’importants progrès sont réalisés vers
l’atteinte des objectifs du PAC au cours de la première phase. Ce constat est d’ailleurs
confirmé par le niveau de performance ci-dessous évalué sur la base d’indicateurs
préalablement définis.

Niveau de performance enregistré au cours de la première phase.
Le niveau de performance globale du PAC au cours de sa première phase d’exécution est
très satisfaisant comme l’indique les valeurs atteintes par les indicateurs de performances
et déclencheurs de phase. En effet, 16 des 18 indicateurs (89%) ont atteint les valeurs
cibles en fin de phase. Ces indicateurs revus, affinés et reformulés lors de la revue à mi-
parcours, ont fait l’objet d’un suivi tous les six mois. Au 30 juin 2007, la situation des
indicateurs de performance et déclencheurs de phase se présente comme suit:

En matière d’appui aux communautés (Composante A)
   100 % des grappes de villages ont validé leur PDL dont 70 % avec l’appui du PAC;

   82 % des PDL validés intègrent la gestion communautaire intégrée des écosystèmes en
    particulier et la gestion des ressources naturelles en général. La valeur cible de fin de
    phase est de 75 %;

   93 % des grappes de villages enquêtées sont satisfaites des interventions du PAC
    tandis que la valeur cible de fin de phase est de 80 %.

Niveaux des réalisations physiques de la première phase du PAC.

Au cours de la première phase du PAC, il y a eu la réalisation de plusieurs activités qui ont
touché pratiquement tous les secteurs de la vie socio-économique tant au niveau local que
national. Il s’agit de:

   Des formations diverses et des conseils au profit des organisations communautaires et
    des communes qui ont porté principalement sur i) la mise en place et le renforcement
    des capacités des organes de gestion, ii) l’élaboration des plans de développement et
    iii) l’accompagnement dans l’élaboration, l’approbation et la mise en œuvre des micro-
    projets issus des plans de développement (PDL et PDC) ;

   Le financement de 1546 micro-projets dont 182 de la catégorie eau et assainissement,
    302 de la catégorie éducation, 105 de la catégorie santé, 252 de la catégorie GRN et
    621 de la catégorie AGR sans oublier 78 de la catégorie infrastructures socio-
    économiques dont 34 sièges de mairie. Ce sont seulement les micro-projets de la
    catégorie transport (6) qui sont peu nombreux à cause de leur complexité et leur coût
    très élevé. La nature des micro-projets réalisée dénote le caractère multisectoriel du
    PAC;

   La conduite de plusieurs études contribuant aux réflexions nationales en matière de
    développement local et gouvernance locale. Il s’agit de l’étude sur : i) l’impact des
    technologies de gestion durable des terres (GDT), ii) la revue des dépenses du secteur
    rural, iii) l’harmonisation des schémas d’aménagement, iv) les besoins en
    renforcement des capacités des communes, v) l’étude sur la charte de la
    déconcentration, vi) le dispositif d’appui financier aux collectivités territoriales, vii) la
    décentralisation et les communautés nomades au Niger.

   La réalisation de plusieurs outils méthodologiques dont les plus importants sont i) le
    classeur de fiches techniques, ii) le guide d’élaboration des PDL et PDC, iii) le guide
    de passation de marchés sous le régime communautaire et iv) le guide méthodologique
    de conception et de mise en œuvre d’un système de suivi-évaluation local ;

   La mise en place d’un cadre de collaboration en vue d’améliorer la synergie d’action
    avec i) les services techniques dont le niveau opérationnel prévu par le montage du
    projet (niveau départemental) a été fonctionnel, ii) les partenaires du niveau national
    dont le HCME, SP/CR, DGEPD, SP-SDRP, SE-SDR, ICRISAT, FENU, TerreAfrica,
    et iii) les projets notamment avec le PLUCP, le PADL, la SNV, le LUCOP, PIP2. La
    synergie avec les autres projets financés à travers les fonds FEM n’a pas été très
    développée alors que les objectifs visés et les enjeux étaient similaires.

Sur la base des évaluations conduites en 2007, il ressort que les réalisations physiques ci-
dessus énumérées ont permis d’enregistrer au niveau des bénéficiaires plusieurs résultats
(en terme d’effets) notamment un changement significatif sur leurs conditions de travail et
de vie.
                                               85
Niveaux des réalisations financières de la première phase du PAC.

Le décaissement des fonds a été timide entre 2004 et 2005 (avant la revue à mi-parcours
de février 2006). Mais il s’est progressivement amélioré pour atteindre pratiquement les
100 % en fin 2007. En effet, les niveaux de décaissement des fonds à la date d’achèvement
(31 décembre 2007) par sources de financement, par catégorie de dépense et par
composante sont globalement satisfaisants comme l’indique les tableaux ci-dessous.
Cependant du fait de la chute de la devise de transaction (le dollars US) par rapport à la
monnaie locale (F CFA) et de l’absence d’une rubrique « non allouée », la Cellule de
Coordination Nationale a été amenée à solliciter des réallocations de fonds afin de corriger
les déséquilibre qui se présentaient tout au long de l’exécution du projet.

Par ailleurs, le calcul du taux de réalisations financières sur la base des fonds alloués n’est
valide que par rapport à la devise dans laquelle le financement est libellé. A cet le Don
IDA est libellé en DTS, le Don FEM en dollars US, le Don PHRD en dollars US et la
contribution de l’Etat du Niger et des Bénéficiaires en F CFA.

Commentaire analytique. Le niveau des réalisations financières par source de financement
a atteint le niveau souhaité sur toutes les sources de financement y compris les
contributions de l’Etat et des Bénéficiaires (communautés et communes). Il faut noté que
les contributions de l’Etat et des Bénéficiaires est respectivement faite en grande partie
sous forme de taxes exonérées et de contribution en nature. Les niveaux de réalisation sont
d’environ 100 % pour les fonds extérieurs et de plus de 95 % pour les contributions
internes. La mobilisation du fond PHRD a démarré en mars 2007 pour soutenir l’initiative
bio-carbonne du PAC qui fait l’objet d’un projet soumis au Secrétariat Exécutif du
Mécanisme de Développement Propre (MDP).

Commentaire analytique. Les réalisations financières varient en fonction des catégories de
dépenses. De manière globale, les proportions de départ par rapport au fonds alloués ont
été respectés car les catégories 5 (investissements au profit des communautés) et 6
(fonctionnement) ont mobilisé respectivement 55 % et 16 % des fonds globalement
mobilisés.

Commentaire analytique. Les réalisations financières par composante sont conformes aux
proportions de départ excepté au niveau de la composante E « Gestion du projet ». Cette
situation s’explique essentiellement par la faiblesse du système d’imputation comptable
qui ne désagrège pas les dépenses communes par activité et par composante. Ainsi toutes
les dépenses relatives à l’acquisition des biens et services communs sont imputées dans la
composante gestion du projet alors qu’ils devraient être ventilés dans les autres
composantes également.

Commentaire analytique : Les réalisations financières sont conformes au poids de chaque
région en terme du nombre de grappes et communes appuyées ainsi que de l’étendue de la
zone d’intervention couverte excepté la région de Tillabéry où la planification
opérationnelle n’a été bien maîtrisée. Au niveau de la CCN, toutes les dépenses
d’équipement et de fonctionnement dont le processus d’acquisition a été piloté par la CCN
ont été imputées à ce niveau alors que les imputations doivent concernées les zones
d’utilisation des biens et services.

Principales difficultés rencontrées au cours de la première phase et
recommandations pour la mise en œuvre de la deuxième phase de financement du
PAC.

Pendant les quatre années d’exécution du projet, il y a eu des difficultés dont certaines ont
pu être résolues. Ces difficultés ou insuffisances dont il faut tenir compte au cours de la
deuxième phase sont :

   le niveau jugé élevé de la contribution demandée aux bénéficiaires notamment des
    groupes vulnérables (les femmes, les jeunes et les handicapés) pour accéder aux
    micro-projets générateurs de revenus ;

   la faible capacité financière de certains entrepreneurs qui ont le plus souvent arrêté les
    travaux dès que le paiement des décomptes accuse un retard alors que les contrats ne
    prévoyaient que l’avance de démarrage. Ce qui a entraîné parfois un retard important
    dans l’exécution des travaux ;

   la faible prise en compte des mesures de sauvegarde environnementale et sociale, qui
    est liée à une incompréhension des enjeux en termes d’impacts environnementaux et
    sociaux négatifs par l’ensemble des acteurs impliqués dans l’exécution du projet même
    si tout au long de la mise en œuvre du PAC, des améliorations remarquables ont été
    apportées dans l’élaboration des dossiers de MP par rapport à la présentation des
    activités sources d’impact, des impacts potentiels et des mesures d’atténuation;
                                             88
   le non respect de la planification opérationnelle particulièrement dans certaines régions.
    Ce qui a entraîné parfois un engorgement du flux financier ;

   le manque de régularité dans le suivi budgétaire et le contrôle interne. Ce qui est en
    déphasage avec l’envergure d’un projet comme le PAC, où toute négligence peut
    entraîner des dépassements budgétaires, des tensions de trésorerie et des retards
    importants dans l’acheminement des fonds sur le terrain pour la réalisation des
    activités régulièrement approuvées à travers les plans de travail.

Synthèse du RAPPORT INTERNE D’ACHEVEMENT DE COMPOSANTE GRIPPE
AVIAIRE DU PROGRAMME D’ACTIONS COMMUNAUTAIRES PHASE1 (Période
de 2008-2010)

Résumé

Suite aux flambées de l’influenza aviaire hautement pathogène (IAHP) en 2006 dont le Niger
a connu deux (2) foyers à Magaria et Boko Mai Gao, le Gouvernement de la république du
Niger a sollicité et obtenu de l’Agence Internationale pour le Développement (AID) un don de
deux million neuf cents mille droits de tirage spéciaux (2.900 ;000 DTS) en février 2008 dans
le but d’appuyer le dispositif national de lutte contre cette maladie.

Exécuté en 2008 et 2010, ce financement a permis le renforcement des capacités de
prévention et de riposte des services vétérinaires, de l’environnement, de la santé humaine et d
e communication à travers la formation des 697 agents , la fourniture d’équipement et de
consommables, la réhabilitation de deux laboratoires vétérinaires et de 3 salles d’isolement
des malades humains dans les hôpitaux régionaux de la zone à risque. En matière de
communication, 437 acteurs de la fières avicoles ont été formés et sensibilisés sur les mesures
préventives contre l’IAHP et la biosécurité. De même que 34 150 petits producteurs à travers
les missions de surveillance active.

En absence de tout foyer de l’IAHP au cours de la mise en œuvre du projet, deux(2) foyers de
la grippe AH1N1 ont été détectés rapidement en février 2010 à Niamey et Gaya. Ces deux
foyers ont été éradiqués avec succès, tous les malades ont été traités guéris sans aucun décès.

Sur le plan financier, 1 988 408 528 FCFA ont été dépensés pour une prévision de 2 151
894 597 FCFA, soit un taux d’exécution de 92 % au 31 décembre 2010.

Le succès de mise en œuvre du projet, a ouvert l’opportunité aux participants de l’atelier de
clôture du projet en décembre 2010 à Maradi et du Comité de Pilotage en décembre 2010 de
recommander la consolidation des nombreux acquis et la mise en œuvre effective du nouveau
concept « un monde, une santé » dont le projet a déjà démontré la voie; à travers un
programme élargi aux autres zoonoses majeures i.e. tuberculoses, brucelloses la rage etc. et
d’entrevoir les voies et moyens d’utilisation du reliquat des fonds du projet.

Bilan Financier :

La réalisation financière cumulée de la composante est de 1 988 408 528FCFA pour une
prévision de 2 151 894 597 FCFA dont 197 647 276 FCFA d’engagement soit des taux
cumulés respectifs de 92% pour la réalisation et 83% pour le décaissement.

Le taux de réalisation ramené au montant initial du projet de 2.025.000.000 FCFA serait
de 98%. La plus-value du montant initial du projet d‘environ 126 894 597 F CFA provient
de la dépréciation l’Euro (monnaie à laquelle le franc CFA est arrimé) par rapport au DTS.

Mais même dans ces conditions, le solde positif du projet d’un montant 163 486 070
FCFA est dû à certaines activités non exécutées dont les indemnisations en absence de
maladie, l’échec d’achat du lyophilisateur pour le LABOCEL d’abord et la réalisation en
partie de sa réhabilitation (Expertise diagnostique), et de certaines activités de la
convention PGES avec le BEEI.

Si ces résultats ont pu être obtenus, c’est grâce à la bonne collaboration des différents
acteurs, tant au niveau de la Banque qu’au niveau de la Partie Gouvernementale.



                                             95
Les principales contraintes rencontrées ont trait aux préparatifs du démarrage du Projet, la
lourdeur dans la passation de marché et la difficulté de mobiliser certains acteurs des
services à temps opportun.

En conclusion, l’approche intégrée adoptée dans la mise en œuvre du projet a convaincu
les participants à l’atelier de coordination et de clôture du projet, que nous sommes déjà
avancés dans la mise en œuvre effective de la nouvelle approche « One World- One
Health » ou « Un monde, une santé », et qu’il y a lieu de consolider les acquis et d’étendre
le champ d’intervention à d’autres zoonoses majeures (tuberculoses, rage, brucellose …)
dans le cadre d’un nouveau programme de plus grande envergure.

4. Difficultés Rencontrées

En terme de principales difficultés rencontrées, il faut noter que :


   Dans les préparatifs, il y a eu retard dans la mise en vigueur du Don, l’accord étant
    signé le 12 février 2008, elle n’a intervenu qu’au 21 juillet 2008, ceci tient beaucoup à
    la non maitrise du circuit administratif par la coordination du Projet,

   La passation de marché a également été laborieuse. En effet, la conciliation procédures
    nationales et celles de la Banque n’a pas été facile surtout en absence d’un spécialiste
    de passation de marchés propre au Projet,

   Par fois, la mobilisation de certains responsables d’unité pose des problèmes compte
    tenu de leurs nombreuses tâches. En effet, le fait que des Directeurs Centraux soient
    des Responsables d’Unités a quelque peu entravé la bonne marche du projet car il leur
    est difficile de concilier les sollicitations du projet et leurs tâches classiques ;

   L’insuffisance dans la maîtrise des procédures de la Banque par la plus part des acteurs
    de la mise en œuvre du projet au début du Projet a conduit à des lenteurs dans
    l’approbation de certains documents tant à l’interne qu’au niveau de la Banque ;

   Sur le terrain certains comités régionaux nés dans la crise de 2006 n’ont pas pu bien
    fonctionner parce que pléthoriques. Il a fallu un recours à la mise en place de cellules
    techniques restreintes;

   Le suivi du niveau central n’a pas été régulier;

   Certaines activités de la convention avec le BEEEI comme le Bilan environnemental
    n’ont pas pu être exécutées faute de temps;
   L’aspect avifaune et environnement a été dilué entre la sous composante santé animale
    et la sous composante suivi et évaluation ;

   L’achat d’un lyophilisateur neuf pour le LABOCEL (non prévu dans les objectifs
    initiaux du projet, accepté par la Banque à la demande l’Etat) n’a pu s’exécuter pour
    des raisons de marché infructueux, lié au temps court et à l’insuffisance de ressources
    prévues ;


                                              96
   Le projet n’a pu faire aboutir une étude de réhabilitation de l’aviculture dans les zones
    d’anciens foyers de grippe aviaire de 2006 de Magaria et de Boko Mai Gao.

5. Performances du Projet, Gouvernement et de la Banque

CCN/PAC2 :
L’arrimage du projet au PAC1 a été très bénéfique compte tenu du manque d’expérience
de la Cellule Permanente dans les procédures de la Banque. L’appui conseil du personnel
du PAC2 a été déterminant dans la mise en œuvre du Projet, sans oublier la mise à la
disposition au projet de 2 bureaux et d’un véhicule 4X4 pour unité de gestion ;

Banque Mondiale :

La coopération de la Banque : i) l’’appui conseil du chargé et de l’équipe de la Banque a
été aussi déterminant, il y eu des formations au siège de la banque à Niamey pour
familiariser les équipes des projets aux différentes procédures de la Banque et ceci a
beaucoup à palier aux insuffisances ci-dessus mentionnées, ii) la mission conjointe de
supervision a permis d’évaluer les progrès accomplis et de réorienter certaines activités
pour satisfaire de nouveaux besoins, iii) le rétablissement rapide des décaissement par la
Banque suite l’application de sa Politique opérationnelle 7.30, en relation avec
l’évènement du 18 février 2010, iv) l’acceptation de la prorogation de la date de clôture du
projet au 31 décembre 2010 au lieu de 30 juin 2010.

Performance du Gouvernement (Ministère de Tutelle) :

Le soutien du Ministère de tutelle et son ’implication dans la mise en œuvre du projet ont
permis de résoudre certaines difficultés, notamment dans le processus de passation de
marché et dans les rapports avec les autres ministères bénéficiaires du projet. Le Ministère
a dirigé deux sessions de Comité de Pilotage du Projet.

De même les structures du Ministère de l’Economie et des Finances se sont acquitté
honorablement leur part de responsabilités notamment, le traitement de DRF, la
facilitation de la prorogation de la date de clôture du projet et la participation à la mission
de supervision et réunion du Comité de Pilotage.

Performance de l’Unité de gestion du projet :


    L’Unité de gestion du projet (réduite à 3 personnes après le départ du responsable de
    suivi évaluation à la mi-année 2010), a été très performante eu égards aux nombreuses
    activités réalisées. Tous les rapports techniques et financiers ont été faits à temps, à la
    satisfaction du bailleur et des autres partenaires.

   En matière de passation de marché malgré un handicap d’expérience au début du
    projet, tous les marchés se sont bien passés. Une seule plainte a été enregistrée sur le
    marché des Réhabilitation, mais déboutée par l’Agence nigérienne de Régulation des
    Marchés Publics.


                                              97
    Le Projet a entretenu des rapports avec les autres partenaires au développement
    (SPINAP-AHI, OMS, FAO, UNICEF) à la mise en œuvre conjointe d’activités ou des
    réunions d’échanges.

    En fin en matière de la mise en œuvre de démarche d’approche programme, le projet a
    démontré qu’il est possible, qu’avec une équipe légère, qu’on puisse réaliser tant
    d’activités par les services classiques de l’Etat.

6. Leçons apprises :

Malgré les quelques contraintes rencontrées dans la mise en œuvre, les principaux acteurs du
projet présents à l’atelier de coordination et de clôture les 27, 28 et 29 décembre 2010 à
Maradi ont été unanimes sur les résultats atteints par le projet :


   Le fait d’avoir fait travailler de façon intégrée plusieurs départements ministériels a été
    un fait marquant pour ce projet ;

   La mise en place d’un réseau de surveillance intégré ;

   Les différentes acquisitions en termes de logistiques, matériel de froid, matériel
    informatiques et électroniques, équipement techniques, consommables ont servent non
    seulement la lutte l’IAHP mais aussi serviront à beaucoup d’autres maladies ;

   L’amélioration des infrastructures sanitaire, les salles d’isolement normalisées et les
    laboratoires vétérinaires réhabilités sont des atouts indéniables ;

   La Mise en place d’un système de communication adapté à la situation
    épidémiologique de la maladie, la flotte de communication a été très appréciée par les
    services bénéficiaires et les formations sensibilisations des professionnels de la filière
    avicole ont permis un éveil de conscience par rapport à la maladie, un changement de
    comportement notamment la prise en compte de la biosécurité dans leurs activités ;

   Le projet a prouvé qu’on peut travailler en synergie d’intervention avec d’autres
    partenaires poursuivant les mêmes buts comme le SPINAP-AHI financé par l’Union
    Européenne, pour éviter les duplications.

   L’avènement de la grippe AH1N1 en février 2010 a aussi montré l’efficacité du
    dispositif (non encore éprouvé jusqu’à lors en matière de santé publique) aux cas
    humains, limitant le nombre de cas confirmés à une cinquantaine ; tous les malades
    étant guéris, sans aucun décès ;

   La tentative de règlement du problème du lyophilisateur du LABOCEL a permis à
    travers l’expertise diagnostique de mieux connaître le problème et a aussi suscité la
    programmation de l’achat d’un neuf dans un autre projet ;

   Le projet a jeté les bases d’un programme plus élargi, avec des besoins quantifiés de 4
    composantes sur 5, lors de l’atelier de Maradi.
