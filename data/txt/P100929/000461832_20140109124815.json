All three project\n            development outcome indicators were achieved, as were the\n            seven intermediate outcome indicators. Significant lessons\n            learned during project implementation include: 1) more\n            resolute, up-front action could have been taken to counter\n            the political interference which led to mis-procurement; 2)\n            relatively modest investment funding can be used to leverage\n            other external resources with a programmatic approach; 3)\n            coordination with development agencies can make operations\n            more efficient and have a greater development impact; 4) the\n            Bank can differentiate itself from other development\n            agencies through its expertise on institutional and policy\n            reform; and 5) project outcome indicators should be limited\n            in time and scope, and should measure results which can be\n            influenced by the Bank."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
