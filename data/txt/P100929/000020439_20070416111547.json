This will be\n            achieved by two components: the first is the road network\n            recovery component which will rehabilitate about 400 lane-km\n            of main roads (equivalent to about 160 to 200 km of main\n            roads) and thereby reducing road user costs in the short\n            term. The second component is the institutional\n            strengthening component which will improve the capacity of\n            the State Road Administration to manage effectively the road\n            network under its responsibility, and to carry out road\n            maintenance, rehabilitation, and investment programs in an\n            efficient and transparent manner. This should lead to a\n            reduction of road user costs in the longer term."}, "docdt": "2007-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
