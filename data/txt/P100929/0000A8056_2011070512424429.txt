                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last ISR for this project. The IDA credit closing date is June 30, 2011.

                         Through this project, the World Bank has been able to support the Government of Moldova in (i) putting together a coherent Road Sector Program, including a Road Sector Strategy
                         and a prioritized Road Sector Investment plan, (ii) defining and implementing the necessary road sector reforms and the implementation arrangements for externally funded road
                         projects, and (iii) bringing in several other external partners into the Road Sector Program (EBRD, EIB, MCC and EC) who are now funding most of the cost of the Program. The total
                         amount of external funding that was mobilized as a direct result of the World Bank involvement is of US$ 495 million, while the actual World Bank (IDA) funding was only US$ 5
                         million.
