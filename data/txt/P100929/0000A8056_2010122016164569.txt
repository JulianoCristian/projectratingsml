                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its final stage of implementation. There are several consultant contracts still ongoing with IDA funding; these are related to road sector reform issues and to the
                         preparation of a pipeline of new road projects for future funding by various external partners. Through this project, the World Bank has been able to support the Government in (i)
                         putting together a coherent Road Sector Program, including a Road Sector Strategy and a prioritized Road Sector Investment plan, (ii) defining and implementing the necessary road
                         sector reforms and (iii) bringing in several other external partners into the Road Sector Program (EBRD, EIB, MCC and EC) who are now funding most of the cost of the Program.
                         While the overall Road Sector Program continues, the IDA-funded Road Sector Program Support Project will close on June 30, 2011.
