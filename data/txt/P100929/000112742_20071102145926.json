impacts. Most environmental impacts will be temporary and\n            local, mostly during the construction phase, and will cause\n            only minor, localized, and short-term negative effects. Most\n            of them will be mainly linked with light rehabilitation\n            works such as leveling, grading, potholes patching, cracks\n            priming, surfacing, quarrying, use of hazardous materials,\n            such as combustive-lubricating ones, bitumen, etc., traffic\n            of construction vehicles/hauling of road-building materials,\n            construction materials stockpiling and use of waste\n            disposals. These impacts are common in road rehabilitation\n            works and can be mitigated with existing management\n            techniques. After completion, the project will have positive\n            indirect impacts on human health and safety through\n            decreased number of accidents, reduced air pollution from\n            more stable travel speeds on rehabilitated road sections,\n            cleaning up of solid waste from roadside drains; and reduced\n            water pollution resulting from rehabilitated drainage\n            systems. After completion, the project will have positive\n            indirect impacts on human welfare, safety, health and\n            socio-economic environment through reduced vehicles\n            operating cost, decreased number of accidents; reduced air\n            pollution resulted from vehicles emissions on rehabilitated\n            road sections; cleaning up of roadside drains; reduced risk\n            of soil pollution and erosion, and  water pollution\n            resulting from rehabilitation of drainage system, reduced\n            risk of landslides due to slope stabilization, better access\n            to settlements and markets, and development of new business opportunities."}, "docdt": "2007-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
