of education through\n            curriculum development, in-service teacher training and\n            production of teaching materials. It would promote basic\n            education and skill training through programs of non-formal\n            education and assist in meeting identified needs of\n            specialized manpower in the fields of animal husbandry,\n            forestry, supportive health services and trade testing. The\n            project faces no special risks, although realization of\n            expected benefits will depend on sufficient testing of the\n            materials to be developed under the revised curricula, and\n            the Regional Adult Education and Training Centers may\n            encounter some difficulties due to lack of sufficiently\n            experienced administrators of non-formal education at the\n            regional level."}, "docdt": "1977-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
