Maternal-Child Health\n            Investment Project for Argentina were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the program\n            has created incentives that encouraged each level of the\n            health care system to take steps to improve coverage,\n            quality, and results. The degree to which provincial project\n            executing units (PEUs) have been incorporated within\n            provincial bureaucracies depends on whether provincial\n            health authorities see the plan as a national program or an\n            instrument to conduct their own health policies. Monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) instruments cannot be incidental,\n            particularly with projects that have output-based\n            disbursements. The project required intense policy dialog\n            and technical supervision by the Bank, throughout\n            implementation. The possibility of reviewing and adjusting\n            the enrollment and tracer's goals annually allowed the\n            project to set the right incentives to meet the targets\n            considering the real institutional capacities of different\n            provinces. As the flexible approach also envisioned changes\n            in the benefit package, the Government of Argentina (GOA)\n            was able to include new health interventions to cover the\n            needs that arose from changes in health conditions of the\n            target population. The plan provides the opportunity to\n            develop management tools at the national level that can be\n            applied in the provinces to support the program's\n            implementation, thus capitalizing on potential economies of\n            scale and easing the institutional burden on provinces that\n            use them. As the plan continues, it will be crucial to\n            develop a sound institutional framework for these databases,\n            minimizing the risk of illegitimate uses of the information."}, "docdt": "2011-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
