borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Provincial Maternal-Child\n            Health Sector Investment Project for Argentina were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory.

Some lessons learned\n            included:  An important finding from this three-project\n            assessment is the comprehensive and innovative approach used\n            by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            (IBRD) to support existing government health reform\n            programs. Reforms included institution building, legal\n            changes, reorganization of the care process, training of\n            medical and administrative staff, modification of financial\n            incentive framework, data collection and analysis, audits of\n            performance data, and regular feed-back of results to\n            government units and providers. Both countries aimed to\n            improve health outcomes and system performance with the\n            reforms. While the peer-reviewed literature identified\n            various factors that have contributed to decreasing infant\n            mortality rates in addition to improved access to family\n            medicine; both countries made substantial progress in\n            advancing the health reforms. Modifying the incentive\n            framework required upfront investment in data collection and\n            analysis. In both countries IBRD disbursed earmarked health\n            funds tied to tangible results to the government to target\n            existing health reform programs. The central governments\n            applied the same approach to transfer additional health\n            funds tied to performance targets to the local governments."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
