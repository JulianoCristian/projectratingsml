The first Adaptable\n            Program Lending (APL) would cover the nine poorest provinces\n            of the NOA and NEA. By the end of loan implementation of\n            APLl (5th project year), 80 percent of the targeted\n            population would be covered and served by the Maternal and\n            Child Health Insurance Program (MCHIP) (more than 600,000\n            beneficiaries). Lastly, the project would contribute to\n            improving the national-provincial health policy dialogue and\n            policy integration, reducing the extreme policy\n            fragmentation that characterizes Argentina's health\n            sector in the last 30 years. Achieving all 3 objectives\n            above would allow the national-provincial policy dialogue to\n            shift away from focusing on inputs and center on output and\n            increasingly on outcomes.  This Indigenous Peoples Plan\n            (IPP) consists of three parts: Social evaluation;\n            consultation process; and Matrix shares with Indigenous\n            Peoples Plan which is the schedule of activities and\n            specific actions to be carried out in the period indicated\n            for consensual with indigenous communities during the\n            consultation and aims to bring together and strengthen the\n            inclusion of indigenous communities to the project. This\n            project has macroeconomic risks associated with Argentina\u0092s\n            economic fragility, and the inherent political risks of\n            fiscal and institutional reform governing\n            national-provincial relationships. Additional implementation\n            risks have been recognized, specific to the investment\n            program, and have been taken into account in its design.\n            These relate principally to the weak institutional capacity\n            of provincial health ministries."}, "docdt": "2010-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
