INTEZFATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEOPM4ENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO DE LA REPUELICA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOIMBIA
FOR A
FOURTH DEVELOPPIENT FINANCE COITANIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$40 million
to Banco de la Republica (BR), the central bank of Colombia, the proceeds
of which are to be made available to five Colombian private development
finance companies (Financieras). The loan would be guaranteed by the
Republic of Colombia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The five Financieras are the same companies that are parti-
cipating in Loans 451 CO, 534 CO and 625 CO, which were made in May
1966, Hay 1968 and June 1969. The two larger and older of the five,
Corporacion Financiera Colombiana (Colombiana) and Corporacion Finan-
ciera Nacional (Nacional), were established in 1959 in Bogota and
Medellin, respectively. The three others, Corporacion Financiera de
Caldas (Caldas), Corporacion Financiera del Valle (Valle) and Corporacion
Financiera del Norte (Norte) were established in Manizales in 1961,
in Cali in 1961 and in Barranquilla in 1963, respectively. IFC has
invested in each of these companies as follows: a US$2 million convertible
loan to Nacional made in 1961 and converted into common stock during
1961-63, a US$2 million convertible loan to Colombiana made in 1961
and converted into common stock during 1961-62, a US$700,000 equity
investment in Caldas made in 1964, and equity investments of US$430,000
each in Valle and Norte made in 1969.
3.        Private industry in Colombia suffered for many years from a
lack of sources of medium and long-term finance. To help alleviate
this situation, the Bank supported the creation of a Private Investment
Fund (PIF) in 1°63 within BR, which wzas conceived as a means of inducing



- 2 -
a substantial flow of external credit for medium and long-term
financing of productive investments in industry.   To the same end, 
the Government has revived the Instituto de Fomento Industrial
(IFI), a publicly-owned development finance company which was vir-
tually inactive until 1968 and for which the Bank is considering a         A
possible loan.) PIF attracted support from members of the Consul-,        /   9
tative Group f6r Colombia, mainly the United States, Germany, Holland
and the Inter-American Development Bank. In May 1966 the Bank in
turn participated in this effort by making a loan of US$25 million
(Loan 451 00) to BR, to be relent to the five Financieras and to be
used by them to finance the direct foreign exchange costs of produc-
tive investment projects in the private sector. The loan was committed
in about 18 months. A second loan, of US$12.5 million, made in May
1968 (Loan 534 00) and a third loan, of US$25 million (Loan 625 CD),
made in June 1969 for the same purpose were each utilized ahead of
schedule, with the third loan being largely committed fourteen months
after the signing of the Loan Agreement. ,
4.        As a result of the unexpected rapidity with which the third
loan was committed, most of the Financieras have a substantial number
of projects awaiting financing, and in order to eliminate this back-
log, and to assure the continued availability of this type of financing,
the Government and BR have asked the Bank to make a fourth loan on a
basis similar to the first three loans. During Lppaisal,_the-Government
and _BRrequested the_Bank to_consider_includirg. within. the-proposed-L-oan
the eight,additional..Financieras,-which_are now operating in Colombia.
The Colombia_parties~ wereIadvised                 howe      .,tLat _itIwa --tpos_sible to
include-the-add-i-tiona-l-F-inancieras-with-out--si-gni-f-icantl.y-delayin-g_the

consider-giving- access- to. future Bank oans toTn-e Financieras-if sgitable
arrangements.-could_be.worked out and.- that-the Bank-was-prepared--to-send a
mission to Colombia within the next few months to begin discussions to
th'is-end.---Under--the existing -arran-gement,~ the BR serves as as an inter-
mediary, but the Bank maintains direct relationships with the five
Financieras.   The Colombian parties were told that, while the Bank felt that
this direct relationship had contributed to the instt.utional-de-velop-
men.t_Qf_the_Financie-ras, th`eadmi-rnative burden of maintaining similar
relationships with additional Financieras would be too great.   If-additional
Financieras were to have access to Bank funds, therefore, new arrangements
would haive 6to be d,6F 
wo     er   n ot_.a ermediar-,,but-as-pr-1ncipalboxoger      The Bank would
have to be assured, not only that such agency was cragilyathy, but also
that ituwaszapablj of appraisin3g Fnancieras and their investment proposals
in accordance with Bank standards and of super.ising-the-.work_of._the
pai1- clpating F:nancie4^m,  The Government and BR have accepted in
piincl-ple the proposed new approach for future lending for Financieras.

5.        A mission to Colombia appraised the proposed loan during
September 27-November 7, 1970, and negotiations were held in Washington
from March 29 to April 2, 1971. The Government was represented by
Dr. Douglas Botero (Ambassador in Washington) and Dr. Eduardo Gaitan
(Minister Plenipotentiary in Washington), the National Planning Depart-
ment by Dr. Luis Rosas (Deputy Director), and BR by Dr. Oscar Alviar
Ramirez (Deputy M'danager) and Dr. Benllini Galindo (Director, Private
Investment Fund). The Financieras were represented by Dr. Eduardo Arango
(President, Caldas) Dr. Ignacio Copete (President, Colombiana), Dr. Jose
Gutierrez Gomez (President, Iacional), Dr. Alvaro Jaramillo (President,
Norte) and Dr. Benjamin Martinez (President, Valle).
6.        The proposed loan is being presented simultaneously with
proposed loansof US$88 million for the Second Bogota WCater Supply Project
and of US$2 million for the Palmira W4ater Supply and Sewerage Project.
Counting these two loans, the proposed loan would be the forty-eighth
made to Colombia It would increase the total amount of Bank loans to
Colombia to US$871.8 million (net of cancellations), of which US$572.4
million is now held by the Bank. IDA has made onecredit of US$19.5
million for highways in Colombia.   A summary statement of Bank loans
and IDA credits to Colombia and their status of disbursements as of
March 31, 1971 was included in my Report and Recommendation on the
proposed loan for the Caqueta Land Colonization Project (P-921), dated
April 21, 1971.
7.        In the next few weeks I expect to present to the EXecutive
Directors for approval a loan of US$5 million to the Republic of
Colombia. for use by the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) for the
Second Atlantico Development Project.
8.        IFC has made 35 investments and underwriting commitments in
18 enterprises in Colombia, totalling US$18.5 million (net of cancellations),
of which IFC now holds US$11.3 million.

PART III - THE PROJECT (t                             P9
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Five Dev    ment
Finance Companies in Colombia" (DB-77a) on the project is attached.
11.       While manufacturing industry's percentage contribution to
Gross Domestic Product in 1968 was almost the same as in 1958, increasing
from only 16.2 percent to 16.8 percent, it has since increased more
rapidly than the overall rate of economic grouath. GDP growth was 6.5
percent in 1969 and approximately 7.0 percent in 1970, while



manufacturing industry grew by an estimated 8.8 percent and 9.4 percent
respectively during the same years. The five Financieras and IFI are
industry's most important sources of medium and long-term loan financing
as well as of equity financing. Since a high percentage of IFI's
financing is channelled to Government-controlled industrial and mining
enterprises, the five Financieras remain the principal suppliers of
medium and long-term finance for private industry.    By December 31,
1970, the aggregate value of the portfolios of these Financieras had
risen to Col.$2.86 billion (from Col.$2.36 billion a year earlier)
and their equity portfolios to Col.$458 million (from Col.$398 million
a year earlier).
12.       The Bank has been the main source of fresh long-term funds
for the Financieras in the past few years. Other important sources
of funds for the Financieras have been their equity, credit lines and
rediscounting facilities from the BR and credit lines with foreign
commercial banks.
13.       Except for the special case of Caldas (discussed below),
the performance of the Financieras has been satisfactory. Portfolios
are generally sound, operations have been reasonably profitable, loans
are well secured by collateral, arrears are small and the Financieras
are headed by active and experienced boards of directors and presidents.
Appraisal and follow-up techniques have impiroved, but should be further
strengthened, and special attention would continue to be paid to these
matters during Bank supervision. One aspect of appraisal which is in
particular need of greater attention is the economic analysis of invest-
ment projects, and the Financieras agreed during negotiations to give
increased emphasis to this analysis. They undertook to prepare a
calculation of the effective rate of protection in case of projects
requiring at least US$250,000 of Bank funds. Colombiana, Nacional,
liorte and Valle are creditworthy, with strong equity positions and
good business prospects that justify the expectation of substantial
increases in earnings. They are suitable recipients of the proposed
Bank loan and should be in a position to service the loan without
difficulty.   Additional data on each of the Financieras is contained
in Annex I.
l1.       In October 1970, it became apparent that Caldas was facing a
liquidity crisis and the possibility of serious portfolio losses for the
reasons described in the Appraisal Report. A new president took
office in early November, and after consultations with the Bank, Caldas
and the BR requested the Bank to suspend consideration of pending
applications for sub-project approvals and disbursements under the
existing loans, and advised the Bank that no further applications
would be submitted until Caldast situation woas clarified and a plan of
remedial action approved. A reviewr of Caldast situation has since been



carried out by a consultant on behalf of the Bank, working in co-
ordination with Caldas' auditors and another consultant employed
by Caldas. Following issuance of the consultants' reports, a number
of actions vere taken by the dynamic new president.   As a result,
Caldas has already overcome the immediate liquidity problem and
started on the way to recovery. It has received a five-year loan of
US$4 million out of coffee compensation balances held by BR. Caldas
has arranged to convert this loan into cash at a 13.5 percent dis-
count, and BR has agreed to assume the exchange risk on the loan. Caldast
two main shareholders, Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros and Banco
Cafetero,have stated their intention to subscribe Col.$10 million
each (totalling about US$1 million equivalent) to Caldas' share capital.
Administrative expenses have already been reduced significantly, its
office in Bogota has been closed down, promotion of new enterprises
has been suspended for the time being, and changes have been made in
the size and make-up of the Board to make it a more effective body.
(l,1r. Luis I'Machado was elected a Board member representing IFC in
February 1971.)   The Financiera has also started a program to sell
some of its equity investments. Based on the substantial improvement
in Caldas' situation, disbursements and commitments totalling aboutV
US$100,000 have been approved in recent iweeks under existing Bank
loans. While Caldas cannot yet be considered in a condition where
receipt of Bank funds under a new loan would be justified, the Bank's
continued support will be crucial to its recovery. Under these cir-
cumstances, funds from the proposed loan would be allocated t6 Caldas
on the basis described in the following paragraph, but Caldas wjould
not be eligible to draw on any portion gf these funds until a special
review of Caldas' situation, to be undertaken not earlier than July 1,
1971, establishes to the Bank's satisfaction that Caldas' credit-
worthiness for substantial additional funds has been restored.
15.       One-halfl-of the US$40 million Loan would initially be allocated
equally among the Financieras. The unallocated balance would be available
for projects of Financieras to the extent that they had exhausted their
fixed allocations and for joint projects of three or more Financieras.
It w¢as also agreed that the balances of the allocated amounts hich
were unutilized at June 30, 1972 wjould be added to the unallocated
portion of the loan, at which time the entire unused balance of the loan
would be available on afirst-come-first-served basis for individual
or joint projects of the Financieras.    The limit for projects not
requiring prior Bank approval would be US$250,000 equivalent for each
Financiera,  qecept that all Caldas projects would require prior Bank
approval.  Not mo e-th-anU-S$4-miivon-equivalent--of the-costs-of-a
single project, whether financed by one or more Financieras, lwould be
financed under the Loan unless the project had a high economic priority
and no alternative pource of financing was available.

investment projects that the BR determines, after taking
into account the economic policies of the Guarantor,
will not make a significant contribution to the economic
development of Colombia;

BR and Caldas sets forth the specific conditions of
effectiveness applicable in the case of that Financiera.
