Re: Irrigation Based Community Development Project 
 
(Loan No. 4607-MOR)  Amendment to the Loan Agreement 
 
Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Loan Agreement relating to Irrigation Based Community Development 
Project between the Kingdom of Morocco (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated April 12, 2002 (the Loan Agreement).  
 
We are pleased to inform you that in order to comply with Bank’s policy which limits the 
period of eligibility for retroactive financing to one year prior to signature, the Bank has amended 
the Loan Agreement as follows,: 
 
Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 is amended to read as follows: 
 
“Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals shall be made in 
respect of payments made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, except that 
withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not exceeding Y380,000,000, may be made in respect of 
Categories (1), (2), and (3) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule on account of 
payments made for expenditures before that date but after April 12, 2001.” 
 
Please confirm your official agreement to the foregoing, as the Borrower’s authorized 
representative under the Agreement, by signing the form of confirmation set forth below, 
returning to us one fully executed original of this Amendment Letter, and retaining one original 
for the Kingdom of Morocco’s official records. 
 
Except as specifically amended by this Amendment Letter, all provisions of the Loan 
Agreement remain in full force and effect.
