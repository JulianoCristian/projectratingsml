          the incomes and quality of life of rural communities\n            centered on small and medium irrigation (SMI) in 15\n            provinces over a 13-year period, primarily through\n            demand-driven, coordinated investments in SMI rehabilitation\n            and improvement and complementary community infrastructure,\n            including rural roads, water supply/sanitation,\n            electrification, health, and education facilities. The\n            first-phased project consists of the following components:\n            The first component supports rehabilitation of SMI serving\n            an area of approximately 9,450 hectares (ha), of which 3,450\n            ha in Azilal and an estimated 3,000 ha each in Khenifra and\n            Al Haouz. The second component will support complementary\n            community infrastructure not covered by ongoing sectoral\n            programs. The third component will support institutional\n            strengthening through a training and technical assistance\n            program for agricultural development activities to intensify\n            production practices and thereby increase farmers'\n            income. The last component will support the preparation of\n            the next phase of the project through participatory,\n            integrated programming of the IBCD activities in six\n            additional provinces to be selected."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
