satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory.  Some lessons learned included: the\n            project demonstrated that participatory community-based\n            planning and integrated local level investment programming\n            anchored in Small and Medium Scale Irrigation (SMI) are\n            feasible in rural areas of Morocco and add value in terms\n            both of appropriation by the beneficiaries and of\n            development impact. In fact, SMI proved the optimal entry\n            point for integrated development in mountain areas as all\n            social and economic life in these zones is organized around\n            the irrigation perimeter. The project also demonstrated that\n            Government agencies are both able and willing to implement\n            this approach, and that fiscal decentralization, the Rural\n            Development Fund (FDR) under the management of the Governor,\n            aids the approach. The lesson is that the IBCD model is an\n            effective mechanism for reducing rural poverty and the\n            project model is ready, subject to some adjustments, to be\n            extended to other areas and scaled up. A related lesson is\n            that a project such as the IBCD project, introduced to\n            pioneer the implementation of a new strategy, should not\n            only invest in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) from the\n            outset so as to provide empirical evidence of results but\n            also have an inbuilt communications program to ensure that\n            emerging messages are passed to decision makers and other\n            key stakeholders, and so are fed back into the policy,\n            strategy, and programming cycle."}, "docdt": "2009-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
