There are three main\n            components. The first rehabilitates and upgrades electric\n            utility distribution facilities in the central West Bank and\n            the Hebron governorate, and implements a distribution\n            dispatching center for the Jerusalem District Electric\n            Company (JDEC0). The second component finances a management\n            contract and technical assistance to strengthen sector\n            institutions. It comprises four sub-components: 1) the\n            three-year cost (fixed fees and performance incentive) of a\n            performance-based management contract for the Southern\n            Electric Company; 2) technical assistance to JDECo in areas\n            where its own capacity has potential for improvement; 3)\n            technical assistance to help the municipality of Hebron\n            corporatize and commercialize its electric utility\n            operations (business plan implementation); and 4) technical\n            assistance to the Palestinian Energy Authority to implement\n            the actions specified in the Letter of Sector Development\n            Policy. The third component funds initial startup and\n            operating expenditures, and helps to strengthen both the\n            Hebron and Southern electric companies' capacities to\n            operate as financially sound and technically capable power\n            distribution companies."}, "docdt": "1999-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
