{"cdata!": "The Electric Sector Investment &\n            Management Project of the West Bank and Gaza had the\n            following ratings: outcomes were moderately satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned included: 1) The project reinforces previous\n            experience regarding the importance of maintaining\n            flexibility in project implementation when working in\n            conflict areas; 2) The impact of political factors on the\n            corporatization and commercialization of state-owned\n            enterprises should not be underestimated. This is\n            particularly true when the revenues of the enterprise have\n            previously formed part of the general revenues of the\n            government; 3) Tied co-financing carries special risks,\n            especially if manufacturers in the co-financing country\n            specialize in products that are not technologically\n            compatible with the Borrower's systems; 4) A\n            centralized Project Management Unit would have helped to\n            ensure better co-ordination between the various implementing\n            agencies as well as providing appropriate\n            technical/procurement support mainly in contract management\n            to these agencies; and 5) The high customs duties imposed by\n            Israel on the imported goods have hindered and slow the\n            successful implementation of contracts by the implementing\n            agencies. Such situation has worsened by the reluctance of\n            Israel to give back such levies. This situation is expected\n            to be experienced in future project and therefore should be\n            addressed during future project preparation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
