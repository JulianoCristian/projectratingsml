The project will help make training and employment\n            services more relevant to the needs of individuals and\n            enterprises and will assist the government in its strategy\n            to increase labor productivity and mobility. The project\n            will also assist the government in implementing its\n            vocational training reform by: 1) developing its capacity to\n            monitor the labor market and to use economic analysis to\n            identify and evaluate alternative training investment\n            opportunities; 2) gradually replacing the existing\n            institution-based training by enterprise-based, dual\n            training and apprenticeship programs; 3) promoting\n            in-service training for small and medium enterprises and\n            improving the vocational training tax-rebate system; and 4)\n            enhancing labor mobility by developing employment services\n            for workers affected by economic restructuring. The project\n            will consist of the following three components: 1) creation\n            of a labor market information system; 2) development of\n            employment services, including consulting services,\n            equipment and staff training; and 3) development of training\n            services comprising technical assistance, civil works,\n            in-service training, vehicles and equipment."}, "docdt": "1996-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
