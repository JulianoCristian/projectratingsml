The\n            lessons learned indicate that the government commitment is\n            essential, in particular for reforms of the same scope as\n            those of the project. This engagement leads to other\n            positive aspects, such as the allocation of well-qualified\n            personnel for project execution and effective\n            decision-making during difficult moments. The importance of\n            having an overall strategic framework that facilitates\n            planning and organization of donors participation in the\n            reform. However, the dialogue between the different parties\n            (government and donors) must continue beyond the preparation\n            phase of the assistance program to ensure synchronization of\n            interventions during implementation. For projects\n            necessitating organizational and cultural transformation, it\n            is important to allow flexibility during the study and\n            roll-out phases. During these phases, mistakes and\n            innovations must be permitted. In the development of a\n            demand-oriented system, it is necessary to attach equal\n            attention to the development of capacity on the demand side,\n            as the success of the reform depends in large part on the\n            demand side being properly organized, having the ability to\n            express its needs and the capacity to contribute its share.\n            The difficulties associated with the setting up of an\n            observatory are frequently underestimated. Few projects\n            financed by the Bank have succeeded in establishing one that\n            functions satisfactorily. The problems are diverse and\n            include those experienced by the \"Observatoire\"\n            (see Paragraph 4.2). The following aspects are to be taken\n            into account in the establishment of an observatory: (i) a\n            clearly defined mission and objective, (ii) dynamic\n            leadership to guide its mission, (iii) staffing with capable\n            research personnel, and (iv) sustained support to its\n            mission. Formulate performance indicators in relation to the\n            anticipated results. The indicators are a management tool\n            and should be used to evaluate the progress of the project,\n            throughout implementation. They eventually could be revised\n            according to needs. In certain cases, it is helpful to\n            specify the calculation method of the indicators in order to\n            guarantee their reliability."}, "docdt": "2003-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
