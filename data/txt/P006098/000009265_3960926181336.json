Specifically, the project provides for a program of routine\n            maintenance, under monitored force account and over a three\n            year period over most of the road network. Also financed\n            will be the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of\n            specific sections of the Northern, Western and Southern\n            highways, and the completion of drainage structures on the\n            unpaved Southern highway. Also funded will be scholarships\n            for training abroad in transport planning and professional\n            services for engineering designs and supervision of civil works."}, "docdt": "1988-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
