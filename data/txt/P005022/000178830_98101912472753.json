"The Fourth Development Industrial Bank\n            Project is designed to provide a part of DIB's foreign\n            exchange requirements over about two years. Besides enabling\n            DIB to continue to provide foreign exchange resources to\n            industrial projects in the private sector, which has\n            received renewed Government support recently, DIB will\n            increase its financial and technical assistance to small\n            scale industrial enterprises (SSI). Over 1980-81 DIB will\n            alocate 30 percent of its total term-lending to SSI. DIB\n            will also allocate up to $10 million of its total foreign\n            currency resources in those years to assist smaller SSI. Up\n            to 20 percent of the loan proceeds could be made available\n            to public sector enterprises with export potential. During\n            the commitment period of the loan, DIB's institutional\n            framework will be further strengthened to provide assistance\n            to industrial enterpises in the private sector. No special\n            risks are associated with the project."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
