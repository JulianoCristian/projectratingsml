includes: installation of 3,800 lines of automatic switching\n            equipment with cable and subscriber distribution networks;\n            improvement of long-distance services by providing trunk\n            switching equipment, three very high frequency radio (VHF)\n            links and one High frequency radio (HF) link, overhead line\n            and carrier equipment; civil works; miscellaneous equipment,\n            vehicles and tools; and 30 man-months of engineering\n            consultants services; 18 man-months of financial consultants\n            services; both at about US$5,400-US$5,500 per man-month and\n            a total cost of US$260,000. It is hoped that Office des\n            Postes et Telecommunications du Niger (OPTN) will be able to\n            obtain the technical assistance it requires from other\n            sources in which case the amount in the credit will be\n            reduced to the extent that such assistance become available."}, "docdt": "1976-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
