3,800 lines of automatic switching equipment with cable and\n            subscriber distribution networks; improvement of\n            long-distance services by providing trunk switching\n            equipment, three VHF links and one HF radio link, overhead\n            line and carrier equipment; civil works; miscellaneous\n            equipment, vehicles and tools; and 30 man-months of\n            engineering consultants services; 18 man-months of financial\n            consultants services; both at about US$5,400-US$5,500 per\n            man-month and a total cost of US$260,000.
