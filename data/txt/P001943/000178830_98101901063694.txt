PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGER: TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 634-NIG)
PREFACE
This report covers the first telecommunications project
in Niger supported by Credit 634-NIG. The credit of US$5.2 million
approved in June 1976, bzecame effective in November 1976 and was
closed in September 1981, fifteen months after the original closing
date.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Industry Department of the Bank on the basis of information and data
provided by the Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Niger (OPTN)
and gathered by a project completion mission which visited Niger
during January 1982.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PCR were
sent to the Government and the Beneficiary (OPTN) for their comments,
but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGER:  TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 634-NIG)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The first IDA supported telecommunications project in Niger was
aimed at establishing the basic long distance network, extending and
improving domestic and international services and improving OPTN's (Office
des Postes et Telecommunications du Niger) organization, management and
accounting. It was designed within the framework of OPTN's investment
program the objectives of which were to improve the availability and the
quality of telecommunications services in the economically more important
areas of Niger. In addition to the project financed by IDA, the program
included the construction of microwave links the costs of which were
financed by the Niger government and Canadian and French bilateral aid.
2.        In general, the time needed for various project activities
appears underestimated at appraisal.   The consultancy contract was not
signed until ten months after the Board's approval of the credit and OPTN
was slow in acting on the consultant's recommendations. Largely due to
frequent changes in the management positions of OPTN, shortage of qualified
staff and insufficient allocation of project funds to consultancy inputs,
OPTN's financial management and accounting did not improve as much as had
been envisaged at appraisal.
3.        The original estimated cost of the project (US$6.5 million) was
exceeded by about 21 percent and the cost overrun was absorbed by the
Nigerien government.   The timing of bid openings and contract signatures
slipped by about 1-1/2 years on average. Completion targeted at appriisal
for June 1979 was delayed by 2-3/4 years with full utilization of th-t
facilities expected by March 1982   (Paras 3.03-3.05).
4.        The starting up of the project was slow due to the relatively
long time needed in Niger for the ratification process (p3ra. 3.01), and
could have been improved if hiring of consultants and subsequent project
preparation had been started before Board presentation. A use of the
project preparation facility would certainly have been useful in expediting
the implementation of the project. Such a facility was suggested to but was
not accepted by the borrower. More frequent supervision during the later
stages of the project also may have helped to enhance OPTN's benefit from
the technical assistance component of the project. OPTN needs additional
assistance for institutional development   (Para 5.05).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGER: TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 634-NIG)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The public telecommunications services in Niger are provided
and operated by a parastatal enterprise, the Office des Postes et
Telecommunications du Niger (OPTN). A government-appointed Board of
Directors establishes policies and the Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications is responsible for the political supervision and for
coordination with military and security users of telecommunications
installations. OPTN also handles mail services and money orders, a postal
checking system and, as a special undertaking, a public savings account
activity. A company, Societe des Telecommunications Internationales du
Niger (STIN), owned 20 percent by France Cable et Radio and 80 percent by
OPTN and various other organisms of the Republic of Niger was instituted
during project implementation to handle international common carrier
facilities which were ,reviously operated by France Cable et Radio. The
capital transfer and the operational/financial questions have not yet been
resolved between OPTN and STIN.
1.02      In June 1976, IDA approved a credit of US$5.2 million to the
Republic of Niger (Credit 634-NIG), with OPTN as the beneficiary. The
credit was for the support of a project for improvement and expansion of
domestic telecommunications services within the framework of OPTN's 1976-79
telecommunications investment program and for assistance in OPTN's
institutional development. The proceeds of the IDA credit were onlent to
OPTN, under a subsidiary loan agreement, at 8-1/2 percent annual interest
rate, for 20 years, including a four-year grace period.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      IDA was approached by the Niger Government in 1969 to finance
telecommunications facilities for educational television. After reviewing
the proposed project, namely the educational aspect, IDA questioned its
viability and suggested instead to support the whole public telecommunica-
tions sector. A first identification mission visited Niger in April 1972
and reviewed OPTN's 1976-79 telecommunications investment program, which
was based on a master plan prepared in 1970 by consultants and on relevant
parts of a Panafrican telecommunications network (PANAFTEL) system.
However, taking into account OPTN's financial commitments at the time in
the ongoing program and the preparatory work still required for the 1976-79
program, IDA decided to postpone further action until FY74. Preappraisal



- 2 -
of the project was carried out in October 1974 followed by appraisal in
October 1975. Negotiations between IDA and the Government of Niger were
concluded on April 15, 1976 and the Credit was approved by IDA's Board of
Executive Directors on June 3, 1976.
2.02      The principal sector objectives for the 1976-1980 period were:
(a) to establish the basic long distance network; (b) to keep pace with the
expected growth in subscriber demand; (c) to rehabilitate, improve and
expand secondary long distance routes and extend service to rural areas;
(d) to extend and improve domestic and international services, and (e) to
improve OPTN's organization, management and accounting. In following these
objectives and with the aim of supporting specific country development
efforts, OPTN's investment program was designed to improve the availability
and the quality of telecommunications services in the economically more
important areas of Niger: the Maradi and Zinder regions, the Niger valley,
the Niamey, Dosso and Tahoua departments, and the mining areas in the
Sahara.
2.03      Besides the project financed by IDA, the program comprised (a)
the construction of the Dosso-Zinder (paragraph 2.04) microwave link
financed by the Niger Government, French bilateral aid (CCCE/FA) and
supplier credits; (b) the construction of the microwave links to Benin and
Upper Volta as part of the Sahalian route of PANAFTEL financed by the
Canadian bilateral aid (CIDA). The concept of the IDA financed project was
also to group into a balanced and well defined configuration those portions
of the program that were not taken care of by other donors; it included, in
particular; important measures for achieving institution building
objectives [paragraph 2.02(e)]. At the time of project appraisal, the
program cost was estimated at about US$20.0 million, with US$16.2 million
in foreign cost.
Project Description
2.04      The project comprised the following elements:
(a) installation of new automatic telephone exchanges, with a
total capacity of 1,400 lines at Dosso Tahoua and Zinder,
and expansion of the existing exchanges in Niamey by 2,000
lines and at Maradi by 400 lines installation of toll
exchange equipment at all these locations with a general
introduction of the R2 signaling system;
(b) expansion of local cable networks in several cities and
towns;
(c) construction of line-of-sight radio links on the routes
Oualam-Banibangou, Maradi-Dakoro and Zinder-Tanout and of HF
radio links on the routes Niamey-Agadez and Agadez-Arlit-
(d) construction of an open wire pole line between Tera and the
Upper Volta border and installation of multichannel carrier
facilities on the existing lines to the towns of Goure,
Keita, Loga and Maine;



- 3 -
(e) provision of miscellaneous equipment. vehicles and tools;
and
(f) provision of services of financial and engineering
consultants.
Project Cost Estimate
2.05      The project cost was estimated at US$6.5 million, of which the
foreign component was US$5.2 million corresponding to the IDA credit. The
local cost of US$1.3 million was to be financed by funds generated in
OPTN's operations.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-Up
3.01      The conditions of effectiveness required that the subsidiary loan
agreement be ratified and that financing from Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation
and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique of France be secured for the
construction of the microwave link between Dosso and Zinder.   The credit
agreement became effective on November 9, 1976, about five months after the
date of signature.  The delay was due to the relatively long rime needed in
Niger for the ratification process.   Following effectiveness, the OPTN
started up project execution with the engagement of consultants.   On
January 8, 1977 a contract was signed with the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) for support to both the engineering and the
institutional aspects of the project.
Project Revision
3.02      Project composition did not change significantly, although some
quantities of equipment were increased, some unit costs were higher than
expected and the implementation schedule slipped (paragraph 3.03). For
system engineering reasons, the envisaged HF circuit Agadez-Arlit was
constructed between Niamey and Arlit. The open wire carrier system on the
route Tera to Upper Volta border was deleted as unnecessary with facilities
to be available with the adoption of the Liptako-Gourma project (between
Mali, Niger and Upper Volta).
Implementation Schedule
3.03      After the comipletion of the engineering work by consultants
tender documents for switching and transmission equipment were issued on
January 12, 1978. The tender documents for cables, auxiliaries and



-5-
subscriber equipment were issued by August 29, 1978. Annex 1 shows a
compar'son between the actual project implementation schedule and that at
appraisal.  In general, the time needed for various operations appears
underestimated at appraisal. Other factors that contributed to the
divergence between the two schedules are:
(a) inadequate planning and coordination within the OPTN of
various categories of work;
(b) shortage of qualified staff;
(c) delay in the construction of exchange buildings and of cable
ducts, partly as a result of (a), and partly due to less
than satisfactory performance of contractors.
Annex 2 gives details of dates of bids opening and issue of letters of
intent for principal contracts.
3.04      As for the institutional development aspect of the project, the
consultants were contracted to (references to Project Agreement sections):
(a) prepare a proposal to modify OPTN's staffing with a view
towards increasing its efficiency (PA 3.02 a);
(b) review OPTN's planning activities and propose an efficient
planning system to be applied not later than June 30, 1978
(PA 3.02 b);
(c) reorganize OPTN's accounting and introduce commercial
accounting separating the telecommunications services and
postal/financial services, as from the financial year 1978
(PA 4.01 b);
(d) improve OPTN's billing and collection system (PA 4.03); and
(e) study OPTN's tariffs and propose before December 31, 1978 a
new tariff structure and, possibly, new tariff levels
(PA 4.04 a).
3.05      In general, the consultants' reports on these items were
submitted to OPTN on time according to contract, or with minor delays
only. However, as the consultancy contract had not been signed until ten
months after the Board's approval of the credit, the reports became
available later than envisaged at the time of appraisal. Moreover, OPTN
was slow in acting on the recommendations of the reports and, consequently,
it could not observe several of the agreed covenaiits. More important
still, OPTN's financial management and accounting has not improved as much
as had been envisaged.   This shortcoming was due to a variety of reasons,
the most important being:
- frequent changes in the management positions of OPTN;



- 6 -
- insufficient allocation of project funds to consultancy
inputs and inadequate definition of tasks and
responsibilities in consultancy agreements;
- insufficient collaboration between consultants and OPTN's
management and staff; and
- insufficient response by OPTN to experts' recommendations.
Procurement
3.06      The procurement of equipment, material and services for the
project was generally smooth. The Bank's guidelines were followed and the
agreed procurement conditions complied with. The limit of US$20,000 set
for local procurement, was exceeded in the case of vehicles with IDA's
approval.
Project Costs
3.07      The project costs as appraised and actual costs are summarized
below:
Appraisal                   Actual
Item                      Local  Foreign   Total    Local  Foreign    Total

Total project cost    1.33     5.20     6.53    1.96     5.94      7.90
The original estimated cost of the project (US$6.5 million) was exceeded by
about 21 percent and the cost overrun was absorbed by the Nigerien
government. The cost increase was partly due to some increase in the
quantities of equipment and cables and to the cost of the associated civil
work which substantially exceeded the appraisal estimates. This was
accentuated by the slippages in the timing of bid openings and contract
signatures by about 1-1/2 years on the average, and the intervening price



-7 -
increases due to inflation. A further reason for the relatively high
prices was that the participation in the bidding turned out to be rather
limited, mainly due to the small size of the procurement and the lack of
knowledge of the local conditions and environment by most of the
international telecommunications suppliers.
Disbursements
3.08      The estimated and actual total disbursements of the IDA credit
year by year through 1982 were as follows:
IDA FISCAL YEAR             Accumulated Disbursements               Actual
Appraisal                  Actuals      as % of
US$ (000)                 Appraisal

1978                        3,050                  150           2.9
1979                        4,630                1,900          36.5
1980                        5,200                2,060          39.6
1981                                             4,920          94.6
1982                                             5,200         100.0
During the first two years of project execution, the disbursements slipped
significantly when compared to forecasts. Thus, on June 30, 1978, only
3 percent of the credit had been disbursed as against an estimated 60
percent. A certain improvement was achieved from 1979, however, and the
final payment was about 14 months later than anticipated at appraisal.
Credit Allocation
3.09      The allocation of the IDA credit to disbursement categories did
not change much from the appraisal estimate, as can be seen from the table
below:

Operations
3.10      The equipment installed within the framework of the project has
functioned satisfactorily. Consultants' participation in preliminary
acceptance and in the checking of the results thereof, was helpful in this
respect.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.11      After initial delays in engaging consultants, the project
execution proceeded relatively well. The international suppliers and
contractors have generally performed in accordance with their contractual



-9-
obligations. Expatriates were provided by the foreign manufacturers,
within the framework of their contracts, for the installation and initial
operation and maintenance of new equipment.
3.12      Given the circumstances the consultants' performance was
acceptable.
3.13       Although some deficiencies have been noted in the implementation
of the institutional improvement part of the project (paragraphs 3.04 3.05,
and Chapter VI), OPTN performed relatively well on the whole.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01      In Niger, there were 9,517 telephones installed by the end of
1981 with 6,360 direct exchange lines (DELs). These figures give the
densities of 0.17 telephones arid 0.11 DELs per 100 population, which are
very low even compared to other countries south of Sahara where the average
(except for the Republic of South Africa) is 0.4 DELs per 100 population.
As shown in the table below, there are also big variations inside the
country with most telephones and DELs concentrated in a few cities (figures
reflect conditions by end of 1981).

All regional centers have automatic exchanges, both for local traffic and
for long distance traffic. Of the 30 district centers which are not
regional centers, one (Arlit) has an automatic exchange and the others have
manual exchanges. Manual exchanges are also installed at 16 subdistrict
centers. All these are connected to the public network through lines of
good or satisfactory quality.
4.02      The users (according to number of DELs and billing) follow the
pattern shown by the table below (the figures give the distribution on
categories by percent).

The registered unsatisfied demand for new telephone subscriber connections
was 711 on December 31, 1981 (579 in Niamey and 132 in other cities). The
registered demand does not reflect total unsatisfied demand, which both the
OPTN management and their consultants estimate to be around 3,000. The
reason for the registered figure being lower is due to the fact that it
only reflects possible connections not yet effected. Records are not kept
for demand that cannot be met with available switching equipment and
cables, and this excludes big areas of Niamey and many other cities and
towns. The total installed switching capacity in the country is 9,630
lines (end of 1981); the connected lines (6,360) correspond to an exchange
fill of only 66 percent. The free capacity is not evenly distributed,
however. For example, one of the two exchanges in Niamey and the exchanges
in some other cities and towns are fully utilized. Even when account is
taken of this condition, the low exchange fill still reflects a relatively
poor planning and coordination of installation work. The total number of
telex subscribers is 212 with additional demand of 60 that has not been
satisfied due to adequate cable pairs not being available.
Project's Role
4.03      From 1975 (corresponding to project appraisal) to 1981, the
available telephone switching capacity in Niger has been increased by 4,058
lines to a capacity of 9,630 lines.   During the same period, 3,317
telephones and 2,610 DELs have been added, corresponding to annual growth
rates of 7.4 percent and 9.2 percent respectively.    The DEI growth rate in
Niamey was 10.2 percent and in the rest of the country 7.1 percent per
annum. The telephone density in the country has increased modestly from
0.14 to 0.17 telephones per 100 population, which does not change the
situation of Niger being one of the most poorly provided countries in the
world in regard to telephone service. While the increase of switching
capacity slightly exceeded the project objectives (albeit with about two
years delay), the rate of attained subscriber growth (9.2 percent per annum
overall) fell short of the appraisal piojections of 12 percent per annum.
If the growth had been 12 percent, the telephone density would have reached



almost the figure of 0.20 per 100 population and the exchange fill
(paragraph 4.01) wqould have been 75 percent, and more acceptable,
considering the relatively small size of the national network. Most recent
additions to the long distance ne,twork which are being implemented at the
eMid of the extended project period (1979-80) are outside the scope of the
project and also financed from bilateral resources. However, the new long
distance installations that were included in the project have been
completed satisfactorily.
Other Factors
4.04      The quality of the long distance service is good at Niamey and
other regional centers and at some of the distri,t centers and other towns
connected to the network. Similarly, the local service (table below) is
adequate at the larger cities, but deficient or non-existent at most towns
and rural centers. From paragraph 4.01, it can be seen that the service is
very much concentrated in the urban areas. During the project period, the
places with telephone access increased from 30 to 52, which is still far
from sufficient, especially as about 86 percent of the population of Niger
lives in areas outside these 52 places. The staff appraisal report does
not contain comparable figures, but it is clear that the quality of both
long distance and local service has been significantly improved as a result
of the project as indicated by the following table.

OPTN are shown in Annexes 3-6. It is not possible to make a meaningful
comparison of the financial results for the Telecommunications Department
since, except for the income statement, the accounts have yet to be split
between telecommunications services and postal and financial services. The

The delay in the project implementation is reflected in the lower value of
plant in service as compared with that at appraisal.
Accounts Receivable
5.03      The amount of OPTN's outstanding bills for services rendered has
increased from CFAF 363 million in 1977 to CFAF 1,400 million in 1982.
OPTN does not maintain an accounts receivable ageing list. It is therefore
not possible to indicate an accurate breakdown of the main categories of
owing customers. However, it is understood that the major debtor is the
Government and in particular the Ministry of Information. Furthermore, the
Government (Ministry of Information) has not yet complied with the Credit
Agreement (Section 4.02) which provided for the sharing of the cost of
investment and operation of the common facilities of the Niamey-Zinder
microwave route.
Financing Plan
5.04      OPTN's funds flow statement and appraisal estimates for FY76-82
are given in Annex 5. A summary in millions of CFAF is presented below

The internal cash generation was higher and borrowings lower than expected
at appraisal.
Financial Covenants
5.05      The beneficiary has not complied with a number o- financial
covenants (paragraph 6.05) largely due to lack of sufficient qualified
manpower. As a result OPTN still prepares consolidated balance sheets and
funds flow statements for all its services; external audit is perennially
two years late, and the accounts have not been certified. OPTN needs
further assistance to overcome the major shortcomings in the financial
management of its operations. Such assistance should focus on:
(a) establishing a management information system;
(b)  bringing the external auditing of OPTN's accounts
up to date; and
(c) assessing the viability of OPTN's various
services.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01      The administration of OPTN improved in several aspects during the
project execution period; to a great extent this was a result of the



- 15 -
technical assistance part of the project focused on improving staff admin-
istration, accounting, and commercial activities. However, the efforts to
develop the institution, in general, and to increase its efficiency, in
particular, were hampered by several factors, among which were:
- changes in top management, General Manager, Director
Telecommunication, etc.;
- shortage of staff with adequate qualifications or with
a sufficient educational background for on-the-job
training;
- difficulty in mobilizing staff because of a rigid
r                   salary system which lacks incentives; and
- insufficiency of the technical assistance input.
A subsequent effort is being made under bilateral aid to support the
assistance to OPTN's telecommunication branch to overcome these
deficiencies.
Growth
6.02      The technical facilities which have been added to OPTN's network
within the framework of the project and, subsequently, on the basis of
bilateral loans and credits, have enabled a substantial growth of OPTN's
services. The available telephone switching capacity in Niger increased
from 5,807 lines in 1975 to 9,630 lines in 1981. During the same period
the annual growth rates for telephones and DELs were 7.4 percent and
9.2 percent respectively.
Staff and Training
6.03      The number of staff has grown significantly since the time of
project appraisal (1975), both as a whole and for the telecommunications
branch; recruitment has to a great extent been imposed on OPTN by political
decisions. Thus, although the number of telephones and the number of main
lines (DEL) have grown by as much as 47 and 62 percent, respectively, the
ratios of telecommunications staff per 1,000 telephones and per 1,000 DELs
have grown still further, from 87 to 100 and from 145 to 150, respectively
between 1975 and 1981. Instead of increasing, these two ratios should have
decreased significantly over the period.   Unless OPTN can resist future
pressure to employ more staff than is needed for its operations,
productivity will continue to decline. An extensive training program has
been prepared by the consultant and is under implementation.    Training for
most of the trades is done at the local P&T school. Higher level and
specialized training is done by equipment suppliers and at training
institutions abroad.

VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The project met its objectives to improve and expand the switch-
ing and distribution network installations and to extablish certain trans-
mission links, to feed into the long distance networks. Although the
project works were completed later than estimated (paragraph 3.03), thereby
delaying project benefits, the quality and the operations of the
facilities, added under the project, have met expectations. Partly due to
the two-year delay in the completion of the local distribution networks,
OPTN has not met the planned number of new telephone connections. However,
the technical assistance elements, in engineering and in administration,
contributed to the development of OPTN as an institution. The effort
however, was inadequate to fully meet objectives; this holds particularly
for the assistance to accounting, billing and planning.
Least Cost Solution
7.02      The project made a contribution to minimizing costs for the
technical installation, by an appropriate engineering design and by
international competitive bidding. On the latter element the success
turned out to be less than had been expected though, due to limited
participation by suppliers.
Return on Investment
7.03      Operating results, as measured by the rate of return on average
book value of net fixed assets in operation, reveal a deteriorating trend
since 1979, a year in which the rate of return rose to 17 percent following
a 29 percent tariff increase on May 1, 1979. Provisional figures indicate
that the rate of return dropped to 11 percent in 1981 and will drop further
to 6 percent in 1982. The operating ratio during the same period also
shows a deteriorating trend, rising from 73 percent in 1979 to 90 percent
in 1982.  The rate of return of 11 percent for fiscal year 1980 was above
the 8 percent return required by the Project Agreement (Section 4.06)
whereas that projected for the fiscal year 1982 (6 percent) is below the
10 percent required by the Project Agreement. This is mainly due to slow
connection of new subscribers in Niamey and big investments in the toll
network.
7.04      The project was an integral p<art of OPTN's 1976-1981 investment
program. Since costs and benefits of all components of the program are
interrelated, the return is calculated on the investment in the program as
a whole rather than on the investment in the IDA-financed project. On this
basis the internal financial rate of return was 16 percent. This compares
favourably with the estimated 14 percent at appraisal. The basis for the
calculations is given in Annex 7.
7.05      The above financial rate of return understates the benefits which
would be derived from the investment program partly because it does not
include consumer surplus. It also does not take into account the indirect
and external benefits received by nonusers oL the service.



- 18 -
7.06      An estimate of some portion of the consumer surplus can be made
by noting that at an average annual inflation rate of about 10 percent, the
total inflation over the 1976-1982 was 77 percent.    Thus subscribers who
were connected in 1976 had demonstrated in real terms that they were
willing to pay at least 77 percent more in real terms for a lower quality
and more limited telephone service than current subscribers were being
asked to pay.
7.07      By tabulating the prices in real terms which existing consumers
actually paid when they acquired telephone service, and assuming that new
consumers are similar to the average existing consumer, the estimated
economic rate of return on the program is 29%. Under the same +-eat of
assumptions, the projected economic rate of return at appraisal was 24%.
VIII.  IDA PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
8.01      The starting up of the project was slow, and could have been
improved if hiring of consultants and subsequent project preparation had
been started before Board approval. This issue has now been addressed by
the initiation of the IDA project preparation facility and this mechanism
would certainly have been useful in preparing this project. Apart from the
initial slippages and the consequent increase in project cost, the physical
execution was smooth. The scope and level of technical assistance as it
turned out, should have been much greater than provided for in the pV oject.
Supervision
8.02      Supervision of the project amounted to an average of 1-1/2 field
missions per year. More frequent or more extensive missions during the
initial stages would not have accelerated the start-up process, since the
delay was mainly caused by the time it took to engage the consultants and
time needed by the consultants to prepare the tender packages. More
frequent supervision during the later stages of the project, however, may
have helped to enhance OPTN's benefit from the technical assistance
component of the project and to press for a more speedy connection of new
subscribers.
Working Relationship
8.03      The working relationship between IDA staff and Nigerien officials
was good.   The lack of a mangement information system in OPTN made it
difficult to identify and resolve problems, but cooperation was forthcoming
and IDA staff advice was always considered.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project overall made a contribution to the physical
improvement and expansion of the telecommunications services in Niger. The
quality of these services is now generally acceptable, although the extent
of the services is still very much inadequate. Planning and preparation of
the project were insufficient, particularly the schedule of
implementation. A PPF advance as initiated in later projects in the Bank
group could have been utilized beneficially in this case for the start-up
period. The project execution period most realistically could have been
estimated at being at least 18 months longer than the estimated 3-1/2
years. Even with better preparation before project commencement, such a
short execution period would have been hard to adhere to. As it turned
out, the date of completion of physical components required about 5-3/4
years after signing of the Credit Agreement of which the first 18 to 26
months were consumed by engineering and preparation of tender packages.
Better account could also have been taken of the fact that the OPTN had a
great shortage of sufficiently qualified staff.
9.02      The assistance provided by the project to OPTN's institutional
development was relevant and well received. The extent of assistance was,
however, inadequate for the needs. OPTN does not have a proper financial
management or a management information system; the accounts are not fully
separated between the main branches of services; and the tariff study,
which was thorough in regard to costs of operations and of capital, did not
consider the influence on an optimum structure of marginal benefits and
costs. OPTN needs additional assistance to remedy these shortcomings.

Return on Investment
1.        The benefit period of programe extends from 1976 to 1996, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to approach
the end of its useful life.
2.        The average annual price inflation rate is 10 percent.
3.        The standard conversion factor for Niger is 0.85.
4.        Capital expenditures are based on actual cost incurred during the
investment program and have been adjusted to reflect 1976 values.
5.        Incremental operating costs and revenues associated with the
investment program have also been deflated to 1976 values.    It has been
assumed that the telecommunications operations account for 58% of total
operating costs.
6.        The following is a summary of the program's incremental cost and
benefit streams in million of CFA francs at 1976 price levels.

7.        The internal financial rate of return for the foregoing benefit
is 16 percent.
8.        Based on the assumption that consumer surplus exists in Niger,
the economic rate of return is 29%.
