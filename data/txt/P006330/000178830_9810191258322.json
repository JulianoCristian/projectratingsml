           the provision of subloans for the construction, improvement\n            and rehabilitation of about 8,000 Km of feeder roads,\n            included in the National Feeder Roads Program administered\n            by BNDES; (b) the up-grading of road maintenance capacity of\n            the States and municipalities; and (c) the strengthening of\n            planning and management functions of institutions involved\n            in carrying out the Program. The project would contribute to\n            agricultural development through easier and cheaper access\n            to markets for both inputs and farm products. It would also\n            enhance better balanced economic progress in frontier areas\n            by providing transport links between the new settlements and\n            the trunk road network."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
