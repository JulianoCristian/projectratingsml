The outcome of these\n            components was mixed. They accomplished some of their goals\n            but their impact was modest and sustainability is doubtful.\n            While the Borrower performed satisfactorily, the Bank did\n            not. These results stem from the overly ambitious goals of\n            the project. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, only those institutions that are prepared to\n            make a long term commitment to SMI (Small and Medium\n            Industries) development through staffing and appropriate\n            lending policy and procedures should be eligible to\n            participate in future operations. Second, financial\n            assistance alone cannot ensure successful implementation or\n            operation of an SMI. Business advisory services are needed\n            from project conception to commercial operation. Lastly, TA\n            (Technical Assistance) programs under the project were\n            rather ambitious and did not visualize the organizational\n            and management weaknesses of the implementing agencies. Bank\n            staff should have devoted more supervision effort in\n            monitoring the implementation of these programs."}, "docdt": "1992-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
