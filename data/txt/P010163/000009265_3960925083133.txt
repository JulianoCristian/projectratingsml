PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES PROJECT
(CREDIT 1182-CE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Small
and Medium Industries Project in Sri Lanka, for which Credit 1182-CE in the
amount of SDR 26.7 million (US$30.0 million equivalent) was approved on
October 13, 1981. The cred_i._ was closed on December 31, 1987, atter two one
year extensions. It was disbursed to the extent of SDR equivalent of US$32.31
million; the undisbursed amount of US$210,000 was canceled. The last
disbursement was on April 14, 1988.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was jointly
prepared by the Industry and Energy Division and the Resident Mission in Sri
Lanka of Country Department I of Asia Region, and Part II by the National
Development Bank (the apex institution) on behalf of the Borrower.
Preparation of this PCR was started in January 1991 and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Development Credit and Project
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between IDA and the borrower;
and internal Bank memoranda.

SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES PROJECT
(CREDIT 1182-CE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
(M)         The major project objectives were to increase output, employment
and exports through financial assistance to Small and Medium Industries (SMI)
and by addressing constraints hindering their growth, productivity, and
technological improvements, particularly in sub-sectors with significant
export potential.
ImDlementation Experience
(ii)        The project had two components: (a) a credit component of US$28
million on-lent by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to the National
Development Bank (NDB), the apex institution, for refinancing loans to SMIs
made by four commercial banks and the Development Finance Corporation of
Ceylon (DFCC); and (b) a technical assistance component of US$2 million to
strengthen capabilities of institutions assisting the private industrial
sector.
(iii)       The project became effective on May 5, 1982.  The credit component
was fully committed by December 1987 and disbursed by April 1988 as against
the appraisal estimates of 1984 and 1986, respectively. Initially, the rate
of commitment and disbursement was slower than estimated at appraisal due to
over-optimistic assessment of effective loan demand, adverse reaction by SMI
borrowers to the perceived high rates of interest and ethnic disturbances in
parts of the country. To expedite commitment and disbursement, the scope and
size of projects and amount of loans eligible fox refinancing were enlarged
and interest rates reduced (Paras. 5.01-5.02).
(iv)        The TA component provided funding for assistance to: (a) NDB and
the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) to upgrade their capabilities;
(b) Industrial Development Board (IDB) to stzengthen its extension program by
providing an advisor to coach regional extension officers, establish a SHI
consultancy fund to tap local private expertise and expand its engineering
service facilities; and (cj the Export Development Board (EDB) to divelop its
program of export promotion and supply development in key light industrial
product lines.



Results
(v)         The credit component financed over 2,500 sub-projects, mostly for
exn-r. Son, mal.-ly in traditional sectors and in urban areas.  These sub-
prr   .s are eotimated to have created 25,000 jobs at an estimated investment
cost -r job of US$1,900.  The financed sub-projects' export potential appears
limitud althouih the project imphasized export development.  A limited survey
of 66 sub-projects carried out in 1989 indicated that about one-third were
financially shaky because of cost overruns or poor sales (Para. 6.01). As of
December 31, 1990, the principal infection ratio (representing the portion of
the portfolio uith arrears of six months or older) was 33Z. The average
collection ratio-as of this date was 792 (Para. 6.02).
(vi)        The TA program's performance was mixed.  While the TA to NDB and
PCIs for institution building waF effective, the impact of programs directed
at building up IDB's extension centers/activities was modest. EDB's programs,
particularly the Clothing Industry Training Institute (CITI) and the Lapidary
Training Center, were successful. The TA program's mixed performance was due
to the following factors: (a) the program was overly ambitious, going beyond
the management capabilities of implementing agencies; (b) some of the
activities were supply driven rather than based on an analysis of market
demand; and (c) the implementing agencies were unable to retain qualified and
trained staff due to poor compensation policies. IDA had identified these
issues during project appraisal but was unable to closely monitor implemen-
tation due -to the inappropriate skill mix of its supervision missions (Paras.
5.08, 6.03-6.05). -
Sustainabilitv
(vii)       On the basis of a limited survey of sub-project performance,
including repayrent performance, the sustainability of a number of sub-
projects, i.e. their ability to continue to generate expected benefits over
their useful life, is doubtful (Para. 7.01).
(viii)      Sustainability of the results of TA presents a mixed picture.
While there were initial gains in the capacity of IDB to provide extension
services, it failed to retain staff due to lack of adequate incentives. TA
was more succe3sful in providing training facilities by establishing Lapidary
Training Center, Jewelry Training School, Musnroom Development Center and
Clothing Industry Training Institute. EDB has grown into a large institution
and continues to have influence in improving export policies and procedures.
(ix)        Project appraisal skills continue to improve in all PCIs, with
consequent beneficial effect for SMI III. In terms of financial viability of
lending institutions, SMI II had little effect as this type of lending
remained a relatively small portion of the commercial activities for the PCIs.
Although all PCIs have invested staff resources in building up their SMI
departments, it remains to be seen whether all of them would continue to
provide financing to SMIs without refinancing facilities from the GOSLIIDA.



-V 
In±ingas ond J.essons Learned
(x)         The most important lesson is that only those institutions which
are prepared to make a long-term commitment to SKI development through
staffing end appropriate lending policy and procedures should be eligible to
participate in future operations. This cammitment should extend to
establishing an organization structure which would involve a decentralization
of decision making to major branches and their adequate staffing. Lending to
SMIs should be a part of their long-term strategy and not a transient
involvement due to the availability of World Bank Group credit lines.
Allowing all banks to participacL on the grounds that greater coLpetition
would improve the project impact does not seem to be borne out by results
(Para. 5.10).
(xi)         Another important lesson for future SMI projects is that
financial assistance alone cannot ensure successful implementation or
operation of an SMI; the latter needs business advisory services from the
stage of project conception to commercial operation. Arrangements for such a
aervice should be an integral part of the project (Para. 13.03).
(xii)       TA programs under the project were rather ambitious and did not
visualize the organizational and management weaknesses of the implementing
agencies. IDA staff should have devoted more supervision effort in monitoring
the implementation of these programs (Para. 13.04).

Sector             Industry
2.    Background and Sectoral Context
2.01        Policy Context.  In 1977, Sri Lanka adopted a dynamic
liberalization program after a long period of control and regulation. The
thrust of the reforms was to reorient the economy in an outward direction and
to reverse the bias against the private sector. The main elements of the
reform package were a large devaluation coupled with eliminaticr of the dual
exchange rate system, elimination of a large number of import quotas and their
replacement by tariffs, easing of exchange controls, decontrol of most product
prices and recourse to interest rates to determine credit allocation. Among
other measures adopted to reorient the economy were: (i) the establishment of
an Export Development Board (EDB) to administer a wide variety of export
incentives aimed at encouraging non-traditional exports; (ii) creation of a
Free Trade Zone and encouragement of foreign-owned export oriented enterprises
to locate there; and (iii) relaxation of the strict rules and regulations on
private domestic investments.
2.02        The Industrial Sector.  Sri Lanka has a limited industrial base
consisting of 30 public manufacturing enterprises, 500 large scale private
registered factories, 5000 small and medium scale registered factories,
approximately 25,000 small cottage units concentrated in handicrafts and
services and an estimated 100,000 units employing less than 5 persons.
2.03        The manufacturing sector contributed 17Z of GDP and accounted for
52Z of exports in 1990. The sector provided about 11.6% (1990) of total
employment. The private sector was estimated to account for 60% of manu-
facturing value added. Most SMIs are oriented towards the domestic market
with the exception of firms in garments and gems and jewelry. The latter
industries have emerged as extremely successful exporters, accounting for 582
of manufactured exports.



2.04        The gradual liberalization of the trade regime and deregulation of
internal investment controls have in ressed competition putting pressure on
SMI firms to improve quality and reduce cost.  The number of SMI firms engaged
in activities involving modern technology and high level skills is very
limited. Lack of linkages between small and large firms has been a critical
constraint to SMI growth in sectors such as engineering where a large number
of SMIs can be found in many newly industrializing countrics.
3.    Project Objectives and Descri 
3.01        Proiect Obiectives   The major project objectives were to increase
output, employment and exports through financial assistance to SMIs and by
addressing constraints hindering their growth, productivity and technological
improvements, particularly in sub-sectors with significant export potential.
3.02        Project Description.  The project provided SDR 26.7 million
(US$30.0 million) in IDA financing, of which US$28.0 million equivalent was
for the credit component and US$2.0 million for technical assistance. The
credit component was to be on-lent by the Government to the National
Development Bank (NDB) as an apex body under a subsidiary loan agreement for
the account of a separately managed SMI Refinancing Fund within NDB.  The SMI
Fund would provide refinancing of sub-loans made by participating credit
institutions (PCIs) to SMIs which met financial and economic eligibility
criteria. Responsibility for sub-project appraisal, on-lending and
supervision was delegated to the five PCIs: two public commercial banks, the
Bank of Ceylon (BOO) and the Peoples Bank(PB); two locally controlled private
commercial banks, the Hatton National Bank (HNB) and the Commercial Bank of
Ceylon (CBOC); and the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC).
3.03        The technical assistance component of US$2.0 million was to
support: (a) institutional strengthening of the NDB and of the PCIs; (b) The
Industrial Development Board's promotion and extension services, expansion of
engineering and technical services centers and SMI Consultancy Fund to tap
private sector know-how; (c) The Export Development Board's promotion and
supply development programs including pilot projects in key light ind"stries;
and (d) an Expansion Fund to support sub-sector schemes.
4.    Proiect DesiRn and Organization
4.01        The project was the second in a series of prnjects, apprcved by
IDA with the objective of achieving broader policy reforms in the trade and
industrial sectors in addition to providing conventional lines of credit and
technical assistance to small and medium scale industrial and service firms to
expand output, employment and exports. A modest start in this direction had
already been made under the SMI I project and the Government was keen to
continue the activities and programs supported thereunder. Although SMI I did
not meet its overly ambitious objectives, it focused the GOSL's attention to
the need for policy reforms in the trade and industrial sectors and
highlighted the demand for term credit for SMIs. It, therefore, appreciated
the projects scope and scale and its timing.



- 3-
5.    Proiect Imlementation
5.01        The credit component of US$28 million was fully committed by
Decar.ber 1987, and the final disbursement was made in April 1988, as against
the appraisal estimates of 1984 and 1986, respectively; US$0.2 million from
the TA component was canceled. Initially, commitments and disbursements were
slower than estimated at appraisal due to over-optimistic assessment of loan
demand, the PCIs' increasing awareness of SMI borrowers' poor repayment
record, borrower resistance to the high interest rates charged for SMI loans
and ethnic disturbances. As some of these problems resulted from misjudged
parameters, GOSL and IDA agreed to review the sub-project eligibility criteria
and to make adjustments in the light of new information.  The scope of
projects eligible for refinancing was enlarged to include some commercial
sectors because of the saturation of loan demand from the traditional sectors,
and loans for permanent working capital requirements were made eligible.  At
the same time, the size of sub-projects and -he maximum sub-loan size eligible
were increased, and rate of interest to SMI borrowers was reduced.
5.02        Sub-project operations.  The number and amount of sub-loans
financed under the credit by PCIs is given in Annex VI.  The Bank of Ceylon
accounted for the largest number and amount financed, followed by Peoples Bank
in number and the DFCC in amount.  A breakdown of sub-loans approved by size
is given in Annex II. About 49% of the loan amount went for sub-loans over
Rs.1 million; the average sub-loan size was over Re. 400,000 ($10,000)
reflecting the larger proportion of expansion projects. According to the
appraisal estimates about 602 of the credit component would hava gone to loans
below Rs. 500,000; actually only 26% went to loans of that size, partly due to
the changes in sub-project eligibility criteria. The lending operations of
the five institutions included in the SMI II as PCIs (four commercial banks
and DFCC) also affect this statistics as these institutions are less suited to
service "cottage industry" end of the spectrum.
5.03        Sectoral Classification.  The Project mainly financed enterprises
in traditional industries: food processing (27%), metal products (82),
printingw & paper and construction material (7% each), garments and commercial
transport (6% each), and wood products (5%). The credit appears to have had
very little impact on promoting new technological processes or products not
contributed significantly to export growth.
5.04        Geographical Dispersion.  The major concentration of industries
was in urban areas: Colombo (28%), Gampaha (13%), Galle (10), with 4%-5% each
in the smaller towns of Kurunegala, Matara, Ratnapura, Kandy and Kegalle. No
financing was provided in the North or East, which were affected by ethnic
disturbances. The sectoral composition and regional distribution of the sub-
projects financed reflects the sectoral and regional distribution of existing
SMI units, since most of the sub-projects were expansions of existing firms.
The lack of effective programs of entrepreneurial development n-' supporting
infrastructure as well as the ethnic disturbances appear to be responsible for
concentration of industries in selected industries and regions.



5.05        The Role of NDB and the PCIs.  NDB was the apex institution under
the project and used its SMI Departwent to administer the Project operations.
The dipartment benefitted from technical assistance under the project to
strengthen its capabilities in this area. The main functions of the
department were to: (a) operate an SMI Fund and refinance 80Z of loan amounts
disbursed by PCIs to eligible SMIs; (b) recycle sub-loan repayment under the
credit; (c) monitor commitments and disbursements under the credit, including
sectoral exposure limits, and submit regular reports to IDA; (d) review
appraisale above the free limit submitted by PCIs; (e) liaise with the Central
Bank SMI Credit Guarantee Scheme; (f) train PCI staff on project appraisal
procedures; and (g) undertake sub-sectoral studies.
5.06        The SMI Department helped in upgrading PCI's project appraisal
standards by establishing norms for financial parameters and assisting some of
them in identifying sourc;s of machinery, etc.  The TA funds available under
the credit enabled NDB to undertake an extensive training program for PCI
officers which enabled them to improve appraisal standards. The department's
ability to monitor sub-project appraisals also improved. With IDA's
assistance, it implemented a quarterly reporting system for PCIs whose
branches provided data directly to the Department relating to commitments,
utilization, collections and arrears; the latter collated the data and
supplied summary information to PCI headquarters. NDB did not carry out any
sub-sectoral studies.
5.07        A serious shortcoring of the monitoring system was the lack of an
in-built mechanism to collect information on the financed sub-projects' ex-
post economic and financial performance, which prevented the assessment of the
economic benefits of the sub-projects or of the SMI II itself. While
collection of t;.is information in respect of thousands of sub-projects
financed under the credit would have been a difficult task, particularly for
the participating commercial banks' branches where most of the financing
activities took place and whose staff does not have the orientation or
appreciation of economic benefit assessment, IDA should have used its
available remedies to require the PCIs to develop a mechanism under which the
available information regarding SMIs' financial performance, employment
generation, export performance etc. could be collected.
5.08        The main reason for encouraging a number of commercial banks with
branch networks to provide term financing to SMIs was to encourage competition
and imprcve accessibility of term finance, particularly to small firms located
in small towns and non-urban areas through bank branches. The competition
materialized mainly between the two large state-owned banks: the two smaller
private banks with limited branch network, participated to a very small extent
(combined total of 8Z) in refinancing under the project. The technical
assistance funded under the credit enabled the PCIs to improve their
institutional capabilities to appraise proposals for term financing and to
supervise projects. The two state-ownad banks (BOC and PB) set up their own
SKI departments and invested substantial effort in training staff on SNI
lending, but because of transfers, promotions etc., these departments
continued to remain inadequately staffed, and lending decisions were highly
centralized. This situation is reported to have since improved, and some loan
approval powers have been delegated to branch managers. Furthermore, the



training programs were not rigorous enough, lasting only 3-4 days for both
appraisal and supervision training. According to available information, most
lending decisions by banks continue to be based on security considerations
rather than on project appraisal reports and cash flow criteria, because of
the commercial banking culture engrained in the concerned staff which short
term training in project appraisal could not modify. Another reason for
continued emphasis on security-based lending was the requirement of the
Central Bank's Credit Guarantee Scheme, which turned down claims if adequate
security were not obtained. As regards supervision, the bank branches did not
generally monitor performance except when the client was not current on
payments.
5.09        Since term lending to SMIs raises difficult and very different
issues than commercial lending to large firms, and since acquiring this
expertise requires time, capability and on-the-job training, only those
institutions which are prepared to make a long-term commitment to SMI
development, through project lending rather than security-based lending,
should be eligible to participate in such operations. Under this project, BOC
and PB, whose market share of the banking business is estimated at over 60%,
appear to have made such a commitment over the years. The other private
commercial banks whose market share presently does not exceed 20%, appear to
be participating not because of their commitment to project lending but
because long-term resources were not otherwise available. Although they
prepare appraisal reports to satisfy IDA's requirements, the main criteria for
their SMI lending continues to be collateral and the entrepreneur's ability to
repay.   Since SMI lending constitutes a small percentage of their overall
lending, and there is a shortage of alternative sources of term finance, it
would be unrealistic to expect them to make a long-term commitment to project
lending at this early stage of the development of financial markets in Sri
Lanka.
5.10        Technical Assistance Component.  In the course of project
implementation, a number of changes took place in the allocation and
utilization of amounts earmarked for various activities. Table 5 in Part III
summarizes the changes. Some of the programs originally intended to be
financed under SMI II were transferred to SMI I as the Technical Assistance
component of SMI I was under-utilized. The amount transferred to SMI I was
around US$ 593,000. The transfer of some of the projects to SMI I and the
under-utilization of funds by the Export Development Board (EDB) enabled the
addition of technical assistance programs for the Clothing Industry Training
Institute (CITI) under SMI II, although at appraisal stage technical
assistance to CITI was not envisaged. This last program proved to be very
successful.
5.11        Adequacv of Interest Rates.  Financial markets in Sri Lanka lack
benchmark rates for medium and long term lending. Also, a wide range of
government administered deposit and lending rates create anomalies that make
it difficult to assess the adequacy of SMI II onlending rates. The system
adopted for setting interest rates for PCIs was based on a proxy rate for the
cost of funds (average weighted prime lending rate) minus a spread of 6% to
compensate for the added cost of SMI lending provide a reasonable margin.
While this system failed to directly take account of the actual cost of



- 6 -
mobilizing funds in the domestic market, it yielded a rate that did not price
out non-PCI commercial banks from SMI lending but still resulted in
utilization of the credit component of the Project at a moderate pace. The
mechanism for setting lending rates was not changed in SMI III but rates in
SMI TV are based on average weighted cost of deposit plus a margin to directly
incorporate the cost of mobilizing funds in Sri Lanka.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01        Credit Component.  The credit component was fully disbursed to
2,513 sub-projects in traditional sectors such as food processing, metal
products, printing and paper products, construction materials, garments,
commercial transport, etc. These sub-projects are estimated to have created
25,000 jobs at an estimated investment cost per job of U$1,900. About 62% of
the loans approved were for expansion projects. The export impact of most of
these projects was minimal. The lack of reasonably accurate follow-up data on
sub-project performance has made it difficult to carry out an objective
analysis of the projects' benefits. A sample survey of the actual performance
of 66 sub-projects, carried out by NDB in May 1989, produced the following
information: 33 sub-projects (50%) had cost overruns of between 5% to 200%; 9
were completed below cost; and the remainder (24) were completed at cost. In
terms of financial performance, 12 sub-projects (18%) were operating at a loss
or were closed. Eleven sub-projects (17%) had annual net profits as a
percentage of investment between 0% to 5Z, fifteen had between 5% to 15%,
while the remainder 28 exceeded 15%. It appears that slightly over one-third
of the sub-projects were financially shaky, primarily because of cost overruns
or poor sales performance. The percentage of project costs financed by loans
appears high, with most cases falling between 60% and 90%. These figures
reflect inherent riskiness of SMI lending in an environment in which PCIs were
still building their project appraisal skills.
6.02        The repayment performance of the sub-loans under the credit showed
a deterioration between 1986-89 but has since improved significantly. The
principal affected by arrears of over 6 months (Principal Infection Ratio)
which was some 41Z of total principal outstanding as of December 31, 1989,
improzed to 33% as of December 31, 1990. The average annual collection ratio,
which was 62.5% as of December 31,1989, also improved to 79%. The collection
performance of the PCIs as of December 31, 1990, was as follows: BOC 61.9%; PB
77.1%; DFCC 78.9%; CBOC 78.4%; and HNB 99%. The affected PCIs are taking
steps to improve the effectiveness of their debt recovery procedures.
6.03        Technical Assistance.  The TA programs funded under the project
were implemented with mixed results. The programs focused on completion of
the initiatives launched under SMI I. The allocation to the Industrial
Development Board (IDB) emphasized building up on the extension activities at
its regional branches through coaching of extension officers by specialists as
well as expanding the engineering services centers. This activity did improve
the extension officers' effectiveness but was only marginally successful as
IDB was unable to retain its professional staff, trained at high cost, due to
inadequate compensation and incentives. Most of the industrial extension
centers established under the project were supply driven and not based on a
careful analysis of demand. Furthermore, their ownership and management by



the public center very likely reduced their market effectiveness. The Rubber
Products Development Center, although very active, also had a minimal impact
because its services were not used by the large scale sector. The sub-
contracting exchange was not very effective because of the small number of
large engineering industries that require sub-contracting services coupled
with the small number of SMI engineering firms capable of doing precision
work. The consultancy services provided to SMI firms also had limited impact
except in the case of mushroom farming.
6.04        Compared to IDB, the Export Development Board (EDB) used TA funds
with greater success. The Clothing Industry Training Institute (CITI) was the
mcst successful training center assisted under the project, followed by the
Lapidary Training Center, the Jewelry Training School and the Mushroom
Developmen,; Center. These training centers had some success in transferring
technology and export marketing skills to entrepreneurs and continue to
fulfill a portion of training needs in the sub-sectors.
6.05        The program of TA to NDB for institution building was effective in
terms of building up systems and procedures and assisting management in
strategic planning. Technical assistance to the SMI Fund was effective in
building up staff capability, particularly for reviewing sub-projects above
the free limit and overall monitoring of credit utilization. TA to PCIs for
improving their staff capabilities also appears to have been effectively used.
7.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01        General.  On the basis of the limited survey of sub-project
performance, including repayment performance, the sustainability of a number
of sub-projects is doubtful. Sustainability in this context refers to their
ability to continue to generate expected benefits over their useful life;
these benefits include employment, output and profits. The project components
were not designed to build a self-sustaining system to service the credit
needs of SMIs in Sri Lanka. While TA component assisted in strengthening the
PCIs and NDB, the Project did not address the policy reforms required to
mobilize long-term funds for SMI needs. A Banking Sector Adjustment Project,
currently being prepared by IDA, is addressing the issues associated with
Banking Sector reforms and mobilization of longer term funds.
7.02        The role and the strategy of both IDB and EDB are being evaluated
at present in order to reorganize and refocus their activities to enhance
effectiveness. While the benefits of TA to IDB have been largely lost due to
staff turnover and the inflexibility of IDB in responding to the needs of
entrepreneurs, EDB's problems are different in nature and are a result of
attempting to fulfill too many different functions. PCIs and NDB strengthened
through the Project continue to service the SMIs, as do the vocational
training institutes supported with the Project TA component.
7.03        Credit ComDonent.  With the exception of BOC and PB, the PCIs are
financially viable institutions. The two state banks, BOC and PB, which are
the largest commercial banks in the country and account for utilization of
about 66Z of the credit, have high levels of non-performing loans. However,



- 8 -
their operations, policies and strategies are presently being reviewed by
international consultants with a view to restructuring and adopting strategies
to improve their performance iu the future. The major issve with SMI lending
concern's PCIs' long-term commitment to SMI financing, i.e, whether they
would continue to finance SMIs without refinance facilities from the
Government/IDA and credit gudrantees from the Central Bank. It will depend
mostly on the interest rate policies and the pace of institutional
strengthening, which are being addressed by IDA under SMI IV. The proposed
Banking Sector Adjustment Credit will also seek a major reform of these two
large state-owned banks.
8.    IDA's Performance
8.01        Although the project followed closely the design of the first SMI
project, IDA staff spent considerable time in assessing the results of the TA
program under the first SMI project and in developing TA components which
would be complementary and improve the performance of the beneficiary
institutions. However, the effectiveness of IDA's supervision was less than
satisfactory because of frequent staff changes, long intervals between
supervision missions during the latter stages of the project and inadequate
monitoring of the technical assistance component, given the ambitious scope of
the TA programs and the weak management and organizational capabilities of the
Government agencies responsible for implementation.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.01        NDB, which was the apex institution for the credit, generally
managed the implementation of the project satisfactorily. However, because of
its own staffing constraints, it was unable to have an impact on improving the
PCIs SMI lending operations. Another shortcoming was NDB's inability to build
a mechanism to collect information on sub-projects' ex-post economic and
financial performance which prevents an evaluation of their economic benefits.
10.   Prolect Relationships
10.01       The overall relationship between GOSL, IDA, NDB and the PCIs
remained very cordial all along. The supervision missions worked closely with
them particularly with regard to training of their staff. In the area of TA,
the relationship between IDA and EDB and IDB was quite constructive. IDA took
into account these agencies' recommendations in making or adjusting
allocations for technical assistance programs in order to enhance their
effectiveness.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01       The quality of work performed by consultants was gelierally
satisfactory. The consultants who helped in setting up the diamond industry
were very effective, as were the consultants who coached the IDB extension
staff. However, the performance of the consultants who provided services to
CITI was mixed. The trainers engaged to train the CITI staff were very
effective but there were differences of opinion between CITI and the
consultancy firm that assisted it as to the direction of the training program.



-9-
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.01       For the preparation of the PCR, data with respect to the credit
component was available with NDB and the PCIs. The data and the information
relating to technical assistance were not available in the required form. It
was quite evident that the monitoring of programs funded under SNI II TA
component was not properly documented. The SAR was not used by the borrower
and its agencies to obtain guidance for implementation of the programs, and
some of the implementing officers were not even aware of the contents of the
document. Legal documents between IDA, GOSL, NDB and PCIs were adequate for
the Project.
13.   Conclusions and Lessons Learned
13.01       The project had two components: (a) the credit component, which
met the objective of providing financial assistance for development of small
and medium scale industries; and (b) the technical assistance component, which
was only par:tly successful in removing the constraints to their growth,
productivity and technological improvements.
13.02       In respect of the credit component, even the large PCIs had
difficulties in consistently providing adequate staffing for their SMI
departments because of administrative reasons. This contributed to slow
commitments and disbursements during the early years. Lending decisions
during those years were highly centralized; this defeated an important
objective of associating commercial banks with branch network to participate
in channelling credit to SMIs in small towns. The position has since
improved. The second objective i.e., increasing competition among banks was
only partially achieved because the two privately owned banks were relatively
very small and their participation was not material (3Z-4%). An important
lesson that can be learned from this project is that only those institutions
which are prepared to make a long term commitment to SKI development through
staffing and appropriate lending policy and procedures should be eligible to
participate in future operations. This commitment should extend to
establishing an organization structure which would involve a decentralization
of decision making to major branches and their adequate staffing. This would
also imply that the PCIs adopt lending to SKIs as part of their long-term
strategy and not as a transient involvement due to the availability of World
Bank Group credit lines.
13.03       Another important lesson for future SMI projects is that mere
provision of financing cannot ensure successful implementation or operation of
an SHI; it needs business advisory services from the stage of project
conception to commercial operation.  Government commitment to support SKIs and
resources for providing TA should be an integral part of the Project.
13.04       The technical assistance program was ambitious and did not take
into account the organizational and management weaknesses of the implementing
agencies. IDA did not provide the relatively large amount of resources
required to supervise a complex project of this type and IDA supervision
missions did not have the skill mix necessary to effectively monitor the
implementation of these programs.



- 10 -
13.05       The findings of the supervision missions for SMI II were acted
upon in the design of SMI III, the subsequent operation. Also, the findings
noted in paragraphs 13.02 to 13.04 above were reflected in the design of SMI
IV.

PART II: Proiect Review From Borrower's Perspective
The following comments on the Draft PPAR were submitted by the
National Development Bank which was the apex institution for SMI II.
Proiect Performance Audit ReDort on SMI I (0942-CE
SMI II (1182-CE) and IDP I (1401-CE)
Thank you for your letter dated 7 May 1991 and the enclosed Report
on above subject. Our comments on the above report are given below:
1.    Lending under SMI I & II - Section IV
(a)   We are in agreement with the comments made in the report with
-regard to the shortcomings on SMI I due to weaknesses of PCIs in
Project Appraisal and Supervision and the monitoring system.
However, under SMI II & III, we were able to overcome most of
these lapses through the improvements in the guidelines on project
Appraisal norms and supervision. Efficiency of SMI lending
operations of PCIs also has been improved by training PCIs' staff
in SMI lending. Steps are also being taken by the NDB to carry
out sectoral studies to further improve the efficiency of SMI
Lending operations.
(b)   Weaknesses in monitoring systems due to lack of in-built
mechanisms to collect information has now been rectified by
collecting data on the total investment cost of sub-projects which
will enable calculation of key economic ratings.
(c)   With regard to additional functions that can be performed by the
NDB, we are now in the process of:
(i)   examining the potential use of some resources in equity
support to SMI entrepreneurs, and
(ii)  undertaking sample surveys of SNI sub-borrowers to assess
the actual economic impact of the sub-borrowers.
