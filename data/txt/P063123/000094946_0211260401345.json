Valuable\n            lessons were learned from project implementation, and\n            supervision, particularly that processing the project under\n            an emergency recovery lending following a \"fast\n            track\" within three to four years, proved realistic, a\n            practice which could be replicated in China, and elsewhere.\n            Nonetheless, the size of each subproject should be given\n            careful attention, since some subprojects were comparatively\n            large, and implementation turned less than satisfactory due\n            to work complexity, and time-frame longer than expected.\n            Conversely, the flexible approach adopted in the procurement\n            process, where small subprojects underwent the national\n            shopping process, and larger subprojects the national\n            competitive bidding, facilitated an effective procurement\n            process. However, counterpart funding constraints led to\n            some subprojects being dropped; the reason being that under\n            the principle of the \"beneficiary pays\",\n            provincial governments were reluctant to assist those\n            counties unable to raise required funds, and thus service\n            the Bank loan/credit. To this end, the blend in project\n            lending (partly loan, and partly credit) could preferably\n            benefit from the use of credit lending for non-revenue\n            generating subprojects (flood protection, and social\n            sectors), using the loan portion for infrastructure works,\n            thus collecting fees for loan servicing. Finally, the active\n            participation, and effective coordination of local\n            governments, inter-agencies, and end-users, greatly\n            facilitated project implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
