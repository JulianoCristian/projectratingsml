The main components are restoration and\n            reconstruction of roads, water supply systems, county and\n            township secondary and primary schools, hospitals, health\n            centers and clinics, and irrigation systems. The project\n            also provides for each province to upgrade existing or\n            developing flood forecasting, and simulation and dispatch\n            systems, taking into account the recent flood experience."}, "docdt": "1999-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
