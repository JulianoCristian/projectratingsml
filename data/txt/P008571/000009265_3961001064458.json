provide support to Poland's efforts to develop and\n            implement an effective enterprise privatization program, and\n            implement restructuring across a major share of its\n            industry, by: (i) assisting with the design of the necessary\n            policies, the establishment and strengthening of the\n            institutional framework, and the implementation of the\n            privatization program; (ii) providing finance in ways which\n            will mobilize additional resources for privatization; and\n            (iii) providing finance for enterprise restructuring\n            programs. The scope of the project includes: (a) a policy\n            component to support the Government's program for\n            enterprise transformation and privatization, specifically,\n            the implementation of the necessary policy and institutional\n            conditions facilitating privatization; (b) a technical\n            assistance component principally to support the key agencies\n            involved in the privatization and restructuring process; and\n            (c) an investment component for privatization/restructuring\n            to finance the direct foreign exchange investment costs,\n            including physical improvements to production facilities,\n            permanent working capital, interest during construction,\n            licenses or other types of technology transfer, as well as\n            software, technical assistance and training at the\n            enterprise level."}, "docdt": "1991-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
