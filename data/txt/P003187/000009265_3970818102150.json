production\n            increases.  It would support policy and institutional\n            reforms in the agricultural sector. Specifically, the\n            Project would provide farm machinery and implements,\n            agro-chemicals, and miscellaneous items.  These items\n            include agricultural hand tools, packaging materials for\n            grains, etc., improved seeds, small-scale irrigation pumps\n            and fittings.
