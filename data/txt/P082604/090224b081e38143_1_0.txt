                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and their
                         clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of vulnerable groups in
                         participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end ) ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating
                         provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Due to the late finalization of the revised grant agreement which was extended to December 31, 2013 and the associated approval process, most of the 32 project provinces were
                         only able to start implementation for 2013 in early April, 2013. Provincial Action Plan for 2013 was approved in February, 2013 by the Technical Review Team and the Central Project
                         Management Unit (CPMU). Harm reduction intervention activities for preventing HIV transmission among target groups is being maintained. Although the total project budget in 2013
                         was smaller than 2012, intervention sites for both Injecting Drug Users (IDU) and Female Sex Workers (FSW) are the same, while the number of IDU and FSW peer educators has

                         been reduced.

                         After the project ends in 2013, there will be a major gap in resources for HIV prevention activities in project provinces, in particular for the peer educators network, other staff salaries
                         (e.g. for methadone treatment) and for the procurement of commodities (needles and condoms). In order to ensure the continuous provision of services of this peer educator network,
                         the harm reduction activities of the project (including needles exchange program, free condom distribution and peer educator network) will be handed over to theVietnam Agency of
                         Aids Control (VAAC) to coordinate the transfer of project activities to other related programs.
