                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and their
                         clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of vulnerable groups in
                         participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end ) ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating
                         provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)

                         After nearly nine years, the Project's progress towards meeting its development objective is rated as moderately satisfactory. The rate of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) regularly using
                         clean needles in the last month was 82.7%; this surpassed the project target (70%). The rate of Female Sex Workers (FSWs) reporting that they used condoms with their clients in
                         the most recent sex intercourse was 85.2%; this surpassed the project target (80%). In 2013, there are 18 /32 project provinces have developed harm reduction intervention for man
                         having sex with man (MSM) group. 303,191 lubricant sachet and 158,790 condoms were distributed for free to this group. The project supported 12 provinces to implement

                         Methadone program. There are 2,167 patients receiving treatment. This surpassed the final target (5 provinces and 2000 patients ). The main concern with respect to the
                         development outcome is sustainability at this high level of performance. Vietnam Authority for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) with the support of the Project has established a transition
                         task force, with representatives from UNAIDS and other key development partners to develop a plan for future HIV/AIDS service delivery modalities and activities, in the context of
                         significantly reduced donor funding. Technical assistance is being provided for developing models of innovative and cost-effective harm reduction interventions. For example,
                         guidelines for commune-level & user-pays methadone treatment, and a draft protocol for rapid HIV testing at the commune level, will be completed by December 31st 2013. Central
                         Project Management Unit is working with VAAC to transfer key harm reduction services & activities to other ongoing implementation projects, such as GFATM, LifeGAP (funded by
                         the US Government) and the national targeted program. VAAC has committed to sustain VIP PLus condoms social marketing after project ending. The successful models on harm
                         reduction intervention will be replicated, such as harm reduction intervention for minority group, integration HIV service into health system.
