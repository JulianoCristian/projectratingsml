                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and their
                         clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of vulnerable groups in
                         participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end ) ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating
                         provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
