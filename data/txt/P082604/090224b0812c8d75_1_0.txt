Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIVIAIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and their
clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: * Percent of vulnerable groups in
participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end) * Percent of vulnerable groups in participating
provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)
Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

Implementation Status Overview
The project remains the major financier of harm reduction in Vietnam. In general, the harm reduction interventions in 2011 have continued smoothly, with active involvement of peer
educator networks (for IDUs and SWs and some new network activities for MSM) and increased accessibility to project services. 85.9% of IDUs consistently use sterile needles and
>   syringes over the last month (higher than the end-of-project target of 80%). 84.8% of FSWs consistently use condoms with regular clients over the last month (higher than the end-of-
o   project target of 80%) and 93.6% of FSWs consistently use condoms with irregular clients over the last month (higher than the end-of-project target of 80%).The project has made
0   good step for social marketing of condoms which is key to the sustainability of the HIV prevention program after the project closes in December 2012. Commercial firms to conduct
:   condom social marketing at the provincial level, consulting firm to develop the brand image of VIP Plus condoms and logistics company have recruited. 31 out of 32 provinces have
o   signed Memorandum of Understanding to conduct VIP Plus condom social marketing program. Four trainings on social marketing provided by UK consultants to 32 provinces with the
0   participants from central and provincial management project units and Provincial.
