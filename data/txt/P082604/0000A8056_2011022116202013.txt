                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs,
                         and their clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of
                         vulnerable groups in participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end ) ** Percent of
                         vulnerable groups in participating provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)

                         smooth. The total number of project provinces is now 32. All project provinces have been making efforts to successfully complete their annual plans in 2010.
                         Major achievements at the provincial level are in harm reduction, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. At the central level, an Innovation Day on HIV/AIDS prevention to
                         mobilize innovative ideas on how to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission in community and to limit the impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic to the social economic development. The project
                         selected 30 proposals to receive official award of USD10000 each for implementation. The project staff has improved their project management skill through trainings and re-training
                         on procurement and finance management. Regular supervisions were conducted by CPMU to support implementation at provincial level. The regional institutes has significantly
                         contributed its expertise on technical assistance to the implementation of action plans of provinces, as well. The project also conducted 7 IBBS studies for CSWs and 8 IBBS studies
                         for IDUs at the provincial level. There were 4 provinces already provided services to MSMs ( Men who have sex with Men). All project provinces have prepared their action plan for
                         2011 and approved by the Bank. The implementation of these plans are under way.
