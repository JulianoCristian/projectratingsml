                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The specific objective of this project is to support programs designed to halt transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations( PLWHA, IDUs, CSWs, and their
                         clients and sexual partners) and between these vulnerable populations and the general population. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of vulnerable groups in
                         participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at the project end ) ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating
                         provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.       Overall implementation has been positive and progressing well in terms of achieving the targets, despite reduced funding in 2012. Harm reduction intervention activities
                         continue to be on track. 18.5 million needles and syringes distributed (2012 target is 24.6 million); 25.4 million condoms distributed (61% of the annual targeted number of socially-
                         marketed condoms, and an additional 6.5 million free condoms distributed – this compared favourably to the 16.8 million free condoms distributed in 2011. The reduction in the

                         annual number of free condoms distributed is expected, given the decision by the Government to move from a free distribution to a socially-marketed condom distribution approach.
                         Program for men- having sex with men (MSM) have commenced, with 16 of the 32 provinces planning HIV services for 20847 MSM. Methadone treatment is reached at 5/6 provinces
                         where methadone service is available and 1,720/2000 patients are benefited from the project investment.

                         2.        Project management transition: with a view of the WB/DIFD Vietnam HIV Prevention Project ending on 31 December 2013, streamlined project management is essential.
                         Thus, it has been agreed that the management units of WB/DFID project and Global Fund would be merged at the start of 2013, so as to minimize the funds spent on project
                         management in 2013, whilst retaining good quality services being delivered.

                         3. Additional Financing for 2013 : Project Development Objective (from 2013 Project Paper for additional financing, where MSM was added as a project category): To assist the
                         Government of Vietnam in establishing and maintaining national, provincial and local policies and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information and service delivery
                         programs designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations ( Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs), clients and CSW partners,
                         and MSM) and between vulnerable populations and the general population, thereby assisting the Recipient in the implementation of its National Strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and
                         control. Key outcome indicators include: ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating provinces reporting safer injection practices (from an estimated 20% at baseline to 70% at
                         the project end) ** Percent of vulnerable groups in participating provinces reporting condom use in sexual intercourse (from an estimated 40% at baseline to 80% at project end)
                         **480 000 lubricant sachets distributed to MSM in the last 6 months.
