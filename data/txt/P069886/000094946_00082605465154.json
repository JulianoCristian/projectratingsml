the Africa Region, will significantly increase access to\n            HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs,\n            particularly by vulnerable groups - youth, women of\n            childbearing age, and groups at high risk. The project is\n            the first phase of the regional Program, covering Ethiopia,\n            and Kenya, who have met the eligibility criteria for\n            accessing funds under the MAP, developed comprehensive\n            multi-sectoral strategic plans for the medium term, and\n            endorsed the principle of public/private partnerships, to\n            implement their national strategies, and assume overall\n            program coordination. Each individual country project\n            operation has their own specific development objectives, but\n            provide the basis for this program. The program for Ethiopia\n            will finance the Government's 2000-2004 HIV/AIDS\n            strategic plan, that include support for capacity building\n            within, both private, and government agencies. Prevention,\n            care, and treatment activities will also be financed, to\n            expand the public multi-sectoral response of civil society,\n            and communities to the AIDS epidemic. The Kenya program will\n            intensify the fight against AIDS, supporting five priority\n            areas, that include prevention, and advocacy, treatment and\n            support of the continuum care of AIDS affected people,\n            management, and coordination, and mitigation of social\n            impact, through research, monitoring, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2000-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
