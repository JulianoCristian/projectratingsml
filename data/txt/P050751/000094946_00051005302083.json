will be the first of a series of investments\n            which will support the Government's 15-year vision to\n            extend community nutrition services to the entire country.\n            The goal of the national program is to improve nutritional\n            status to the extent that malnutrition will no longer be a\n            public health problem. The project consists of two\n            components. The first, the Service Component, is comprised\n            of two sub-components: Area-based community nutrition\n            services improve behavioral practices in critical areas such\n            as breastfeeding, timely introduction of solid foods, and\n            increased food intake during pregnancy. It also increases\n            awareness and treatment of malnutrition in the primary care\n            health system and provides food security and\n            income-generating activities to the poorest households in\n            the community. The second sub-component funds a foundation\n            promoting and protecting breastfeeding; funds a program for\n            national micro-nutrient supplements; and provides technical\n            assistance to draft legislation on fortification and food\n            quality standards. The second component, the Project Support\n            and Institutional Development Component, consists of three\n            sub-components: project management and institutional\n            development; monitoring, evaluation, and operations\n            research; and training and behavioral change communications.\n            This component strengthens the management capacities of\n            communities and nongovernmental organizations."}, "docdt": "2000-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
