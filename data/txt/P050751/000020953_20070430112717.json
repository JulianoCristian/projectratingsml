Lessons learned included: 1) One of the key\n            lessons learned in NNP is that projects can set themselves\n            up for failure by defining overly ambitious, ambiguous, and\n            un-measurable targets; 2) Future projects must address\n            possible contentious issues early on in project preparation\n            by working closely with government; 3) The process of\n            scaling up should be undertaken with care. An essential\n            prerequisite is to have a robust evaluation of the pilot, so\n            that lessons learned can be incorporated into the new\n            project; 4) Frequent changes of leadership and turnover of\n            staff both within the Bank and the borrower, and among the\n            implementing agencies are detrimental to implementation; 5)\n            Enhance program impact through decentralizing\n            decision-making, incentives and accountability; 6) Provide\n            additional assistance in preparing follow-on operations; 7)\n            Monitoring of NGO contracting is particularly important\n            since it is often subjected to undue influence from\n            political/bureaucratic bosses; 8) Keep flexibility in\n            project design to be able to adjust project components based\n            on emerging evidence from operations research; 9) Since\n            behavior change needs to occur among poor, often illiterate\n            women in rural settings, it is important that the focus of\n            behavior change communication (BCC) activities through\n            inter-personal communication at the grassroots level is\n            intensified even further; 10) Sustained effort required to\n            address malnutrition in Bangladesh; and 11) Invest in\n            operations research and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            and ensure that the results are appropriately utilized to\n            update project design and implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
