employment, and income in the social and\n            individual farm sectors; (b) increase production of\n            livestock, wine, fruits, nuts, milk and cheese and processed\n            food products primarily for the domestic market; (c) advance\n            planning of small-scale irrigation development through\n            groundwater studies; (d) contribute to institution building\n            by strengthening the capabilities of the regional\n            development institutions. The project objectives will be\n            achieved primarily by providing finance for: (a) increasing\n            processing capacities to ensure adequate and steady markets\n            for agricultural products from the project area; and (b)\n            livestock and horticultural production in both the social\n            and individual sectors."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
