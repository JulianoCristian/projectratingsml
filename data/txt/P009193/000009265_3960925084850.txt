OS-OVO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1993-YT)
PREFACE
1.          The Ko8ovo Agricultural Development Project. for which Loan 1993-
YU in the amount of US$90.0 million was approved on May 14, 1981. was closed
after a one-year extension to June 30, 1988 with a final disbursement in
March 1989. Only $54.35 million was utilized from the loan and $35.65 million
was cancelled. This was the 11th Bank loan for agriculture and agroindustries
in Yugoslavia.
2.          The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office based in part on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No.
3286-YU) dated April 16, 1981, the President's Report (No. P-3030-YU), the
Loan Agreement of June 15, 1981, correspondence with the Borrower, and
internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files.
The Borrower was requested to prozide information for Part II of this PCR, but
none was received.

PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVA
KOSOVO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1993-YU)
EVALUATION SWIAY
1.    Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives were to provide greater
opportunities through credit to individual and social sectors for: (i)
cooperative membership of private farmers; (ii) primary agricultiral
production; (iii) increasing food processing capacities; and (iv) agricultural
marketing for local and export markets. Also, the project was to assist in
planning of small-scale farm groundwater irrigation. Finally, the project was
to strengthen the capacity of Kosovska Banka Pristina (KBP), the Borrower, to
appraise and supervise subprojects. All those objectives were designed to
accelerate economic activity in rural Kosovo.
2.    Implementation Experience.  The macroeconomic conditions during project
implem..tation deteriorated substantially compared to appraisal assumptions
and could not hsae been fully anticipated. High and accelerating domestic
inflation foll>-ed by successive Dinar devaluations resulted in significant
adverse changes in the agricultural price structure Pnd a drop in demand for
agricultural products. Interest rates became increasingly negative in real
terms. Social sector enterprises that were mostly loss makers in other
sectors were favored by the government and claimed most of the scarce local
counterpart funds. Thus the agriculture sector and particularly the
individual farmer sub-sector were discriminated against in the allocation of
counterpart funds which impeded the project implementation. Several attempts
to strengthen KBP failed and its performance continued to deteriorate.
3.    Proiect Results.  The results of this project are similar to those of a
number of other agricultural development projects in Yugoslavia. While most
of the construction targeta for agroprocessing facilities were achieved
despite procurement delays, the profitability of the constructed facilities
has remained well below appraisal expectations and some of the enterprises may
face liquidation.
4.    Prolect Sustainability.  Whether the project could sustain a positive
level of economic benefits in the economic environment that presently exists
in Yugoslavia is open to question. The future of most subprojects will depend
on how government policies and the Yugoslav economic situation evolve. It is
reasonable to expect that if the government were to pursue market-oriented
policies, as is now being contemplated, most social sector subprojects would
need to be restructured.
5.    Findings and Lesson& Learned.  Although the severe deterioration of the
macroeconomic situation could not have been anticipated at appraisal, the Bank
should have taken into account its earlier experience in Kosovo and



- iv -
*!sevhere in Yugoslavia to a greater extent during the desigr and appraisal of
this project. One of the critical issues was that Agrokosovo did not have an
effective management system. This institutional weakness was overlooked during
the appraisal of the project. Also, in view of the Bank's experience with
projects of this nature in Kosovo, the resources proposed to be transferred to
Kosovo for agricultural development proved to be too large for the local
economy to absorb efficiently. It was too difficult for KBP and Agrokosovo,
both weak organizations, to find enough suitable subprojects to utilize the
credit made available under the project.

B. BACKGROUND
Previous Bank Involvement
1.          The project was designed to continue Bank support to the Kosovska
Banka Pristina (RBP, the Borrower) mainly for on-farm and agroindustrial
investments extended under the First (Ln. 1129-YU). Second (Ln. 1477-YU), and
Third (Ln. 1801-YU) Agricultural Credit Projects. Also, Kosovo received Bank
support for the Ibar and Metohija Multipurpose projects (Ln. 177-YU and L;.
1360-YU) to dovelop irrigation infrastructure for about 30,000 ha. RBP has
been the main development banking institution financing more than 80% of all
investment projects in Kosovo.
Sector Development Obiectives
2.          As worked out with the Yugoslav Government, Bank strategy focused
on agticultural development of less developed areas of Yugoslavia such as
Kosovo by promoting giowth through financing of infrastructure development and
credit to the individual and social sectors. The key policy issues perceived
at the time included consideration on how to: (i) increase agricultural
production to meet an estimated 4% ,er year increase in domestic food demand;
(ii) increase exports and reduce imports; and (iii) improve employment and
income, particularly in poor 4-ural areas.
3.          The main objective for the sector in Kosovo was to increase
agricultural production. It was expected that the 1981-85 Kosovo Agricultural
Development Plan would lead to real annual agricultural production increases
of 5.72, made up of rates of 10.82 and 4.8% in the social and individual
(i.e., private) sectors, respectively. This was rather optimistic when
compared to the actual annual growth of 4.0% and 2.3% in the social and
individual sectors between 1976 and 1980. Also, it was expected that agro-
industrial output would grow by about 7% annually. In addition, an important



-2-
industrial output would grow by about 7X annually. In addition, an important
objective of the Plan was to Integrate increasing numbers of private formers
with the social sector processing and marketing facilities.
Projgct Identification
4.          The proje-t was identified in  Bay 1978 by a joint Bank/FAO mission
and prepared by KBP and Agrokosovo with the assistance of Food Ivdustries
Research Engineering (Wageningen, Holland) and Yugoslav consulting firms.
Agrokosovo is a holding company comprising most agricultural and
agroindustrial organizations in the social sector including wholesale and
retail food trade.
C. PP.OJg T OBJECTIVES AN  DESCRIPTION
Project Objectives
5.          The main objectives were to: (i) promote membership of private
farmers in cooperatives; (ii) increase primary agricultural production; (iii)
increase food processing capacities; and (iv) develop agricultural marketing
for local and export markets. Also, the project was to assist in planning
small-scale farm groundwater irrigation. Finally, the project was to
strengthen the capacity of Kosovska Banka Pristina (KBP), the Borrower, to
appraise and to supervise subprojects. All these objectives were expected to
accelerate economic activity in rural Kosovo.
6.          Project objectives were to be attained mainly by expanding KBP
credit to the individual and social sectors for a wide range of activities
ranging ftom primary production to agroindustries. Also, the project
supported studies and tests for groundwater development. Finally, in an
institution building effort, rhe KBP staff was to benefit from technical
assistance and training to improve its ability to appraise and supervise
subprojects.   KBP onlends througn its seven associated Basic Banks.
Project Description
7.          Six major components were included.  The first was construction
and/or remodeling of 12 agroindustrial facilities, accounting for about 70X of
total project cost. It included a pasta processing plant; a slaughterhouse
for beef, lamb, mutton, and turkey; a turkey farm; a fruit and vegetable
processing plant including cold storage and deep freezing facilities; a bakery
plant for swiss rolls, cakes, and cookies; a potato processing plant for
frozen french fries, dehydrated potato flakes, and potato chips; a fruit
processing plant for juice and concentrate; a biscuit plant for crackers; a
dry maize milling plant for brewery grits, flower, meal, and corn flakes; a
cold storage plant for an existing slaughterhouse; a feed mill; and a sugar
?rocessing and packaging plant.
8.         The second component was an expansion of existing, and
establishment of new, vineyards and orchards accounting for about 201 of total
project cost. It was to be undertaken by eight agroindustrial organizations.



-3-
Also, about 800 privat. farmers were to expand their vineyards and orchards.
About 2,640 ha in total was to be financed under the project.
9.         The third component was the establishment of a 1,200 head capacity
goat farm for milk, cheese, meat, breeding stock, and as a demonstration unit
for privato farmers. The fourth was improvement and/or establishment of dairy
breeding stock, including the construction of farm sheds for about 300 small
dairy farmers. The fifth was further investigation and studies to develop
substantial groundwater resources including engineering investigations,
identification of well irrigation systems, assessment of irrigation potential
for agriculture, preliminary recommendation for irrigation development
priorities, technology, and pilot installations.
10.         Finally, the sixth component represented provisions for training,
institution building, and consultants to assist KBP in the preparation,
processing, and monitoring of subproject investments. Also included were
provisions to train and assist local staff in the preparation and processing
of procurement documents.
D. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
11.         The general concept of the project, its design, components and
organization were similar to those of agricultural development projects in
other Yugoslav republics (e.g. the Bosanska Krajina Project, Ln. 1621-YsU and
the Macedonia III project, Ln. 2039-YU).
Issues of Iroiect Design and Organization
12.         Project issues considered during preparation and appraisal
included: (i) the relative share of each project component, as potentially
excessive investments involved risks of creating an oversupply of some
products; (ii) the project cost, its phasing and the foreign exchange
component, estimation of which was particularly difficult In the uncertain
env'ronment; (iii) the role of KBP and Agrokosovo; (iv) procurement
arrangements and the need to strengthen KBP capability in procurement
administeratlon, since increasing difficulties had been noted in most other
iugoslav projects at the time; and (v) financing arrangements and the
availability of local funds, the lack of which had been noted in some other
Yugoslav projects at the time.
13.         The Bank accepted the project proposal, with minor modifications,
as submitted by KBP and Agrokosovo, assisted in preparation by foreign
consultants. Some proposed investments were excluded from the project as not
viable, including a sour cherry plantation of 450 ha, a goat and sheep farm
at Dragas, and a cold store at Djakovica. As applied elsewhere in Yugoslavia
at the time, the project design followed a standard rural/agricultural
development concept of financing primary agriculture, agroprocessing plants
and rural infrastructure by extending credit to social and individual sectors.
Issues such as negative real interest rates charged to subborrowers and
regulated prices in agriculture were not raised because inflation was rather
low in Yugoslavia at that time and was expected to remain so. Agricultural



- 4 -
prices, even though subject to control, were not greatly out of line with
border prices.
14.         The project organization relied mainly on the KBP capacity to
appraise and supervise the implementation of subprojects includlng the
edeinistration of procurement. Project appraisal confirmed KBP capacity,
interest, -Aillingness and ability with some strengthening of staff, to handle
the task. Implementation of each major agroprocessing investment was to begin
withln the fLrst three years of the project's five year implementation period.
Most primry production lnvestments had been identified and technical designs
completed. Tender documents for 10 agroprocessing investments had been
prepared and submitted to the Bank during negotiations for clearance before
iLsuance to prospective bidders by April 1981. To further foster the KBP
implementation capacity, a technical assistance package was included for
improving the capability of its staff to appraise, process, and supervise
subprojects and deal with procurement administration.
15.         The roles and responsibilities of KBP, Basic Banks, the
government, Agrokosovo, subborrowers and other agencies involved in project
implementation were known to all parties involved. KBP strengths and
weaknesses were known from the implementation experience of the three
agricultural credit projects and four industrial credit projects in which KBP
had part! 4pated. Institutional weaknesses of KBP were confirmed in a
detailed evaluation carried out by the Bank in 1980.
E. POJECT IMPLEMENTATION
General
16.         The macroeconomic condltions during project implementation
deteriorated substantially compared to appraisal assumptions and could not
have been fully anticipated. High and accelerating domestic inflation
followed by successive Dinar devaluations resulted in significant changes in
the agricultural price structure and a drop in demand for agricultural
products. Interest rates charged to subborrowers also became incxiasingly
negative in real terms and it became difficult for investors to obtain local
counterpart funds. Moreover, ethnic unrest further aggravated the worsening
economy. All these developments had a detrimental impact on project
implementation.
17.         The Loan became effectlve on December 23, 1981 after a
postponement by two months due to KBP delays in submitting a Self-Management
Agreement (SMA) specifying legal responsibilities of local participating
organizations, which was a conditlon of effectiveness. However, the project
appeared to start well. KBP was expected to: (i) hire an additional 13 staff
to deal with project subloan administration and procurement; (il) complete bid
*valuations and award contracts for all 12 agroindustrial investments by
January 1982; (iii) complete appraisal of atout 401 of investments in primary
production by December 1981; and (iv) obtain a draft contract for the first
stage of groundwater irrigation studies by January 1982.



5-
KBP Organization
18.          The large increase in the volume of lending put a great strain on
the KBP organization capacity and implementation problems began to appear soon
after effectiveness. In fact, KBP has done little of what was expected at
appraisal. Although it hired a procurement officer and an agroindustries
specialist, it failed to fill most other positions to deal with the increased
workload caused by the project. The evaluation of bids for all agroindustrial
investments was delayed, bid validity expired, some investors changed their
plans and some infringed on ICB procurement rules (para 35). Dry maize
processing, potato processing, sugar packing, and biscuit production were
dropped mainly due to raw material shortages, loss of creditworthiness, poor
management, and other problems identified after the project became effective.
Also, several investors submitted new food processing venture proposals to
substitute for subprojects deleted shortly after effectiveness. Deficient KBP
management caused major delays in processing of subloans to individual sector
farmers and no subloans were granted during the first year of the project.
Finally, KBP ignored monitoring and evaluation tasks and fell behind in
submitting Quarterly Progress Reports to the Bank.
19.         Although it soon became obvious that project implementation tasks
exceeded KBP institutional capacity, actions to deal with the poor quality of
loan administration had been slow and ineffective. Problems continued to
develop unchecked and project implementation progressively worsened. Main
problems included: (i) slow processing of procurement for approved
agroindustry subprojects; (ii) controversy over the use of $21 million of loan
funds to substitute new agroindustry subprojects for those deleted from the
project; and (iii) delays in appraising and approving subloans to individual
sector farmers. Accelerating inflation and resulting exchange rate
adjustments further aggravated implementation difficulties. Following four
years of disappointing performance, the Bank decided in 1985 to review in
greater detail the performance of KBP and Agrokosovo.
Efforts to Restructure Agrokosovo and the KBP Agricultural Credit DeRartment
20.         Background.  Agrokosovo had been the main beneficiary of this loan
under which financing was extended to eight agroindustries, 1,200 ha of
vineyards and 900 ha of orchards, all managed by Agrokosovo enterprises.
Agrokosovo is a holding company with exclusive rights to coordinate most food
production and distribution, including export/import, wholesale and retail
operations. The key terms characterizing the organization of Agrokosovo are
detailed in Annex 1.
21.         In view of the serious financial difficulties of Agrokosovo, the
Bank, KBP and Agrokosovo agreed in November 1985 to carry out an in-depth
review of loss making agroindustries and to restructure Agrokosovo. A report
on the review was submitted to all concerned parties in April 1986. It was
agreed that KBP and the Bank would develop a technical assistance and
rehabilitation program for Agrokosovo and its member enterprises.
22.         The main objective of the technical assistance and rehabilitation
program was to improve the operational and financial performance of Agrokosovo
through: (i) introduction of a planning and monitoring system; (ii) improved
accounting and financial management, including the introduction of cost



-6-
accounting; (iii) development of marketing expertise; and (iv) staff training
at all levels related to the above.
23.         A Restructuring Division (RD) within Agrokosovo directly
responsible to the Management Board was established on October 31, 1986 to
achieve the above objectives. As establ.shed, the RD was a much smaller unit
than the one proposed by the Bank, which had originally suggested that the
unit be headed by a Vice President assisted by two Directors (rehabilitation
and training; planning and monitoring) and an internationally recruited senior
advisor. However, after long discussions the Bank finally agreed to a
compromise proposal of Agrokosovo.
24.         Inappropriately, rather than as a department equipped with
executive power to proceed with restructuring of agroindustries, the RD was
conceived as a service for the improvement of organization, management and
development of Agrokosovo. Its objectives were to introduce to its members:
(i) principles of cost accounting and its use; (ii) a uniform system of
planning and management; (iii) a basis for monitoring and evaluation of
economic and financial consolidation; and (iv) development of marketing
programs. The assignment was to be executed with 10 professional staff and an
internationally recruited senior advisor.
25.         Results of Agrokosovo Restructuring.   The RD impact had been
limited to development of training materials, methodologies and to training of
staff, while the more difficult task of economic and financial restructuring
of Agrokosovo had been side stepped. Moreover, the RD had never obtained the
agreed number of professional staff and the executive authority. Instead, it
focused on research and training and, with the assistance of the Social
Accounting Service (SDK) and the Institute of Economics and Development in
Belgrade (IEDB), completed the following tasks: (i) accounts conversion for
years 1985 and 1986 of eight agroindustries financed under the project into an
internationally accepted accounting system devised by IEDB with the assistance
of the British firm of Coopers and Leybrand. Such an accounting system was to
be applied to all enterprises with loans in convertible currencies from
January 1987 according to Yugoslav obligations to the IMF; (ii) development of
marketing methodology to determine domestic and export sales potential; (iii)
medium and long-term planning methodology. The results of the restructuring
as seen by the head of the RD were claimed to be a success in a report
submitted to the Bank (A Completion Report for Agrokosovo Restructuring,
Pristina, March 1988). In fact, the effort was reduced to an education
exercise and its impact on actual performance of Agrokosovo was at best
marginal.
26.         Restructuring of the KBP Agricultural Credit Denartment (ACD).
The review of KBP ACD operations focused primarily on measures needed for
streamlining and speeding-up of subloan applications for the individual
sector, to improve appraisal procedures, supervision and monitoring, and
streamlining of the processing of disbursement applications. Several attempts
to reorganize KBP under other Kosovo projects preceded this effort without
success. On the contrary, KBP performance continued to deteriorate. This was
the second such exercise under this project (para 18). Other similar attempts



-7-
had been undertaken under Kosovo Regional Development Project (Loan 2306-YU)
and the Industrial Credit VII Project (Loan 2339-YU).
27.         The main recommendations of the review carried out by a consultant
included: (i) establishment of uniform procedures and methodology for
appraisal and supervision of all loans; (ii) increase in the number of staff;
(iii) realignment of functions and responsibilities in ACD and between ACD,
other KBP departments and Basic Banks; (iv) a number of steps aimed at
speeding up subloan processing such as increasing approval limits and more
regular meetings of the Executive Board and the Credit Board of KBP; and (v)
management improvements and training.
28.         Results of KBP ACD Reorganization.  Although KBP completed
reorganization of its ACD largely in agreement with the recommendations of the
conaultant, it came too late to have the desired impact on project
implementation. Moreover, only modest results could be expected from
improving the performance of just one KBP department in the distorted Yugoslav
banking environment.
29.          The reorganization resulted in some minor improvements in the
streamlining and speeding-up of subloan processing, subloan approval,
supervision and monitoring of subproject implementation, and monitoring of
performance after subproject completion. However, duplication of effort
between KBP and BB continued for a number of reasons. For example, Yugoslav
law did not permit BB to directly approve loans from Federal Funds. Those had
to be first approved by KBP. If a limit of Dinar 15 million for approval by
Basic Banks had been permissible, the workload related to loan approval at KBP
would have declined and KBP staff would have been able to focus closely on
larger loans. Also, the review emphasized more training of KBP and BB staff
in investment banking. Although operations manuals and guidelines were
available, the vigor of their application had not been adequate, judged for
example from the two latest feasibility reports submitted to the Bank by KBP.
In summary, the reorganization came too late to turn around the project
implementation performance.
Interest Rate Issue
30.         The accelerating inflation added to the project implementation
problems by aggravating the issue of KBP's increasingly negative onlending
interest rates. With the signing of the May 6, 1983 Letter of Development
Policy (LDP) of the Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2326-YU), Yugoslav banks
were to align their interest rates with the inflation rate over a period of
three to five years. Like most other Yugoslav banks, KBP did not fully comply
with the provisions of the LDP.
31.         There was some doubt as to whether the interest rate provisions of
SAL I were to be applied to subloans approved prior to January 1, 1984 or to
all subloans under the project. While KBP agreed with the general principle
of adjusting onlending interest rates for new credits from domestic commercial
bank source to positive real rates over time as specified in the LDP, it felt
that credit provided through the Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions was



- 8 -
not subject to the LDP interest rate provisions. Although the Bank agreed
that from a strictly legal point of view KBP might not be in default vis-a-vis
the onlending interest rate covenant of this project, it took the view that
this was an important issue involving wider economic and financial
considerations and continued to pursue the matter during supervision of this
and other projects in Yugoslavia.
Proiect Costs
32.         Actual project costs differ substantially from appraisal estimates
(Tables 3,4). The reasons include: (i) the lack of detailed engineering at
appraisal; (ii) 2-3 year delays in subproject start-up in an inflationary
environment; (iii) procurement delays; and (iv) price increases between 1981
and 1987 which were five times greater in nominal terms than appraisal price
contingencies, and Dinar devaluation of about 1,500X. For some of the reasons
mentioned, the project was eventually implemented at a lower US$ cost than
originally estimated.
Financin 
33.         The Borrower failed to provide data on actual financing sources
and project financing sources have been reconstructed from disbursement
applications. Compared to the financing plan at appraisal, the Bank share of
project financing was probably higher, while the share of KBP and that of
investors was probably lower (Table 5).
Disbursements
34.          Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates and at the
Closing Date only US$54.35 million (60%) was disbursed including US$38.35 for
project works and US$16.00 million to the Bank for interest and financial
charges (Tables 5-b). The unused balance of US$5.7 million was cancelled,
following two other cancellations, one of US$20.0 million on November 10. 1986
and the other of US$10.0 million on February 8, 1988. In 1984 and 1985, the
rate of devaluation of the Dinar vis-a-vis most Western currencies was higher
than the rate of domestic inflation.   Since the Loan financed indirect
foreign exchange expenditures under the project, there was significant saving
of foreign exchange compared to the appraisal estimate.
Procurement
35.         Although Bank staff devoted much more time than expected in
assisting RBP in procurement, both ICB and LCB procurement took more than
twice as long as expected at appraisal. Moreover, there were many instances
in which firms in certain countries complained to their Government that RBP
and investors had infringed on Bank ICB procurement guidelines.
Special Action Program
36.         The Bank had agreed in April 1987 to a request made by RBP in
January 1986 to extend the Loan Closing Date by one year, from June 30, 1987



-9-
to June 30, 1988 and to increase the disbursement percentage from 45X to 602
of expenditures. This was based on progress reported by KBP in resolution of
long outstanding implementation issues including: (i) conformity of interest
rates with SAL I agreements; (ii) reorganization of KBP ACD to enhance
efficiency; and (iii) restructuring of Agrokosovo. However, the same issues
reappeared after the request was approved.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
37.         Some of the loan covenants were ignored by KBP without effective
response from Bank supervision missions, especially during the early years of
project implementation. More importantly, loan covenants related to
strengthening of KBP proved ineffective. KBP appointed an agroindustries
specialist and a procurement officer, but failed to provide them with adequate
support staff. Although mostly deficient, the compliance with audit covenants
and the quality of audit reports did not come up as a major issue in the
course of project implementation. The establishment of KBP's Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit was delayed which in turn delayed submissions of annual
progress reports and resulted in the failure of KBP in monitoring project
performance. Finally, KBP failed to submit a draft PCR. Covenant compliance
is summarized in Annex 2.
Project Components
38.         While physical achievements of the primary production components
have been satisfactory, most of the eight Agrokosovo agroindustries continue
to operate well below expectations.
39.         Primary Production.  The project met or slightly exceeded
appraisal targets in the primary production sector: (i) about 1,200 ha of
vineyards in the social sector and 350 ha in the individual sector; (ii) about
2,000 ha of orchards and berry plantations in the social sector and 650 ha in
the individual sector; and (iii) about 300 dairy, and 500 sheep/goat mini
farms were established in the individual sector; all based on data from
project supervision.
40.         The individual sector credit component continued the support
extended under the three countrywide agricultural credit projects and
overlapped with Kosovo Regional Development Project (Ln.2306-YU). The
findings of the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the Third
Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 1801-YU) are also applicable to this
component, as their implementation overlapped. In summary, the PPAR findings
applicable here include: (i) delays caused by the need to identify subprojects
and complete feasibility studies; (ii) difficulties in reaching consensus on
priorities; (iii) shortage of local funds in BBs and investor capital despite
the special agreement among implementing agencies at the time of project
preparation; (iv) significant differences between appraisal projections and
actual investments; and (v) need to reappraise some subprojects due to cost
overruns resulting from domestic inflation.
41.         Agroindustries.  Four out of eight agroineustrial enterprises have
been operating with losses from the time of their commissioning in 1982/83.
The Swiss Roll plant has been unable to cover even its wage bill. Six other
enterprises have become marginally profitable. The Gnjilane slaughterhouse



- 10 -
was still under construction during the last supervision mission of March
1989. Reasons for poor performance include: (i) weak management; (ii) policy
of employment of excessive labor; (iii) wrong product mix and/or ineffective
marketing; (iv) underutilization of capacity either due to the lack of demand
or the lack of raw materials for processing, all compounded by Yugoslavia's
economic crises. Sales and cost figures from 1986 illustrate the position of
some agroindustrial enterprises (Table 7).
42.       Groundwater and Irrigation Studies.  Technical investigations of
existing groundwater resources and feasibility studies of small scale
irrigation have been carried out. However, pilot irrigation schemes have not
been implemented as proposed due to the lack of interest in such investments.
F. PROJECT RESULTS
43.        The results of this project are similar to those of a number of
other agricultural development projects in Yugoslavia including the results of
the Third Agricultural Credit Project and the Kosovo Regional Development
Project (Ln 2306-YU). As under other similar Yugoslav projects most of the
construction targets for the agroprocessing facilities were achieved despite
procurement delays. However, the profitability of such facilities has
remained well below appraisal expectations and some of the enterprises may
face liquidation.
Agricultural Impact
44.           The demand for fresh and processed agricultural produce declined
as a result of the worsening economic situation in the country. Information
on incremental production and yields remains incomplete due to the wide range
of subprojects financed and the limitations of the monitoring and evaluation
system. A revised estimate of the project's annual incremental production in
the individual sector and a list o! individual sector subprojects have not
been made available by KBP. The appraisal estimates of incremental quantity
and value of output are summarized in Table 8.  However, it is not clear tow
much of the incremental production is delivered to agroindustries in Kosoto
for further processing.
Financial and Economic ImRact
45.         Information needed to estimate financial and economic rates of
return is incomplete and PCR estimates of FRRs and ERRs are based on data from
other similar projects in Yugoslavia (Table 9). The appraisal economic rate
of return for the whole project was 25X and the economic and financial rates
ranged from 13X to 47X for agroindustries and 9X to 25X for primary
production. The actual rates of return for most agroindustrial subprojects in
the social sector are likely to be substantially lower than those estimated at
appraisal mainly due to the relatively low present capacity utilization.
While the required capacity utilization rates to obtain a financial rate of
return of 121 ranged from 52X to 951, actual utilization rates have been
substantially lower either due to the lack of raw materials or the lack of
market demand. For example, the Klina Feed Mill started regular production in



- 11 
September 1984 with capacity utilization of 26X in 1985 and 25X in 1986,
compared to 801 utilization required for achieving a rate of return of 121.
G. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
46.         Whether the project could sustain a positive level of economic
benefits in the economic environment that presently exists in Yugoslavia is
open to question. The future of most subprojects will depend on how
goverrment policies and the Yugoslav economic situation evolve. It is
reasonable to expect that if the government were to pursue market-oriented
policies, as is now being contemplated, most social sector subprojects would
need to be restructured.
H. BANK PERFORMANCE
47.         Although the severe deterioration of the macroeconomic situation
could not be anticipated at appraisal, it appears in retrospect that the Bank
could have been more effective in applying to the design and appraisal of this
project the lessons of its earlier involvement in Kosovo and elsewhere in
Yugoslavia.
48.          The Bank generally acquiesced to an agricultural development
policy which relied on subsidized credit, although it kept pointing to the
need for positive onlending interest rates from the mid 1970s.   While the
Bank LnLtiated two interest rate studies (1976, 1980), stipulating that their
results would be applied under ongoing projects, lending to subprojects at
increaslngly negative real rates continued. Agreement on the issue with the
Federal Government was, however, reached only in Nay 1983 and with KBP more
than two years later.
49.         In retrospect, most of the agroindustrial subprojects appear to
have been over designed, and poor management, marketing and weak demand were
the main reasons for their poor performance. The importance of solid
financial data on the performance of both KBP and Agrokosovo has been
underestimated, although it was known that the Yugoslav accounting practices
are dlstortive. The reasons for weak product demand included: (i) declining
real consumer income; (ii) limited export possibilities; and (iii) expansion
of agroindustrial processing capacity elsewhere in Yugoslavia.
50.         About 370 Bank staff weeks were spent on the project, 341 of which
on preparation/preappralsal, 201 on appraisal, 51 on negotiations, and 411 on
supervision (Table 10). It is not clear from project documents why and how so
much of Bank staff tlme was used to prepare and appraise the project. Some of
thls time might have been used to analyze earlier experience, draw
conclusLons, and to ldentify conditionality for subsequent involvement (e.g.,
interest rate and price policy, need for detalled engineering designs prior to
appraisal, etc.), but whether this took place is not clear from the written
record. Project supervision initially focused mainly on assisting KBP with
procurement and less on KBP organizational capabilitles. Most implementation
difficultles could not be prevented in the context of project supervision from
developlng into serious problems. Moreover, most corrective actlons came
either too late or were too weak to have the desired impact on project
implementation.



- 12 -
51.         A lesson to be drawn from the experience with this project is that
substantive issues such as interest rate policy need to be resolved decisively
even at the cost of deferring loan approval. A postponement of the resolution
of such issues not only affects project implementation and the ach'ievement of
policy objectives, but it may also undermine the Bank's position in subsequent
policy dialogue. Another substantive issue that received little attention,
and on which the Bank had little leverage, was the role of Agrokosovo and its
enterprises. Agrokosovo enterprises have been protected by a set of trade and
licencing agreements from competition of other Yugoslav republics and from
foreign imports. Moreover, in a number of cases Agrokosovo with KBP support
has been successful in restricting agricultural trade of private farmers. For
example, dairy farmers who obtained credit from KBP had to agree to sell milk
only to Agrokosovo dairy plants. Although this was necessary to ensure loan
repayment, Agrokosovo misused its monopsony power to depress raw milk prices.
I. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
52.         KBP performance deteriorated under the project reflecting the
weaknesses of the Yugoslav banking system. Although KBP, like other Yugoslav
banks, carries out banking functions with considerable autonomy, its decisions
have been strongly influenced by the social sector organizations which are in
effect both its owners and major borrowers. Moreover, about 75X of all
government funds for economic development are channelled through KBP, giving
an advantage to its major borrowers to obtain subsidized credit. These and
other weaknesses of the Yugoslav banking system are now being recognized and
addressed as part of the overall economic and financial reform.
53.         The reorganization of the Agricultural Credit Department of the
KBP came too late to affect project implementation and had no lasting results.
Various organizational improvements designed to improve implementation did not
prove sufficiently effective and deficiencies identified during earlier
projects and recognized at appraisal were not eliminated in the course of
project implementation.
J. PROJECT DOCUMENTS AND DATA
54.         As already mentioned, the SAR and the Loan Agreement followed the
standards of other Yugoslav agricultural projects. Because of numerous
changes during project implementation, the value of the SAR for project
implementation was limited.
55.         Most project correspondence between the Bank and KBP deals with
procurement issues. Data on project monitoring and evaluation are very
limited with the exception of a report on the restructuring of Agrokosovo and
KBP ACD prepared by a Bank consultant. KBP progress reports were generally
submitted late and contained little useful information. This in turn reflects
the indifference of KBP management toward monitoring and evaluation of its
activities. Also, KBP failed to submit a draft PCR, as required.

GLOSSARY 0 TERMS
AGROKONBINAT (AIX)
The agrokomblnat is a large social sector agrl-business whLch
encompasses all aspects of the food system; Lnput manufacture, primary
productlon, processing, marketing, dLstrLbution and retalILng.
AmROKOSOVO
An umbrella AIX for all 18 agrokomblnats in Kosovo. In this case,
Agrokosovo Ls a COAL comprlsed of 18 WO. (the 18 smaller agrokombinats), 101
BOALx. 75 B'SC COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATIONS, an Agro Commerce O, *and the
research WO, IED.
Central OrmnizatLon of AIK comprlses of (i) Management Board, vhich
performs the functions of a general manager for AIK; (iL) a WO for common
servLces to suumari:e the plans, accounts and business results of AIX,
undertake flnancLal and economlc analysis of AIR's buslness, and provide
expert advLce to BOALs and VOs; (ilL) a UO to disseminate information about
AIX's actlvLtLes; (iv) a WO for research and sceLntific activities; and (v) an
Internal Bank to assist the BOALs ln finding financial resources to the
capital market and to handle transfer of surplus resources wLth AIPE from one
BOAL to another. The expenses of the central organization are met by
contributions from BOALs.
ASSOCIAE AGRICS T
Any INIVIDUAL SECTOR farmer that has agreed (through a Self-management
agreement) to cooperate in some manner vith the socLal sector. This includes
smebershlp ia ZADRUCAs, long-term productlon contracts for sale of crops and
livestock to the social sector, and siillar short-term, agreements that are
arranged annually.
ASSOCIATION OF LABOR
A Yugoslav term used in two overlappLig meanings: as a broad, generlc
term synonymous vith SELl-MANAGEMENT socialLss, ln a narrow sense to
characterize the relations of workers wLthin a BOAL.

Page 2 of 4
BASIC COOPERTIIVE ORGANIZATION (BCO)
The basic production unit within large CoMMune-sized ZADRUGAs. A "sub-
cooperative" the SCO is organized on the saae princlple as the parent
organLzatLon: SCOs' delegates represent the organizatLon in Assemblies of the
ZADRUGAS and also In the FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES.
JASIC ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATED LABOR (BOAL)
The BOAL Ls the basLc unlt Ln whlch the ASSOCIATION OF LABOR takes
place. The locus of all econoLic decisLonuakLng, the BAL, Is an autonomous
legal entity having its own lncome statement and balance sheet. Within an
ENTERPRISE the BOAL Is the smallest dLstLnguishable technologlcal entLty
produclng a marketed or marketable output.
CHAMBER OP THE ECONOMY
All associations of a provlnce, republic, or the federation constitute a
chamber of the economy. It Ls not only a consultatLve body; It also has
certain quasL-legislatlve functLons, insofar as lt prepare and signs SOCIAL
COMPACTS WITH SOCIOPOLITICAL CONMUNITIES and trade unlon on behalf of
consenting members (ENTERPRISES).
COMHUNAL COORDINATING COHlITTEE  (Sae PROJECT COORDINATING COIITTEE)

An INDIVIDUAL SECTOR farmer who chooses to enter lnto a productlon
agreement with the social sector on a per annum basLs.
Under the prevailing Yugoslav usage, the ter apples to the process of
rearrangLng political and general economlc decisLonmaking power to the lowest
level of SOCIOPOLITICAL COHAUNITY In whlch such decLsLons can reasonably be
sade. The term is also used ln a broader senae that encompasses destatizatlon

Page 3 of 4
DELEGATE SYSTEM
The Yugoslav term to denote the particular form of citizen or worker
participation under SELF-MANAGEMENT.  Delegates are elected at the level the
smallest unit vithln a COMMUNE or BOAL and in turn elect delegates at the next
broader level, and so on.  Delegates have strLctly limited terms.  They do not
give up their prior status as vorkers; they must solicit the views of thelr
constituency on any important issues on which they will vote; they can be
recalled at any time If the constituency decides that its vievs or interests
are not being adequately represented.
ZuzRISE
The direct translation Zrom Serbo-Croatian would be "work organization"
(0). Nost enterprises comprise several BOALs as their princLple units; an
enterprise is constLtuted by a SELF-NANAGEWT AGREENENT between BOALs. The
stronger and more permanent identity of BOALs is evidenced by the right of
BOALs to separate from the enterprise under certain conditions and either
constitute themselves as individual enterprises or join another one.
FEDERATION OF COOPEPATIS (FC)
The Federatlon of Cooperatives in Kosovo is comprised of representatlves
from 83 cooperatives (Zadrugas). BOALs. and BCOs. (Approzimately 30 of the
BOALs are also members of Agrokosova.) A coordinating and planning
organization for these agricultural organizations, the FC has decLsionmaking

1ND2VIDUAL SECTOR
Agriculture in Yugoslavia is characterized by the parallel existence of
two sectors: the social and individual. The social sector is comprised of

of producti 1. The individual sector refers to the large, private sector that
domlnates p-imary productlon agrlculture In Yugoslavia. The indlvLdual sector
owns 84% of all arable land In Yugoslavia, but accounts for only 72X of total
agricultural production. IndLvLdual sector farms average 2-4 ha. and are
usually fragoented Into 7-10 tlny plots. Fragmentation and small farm slze
coupled wLth low, stagnant productivLty and employment opportunities have
contrLbuted to making the indLvidual sector the major determinant of overall
low productivity in Yugoslavia's agrLcultural sector.
ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATED LABOR (OALI
The Yugoslav goneric torm for all legal entities that functlon by the
AssocLation of Labor.  This Lncludos such entLtLes as SOALs, ENTEPRISES, and
COALs.
POOLING OF LABOR AND RESQURCES
Financial links between BOALs and ENTERPRISES are established by SELF-
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS on the pooling of resources. Such agreements regulate
the condLtLons under whlch one organization temporarlly makes financial
resources available to another. The arrangement can be a traditional medium-
term or long-term credlt arrangement. It more frequently and increasingly
implies the sharing of income and rLsk under joLnt poolLig.
An economLc actLvLty sLigled out in the SOCIAL PLAN of a SOCIOPOLITICAL
COMMUNITY as being of special importance. Through SOCIAL COMPACTS, prlorlty
activLtLes have a higher degree of coordination and stronger commitments for
LmplementatLon ln the planning of affected ENTERPRISES than nonprLorLty
activities. They also have the flrst claim to resources in the fLnaneLng of
Lnvestment programs and projects.
