I.          The following m_oradum and rncomiedation on a proposed loan to
the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$205.0 million equivalent is submitted
.fo approval.  The lon would be repayable in IS years, including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank'* standard variable interest rate. It would help finance a
natural resource management project in the State of Mato Grosso.
2.          Backgproud. Mato Grosso is a frontier state encompassing 18% of
the Amason Basin of Brazil. It is Brazil's third largest state, with an area
of 901,000 km2, quivalent to the combined size of Franan and Italy.  Nato
-Grosso is a transition area between the cerrados (savannabs) to the east and
south, which cover some 33% of its territory, and humid tropical jungles to
the west and south, whleh cover some 57%. The remaining 10% is part of the
largest wetland in south America, the Pantnal. Migration, mainly from the
aouth/southeast, caused annual population increases of about 6.5% during
1970-80 and 7% between 1980-89, bringing the total state population to a
currently estimated 2.1 million inhabitants. Agriculture, the most important
sector in the state economy, grew substantially during the last 10 years.
However, this was accompanied by extensive deforestation, with forested areas
declining from 55% of the state in 1970 to 25% in 1989, and soil
erosion/siltation and contamination of the Pantanal watershed from
fertilizers, pesticides and mercury (from mining). Inadequate knowledge of
the state's natural resource base, increased migration, limited institutional
capability and the prevailing policy framework all contributed to the state's
inability to foster viable smallholder settlements using suitable agricultural
and soil conservation practices in the southern areas where the best soils are
concentrated. Instead, livestock development flourished in the
environmentally fragile west, and slash and burn cultivation by subsistence
farmers spread into the Amaonian areas of the north.
3.          In the face of these trends, local political commitment to
-preserve the state's remaining natural resources has been growing.  With UNDP
and FAO/CP assistance, the Government has spent the last 3-1/2 years preparing
a statewide Natural Resource Management Project, based on comprehensive agro-
ecological zoning. The state has been subdivided into seven zones according
to potential land use, and suitable development/ manag_ment plans have been
designed for each. tey regulatory practices affecting land occupation and use
have ben identified and reform measures proposed. State and Federal
authorities have indlcated their willingness to implament the necessary
reforms, modify public investient programs, and encourage private investments
in accordance with the recommendations of the agro-ecological zoning.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The BankIs assistance strategy
for Brazil has three long-term objectivest (a) to stimulate private sector
development and public sactor reform; (b) to increase the productivity and
improve the living conditions of the poor; and (c) to enhance protection of
the environment and local population. The proposd project would contribute



-2-
primarily to the thLrd objectlve, but would also help t. strengthen public
sector management and to improve the productivity and livLng conditions of
poor rural smallholders. Considerable experience has been gained under the
earlier POIONOROBSTE projects, both in the Northwest Region ln general and
Mato Grosso in particular, and new technical knowledge has been developed
which today makes it possible to identify and implement more appropriate
strategies to discourage environmentally destructive development patterns, and
to promote more sustainable forms of land use. The Bank's participation in
the proposed project would be instrumental in helping Mato Grosso to prevent
destruction of its remaining northern tropical rain forest (about 225,000
km2); protect c:itical watersheds of the Pantanal wetlands in the southwest$
and intensify smallholder cultivation in those already deforested areas whlch
have soils suitable for permanent agriculture. It would also be important for
reducing spontaneous migration to neighboring Rondonia, eomplementing the
recently approved Rond8nia Natural Resource Management Project, as well as to
other Amazon states.
5.          Proie¢t !Obictives.  The principal object.ve of the proposed
project wouid be to implement an improved strategy for natural resource
nagement, conservation and development in the State of Mato Grosso, bys
(a) supporting changes in Government policies, regulations and public
investment programs so as to provide a more coherent incentives framework for
the sustainable development of Mato Grosso; (b) creating and protecting
conservation units, Amerindian reserves and forest reserves in areas which
should remain under permanent forest cover, with particular attention to
protection of the watersheds of the most important rivers flowing into the
Pantanal area; (c) promoting sustainable agriculture and agro-forestry, where
soils are suitable, and supporting basic socio-economic infrastructure and
services needed to implement the state's agro-ecological zoning; and
(d) consolidating and strengthening the technical and operational capacity of
the main state institutions responsible for agricultural and forestry support
services and protection of ecological and Amerindian reserves.
6.          Project Descgiption. Project activities would includes
(a) refinement of agro-ecological zoning and land tenure regularization (17%
of total baseline costs); (b) management, protection and monitoring of natural
resources, including establishment, management/protection of conservation
units and forestry reserves, protection of indigenous reserves; environmental
protection, pollution control, strengthening of forestry police and monitoring
of protected areas; technical assistance and training (22% of costs);
(c) agro-forestry development, including rural extension, agro-forestry
research, rural credit, and marketing information systems (29% of costs);
(d) socio-economic infrastructure and services essential to consolidate
occupation of those parts of the state which can support sustainable
development (27% of costs); and (e) project administration and technical
cooperation (St of costs). Tnternational and national Roos have taken part in
project design, and their participation will continue throughout project
implementation. Project activittes, executed by State and Federal agencies
and NGOs, will be coordinated by the State Secretariat of Planning.

7.          Project institutional arrangements would provide for:
(a) decentralization of responsibility and accountability for execution from
the Federal to the state level; (b) primary reliance on contracting out of
project works versus direct execution by public agencies, including pilot
efforts to privatize agricultural extension services; (c) reliance on existing
Government structures rather than creation of special project entities;
(d) institutional strengthening, technical assistance -ad consultancies,
particularly for management and monitoring activities and in fields requiring
greater innovation or in which a major impact is necessary over a short
period; and (e) improved personnel policies to enable executing agencies to
recruit and retain qualified staff.  The project would be coordinated at the
Federal level by the Secretariat of Regional Development of the Borrower's
Presidency (SDR-PR). Physical and financial monitoring and impact assessment
would be carried out routinely by each project agency, by SEPLAN-MT's Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) and by SDR-PR. Also, a forest cover monitoring unit
to be established in SZPLAN-MT would be specially equipped to use satellite
imagery to monitor deforestation/encroachment of protected areas. Finally, an
independent Evaluation Committee, including relevant local Brazilian RGOs,
would meet annually to revie-w the project, and joint Government-Bank
implementation reviews would be undertaken yearly.
S.          The total project cost is estimated at US$285.7 million
equivalent, urith a foreign exchange component of US$55.3 million, or about 19%
of lhe total cost. The project, to be carried out over five years, would fund
civil works, equipment and furniture, technical assistance, training, studies
and contractual services, investment credit and selected incremental operating
costs. The Bank loan would finance 75% of the total project cost net of
taxes, with counterpart funds provided by the State and Federal Governments.
The share of Bank financing is justified by the strong environmental focus of
this operation. The fiscal situation in Brazil makes it difficult at this
point in time to carry out these kinds of environmental initiatives because
most of the benefits, although substantial in economic terms, would
materialize only ir the long-run, and then largely in the form of foregone
losses. The proposed share of Bank financing would also reduce implementation
risks caused by inadequate or untimely counterpart funding. Retroactive
financing of up to US$20.5 million would cover eligible expenditures incurred
before loan signing, but after October 1991, when the project was appraised.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. a timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Brazil are given .in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and
the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10402-BR, dated June 1, 1992, are also
attached.

later than June 30, 1994 for those identified in the first year of the
project, and not later than June 30, 1995 for the remainder, provided a
minimum of nine forest reserves and 16 conservation units are created by June
30, 1995; (v) presentation not later than June 30, 1993 of a plan of action to
encourage the sustainable management of privately owned forest areas in Zones
5 and 6, in accordance with the recommendations of the zoning; (vi) study by
December 31, 1992 the feasibility of enlarging the Chapada doe Guimarles
reserve and, if so recommended, prompt enlargement and maintenance of the
reserve; (vii) carry out the Sarar6 Action Plan to prevent future illegal
occupations and to recuperate the area from environmental damages caused by
mining; (viii) the results of satellite monitoring of the rate and location of
deforestation in the state would be available to the Bank and the public on a

of revised and simplified project performance indicators and operating
procedures of the PCU/M&N Unit by December 31, 1992; mid-term review of the
project by July 31, 1995; and final assesoment of the overall project not
later than six months after the project completion date; and (xiv) the annual
contracting of an Independent Evaluation Committee, with relevant local
Brazilian NGO representatives, to monitor project implementation and the
compatibility of annual Federal and State investments in Mato Grosso with the
agro-ecological zoning, with the Committee's findings made available to the
Bank by June 30 of each year, starting in 1993.
10.         Benefits.  The main benefits of the project, i.e., reduction of
deforestation and pollution from wildcat gold mining, conservation of
biodiversity, protection of the environment and of indigenous communities'
rights, do not generate direct economic or financial returns. Nevertheless,



-5-
projeac actions would help conserve the natural resource base of the state for
future agricultural, forestry, medical and other uses. Because much of the
area to be protected is located on steep terrain, project activities uculd
also help to ensure the protection of important watersheds, by regulating
water flows and decreasing soil erosion. Some 16,000 indigenous people living
on 38 existiag reserve and at least nlne more to be created would benefit
from improved protectlon from encroachment, boundary demarcatlon and health
services. About 32,100 low-income farm familles would beneflt dlrectly from
the atrengthening of agro-forestry services in those areas of the state which
are suitable for sustaLnable agrLcultural development, and about 18,000
smallholders would have their land titles regularized.  The consolidation and
intensification of agriculture in areas wlth sustainable potential would
generate Lncremental net revenues of about US$3S million per year at full
development. Finally, the project would make a meanLngful contribution to
poverty alleviation and improvement of the health and well-boing of
benefLciarLes.
11.        Sigsainabilitv.  Whlle the long-term fiscal impact of the project
would be positive, this is not likely to be the case during the years
immediately following project completion. Total recurrent costs in the fLnal
year of the project would be about US$18.0 million, equivalent to
approximately 5 of the total 1990 state budget. By full development (project
years 12-15), selected project activities should provide the state with annual
incremental tax revenues at least sufficient to cover that amount. These
revenues would derlve from the Federal tax on the circulation of goods (ICM)
that would apply to the lncremental marketable production. However, in the
flrst years after project completlon, the state may require continued flscal
support from the Federal Government. To a ceortaln extent, such support would
be justified given that most of the deforestatlon and other natural resource
degradation in Mato Grosso over the last 10 to 15 years has been caused by
migration from other parts of Brazil. At the farm level, financial rates of
return to proposed agriculture and agro-forestry investments would be
sufficiently attractlve to ensure their sustainability.
12.         Proiect Riskg.  In the past, Lnadequate technical knowledge led to
occupation of lands with little sustainable development potentlal, rapid
deforestation and resource depletlon.  However, given the availabliLty of
agro-ecological zoning, and the Government's coamitment to comply wlth the           N
zoning recommendations in its investment programming, the risk of continued
occupation of fraglle areas has been reduced. To help ensurp that unforeseen
factors (e.g., unexpected weather or economli problems ln other parts of
Brazil that could once agaLn accelerate spontaneous migration to the Northwest
or unanticipated disease problems that could threaten planned agro-forestry
activities) would not undermine the impact of these policy reforms,
approprlate monitoring and evaluation devices are belng put into place at
project start-up. An Independent Evaluation Committee, includlng RGO
representatives, would convene annually to review progress and recommend
correctlve actlons or reflnements to project strategy as necessary; and a
joint Government-Bank implementation review would be undertaken annually.



- 6 -
13.         The project wuald support the establishment of conservation units
and Zndigenous reserves, but this above would not be sufficlent to prevent
illegal encroachment and deforestatLon of these areas* Environmental
protection has been weak in Mato Grosso in the past, both because the policy
framework often encouraged use of those areas, and because of the state's
limited enforeement capacity and inadequate field presenes. The various
policy and regulatory reforms adopted ln recent years, and others being
undertaken in connection with this project, should address the incentives
issues, and the environmental protection subco.ponent of the project would
strengthen the capacity of key agencies to enforce the state's environmental
policies and legislation, 4nd the borders of conservation units and reserves.
Also, the field information system would be strengthened by the use of
satellite imagery, permitting immediate detection of forest burning and other
forms of invasion. Nonetheless, given the extensive areas to be protected, it
must ba recognised that even these measures may prove inadequate to completely
eliminate illWal deforestation during the project period.
14.         Finally, fiscal problems have led the State to restrict public
sector recruitment and compnesation, which could threaten the necessary
strengthening of Mato Grosso's elatively young environmental, land and agro-
forestry institutions, which must bear the main burden of project
implementation. During negotiations the Government presented an acceptable
strategy to ensure that project executing agencies would be able to rec&uit
and retain qualified technical and anagerial staff, and the agreements
reached wou '.d be closely monitored. The project also includes considerable
technical assistance and staff traLning to support institutional development,
and Bank and Federal Government supervision of the project would be intensive
throughout the project period.
15.         R9c*mmdtL=n   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomuend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
