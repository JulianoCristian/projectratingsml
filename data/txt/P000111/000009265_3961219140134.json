implementation of key accompanying measures\n            designed to strengthen the supply response to the\n            devaluation of the CFA franc and to consolidate refroms\n            initiated since 1990. In particular, the devaluation has\n            provided Benin the opportunity both to accelerate refroms\n            that were constrained by the previous overvaluation - such\n            as lower import tariff protection and privatization of\n            previously uncompetitive enterprise - and to generate a\n            great supply response from the measures taken since 1990.\n            This credit will support the Government's efforts to\n            maintain a substantial real depreciation through appropriate\n            macroeconomic policies, assure a strong supply response to\n            the devaluation, and improve the delivery of essential\n            public services required for higher growth in the medium\n            term. The adjustment package proposed under the operation\n            consists of a an acceleration of fundamental policy reforms\n            in two areas. First, the credit will support improved\n            incentives for private sector development through further\n            simplification and rationalization of foreign trade\n            taxation, a deeper restructuring of domestic indirect and\n            direct taxation, additional changes in the regulations\n            governing commercial activity, investment and the labor\n            market, and the public enterprise divestiture. Second, it\n            will support improved management of public resources and\n            delivery of public services by restructuring current\n            expenditures, improving public investment programming and\n            execution, and reorganizing key ministries."}, "docdt": "1995-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
