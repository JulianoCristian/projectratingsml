Much remains to be done to improve the\n            business environment and attract private investors. The\n            economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks and even\n            more dependent on cotton than it was before the reform\n            program was initiated. Poorly implemented changes in the\n            sector have compromised the 1998-99 crop year, and made more\n            difficult the implementation of a reform process aimed at\n            empowering producers. Poor management in the energy sector\n            aggravated a power shortage in 1998, due to a drought in the\n            region. Despite increased budget allocations to priority\n            sectors, the delivery of essential services has not\n            significantly improved. Implementation of ongoing projects\n            in education, health, and transport in support of this\n            objective is far behind schedule. The changes supported by\n            the project are likely to be sustained. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: A two-tranche operation was\n            not the most appropriate instrument in a difficult political\n            environment. A series of single-tranche operations would\n            have increased leverage and flexibility. Staff continuity on\n            both sides contributed to a good quality dialogue, even when\n            the political environment was not conducive to reform. An\n            attempt should have been made to quantify the program's\n            objectives, and a monitoring and evaluation system should\n            have been put in place."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
