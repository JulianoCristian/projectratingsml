social, and\n            environmental costs. The components include: 1) consulting\n            services, and technical advice to assist the Government in\n            fulfilling its obligations under oil, and gas pipeline\n            transit agreements. These services will focus on reviewing\n            environmental, and social impact assessments, as well as\n            strengthening environmental management capacity; 2)\n            specialized legal advice concerning implementation of the\n            various transit agreements negotiated, as well as revision\n            of Georgian legislation as necessary. Financial, and fiscal\n            management advice would complement the legal advisory\n            services, under precise, and ad hoc terms of reference; 3)\n            financial audits, to be conducted annually on company\n            operations, but only partly financed, i.e., during the first\n            year of operation; 4) non-pipeline oil spill prevention, and\n            mitigation, addressing risks related to marine, and rail\n            transportation of oil, by financing essential equipment to\n            facilitate spill response, monitoring, and enforcement by\n            the Ministry of the Environment. Consulting services, and\n            training provision should complement this component; and, 5)\n            project management expenses, through the provision of office\n            equipment, project auditing, and incremental operating costs."}, "docdt": "2001-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
