Some\n            lessons learned included: the ETIB Credit had multiple\n            beneficiaries with little experience of joint\n            decision-making and some sense of distrust, which made\n            consensus difficult. Creating a steering committee,\n            comprising highest-level officials was a novel concept that\n            aimed to improve consensus building and a sense of ownership\n            among Credit beneficiaries. However, this arrangement proved\n            to be operationally impractical for several reasons.\n            Therefore, the operational aspect of the Credit should be\n            separated from the Steering Committee (SC), or SC\n            decision-making should be delegated to less senior public\n            officials. Negotiation advisor assistance requires strong\n            levels of trust among Bank and beneficiary stakeholders, and\n            less stringent monitoring of the content of the\n            negotiations. Since the negotiation advisors are\n            'insiders' from the industry under negotiation and\n            well connected to both sides of the negotiations this can\n            lead to a perception of corruption. The Bank responds to the\n            perceived corruption by increased scrutiny, which may erode\n            project effectiveness and damage outcomes. A key aim of the\n            project was to build and sustain institutional capacity. The\n            monitoring unit in the ministry of environment was an\n            effective institutional setup that succeeded in\n            consolidating staff and institutional experience during\n            project implementation. In addition, funding equipment and\n            operational costs from the Credit strengthened unit\n            effectiveness, and post-project unit operation appears sustainable."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
