Although the project\n            achieved most of its physical objectives, the principal\n            objective-to enhance the efficiency of the sector-was only\n            partially achieved. The project experience offers three\n            lessons: A) When a policy action is stipulated as a loan\n            condition, conditionality needs to be grounded in realistic,\n            dated covenants and supplemented with monitorable\n            performance indicators to ensure implementation. B) Gas\n            pricing ought to extend beyond the goal of achieving\n            financial viability for the gas utility and move toward\n            economic energy pricing based on opportunity cost\n            principles, including an appropriate pricing structure in\n            relation to alternative fuels. C) The Bank needs to exercise\n            flexibility within the procurement guidelines to resolve\n            procurement issues, particularly in countries with weak\n            institutional capacity and where such issues concern\n            components whose implementation is crucial to achieving\n            development objectives and increasing institutional capabilities."}, "docdt": "2006-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
