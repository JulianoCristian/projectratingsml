The main\n            lessons concern the leverage that a credit instrument\n            financed by IDA (International Development Association) can\n            reasonably exert on Government policy making in the sector.\n            The investment credit instrument by itself does not provide\n            sufficient influence on Government to take the most\n            difficult restructuring and pricing policy decisions.\n            Conditionalities attached to the IDA adjustment credit, in\n            the Second Structural Adjustment Credit Project (SAC II),\n            were effective in getting the Government to tackle some of\n            the most difficult sector issues, such as that of nonpayment\n            in the gas sector. Another important observation is that\n            supervision of an investment Credit provides a very\n            effective way of gaining intimate knowledge of sector issues\n            and this knowledge translates into sound advice to IDA on\n            conditions for adjustment Credits."}, "docdt": "2004-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
