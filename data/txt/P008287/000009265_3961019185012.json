The project is divided into four main components:\n            1) metering, which includes the rehabilitation of the city\n            gate meter stations, the installation/replacement of meters,\n            and the purchase of meter proving equipment; 2) cathodic\n            protection system rehabilitation; 3) analytical equipment\n            including gas quality test equipment, leak detection\n            equipment, and computer software and hardware to undertake\n            network modeling; and 4) corporatization support involving\n            assistance in project implementation, training of Azerigaz\n            staff and upgrading of office equipment."}, "docdt": "1996-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
