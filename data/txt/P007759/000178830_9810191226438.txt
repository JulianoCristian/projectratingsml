CHAPTER 1
THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      The Nicaraguan Government has requested Bank financing for a Rural
Sanitation project. This project would be the fifth Bank operation in the
sector. Previous operations include the expansion of Managua water works, the
rehabilitation and expansion of the system after the 1972 earthquake, and the
Managua Water Supply III project which was appraised at the same time as the
proposed Rural Sanitation Project and is presented separately for consideration.
1.02      The project covered in this report would provide basic sanitation
services for the smaller villages (median population 75 inhabitants) of three
Regions in Nicaragua at a cost of US$6.3 million. The proposed Bank loan
for the project is US$3.0 million coVering foreign exchange costs and about
18% of local costs.
Population
1.03      In 1976, Nicaragua had an estimated population of 2.3 million of
which 51.5% (1.18 million) were living in rural areas. 1/ The country is
divided into eight regions and 16 provinces. The average population density is
17.6 inhabitants per square kilometer, the lowest in Central America, but varies
from 115 in Region II (Central Pacific) to 1.9 in Region VII (North Atlantic).
Population growth averaged 3.2% p. a. in the period 1965-1975. As in most
developíng countries the urban population has been growing at a fast rate and
between 1965-1975 the urban population almost doubled, reaching a compound
rate of 4.8% p.a. and increasing the percentage of urban population from 42%
to 48%. Present forecasts predict that the urban population will reach 52% by
1985 and 59% by the year 2000. The population growth between 1975-1985 is
estimated at 3.3%. 2/
1/   Towns, according to the Census Bureau, are villages with 1,000 or more
inhabitants. Villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants are also classi-
fied as towns if they have urban characteristics, such as streets, energy,
services, etc.

Population Served
1.04      The availability of water and sewerage services in urban towns ranks
average ín comparison to other Latin American countries, 1/ but the water and
sewerage services in rural areas are among the lowest, and only five countries
in the Hemisphere have lower service levels.

countries. For 1975 PAHO reports that 14% of the rural population
were served by standpipes and 24% were served by latrines.

1.06      Health statistics are seriously distorted and should be used with
caution (Table 1.1). The main reasons are unreported deaths, especially
infant mortality; mortality and morbidity are reported where they are diagnosed,
mostly in urban areas; and, finally, substantial seasonal labor immigration for
the cotton and coffee crops which distorts morbi,dity rates in the Pacific
Regions.
1.07      There is no effective regulation for contamination control:  sewerage
and industrial wastes are untreated and contaminate water resources, especially
the Lake Managua. A Managua sewage treatment project being considered by IDB
financing is designed to solve this problem by 1982. Sewerage services
are minimal and, outside Managua, exist only in six cities which have 7,946
connections for a population of 265,488 persons (1975).

Sector Organization
1.08      The main institutions working in the water supply and sewerage
sector are:
(i)  The Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM), Managua Water Supply
Company, supplying potable water to the capital city, a well
organized and properly managed institution that served
471,000 persons (about 90% of population) by house connections
in mid-1977. The Ministry of Public Works has de Jure
authority over EAM;
(ii)  Departamento Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado
(DENACAL), which administers all urban water supply systems
(excluding Managua and four other municipalities which have
their own water supply systems), sewerage systems (including
that for Managua), and some solid waste collection and
disposal. DENACAL plans and runs its systems moderately well
and depends on the Ministry of Public Health. In 1976 it
served 62,000 water house connections supplying water to
about 320,000 inhabitants, and 48,000 sewer connections
serving 390,000 persons.
(iii)  The Ministry of Public Health has been responsible for rural
water supply and excreta disposal (Rural Health Services). A
new department, PLANSAR (Rural Health Program), established in
1976, is now responsible for the construction of rural water supply
and excreta disposal systems.
Sector Investments
1.09      Investments for water and sewerage during the last six years (1971-
1976) averaged US$2.90 per person per year (US$38.2 million, or about 7.8%
of the public sector investment). 95% of this investment has been made
in the urban areas (Table 1.2). The Government, however, is initiating

an ambitious program to provide water supply and waste disposal facilities
to rural communities and, for this purpose, it created PLANSAR in 1976.
PLANSAR is presently carrying out a project in Regions II, IV and V with
the financial assistance of AID.   Each region has one or more provinces
(map attached).
External Assistance
1.10      External assistance provided US$20.3 million (53%) of the sector
investments between 1972-1976. The major part of that assistance was given
by the Inter-American Development Bank (55%), which financed urban water and
sewerage works. A World Bank loan for US$6.9 million, and an IDA credit for
US$2.5 million (Managua Earthquake Reconstruction) have been successfully used
for Managua's waterworks. The main source of assistance for small communities
has been the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere, CARE, which has
worked with DENACAL in developing water supply for several towns below 3,000
inhabitants. An AID loan, approved in 1976 (US$3 million), is financing the
training of personnel for rural health and improving rural health care.
Another part of this AID loan is providing water and excreta disposal for
rural comunities (PLANSAR) in Regions II, IV and V (US$2 million). The main
projects under execution and their financing sources are shown in Table 1.3.
Government Objectives
1.11      Present Government objectives are to extend, improve, and integrate
sanitation services, particularly in rural areas, thereby improving the
living standards of low income groups. The target for 1981 is to serve 80% of
the urban population through water house connections and 70% with sewerage. For
the rural population, the 1981 target is to serve 40% with safe water and to
provide latrines to 48% of the population. These targets are feasible if the
projects already planned obtain the foreign resources needed and if PLANSAR's
execution capacity is increased.
1.12      The Government has given top priority to the rural areas aiming at
integrated rural development, including education, sanitation, house improve-
ments, and support for agricultural products. These efforts are expected to
result in a decrease in migration to urban areas, an increase in life expec-
tancy, and a reduction in child malnutrition, increasing
the income of the rural population, and improving the environmental and
health conditions.
1.13      In order for the Government to continue its program in the sector and
achieve its targets for the country by 1981, it is estimated that public in-
vestment in the sector would have to grow on average at about 10% per year in
real terms. Certain measures are being undertaken to help ease the financial
burden of investment in the sector. In urban areas, the Government is trying
to make DENACAL more self-sufficient by phasing out a program of giving foreign
loans to it as grants. The government also recognized that efforts should be
made to increase DENACAL's tariffs to cover operating costs in the urban areas
and revise the tariff structure, which now consists of more than 60 categories

which are cumbersome to administer and are characterized by little or no pro-
gressivity. Tariff improvements are undertaken by EAM as a condition of Board
presentation for the proposed Managua Water Supply III Project. In rural areas
the Government is emphasizing the development of simple designs and the particí-
pation of the community in cash and labor, which will bring costs for construc-
tion, operation and maintenance of the systems to levels which will enable
the country to readily duplicate the program in the future in other communities.
Bank Objectives in the Sector
1.14      The proposed project would support the Government objectives of pro-
viding basic sanitation 1/ to the rural population in seven of the 16 provinces
not covered by AID programs, to serve 250,000 additional persons by 1988, or 41%
of the rural population in these provinces.
1.15      The distribution of responsibility for water supply and sewerage
in Managua between the Empresa Aguadora de Managua and DENACAL has not caused
particular problems in the past, but it might cause them in the future,
if the sewerage facilities lag much behind the water supply house connec-
tions. Therefore, assurances have been obtained from the government for
the Managua Water Supply III project that it will conduct a study of the
organizational arrangements for water and sewerage services in Managua
which would develop recommendations for the optimization of the coordination
between the agencies working in the city.
1/   The Government program includes:  water, latrines, sanitary house improve-
ments (trash disposal, mosquito prevention, floor leveling, etc), health
education and child immunization.

CHAPTER II
THE BORROWER
Introduction
2.01      The Borrower for the proposed project would be the Nicaraguan
Government. The Ministry of Health (MOH), through PLANSAR (Rural Sanitation
Plan), would be responsible for carrying out the project. This chapter dis-
cusses MOH's and PLANSAR organization and the measures proposed to strengthen
them.
MOH Organization
2.02      The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for all health programs
in Nicaragua. Its bylaws were established by Decree 106 of October 1948 and
modified by Decree 1027 of December 1964. Urban health services are provided
through the General Director of Health (see MOH Organization Chart). Rural
health and sanitation services are provided by the Rural Health Department,
divided into which has three sections: Administration, in charge of all pro-
curement and general services for the rural health programs; Human Resources,
which trains the paramedical personnel required for rural health programs; and
the National Plan of Rural Health, PLANSAR, which is responsible for planning
and implementing rural sanitation programs, and is the executing agency for the
proposed rural project. In addition to the programs directed by PLANSAR, MOH
is undertaking other efforts to raise the consciousness of the rural population
to health issues. These efforts, which includes radio broadcasts and follow-up
discussions with MOH officials, are often directed to the woman in the community
who usually play a crucial role in guaranteeing the health of their families.
PLANSAR Organization
2.03      PLANSAR has two departments:  Planning and Execution.  The Plan-
ning Department (PLANSAR organization chart) organizes and coordinates
the execution, operation and maintenance, education and immunization programs
among the different regions. The Executing Department (Regional Units) is
responsible for community organization and health education, and the con-
struction of sanitation project works. PLANSAR was established in 1976, and
its first construction projects were carried out in 60 communities during the
first half of 1977. Although PLANSAR's management is adequate, and there is a
PAHO engineer providing technical advice to the AID-financed project,
Nicaragua's lack of experience in rural sanitation necessitates the appoint-
ment of a "Project Technical Adviser" who will provide management and tech-
nical assistance in bid preparation, implementation of low-cost technical
solutions, promotion of community organization, and administration of the
procurement and supply for many simultaneous projects. The "Project Technical
Adviser" will review the village contracts, before approval by PLANSAR, to
ensure that the elegibility and design criteria (para 3.08) are being followed.
His appointment is a condition of effectiveness (para 4.17).

PLANSAR Personnel
2.04      The Rural Health Department has a total of 85 employees, most of
them technicians participating in the design and execution of works. The
present staff is young and their dedication and motivation partially com-
pensates for their limited experience. The water projects for the rural
communities are simple and repetitive, and the first results already obtained
in the AID-financed project in Region II indicate that there should not be
any major problem in project implementation. There is now only one Regional
Unit, responsible for an AID-financed project. The proposed project would
require an additional Regional Unit by 1978 and another by January 1, 1979.
Each Regional Unit requires about 44 employees, of which 21 would be pro-
fessionals or technicians. Assurances were obtained during negotíations
that, as a condition of effectiveness, the Nicaraguan Governnient will
adequately staff the first of these PLANSAR Regional Units required for
the project (see Annex 2), and that it will adequately staff an additional
PLA1NSAR Regional Unit not later than January 1, 1979 or such other date to
be agreed upon by the government of Nicaragua and the Bank.
Rural llealth Program Administration
2.05      The present rural health program adminístration is adequate to
maintain records and control of project costs. Although projects are very
simple and usually require similar components, the accounting and procurement
staff, who are required to support the construction of about 150 additional
systems per year, would need reinforcement through the general administration
of the Rural Health Department.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the accounting and procurement sections of MOH's Rural Health Deaprtment
Administration would be adequately organized and budgeted to enable it to
carry out its responsibilities. 1/
PLANSAR Auditing
2.06      Government auditors (Tribunal de Cuentas) review PLANSAR expenditures
to verify that they are in accordance with budget allocations. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government will maintain or cause
to be maintained records which adequately reflect, in accordance with sound
accounting practices, the operation, resources and expenditures in respect to
the project or any of its parts and that a report from the Government auditors
on such records would be sent to the Bank not later than April 30 of the
following year.
11   The Rural Health Administration now has a Director, two financial analysts,
one economist (cost control), three accountants, two purchase officers and
five auxiliaries (secretaries, drívers, etc.). Preliminary estimates
indicate that by June 1978 the additional personnel described in Annes 2,
page 3 will be necessary.

CHAPTER III
DEMAND
Background
3.01      The proposed Rural Sanitation Project has been prepared by MOR with
PAHO's assistance since 1975. A similar project, financed by AID, has been
carried out in Region II since January 1977, wLth prolects now being executed
in 60 villages. 1/ The AID Drolect is vrogressing satisfactorily and will
finally serve 300 villages. The communities' response has been enthusiastic,
their contribution in cash or in labor often exceeded 15% of project costs,
and the execution rate is much faster than forecasted.
2                    2
3.02      Nicaragua has an area of 128,000 km , of which 9,642 km  are lakes.
Nícaragua's weather is mostly warm, with median temperatures around 26°C (790F)
and mínimum temperatures of 20 0C (680F).  The country is divided into 16
provinces with 126 municipalities and 5,000 villages. The population from
1965 to 1975 by provinces and regions is shown in Table 3.1.
Villages and Population to be Served
3.03      All Nicaraguan provinces except inaccessible areas in the Zelaya
province would be served by the ongoing AID and the proposed Bank projects.
The provision of sanitary services to the rural population in the project area
(Regions I, III and VI) has been difficult for several reasons:
(i)  Poverty, which reduces the rural population's capacity to
contribute to project works: according to the 1971 census,
77% of the population has an estimated per capita cash income
of $120 or less;
(ii)  Scattered population:  about 33% of the rural villages in
proposed project areas have 50 or fewer inhabitants (see
table below); and
(iii)  Limited access (jungle or poor roads):  on average only 26%
of the roads are usable during the rainy season (see
Table 3.1).
1/   A previous experience in the province of Esteli was used to prepare the
AID project.

3.04      In the project area there are 2,153 viLlages (1971 census) with
10 to 800 inhabitants and a total population of 344,000 persons. Most
villages (64%) have fewer than 100 inhabitants. The median population is 75
and the average population is 160 inhabitants.
3.05      The problem of sanitation in Nicaragua as a whole is evident
from the following:
(i)  The average life expectancy is about 52 years; lower than in
most Latin American countries (Argentina 72, Jamaica 67, Costa
Rica 62, Panama 64, Mexico 64, El Salvador 55). 1/
(ií) Infant mortality (deaths of children up to one year of age) is
estimated by PAHO at 146 per 1,000 birllhs.
(iii)  The percentage of deaths among children 1 to 4 years of age
attributed to enteritis and other diarrheal diseases, is the
highest in Latin America (37%), according to PAHO 2/.
(iv) According to PAHO, in 1975 only five countries in Latin
America (Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti and Paraguay) had
lower percentages of rural population than Nicaragua (14%)
with reasonable access to water. The percentage of rural
population served by latrines is somewhat better (24%).

3.06      The Government's strategy to solve these basic sanítation problems
at minimum cost is based on the following principles:
(i)  Community organization and contríbution (at least 15% for
construction) is essential for the construction, maintenance
and operation of the sanitary works;
(ii)  Rural sanitation works should use simple designs appropriate
for local maintenance;
(iii)  The rural sanitation program would be integrated, by including
water supply, latrines, home sanitation improvements and child
immunization;
(iv)  Health education would be a prerequisite and a first priority;
(v)  In the fírst stage, only víllages with access roads (at least
part of the year) would be included in this program.
Elígibility and design criteria consistent with these objectives have been
developed (See paragraph 3.08).
3.07      The villages within each state in Regions I, III and VI, for which
the Nicaraguan Government has requested Bank assistance, were classified
according to their population, type of water sources, and feasibility, either
technical or by the expected community participation. The results (Tables 3.2
to 3.4) are summarized below and show that about 172,000 persons (1971 census)
or 50% of the villages' population would be served in the 561 villages in the
project. It is estimated that the population served in these villages would
reach 250,000 persons by 1988. Their size, inaccessibility, or lack of
community participation would leave 1,592 (74%) villages for subsequent
projects.

EliRibility and Design Criteria
3.08      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the-following
eligibility and design criteria would be followed:
1.   Eligibility Criteria:  The following conditions are required
for village eligibility for the program:
(i)  Rural characteristics (according to the Census) and
population between 50 and 800 inhabitants in 1978; 1/
(ii) Community participation, either in labor or in cash,
of at least 15% of the project costs; community partíci-
pation in labor would be estimated using the prevailing
regional minimum wages. 2/
(iii) Per capita costs of the investment in water supply of less
than US$25 (1977 dollars). 3/
2.   Design Criteria:
(i)  The target population in each village is 90% of the popu-
lation in the next 10 years (using the provinces' rate of
growth for villages with less than 500 inhabitants);
(ii) Per capita supply by public standpipes will be 5 gallons
per capita per day (gcd) for dispersed populations, 10 gcd
for aqueducts and wells within easy access and 12 gcd if
livestock should be fed from the same sources;
(iii) For wells, the maximum walking distance in flat terrain,
would be about 500 meters (the average distance would be
around 300 meters); and
(iv) There would be three types of small aqueducts (used only if
they are the least-cost solution or the only alternative
to manually operated wells), with initial connections only to
the school or other comlmnity buildings. House connections
may be made later by the community. They are:
(a) Type A Aqueduct which includes gravity transmissions
from the water source. It is used when topographic
conditions make it possible;
1/   Urban towns with larger populations would continue to be served by DENACAL.
2/   The prevailing minimum wage in May 1977 was C$438 in Region VI and
C$462 in Regions I and III (US$63-66).
3/   Total cost of water investment (at 1977 constant prices) divided by the
target population (see 2 (1) above).



- 20 -
(b)  Type B Aqueducts which are the same as Type A but adding
storage for 1/2 day demand. They are used when sources
cannot satisfy the diurnal demand;
(c)  Type C Aqueducts which are used only for populations of
500 or more or when the water levels require mechanical
pumping (usually by wind). They will include water
storage for 1/2 day demand and some distribution.
(v)  Design would use the maximum local materials and community
labor. Different types of hand pumps are being tested to
establish which one is the least costly and 15 easier to
maintain by the communities.

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project has the following main objectives:
(i) to develop an integrated health and sanitation program to
help the poorest 30% of Nicaragua's population living in
small communities (average size 160 inhabitants, median
75 inhabitants);
(ii)  to educate the rural population in the use of safe water,
excreta disposal, house improvements, refuse disposal and
immunizatiQn programs;
(iii) to organize and train the community to be responsible for
contributing to the construction and to operate and maintain
the project works;
(iv) to strengthen the managerial and operational capabilities of
PLANSAR the executing agency for the Ministry of Health.
4.02      The basic concept of this project is to provide water in standpipes
with hand pumps (whose costs are now being optimized), using mechanized systems
(wind or eventually electricity) only when no other solution is feasible, and
making community involvement and participation the basic condition for project
execution.
Project Description
4.03.     The project is located in Regions I, III and VI (See table 3.1 and
Annex 4). Its components are:
(i) Construction of basic water supply subprojects for rural towns
with populations between 50 and 800 inhabitants (for popu-
lation distribution and population served by region, see
Tables 3.2-3.5). The project will cover about 550 towns
which qualify according to the eligibility and design
criteria (Para. 3.08). The solutions chosen will be the
least-cost solutions and are estimated to be (based on 1971
Census data of population):
(a)  building and equipping approximately 135 drilled wells
serving about 26,000 inhabitants;
(b)  building and equipping approximately 300 dug wells
serving about 53,000 inhabitants;
(c)  improving approximately 300 wells serving about
53,000 inhabitants; and
(d)  building approximately 77 aqueducts of different
types (A, B, and C) serving 41,000 inhabitants.



- 25 -
(ii)  Sanitary excreta disposal improvements of latrines (14,550),
rehabilitation of latrines (4,140), and additional latrines
(7,500), serving a total of 157,000 inhabitants;
(iii)  House improvements for better living conditions in 26,000  1/
houses (floor leveling, crack repair, inside partitions,
roof repair, adequate trash disposal, etc.);
(iv)  Vaccines to immunize about 72,000 children 5 years of age or
younger 1/ against measles, polio, DPT, BCG and TAB;
(v)  Equipment to be ised bY PLANSAR in the execution of the
project, mainly office and communication equipment, jeeps
and trucks;
(vi)  Project Technical Adviser to assist PLANSAR (see para. 2.03).
Technical assistance consultants to make recommendations for
project cost control, programming and supervision of
construction;
(vii)  PLANSAR educational personnel to provide health instruc-
tion and promote community organization;
(viii)  PLANSAR administrative and engineering personnel to plan
the technical solutions, direct community construction works,
procure the required materials and equipments and.train the
community to maintain its own systems.
4.04      Project componenta (iii) and (iv) are not being proposed for Bank
financing because their respective expenditures would be excessively difficult
to supervise and control. Project component (viii) is proposed to be financed
out of MOR budget in addition to items (iii) and (iv).
4.05      The number of villages to be served and the number of each type of
works undertaken, will be based on the elegibility and design criteria and the
experience gained under the project. These numbers may be adjusted from time
to time by agreement between the government of Nicaragua and the Bank.
Project Costs
4.06      Project cost estimates were made using data from projects presently
under construction, representing costs as of January 1977. Total project cost
is estimated at US$6.3 million. Physical contingencies are 30% for drilled
wells, 5% for engineering and administration and 10% for all other itea .
Community participation was estimated on the basis of average hours of work
(using the experience of the AID project) and the minimum regional wages.
Inflation in Nicaragua has been traditionally low (2% average between 1965-
1972), thus after the period 1977-1978 for which 12% and 9% price increases
1/ The aggregate number of houses improved and children inmunized is a
function of the aggregate number of subproject.

are forecasted worldwide inflation (7.5%) is used for local price contin-
gencies. The price contingencies for foreign cost are estimated at 7.5% for
1978-1979 and 7% thereafter. The investment program (Table 4.3) 1s summarized

Financing
4.07  -    Project expenditures for the rural sanitation program would be
US$6.3 million. 'The Bank loan, US$3.0 million, will fínance 47.6% of
these capital expenditures, equivalent to the foreign cost component (US$2.3
million) plus about US$0.7 million (18%) of local costs. Local cost financing
is justified to assure a reasonable Bank participation in a project which
has a low foreign component but which represents a key initiative to improve



- 27 -
living conditions for families within the lowest income groups in
Nicaragua. Community contributions in cash and labor would finance
22% of the capital expenditures, and the remaining 30% would be
financed by the Government. Although the minimum community contrí-
bution is 15% in any village, the average contribution is expected to
reach 22% (see para. 5.03).
Project Implementation
4.08      Each PLANSAR Regional Unit would consist of offices in two or
three conveniently located villages within the Region. The offices would
be moved to a different area upon completion of subprojects. Each office
would be the operational center for villages within a radius of 50-100
kílometers.
4.09      A PLANSAR educator would visit each village, sensitize the community
to its basic health problems, and organize, usually with the participation of
the local school teacher; an appropriate civic-minded Health Committee (HC)
or cooperative. The HC would elect their President (a community leader) as
well as a Treasurer and a Secretary. The PLANSAR educator and the HC would
evaluate the community's health problems and possible solutions. The educator
would also assess the community's willingness and ability to participate in
the project. If the educator's report is favorable, PLANSAR would send an
engineer to study the least-cost solution for water supply and the project
cost.
4.10      A typical project would include:  water supply (usually by hand
pumps), latrines, children immunization, drainage projects for mosquito
control and home improvements (appropriate waste disposal, roof, floor and
wall improvements and water hook-up in rural towns where a water distribution
system would be installed). Health education on communicable diseases and
basic sanitation would be provided simultaneously to the community. Several
innovative solutions are being tested by PLANSAR for reliability and easy
maintenance (new types of hand pumps, horizontal wells, different types of
latrines, etc.).
4.11      A written request would then be presented by the HC to PLANSAR
describing the works to be done, their schedule, and the community contribu-
tion (in work days, materials and cash). Cash contributions would be collected
by the community Treasurer using receipts provided by PLANSAR. Upon review by
the Project Technical Adviser and approval of the request by PLANSAR, a  con-
tract would be signed between the Government (PLANSAR) and, on behalf of the
community the corresponding municipality or an association of members of such
community (usually a cooperative). This contract will describe the works to
be performed and the respective contributions, and make the Community respon-
sible for the future operation and maintenance of the works under MOH super-
vision (para 5.04). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
prior to loan effectiveness, an appropriate contract format to be used for
villages participating in the project, should be submitted for Bank review,
with satisfactory evidence that legislation exists for cooperatives or munici-
palities adequate to allow them to sign this contract on behalf of the communi-
ties. Assurances were also obtained that the Government will take appropriate
steps for the expeditious granting of legal personality to each cooperative.



- 28 -
4.12      The Regional Unit would request the specific non-local materials,
tools and equipment from the Central Office. A small storage of common
materials (latrines and hand tools) would be kept in the regional offices.
The Central Office would procure the materials and equipment throughout the
"Rural Administration" Department. Advance procurement in groups of hand
pumps, latrines, materials, equipment and tools would be made, and all items
would be stored in MOH warehouses (See para. 4.22).
4.13      PLANSAR would direct the community works or would contract the
necessary works (especially for drilled wells and some aqueducts). Simul-
taneously, the community organization would be strengthened by providing
training to its leaders and teaching one or two persons the required skills
to maintain and operate the water system.
4.14      PLANSAR's Planning Department would coordinate the programs of the
different Regional Units, produce simple design standards, plan the critical
path for works and control their execution, as well as produce the instruc-
tional materials required for community education. It would also calculate
the monitoring indicators (para 5.07) and send to the Bank the information
needed to establish that the elegibility and design criteria (para 3.08) had
been followed.
4.15      Upon project completion, the supervision responsibility of the
operation and maintenance will be given to the Ministry of Health (Rural
Administration).
4.16      The coordination with the AID project will be achieved through
the PLANSAR Directorate, sharing the experiences and results obtained. The
educators needed for the project are being trained under the AID project (most
of them are women). Since each Regional Unit is self-sufficient and works
independently no mutual interference is forecasted between the two projects.
4.17      The project is scheduled to begin in January 1978.  The construc-
tion is programmed considering that there is no access to some areas during
the rainy season, and in other areas local labor (which is part of the
community contribution) is not available during crop season.  With the pro-
posed staff increase (para. 2.04) and technical assistance (para. 2.03),
PLANSAR will have the capacity to carry out satisfactorily the project.

4.18      140H has indicated that the Government expects that the cooperatives
or associations to be formed for the purposes of this project will also be
used in the future to organize communities for other programs -- such as
nutrition, family planning and education -- which would form part of inte-
grated rural development.
4.19      The project contains an estimated 58 man-months of consulting
services (see Annex 1) at an average cost of US$3,400 per man-month. The low
average cost is due to the direct hiring of individual consultants and the
simplicity of the project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
a "Project Technical Adviser" (see para 2.03) would be appointed as a condition
of effectiveness and that the Bank would approve the "Project Technical Adviser's"
terms of reference, qualifications and contract. Assurances were also
obtained that PLANSAR will employ, by not later than March 1, 1978, suitable
qualified consultants acceptable to the Bank to review PLANSAR procedures and
make recommendations on project cost control, programming and supervision of
construction.
Procurement
4.20      All contracts for materials or equipment with an estimated cost
of US$20,000, or more or civil works contracts with an estimated cost of
US$100,000 or more, would be awarded through international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for lower amounts may be
awarded on the basís of competitive bidding in accordance with local procure-
ment procedures acceptable to the Bank provided, however, that the aggregate
costs of these contracts for material, equipment and civil works do not
exceed US$500,000. Bank procurement practices and policies have been accepted
by the Ministry of Health and no major procurement problems are forecasted.
4.21      Suppliers from the Central American Common Market, including those
in Nicaragua, will be allowed a preference of either 15% of the CIF price,
or 50% the import duties applicable to suppliers from non-member countries,
whichever is lower. It is expected that most civil work contracts would be
won by Nicaraguan firms, and most of the equipinent and material supply con-
tracts would be won by foreign suppliers.
4.22      The proposed major contract packages in US$ million are:  equipment
(vehicles, office equipment) US$0.2; drilled wells, US$0.5; pipes and materials
for aqueducts, US$0.3; pumps and wells materials, US$0.2; materials for latrine
construction, US$0.5.
4.23      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that PLANSAR will keep
a separate account of the materials procured under the proposed Bank loan, the
expenses incurred in project construction and the community contribution, and
that these accounts would be submitted annually to the Bank (see para 2.06).
4.24      Assurances were also be obtained that a schedule of the villages
to be served during the following calendar year and a procurement schedule
proposal would be presented by the Director of PLANSAR to the Bank before bids
are invited for these villages. Advance procurement would then be made in
suitable groups for common materials (pumps, pipes, latrines, etc) for these
villages.

4.25        A draft of the tender documents general conditions for international
competitive bidding or local procurement would be prepared for the first bid,
and, upon Bank acceptance would be used for subsequent bids.
Rural Sanitation Disbursements

CHAPTER V
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
MINISTRY OF HEALTH BUDGET
Budget
5.01      The total health budget of Nicaragua reached C$187 million in 1976,
twice the 1972 budget or an increase of 35% higher in constant prices. The
per capita health expenditures increased from C$45.3 (US$6.5) to C$78.4
(US$11.2) per person. Nevertheless, the budgeted share of health expenditures
declined from 11.6% of Nicaragua's budget in 1972 to 8.4% in 1976 due to the
large increase in the Government's overall budget resulting from reconstruc-
tion expenditures and increased service of the public debt following Managua's
earthquake. The total health budget has been as follows:
1972              1976
C$ Million  %    C$ Million   %
Ministry of Health (MOH)                29.1   31.6    65.4    34.8
DENACAL                                 15.1   16.4    40.9    21.8
Hospitals                              47.8   52.0    81.5    43.4
92.0  100.0   187.8   100.0
5.02      The direct Ministry of Health (MOH) expenses increased by 125% in
five years, reflecting a major emphasis in preventive health care. The medical
services program operates health centers; it accounted for 34% of MOH budget
in 1976, employing 1,037 persons. The malaria eradication program accounts
for 32% of MOH budget, and the central administration for 10%. The other 25%
includes environmental sanitation, health education, laboratory services and
community development. Only 7% of expenditures were for capital outlays, and
about 30% for operating costs; personnel costs to total expenditures decreased
from 70% to 58% between 1972 and 1976.

Financing Plan
5.03      The PLANSAR financing plan summarized below is based on the follow-
ing assumptions:



- 34 -
(í)  Mínimum cost solution according to the design and selection
criteria (Section 3.08);
(ii)  Community participation in labor, materials, and cash averaging
22%, but at least 15% in each case (see Annex 5);
(iii)  Government budgetary allocations to cover the remaining project
costs - Col$13.3 million (US$1.9 míllion). No special problems are
expected to obtain this government allocation (about US$0.5
million per year).
(iv) Bank loan of US$3.0 million (47.6% of the project cost; see
para. 4.06).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government contribution
to the project would be adequately budgeted.

Operation and Maintenance
5.04      The communities will own, operate, and maintain the systems (after
training by PLANSAR). Cash operating costs usually are small because most
systems are hand-operated and administered by the community. Maintenance
costs vary from C$160 per year for simple well systems (about C$1.0 per
capita) to about C$2,000 per year for aqueducts, type C (about C$4 per capita),
which is considered achievable because it represents about 1% of the rural
families'average cash income (about C$2,500 per family in 1976 prices).
Maintenance allowances would be collected during the crop season and kept by
the communities. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
communities in the towns served would be organized, trained and made respon-
sible, by contract, to collect the maintenance allowances, to maintain and
operate the water systems, and that the Ministry of Health will assume the
supervision and assist the communities in the operation and maintenance of
works under a continuous basis and with adequately trained staff (see para.
4.10).



- 35 -
5.05      The MOH expenses required to supervise the operation and maintenance
of water systems average about C$2,700 per village, including about one
man-month per village per year (see Table 5.1).
Monitoring Indicators
5.06      The variables shovn in Table 5.2 are considered important monitoring
indicators for PLANSAR to assess target accompli.shment and project execution.
These monitoring indicators should be reported quarterly to the Bank. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that a system of monitoring indicators,
acceptable to the Bank, would be established not. later than March 31, 1978.

CHAPTER VI
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
6.01      The economic benefits of the proposed sanitation project are
difficult to estimate in monetary units, even if we know that they result in
improved living conditions for a population, increased work productivity,
reduction in medical and hospitalization costs, increase in effective nutri-
tion due to reduction of intestinal parasites (especially in children), land
valorization after provision of water services, more equal distribution of
access to services, etc. Although it is not possible to quantify all these
benefits, they are expected to be large.
Project Benefits
6.02      A meaningful measure of the economic benefits for the rural
sanitation project is not possible, not only because of the scarcity of data,
but also because the project is designed to provide an integrated approach to
basic sanitation and health, including many dissimilar components (water
supply, latrines, latrine improvements, garbage disposal, house improvements,
immunization, etc.). A considerable part of the project cost (20%) are
expenses in community organization and basic health education, which not only
should result in better health, but will also contribute to the overall
economic welfare of the population. The beneficiaries willingness to pay for
these perceived benefits will be demonstrated by their contribution of at
least 15% of project costs and all operating and maintenance expenses.
6.03      The need for this basic sanitation program in rural areas is based
on the desirability for improvement in average life expectancy, infant mor-
tality, level of rural population with access to safe water (14%) and death
rate of children aged 1 to 4 years attributed to enteritis and other diarrheal
diseases 1/.
6.04      The rural sanitation program would provide services in about 550
towns, to a population of 172,000 inhabitants (based on the latest census data
of 1971) expecting to reach 250,000 persons by 1988. About 50% of the popu-
lation living in these towns (10 to 800 persons) would be served. The target
population for this program are the poorest inhabitants in Nicaragua, living
below what AID considers the following minimum threshhold of socio-economic
standards:
(i) National life expectancy is below 55 years (about 52 years average
in Nicaragua, and even lower in rural areas);
(ii) Infant mortality in excess of 33 per thousand (146 in Nicaragua
according to CELADE-PAHO and probably higher in the rural areas).
1/   The highest in Latin America (37%) to be compared with Colombia (23%),
Ecuador (22%), Uruguay (8%) and Canada (2%) (see para 3.05).



- 40 -
(íii)  Annual incomes below $150 (about $120 in Nicaragua rural areas
based on a head of household income survey in 1973);
(iv)  Less than 60% of the population having regular access to
health services (about 20% in Nicaragua rural areas);
(v) Birth rates higher than 2.5% (about 4.5% in Nicaragua rural
areas).
6.05      This project is the first Bank water supply project designed to
provide services exclusively to the lowest income rural population, living in
dispersed areas (maximum population 800 and median population of only 75
inhabitants per village). Total per capita costs of the project, for the
projected design (1988) population are about US$19 per person served (1977
prices) and the project investment per year represents less than 1% of
Nicaragua's public sector investment. Accordingly, the project would be
replicable to cover future needs. With the exception of inaccessible areas in
Zelaya, all of Nícaragua's provinces would be served through the implemen-
tation of this project and the one being executed by AID.
Rísks
6.06      The main risk for the rural sanitation program is the short expe-
rience of PLANSAR in project implementation which may delay the project execu-
tíon. However, in the execution of the present AID program, PLANSAR so far is
performing ahead of schedule and work programming is satisfactory. The
cechnical assistance component to PLANSAR would help ensure proper project
execution.  The continuity of community organizatíon to maintain and operate
che systems is also a risk; however, the continuous supervision and support of
OH, the simplicity of the systems, and the reduced maintenance needs of the
works ensure that the risks are no greater than can normally be expected with
water supply and sewerage projects. Consequently, the risk of not achieving
the project objectives is judged medium to low.
Environmental Implications
6.07      Water and excreta disposal problems would be dealt with simulta-
neously. Therefore, no adverse effects can be expected from the project;
on the contrary, soil surface levels of contamínation would be reduced as
a result of latrinization in the rural area.

CHAPTER VII
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government of Nicaragua that:
(1) It will maintain or cause to be maintained adequate records
which adequately reflect, in accordance with sound accounting
practices, the operation, resources and expenditures in
respect to the project or any of its parts and that a report
from the Government auditors on such records would be sent to
the Bank not later than April 30 of the following year
(para. 2.06 and 4.23);
(ii)  The Administration of the Rural Health Program would be
adequately budgeted and staffed (parai 2.05), reinforcing the
personnel of the accounting and procurement sections in a
manner acceptable to the Bank;
(iii)  Unless the Bank otherwise agrees, the eligibility and design
crítería descríbed in paragraph 3.08 will be used for all
villages in the project;
(iv)  The number of villages to be served and the number of each
type of works undertaken, will be based on the eligibility
and design criteria and the experience gained under the
project. These number may be adjusted from time to time
by agreement between the government and the Bank (paragraph
4.05);
(v)  A schedule of the villages to be served during the following
calendar year and a proposal of a procurement schedule
would be presented by PLANSAR's Director for Bank approval
before bids are invited for those villages (para. 4.24);
(vi)  It will establish, not later than March 31, 1978, a system
of Monitoring Indicators acceptable to the Bank and report
on them quarterly (para. 5.06);
(vii)  It will adequately budget the PLANSAR Rural Sanitation Program
(para. 5.03);
(viii) PLANSAR will employ consultants acceptable to the Bank to make
recommendations for project cost control, programming and
supervision of construction, not later than March 1, 1978
(para. 4.19).
(ix)  Unless the Bank otherwise agree it will adequately staff a
second PLANSAR Regional Unit for the project not later than
January 1, 1979 (para. 2.04);



- 42 -
(x) As a condition of effectiveness, it will engage a `Project
Technical Adviser" under terms of reference, qualifications
and conditions acceptable to the Bank, who would províde
assistance in the preparation of bidding documents, tender
analysis, community organization, and implementation of
low-cost technical solutions for water and sanitation.
The "Project Technical Adviser" should also review the
village contracts (prior to PLANSAR's approval) to ensure
that the eligibility and design criteria (para 3.08) are
being followed (paragraphs 2.03 and 4.19);
(xi) As a condition of effectiveness, it will adequately staff one
PLANSAR Regional Unit for the project with at least 44
employees (21 of them engineers, health educators or techni-
cians) (paragraph 2.04); and
(xii) As a condition of effectiveness, it would submit for Bank review
an appropriate contract format to be signed between the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua and on behalf of the community the corres-
ponding municipality, or association of members of such
community (usually a cooperative),and will provide to the Bank
satisfactory evidence that legislation exists for cooperatives
or municipalities adequate to allow local organizations to sign
this contract on behalf of the communities. The Government will
will also take appropriate steps for the expeditious granting
of legal personality to each community association or coopera-
tive.   The contract should specify the works to be done in
each village, the community and MOH contributions, and make the
community responsible for the collection of the maintenance
allowances, the operation and maintenance of the water supply
system under MOH's supervision (para 4.11);
7.02      Provided the foregoíng conditions are met, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$3.0 million.  The loan would be for
17 years including a grace period of four years.
