Rural Sanitation Project seeks to\n            improve basic sanitation services to rural areas by\n            providing an integrated program of water supply, latrines,\n            sanitary house improvements, health education and child\n            immunization. About 172,000 people (1971 census) in about\n            550 dispersed villages would benefit from the project, with\n            an estimated 250,000 to be served in these villages by 1988;\n            the population to be reached is made up mostly of persons\n            within the lowest income groups in Nicargua. Most of the\n            project benefits are unquantifiable (increased work\n            productivity, increase in effective nutrition), and with an\n            integrated project of this nature it is difficult to isolate\n            the benefits of each component. It is clear, however, that\n            the project will contribute substantially to improvements in\n            health and welfare generally, as reflected in the provision\n            of safe water, increased life expectancy and reduced\n            mortality rates of infants and young children."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
