             FIRST POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                         CreditandProgramSummary

Borrower:        The Republic o f Cape Verde

Amount:          SDR 9.7 million(US$15 million equivalent)

Terms:           Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period

Description:     The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-1) will support the
                 implementation o f Cape Verde's Growth and Poverty Reduction
                 Strategy (GPRSP). This one-tranche operation would be the first
                 o f a planned series o f three annual PRSCs. The financial support
                 provided through the PRSC will narrow the gap between the cost
                 o f implementing key elements o f the GPRSP and resources
                 available from Govemment's own domestic revenues and other
                 donor support. A policy dialogue and results-based framework
                 under PRSC-1 will focus on the following pillars of the GPRSP:
                 (i)promote good govemance, (ii)develop humancapital inthe
                 areas o f education and health, and (iii)  improve the effectiveness
                 and sustainability o f the social protection system.

Benefits:        Interms ofbenefits, the value added of the PRSC lies inboth the
                 nature o f the instrument and the results that are expected:
                 (i) improved functioning o f national budget systems, (ii)  reduced
                 transaction costs and distortions due to international assistance,
                 (iii)better linkages between sectors and cross-cutting issues,
                 (iv) improved service delivery for the poor, and (v) improved well-
                 beingo fthe population.

Risks:           There     are    several      risks    associated   with   PRSC-1:
                 (i) macroeconomic shocks could undermine stability and growth,
                 (ii) electoralcyclecouldbringaboutfiscalslippagesandstall
                      the
                 implementation o f the more sensitive policy reforms, and (iii) there
                 could be a short-term reduction in aid effectiveness in the shift to
                 usingnational budgetand administrative systems.

                    PROGRAMDOCUMENT FORA PROPOSED
                FIRST POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                       TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE

                                I. INTRODUCTION

 1.     The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-1) to Cape Verde for
 SDR 9.7 million (US$15 million equivalent) on standard Intemational Development
 Association (IDA) terms supports the implementation o f the Government's poverty
 reduction strategy, as presented in the document Growth and Poverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (GPRSP)* and summarized in the Letter o f Development Policy in
 Annex 1. PRSC-1 i s the first ina series o f three annual single-tranche operations.

 2.      The proposed PRSC-1 is a response to the Government's request for their
 external partners to align with national strategies and systems for poverty reduction, as
 agreed at the Donor's Roundtable Meeting in Praia, in April 2003. The move to
 supporting poverty reduction through programmatic lending i s consistent with Cape
 Verde's level o f institutional, economic and political development and acknowledges
 the country's strong and sustainedperformance inrecent years.

 3.      The reform program associated with this operation i s at the core o f IDA'S
 FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).3 The PRSC series would account for
 about 60 percent o f proposed base case and high case new IDA lending over the next
 four years. The CAS will maintain flexibility to employ other Bank instruments in
 support o f the GPRSP, such as sectoral investment projects in transport, infrastructure
 and HIV/AIDS, notably.

 4.      As agreed during regional review, the proposed operation o f SDR 9.7 million
 (US$15 million equivalent) i s above the IDA ceiling for the country. This i s justified
 by its specificity as a small island economy, its consistently highCPIA ratings, and the
 opportunity o f programmatic lendingto serve as a key leverage for donor coordination.

 5.      The objective o f the project is to support the Government to (a) meet the
 objectives o f its GPRSP; and (b) improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency
 of the national budget process as the central mechanism for channeling resources
 toward poverty reduction. The proposed PRSC would engage the Bank in policy and
 technical dialogue in three o f the five pillars o f the GPRSP, based on division o f labor
 with other IDA and donor projects and comparative advantage o fthe PRSC:

   (a) Promote good govemance, reinforcing effectiveness and guaranteeing equity -
       centered on reforms inpublic expenditure management, civil service, the judiciary
       anddecentralization;
   (b) Develop andenhancehumancapital, with a focus onhealth andeducation; and
   (c) Strengthenthe effectiveness and sustainability o f the social protection system.

    11.     RECENTPROGRESSAND KEYDEVELOPMENTCHALLENGES

                                   A.    Country Overview

 6.       Cape Verde i s a small Portuguese-speaking archipelago located off the coast o f
 West Africa. Half o f the total population o f 450,000 lives on the island o f Santiago, of
 which half lives in the capital city, Praia. Due to the country's Sahelian climate, the
 rural economy frequently suffers from drought and only one-tenth o f the land i s arable.
 The vulnerabilities o f its ecological base and the related devastating famines have ledto
 a history o f out-migration, with a large diaspora residing inEurope and the U.S.A.

 7.       Cape Verde i s a success story among African nations.      Following a shift from a
 socialist to a market-oriented model in the late 1 9 8 0 ~Cape Verde's growth
                                                                       ~
 performance has raised it to the ranks o f lower middle income countries, with a GNI
 per capita o f US$ 1,400 in 2002. Recent economic growth o f around 4 percent per
 capita has been sustained through public and private investmentbased on highlevels o f
 donor support, strong private capital flows and remittances. This growth has enabled
 poverty to decline by one-fourth over the last decade.                The index o f human
 development has increased from 0.59 in 1990 to 0.67 in 2003. Literacy rates are high
 and life expectancy at birthi s the thirdhighest inAfrica.

  8.      Political openness has accompanied this economic and social progress. Since
 the adoption o f a multi-party system in 1991, there have been three national elections
  and two orderly changes in govemment. A free press and media hrther support the
 buildingo f an open society. The next presidential elections will be inearly 2006.

  9.      But challenges remain. As a small, open economy, Cape Verde's vulnerabilities
 to external shocks are high. The country relies heavily on remittances and foreign aid.
 Despite improvements in the unemployment rate in the 1 9 9 0 ~unemployment remains
                                                                        ~
  stubbornly highat about 17 percent. Income inequality has risen and i s generally worse
  than in countries o f comparable income levels, creating a potential drag on growth and
  threatening social cohesion.       Geographical dispersion drives internal inequities and
  raises the cost o f service delivery. As rural populations flee entrenched poverty,
  urbanization i s causing increasing social ills and puts pressure on basic services. Overall,
  the ecological capacity to support large-scale expansion in tourism, industry and
  construction may be at risk ifnot adequately managed.

                       B.       Macroeconomic and Fiscal Performance

  10.     Recent macroeconomic performance has been favorable. Table 1 presents
  selected economic indicators. Despite a drastic fiscal contraction in 2001 to reassert
  control over public expenditure after pre-election over-spending, annual growth has
 remained above 4 percent. The current account deficit remains stable since 2001,
  reflecting effective demand management, low import growth, sustained inflows of
  remittances o f almost 20 percent o f GDP, and better management o f the country's

exposure to external shocks like oil price increases. Foreign direct investment and
donor disbursements have also helped to increase reserves at the Central Bank to 2
months of imports, higher than the original target for the three-year PRGFprogram.

 11.     Economic growth for 2004 i s projected at 4 percent and inflation i s around 1.5
percent. Contrary to most o f Sub-Saharan Africa, the economy relies primarily on
 services, which account for 72 percent o f GDP. The main source o f growth i s expected
 to be tourism, with increases in related services, such as hotels and restaurants,
 transport, and communication. The medium-term GDP growth rate is projected at 5
percent with an inflation rate under 2 percent. The current account deficit (excluding

grants) i s expected to remain steady at 10 percent o f GDP, based on continued inflows
o f remittances and fiscal prudence. However, this scenario could be jeopardized by
contingent liabilities of autonomous institutes, State-owned enterprises and utilities.

12.     Contingent liabilities may be accumulating in State-owned enterprises, utilities,
municipalities or other autonomous public institutions, and there i s a risk that the
Government may refrain from taking rapid action to curtail their impact on the budget,
thus causing (a) diversions of expenditure away from key sectors o f intervention, or
(b) increased domestic borrowing and crowding out of private sector credit. Either of
these developments would affect negatively the medium term fiscal framework and
attainment o fthe Government's poverty reduction objectives.

13.     Given its high vulnerability to external shocks, fiscal discipline is central to
macroeconomic stability. The fixed exchange rate regime (pegged to the Euro) i s one
o f the mainstays o f macroeconomic stability and growth. It contributes to a sound
investment climate, and helps sustain the flow o f remittances that fuel investments and
consumption. However, the regime limits monetary policy, which in turns constrains
fiscal policy. Public expenditures are highat 31percent o f GDP in2003 and conditions
do not allow for much room to expand. Fiscal performance has improved markedly
since the slippages o f 1999/2000. As a result o f expenditure cuts and renewed donor
engagement, the deficit (including grants) i s estimated to be 3.5 percent o f GDP in
2003. However, pressure for increased expenditures will come fkom expansion in
secondary education and an aging population that demands health services.
Furthermore, space will need to be found for complementary poverty interventions
anticipated inthe GPRSP inorder to alleviate the impact o f inequalities and ensure that
the poor can engage inthe opportunities afforded by economic growth.

               C.      PovertyTrends andProgressTowardsthe MDGs

14.     With a strong record o f economic growth and social investment, Cape Verde is
on target to reach most MDGs by 2015 (Table 2). If GDP continues to grow at the
same rate, poverty may be reduced by half in2015. However, the remaining poverty i s
likely to be more entrenched and growth alone may be insufficient. MDG education
targets have already largely been met, and health indicators are on track, with the
exception o f immunization rates where more efforts are needed. Meeting the provision
o f water and sanitation will entail significant investment, but urbanization will ease
meeting this goal. In all cases, however, overall national progress conceals important
geographic variations.

 15.    The share o f the population in poverty has fallen by one-fourth in the 1990s
from 49 to 37 percent, with the population in extreme poverty estimated at 21 percent.
The share of total householdconsumption devotedto food was reduced from 50 percent
to 35 percent, reflecting a reduction in the number o f poor vulnerable to basic food
insecurity. However, while poverty was reduced, inequality has increased. The Gini
index for per capita expenditure rose from to 0.50 in 1988 to 0.53 in2002, exacerbating
the already high concentration o f consumption among the richest.

 16.       About half o f the rural population i s poor and about one-quarter o f urban
dwellers are below the poverty line. The most rural islands, like Santo Antgo, Fog0 and
Brava, have significantly higher poverty rates. They are also the most isolated islands,
with especially hightransport costs and, for Brava, no regular air links. More limited
access to quality education and health care, isolation due to bad roads, and low
productivity agriculture contribute to the entrenched nature o f rural poverty. At the
household level, the main determinants o f poverty are size o f household, education
levels, employment, gender and lack o f access to migrant remittances.

 face constraints, such as lengthy procedures to establish a business, inadequate
 infrastructure (e.g., energy, water) and limited access to finance, particularly for small
 enterprises, agriculture, and fisheries. The banking sector does not appear to face


                                                5

 significant systemic risk, but interest rates remain high at an average 13 percent and
 competition i s limited since the two leading commercial banks hold more than 90
 percent o f all assets. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's), a critical segment
 for poverty reduction, suffer from well-documented problems in securing access to
 credit, which typically translate into higher interest rates. To lower the lendingrate, the
 Government i s (a) limitingits domestic financing requirementsto almost nilfor the past
 two years; (b) promoting financial sector competition by banking with an expanded
 number o fbanks; (c) improving contract-enforcement mechanisms; and (d) developing
 a central credit registry. To improve the creditworthiness o f SME's specifically, it i s
 (a) inviting the two chambers o f commerce to develop outreach programs to improve
 the financial literacy o f SME's, with a view to opening a bank account, and improving
 the presentation o f their financial information; (b) promoting the use o f the banking
 system to make tax payments; and (c) providing direct support to SME's through a
 matching grant mechanism, to help strengthenenterprises through technical assistance.

 18.     Faster progress in implementing key private sector development reforms i s
 crucial. The implementation o f the divestiture program remains incomplete. There has
 been a notable slowdown inpursuingthe program during the past five years, and key
 pending divestitures include EMPROFAC, TACV and the ENAPOR, enterprises
 involved in drugs and transport services. They constitute fiscal liabilities, and the large
 annual subsidiesto TACV may drain resources from more pro-poor expenditures.

 19.     Trade policy reforms should continue. Reforms implemented in early 2004
 have improved tariff structures and shifted revenue instruments to VAT and excise
 taxes. Tariffs still remain high by international standards (7 bands between 0 and 50
 percent) and contribute to the high cost o f economic activity.              Further trade
 liberalization i s expected inthe context o f Cape Verde's accession to WTO.

 20.     The formal labor market is too rigid. Unions are strong in ports, the public
 sector and parastatals, transport, and utilities. The effective cost o f labor imposed by
 labor regulations remains excessive and pension and severance provisions hinder
 flexibility. The Government i s drafting a new labor code to improve labor mobility.

Improve coverage and management of basic infrastructure

 21.      Since Cape Verde consists o f sparsely-populated islands, transport and other
 infrastructure costs are high, which i s an issue both for international competitiveness
 and for the cost o f living o f the population within the country. The introduction o f
 private participation in all infrastructure sectors has improved service delivery, even
 though more remote communities continue to face access problems, particularly in the
 mountainous interior of some of the larger islands. Since privatization, teledensity has
 increased and water generation and distribution has expanded.              However, partly
 reflecting the small and segmented domestic market, the cost o f these services i s quite
 high. Despite IDA support, efforts have yet to yield an effective utility regulation
 mechanism. This i s due to some politicization o f the process as well as indecision on
 the appropriate institutional arrangements.

Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector

 22.     With respect to governance, the country receives relatively high marks for
 political stability, rule of law, and voice and accountability, while further efforts are
 needed in other areas, such as Government effectiveness and quality o f the regulatory
 regime. Of note, unlike in many countries in the sub-region, the residents o f Cape
 Verde do not perceive corruption as a major issue, as shown inthe 2004 Afrobarometer
 surveys.6 In addition analysis by WB17 shows that the control o f corruption in Cape
 Verde i s about twice higher than other sub-Saharan countries, and converging towards
 Europeannorms. Despite difficulties with the implementationo f financial management
 procedures, including delays in the annual review o f general accounts o f the State by
 the Tribunal das Contas (TdC, Auditor General Office), public monies appear to have
 been managed transparently, and in the general interest.            This perception o f low
 corruption i s corroborated by budget execution figures that are close to original
 allocations, little divergence between the State's accounts, its log o f treasury
 operations, and the record o f transactions on its account at the Central Bank, and
 general information gathered from private and public sector operators. Nonetheless, the
 public finance reforms proposed will further reinforce transparency.

 23.     Recent analysis (CFAA, PER and CPAR) confirms the general soundness o f
 public expenditure management, although its underlying systems need improvement
 and modernization in key areas, such as: (a) further integrating investment and
 expenditure budgets, developing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to
 guide resource allocation and linking sector budgets to programmatic outcomes,
 (b) reinforcing financial controls, including more timely audits, (c) more effective tax
 administration through improved information management; (d) development of
 adequate procurement legislation; and (e) control o f contingent liabilities.


 24.     The central Government generally has a strong record o f delivering a good mix
 o f quality and quantity o f public services. While the need for decentralization in a
 population o f 450,000 may not be immediately obvious, the island structure o f Cape
 Verde, including four islands with under 15,000 population calls for moving the locus
 o f decision-making and monitoring o f service provision to.the local level. Current
 proposals for strengthening decentralization to the municipalities underpinthe intended
 goal to further improve policy responsiveness and implementation, as well as increase
 citizen access to information inorder to increase local accountability.

 25.     A top priority o f the Government will be to integrate public sector reform
 priorities focused on the main bottlenecks to a modern administration. Inthe absence
 o f such an integrated strategy, ad-hoc institutional reforms are threatening the ability o f
 the Government to coordinate its actions and underminingaccountability, as i s the case
 with the proliferation o f autonomous institutions with specific missions and their own
 revenue streams, and the creation o f special frameworks to retain critical staff, instead

 o f a more comprehensive civil service reform. Another priority will be to raise citizen
 awareness o f and access to the judicial system, particularly for the poor, and to develop
 alternative disputeresolutionmechanisms to improve efficiency o f the overall legal and
 judicial system.

Develop human capital

 26.     The Government sees expansion in access to and improved quality o f
 educational opportunities as central to long-term poverty reduction. Demand for pre-
 school i s very high, with positive impacts both o f child development and women's
 potential access to the labor market. Universal enrollment at the primary level has
 created a surge in demand for secondary education. Enrollment figures in secondary
 increased three-fold from 16,000 in 1994 to about 50,000 students in 2002-2003, a
 figure that i s expected to grow to 64,000 in 2009/2010. While the Government has
 instituted fees for secondary education, its unit costs are more than 2.5 times that o f
 primary education. Expanding access to both pre-school and tertiary education will
 further test the financial framework o f the sector. Revamping professional training and
 the apprenticeship system is important for providing opportunities of further education
 to a growing number o f students who only completed primary education and do not
 have the skills needed to enter the job market.

 27.     Despite impressive strides in health outcomes, such as the eradication o f many
  contagious diseases that undermine development on the African continent, non-
  communicable diseases are becoming more prevalent, and claim an increasing share o f
  the health care budget. This strains the financial sustainability o f the health system.
  The main challenges for the Government will be to develop a sustainable health
  financing framework including expansion o f insurance coverage, and address inequities
  inaccessto services includingmedicines for thepoor.

Create a sustainable social protection system

  28.    A further challenge will be to reduce vulnerability and social exclusion,
  particularly among those least able to avoid or cope with shocks. The long-term risk o f
  drought has led generations o f Cape Verdians to mitigate this risk through labor
  migrations. The remaining rural population has been supported by labor-intensive
  public works schemes (FAIMO - Frente de A h Intensidade de MCo de Obra), but the
  system requires reform to create a springboard out o f poverty through better
  accumulation o f skills, stimulus o f the private sector, more efficient and transparent
  management, and increased impact o f infrastructure created to boost rural productivity
  and access to services. Management o f risks to health, livelihood and access to services
  by vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, children and youth at risk, and single mothers) are
  addressed through a patchwork o f social assistance programs by both public and NGO
  providers, with little overall coordination o f the quality, targeting or impact o f these
  services. In terms o f formal social security systems, the aging ex-FAIMO workforce
  and indigent elderly have selective access to small pensions through non-contributory
  schemes and formal sector workers and civil servants through contributory schemes.
  Coverage i s limited and targeting o f the non-contributory scheme needs improvement.

    111.     CAPEVERDE'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY(2005-2007)

                  A.      The Government'sStrategyto ReducePoverty

 29.      Cape Verde's GPRSP (2005-2007) final version in Portuguese (Documento
 Estratkgico de Crescimento e ReduG6o da Pobreza - DECRP) was received by IDA on
 September 21, 2004.8 The GPRSP builds on a well-articulated set o f strategies and
 priorities that address Cape Verde's main development challenges. These policy
 documents include: (a) the Major Planning Options (GOP - approved in 2001); (b) the
 2002-2005 National Development Plan (NDP - approved in April 2003); and (c) an
 InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP - presented to IDA'SBoard in April
 2002). Based on the strategic principles outlined in the GOP, the NDP proposes a
 series o f specific policy measures, monitorable indicators and a detailed investment
 program. The GPRSP complements the policy coverage o f the NDP with an emphasis
 on core actions to support poverty reduction and extends the time horizon. The GPRSP
 rests on an updated analysis o f poverty based on the 2002 national household income
  and expenditure survey.

  30.     The GPRSP acknowledges that growth is central to the alleviation o f poverty,
  and therefore complements its proposals for sector strategies with a direct impact on
 poverty (e.g. health, education, social security interventions) with strategies promoting
 private sector development (e.g. infrastructure, financial sector).                    The GPRSP
  underscores the importance o f a modernized and effective administration to implement
  its priority programs. The priorities o f the Government are presented along five major
  axes o f intervention (or "pillars"):       (a) good governance and reform o f the State;
  (b) private sector development;             (c)    human development;          (iv) infrastructure
  development for the integration o f the archipelago; and (d) social security and
  solidarity.

  31.     The first pillar aims to improve on governance by modernizing government
  procedures and institutions and increasing its interface with citizens. Accountability
  and equity will be enhanced through more direct participation o f citizens, better
  financial management practices, improvements in tax policies, a firmer regulatory role
  inthe economy, judicial reform, simplified administrative procedures, expanded use o f
  information technology (IT), and increased decentralization o f responsibilities and
  resources. The GPRSP discusses a broad reform agenda and refers explicitly to the
  recommendations of the CFAA, PER, and CPAR.

  32.     The second pillar reflects the Government's acknowledgement that fighting
  poverty requires economic growth, built on sound and sustainable development o f the
  private sector. The proposed policy interventions focus on the sectors with potential to

generate employment and reduce poverty. Employment policy would benefit from
improved labor market conditions; market failures inmicro-enterprise financing would
be addressed; drip irrigation technology would be disseminated to improve agriculture
productivity; infrastructure in the fisheries sector would be modernized; and tourism
marketing and basic infrastructuredevelopment would be enhanced.

33.      The third pillar, humandevelopment, seeks to improve the education and health
status o f the population. Aligned with its Education Reform Strategy, the GPRSP aims
to improve the employability and skills o f the labor force to support economic growth
and alleviate poverty inCape Verde. Inparticular, the Government seeks to: (a) reduce
barriers that prevent the poorest from accessing secondary education; (b) increase the
education system's internal efficiency; (c) reinforce linkages between the education
system and the labor market by ensuring that the skills and knowledge acquired are
those needed by the economy; (d) expand access to early childhood education; and
(e) develop tertiary education, in particular supporting science and technology, thus
contributing to creating the skill levels needed for highly qualifiedjobs.

34.      In the case of health policy, the Government's sectoral reform strategy
(Programa - Reformar o Sistema para Promover a Satide 2002-2005), has been
summarized inthe GPRSP, and identifies several priorities which together are assumed
to have a significant impact on poverty. Mindful o f increasing costs, health care will
focus on an expansion o f the network o f health facilities, limit treatment overseas by
improving local alternatives,        improve human resource management through
decentralization,    strengthen health information system,         and reinforce citizen
participation in health promotion and disease prevention. Health financing issues will
be addressed inthe plannedreforms o fthe social insurance system.

35.      The fourth pillar, infrastructure and regional development, is central to Cape
Verde's development plans. Although private sector development has outpaced public
sector growth in the past 12 years, large infrastructure projects have remained
prominent with either public or private financing. Energy, water and sanitation are
expected to expand their networks through a public/private partnership. Air and
maritime transportation are the focus o f a domestic and regional hub strategy, while the
road network will be strengthened with user-financed maintenance. This pillar also
proposes to develop environmental protection and conservation measures, to be
implementedthrough increased community involvement.

 36.     The fifth pillar, social protection, reflects the challenges o f curbing the
 increasing income inequality and the growing realization that existing schemes in the
 area o f active labor market interventions, social assistance, pensions and social security,
 community development and food security require reforms to ensure sustainability and
broaden coverage. The Government's reform strategy seeks to move from the more
reactive, coping strategies o f the past to increased attention to risk mitigation and
prevention measures, and to decentralize and contract out service delivery in line with
 the broader reforms o f the State underway in Cape Verde. The GPRSP prioritizes five
 medium-term objectives that support the reform strategies underway, namely:
 (a) developing institutional capacity in social protection, (b) strengthening and
 extending programs that reach disadvantaged groups (including social pensions, social


                                             10

assistance and health insurance programs); (c) promoting local initiatives and
community development; (d) promoting the rights o f children, and (e) improving
mechanisms to prevent and manage food crises and strengthenfood security.

37.     For each o f these pillars, the GPRSP provides a cost estimate (above current
allocations) over the next three years: US$459 million, o f which 4 percent i s allocated
to governance, 14 percent to private sector development, 19 percent to the social
sectors, 5 1 percent to infrastructure, and 13 percent to social protection.

38.     The macroeconomic framework o f Cape Verde's GPRSP proposes an average
real economic growth o f 6.5 percent per annum over the 2005-2007 period, with
inflation projected at 2 percent (in line with euro zone projections, due to the fixed
exchange rate regime). Most o f the additional growth in the short term i s expected to
come from higher investment levels. Public investment is expected to increase by 1.6
percent o f GDP to 7.1 percent through the GPRSPperiod. Private investment including
foreign direct investmenti s projected to increase from 14.7 percent o f GDP in 2004 to
16.0 percent by the end o f the GPRSP period. In the longer term, investment-driven
growth should gradually make way for export-driven growth. Exports GNFS should
gradually increase to more than 38 percent of GDP, up from the current figure o f 30
percent. Fiscal discipline will underpin private sector confidence. The deficit (after
grants) i s expected to grow to no more than 4.8 percent o f GDP, with some o f the
programmed expenditure only occurring ifexternal financing materializes.

39.     Overall coordination i s overseen by a GPRSP Coordinating Commission
comprised o f representatives from ministries,municipal governments, the central bank,
the National Statistics Institute, the private sector and NGOs.               Consultative
commissions at the decentralized level are headed by mayors.                The Technical
Secretariat   to   Support      Development     (Secretariado    Tkcnico    de Apoio   ao
Desenvolvimento - STAD) under the General Direction o f Planning has day-to-day
responsibilities to provide technical guidance, monitor program performance including
reporting on the core set o f monitoring indicators, and inform internal and external
partners o fprogress.

40.     The GPRSP has provided an opportunity for Cape Verde to develop a national
integrated approach to monitoring and evaluation, control, statistics and information
that, if successfilly implemented over the next 3 years, would become a flagship for
Africa. This system would unite the National Statistics System under the National
Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatisticas, INE), the automated Budget and
Financial Management Information System in the Ministry o f Finance, the national
planning process under the General Directorate o f Planning (DGP), the Government's
information technology network implemented by NOSI (Nzkleo Operacional da
Sociedade da Informa@o - Operational Nucleus for Information Systems), and the
sectoral planning units within the line ministries. The main features o f the system are
integration of the budget and financial management system with the technical aspects
of programs and service delivery, development o f a unified technological platform
through NOSI, open access to users to the main data warehouses on national statistics at
INE and the database on policies and projects at DGP, and the restructuring and
strengthening of sectoral units within the ministries. While ambitious, the proposed


                                             11

system builds on existing systems and information technology (IT) platforms which are
well advanced and have been implemented by permanent teams in the Government.
Technical assistance needs and financing have been identified, including support from
the Netherlands, the EU, UNDP, and the ongoing support from the Government o f
Portugal to improve statistical capacity, as well as a Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Buildingand apossiblePRSP ImplementationTrustFundthrough the World Bank.

                B. Joint IMF/IDA StaffAdvisoryNoteof the GPRSP

41.     The GPRSP was developed through a broad, participatory process under the
guidance o f the GPRSP Steering Committee supported in its activities by the STAD.
The GPRSP has a matrix approach o fpillars instrategic areas and cross-cutting policies
(macroeconomic stability, decentralization, employment policy, etc.) which results in a
comprehensive view o fpoverty reduction.

42.     The growth projections o f the GPRSP are slightly more optimistic than those of
the PRGF-supported program (6.5 percent real annual growth vs. 5 percent), but their
underpinnings are clear and realistic. Much o f the additional growth would come from
higher domestic investmentlevels (at 23 percent, 3 percentage points above the PRGF-
supported program). Half of the additional investmentwould be inthe tourism sector,
while the other halfwould be foreign concessional financing for the GPRSP.

43.     The policy mix described in the GPRSP is likely to lead to a sustainable
improvement in the country's growth prospects. Investments in energy and roads are
needed to bring the country up to par with the standards o f a middle income country.
Proposed public support to education, health and social protection represents a
reasonable compromise between expanding              coverage and ensuring financial
 sustainability.  While the GPRSP does not make a clear statement on the priorities
between and within pillars, the dominant portion o f proposed infrastructure spending
provides a partial key to the Government's priorities.          Since most infrastructure
 investment i s   usually externally-financed through autonomous projects,           such
 investment will be undertaken based on availability o f external project financing. At
 about 7.5 percent o f GDP per year, the complete financing of the priority expenditures
 inthe other pillars is ambitious butrealistic.

 44.     Important risks to the GPRSP remain. Potential risks stem from the challenge
 o f designing and implementing the decentralization process and an unchecked
 proliferation o f autonomous institutes, the volatility o f donor contributions
 compounded by inadequate donor coordination mechanisms, inadequate mitigation of
 the side-effects o f growth based on tourism, and a credibility problem for the GPRSP in
 the absence o f results. These risks can be mitigated by a strong and visible political
 commitment to policy reform, evidenced by a sustained pace of actions to strengthen
 public sector performance, and improvements to the investment climate.            Specific
 actions highlighted in the GPRSP, and supported under this PRSC, include actions
 towards civil service reform, the introduction o f an MTEF, and timely audits by the
 independentCourt o fAccounts.

                         C. Linkswith Country Assistance Strategy

 45.      The FY0.5-08 Country Assistance Strategy for Cape Verde i s presented to the
 Board together with this document. The thrust o f the Bank's htureprogram i s twofold:
 (a) to assist Cape Verde in implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy; and (b) to
 improve aid effectiveness by shifting the form o f assistance for this small, island State
 towards programmatic support and sharpening focus on result^.^ The proposed CAS i s
 aligned with all five GPRSP pillars. IDA supports the achievement o f the GPRSP goals
 through its existing lending portfolio, the planned CAS program o f lending, advisory
 services, and capacity building for monitoring and evaluation.                   IDA'S assistance
  strategy (FY05-08) aligns with the GPRSP priorities as follows inTable 3.

 46.       The proposed PRSCs are central to the Bank's CAS.                    This emphasis on
 programmatic lending i s consistent with Cape Verde's strong performance in
 implementation o f the previous CAS, its level o f economic and institutional
  development, and the unique characteristics o f a well-managed, small State. The CAS
  deems the PRSC to be the preferred lending instrument to (a) provide predictable
  resource flows, particularly important given Cape Verde's reliance on donor financing;
  (b) strengthen the Government's own public administration and public expenditure
  management systems, with spill-over benefits to non-IDA resources; and (c) harmonize
  donors and reduce the potential distortions and transaction costs o f external assistance.

                     IV.    DESIGNOFTHE PROPOSEDPRSC

                        A.    Objectivesand Scope of the PRSC

47.     The proposed PRSC is a response to the Government's request for their external
partners to align with national strategies and systems for poverty reduction, as agreed at
the Donor's Roundtable Meeting in Praia in April 2003. This move to supporting
poverty reduction through the national budget process i s consistent with Cape Verde's
level o f institutional, economic and political development, acknowledges the country's
strong and sustained performance           in recent years      and i s     consistent with
recommendations o f core diagnostic work (PER, CFAA, CPAR).

48.     The objectives o fthe proposed PRSC series are to:
  (a) support the policies and reforms set forth inthe Government's GPRSP inorder to
      achieve sustained improvements inwell-beingo fthe population;
  (b) develop an improved form of external assistance that reduces distortions and
      transaction costs associated with project-based aid (particularly acute given Cape
      Verde's small size) and increases Government capacity to plan, execute and
      monitor its efforts to addresspoverty;
  (c) harmonize donor support around the GPRSP, including alignment with other
      multilateral and bilateral donors (EU, Dutch Cooperation) involved inor planning
      budget support operations;
  (d) provide predictable support to the budget cycle to consolidate and smooth
      resource transfers, particularly important given its external vulnerabilities; and
  (e) improve access to and quality o f key social services.


49.     The proposed PRSC would allow IDA to consolidate its lending operations and
engage inpolicy and technical dialogue inthree o f the five GPRSP pillars, namely good
governance (decentralization, public finances, civil service reform, judicial reform),
enhancement o f human resources (education and health), and strengthening o f the
social protection system. This choice o f pillars matches IDA'Scomparative advantage
and division of labor with investment projects in the portfolio, and reflects selectivity
with other donor support. Figure 1illustrates proposed coverage by the PRSC series,
other IDA lendingandbudget support from other partners.

50.     Selection o f the first pillar, good governance, i s central to the PRSC instrument
itself, as it supports the use o f national budget and fiduciary systems as the main
vehicle for channeling resources to GPRSP priorities. It also addresses cross-cutting
issues like civil service and judicial reform and citizen access to information that are
essential underpinnings o f improved service delivery. IDA has had investment projects
inthe area of public sector reform and economic management and has a strong track
record o f analytical work including recent fiduciary assessments.




                                             14

51.     In the third pillar - education and health - IDA has just closed a successful
Basic Education Project, and has been administering the Dutch Trust Fund for budget
support to the education sector. Analytical work on education has been includedinthe
PERs, the DPR and the Poverty Assessment. The health sector is included under the
PRSC even though there has been little previous experience in health sector
investments. For health, the only IDA activity has been an ongoing multi-sectoral
investment project on HIV/AIDS and the construction o f rural health posts through the
Social Sector Development Project.. The PRSC presents a real opportunity for IDA to
engage in a policy dialogue on the health system. This is particularly important given
that the issues facing the health sector are not easily addressed through investment
lending, in particular financial framework issues, including insurance mechanisms.
Recent analytical work inthe PER, DPRandPAhas analyzed the health sector.

52.     The fifth pillar, the social protection system, has benefited both from an
investment project (Social Sector Development Project scheduled to close in March
2005) and from an intensive technical dialogue and technical assistance to Cape Verde
through the WBI Capacity Building for Social Protection Strategies in Africa since
2002. While the Growth and Competitiveness Project supports reform o f the pension
system for civil servants and the formal private sector, the PRSC will focus on the non-

contributory schemes, social assistance, community development and food security,
The PA has done initial analysis on targeting and coverage to underpinthe dialogue.

53.      Subsequent PRSCs may gradually expand coverage on the basis o f IDA'S(and
the PRSC's) comparative advantage and availability o f resources. Tentative areas o f
interest for future PRSC's include agriculture, sanitation, and rural development.
However, Cape Verde has been invited to present a proposal to the US-financed
Millennium Challenge Account which will concentrate mainly in boosting rural
productivity and infrastructure and may represent significant levels o f new funding.
 The new CAS plans a Rural Development Assessment to build an analytical basis for
potential incorporation o f these issuesinto later PRSCs.

 54.     The proposed PRSC will provide US$15 million to the Government's 2005
 budget of about US$300 million, PRSC-1 financing is equivalent to 8 percent o f the
 proposed first year GPRSP expenditures inthe three pillars o f PRSC focus, or about 19
 percent o f the unidentified financing requirements.       In the later years, the PRSC
 contributions to budget support would be about US$ 8.5 million per year (Table 4).
 There i s no earmarkingo f activities to be financed, giving the Government flexibility in
 orienting resources in line with GPRSP priorities. With the support o f the PRSC, the
 Government will be able to provide financing for various activities that can be tracked
 through line items in the budget including teachers and materials for basic education,
 broader coverage o f the non-contributory pension schemes, and more even coverage o f
 health services across the islands.

  55.      The analytical foundations o f the PRSC seek to assess whether government
  policies and institutions target poverty reduction adequately; and whether the systems
  andprocedures for channeling resources to support these strategies are effective. IDA
  i s relying on core ESW, including a PER, CFAA, CPAR, DPR andPoverty Assessment
  as well as a study on the role o fthe State. Main conclusions o f this analytical work are
  described in the technical annexes. With support from UNDP, the Government has
  analyzed the likelihood o f achieving the MDGs. Table 5 presents current status o f
  these analytical underpinnings.

   o f the main thrusts i s to put PRSC financing in place upfront in the GPRSP process,

   anticipated between the approval o fthe GPRSP andthe effectiveness o fthe first PRSC.
   The PRSC series supports the on-going process o f budget reforms, with PRSC
   disbursements matched to budget cycles. Upstream analytical work will strengthen the

                                           A.        ResultsFocus

 57.       The approach o f the PRSC adopts the results focus o f the GPRSP. Cape Verde has a
 national planning process that identifies objectives, targets and monitorable output and
 outcome indicators linkedto the NDP. The GPRSP was derived from this basis. For each o f
 the main areas o f the PRSC, a results chain has been developed which identifies key activities
 and outputs that will result inPRSC period outcomes with specific indicators, all supporting
 long-term strategic goals o f the GPRSP (see Results Chains in Annex 5)".                    The PRSC is
 underpinned by a draft policy matrix (Attachment A) derived largely from the GPRSP matrix.
 Details o f eachprogrammatic area are presentedbelow andinthe technical annexes.

 B.        PromoteGoodGovernance,ReinforcingEffectivenessand GuaranteeingEquity

 58.       Duringthe past 15 years, CapeVerde has moved on various fronts to reform its public
 administration, including: (a) progressive disengagement o f the State from the production
 system, (b) introduction o f a new career and salary system (PCCS) to strengthen
 professionalism of the workforce, (c) launch o f a series o f reforms o f public expenditure
 management in order to strengthen control and improve planning and execution o f
 expenditures, and (d) political devolution o f some service delivery h c t i o n s to seventeen
 elected municipalities. Results to date have been uneven. Lack o f hrther progress inpublic
 sector reforms could trap Cape Verde in a cycle o f fiscal slippages and impede progress in
 improving service delivery andgovernance. Annex 6 details issues and challenges.

             B1.      PublicExpenditureManagementReforms

 59.       The Government's reform agenda i s based on the diagnostics o f the CFAA, PER, and
 CPAR. Together, these analytical pieces provide a comprehensive overview of the critical
 weaknesses inthe public expenditure management system.

Key Issues

 60.       Key issues affecting public expenditure management that will be addressedinclude:

   (a) Fiscal policy i s at risk from an accumulation o f contingent liabilities and mandatory
        expenditure programs.          In the absence of rapid action, expenditure could increase
        unsustainably andcrowd out other priority expenditures.
   (b) Budget formulation is hamperedby insufficient guidance inthe call circular on the main
        priorities, and is not linked to medium-term resource projections.                   The budget is
        elaborated on separate tracks for capital andrecurrent expenditures.
   (c) Tax administration capacity i s mixed.              While customs administration i s strong, the
        General Directorate for Income Tax (DGCI) at the Ministry o f Finance and Planning


"DuringPRSPpreparation, theGovernmentofCapeVerde's PRSPSteeringCommitteeandIDAPRSCteam
benefited froma series ofMulti-Sectoral Team Learning-sponsoredjoint videoconference training sessions to
harmonize this results-based approach across the various sectors andparticipating teams.


                                                        19

      (MOFP) is underperforming. The taxpayer registries are old, often not up-to-date, and
      not reconciled. Follow-up by the DGCIis hampered by limitedcapacity, and an outdated
      IT system, which doesnotpermitadequate information flows with the banks.
  (d) The new IT-based FinancialManagement System (FMS) has been deployed only within
      the Ministry o f Finance and Planning, and its potential to deconcentrate the expenditure
      chain has not yet been exploited. Expenditure commitments are still in effect being
      vetted by the MOFP, along with liquidation requests. Moreover, the absence o f a
      procedure manualto support day-to-day operations i s a fiduciary risk.
  (e) Most o f the investment budget i s financed through donor projects, with self-accounting
      status and insufficiencies inreporting. This issue can only be successfully tackled by a
      more assertive and structured Government role indonor coordination, which i s hampered
      by being managed out o f two separate ministries (the MOFP for multilaterals, and the
      MinistryofForeignAffairs for bilaterals).
  (f) There are persistent delays in closing accounts for the previous budget period. The
      supplementary period is currently as long as three months, and causes problems in
      reconciling the Government's accounts with its cash position. Debt management is not
      linked through IT with the Treasury, which limits the ability o f the Treasury to program
      payments. Moreover, public debt instruments are not streamlined or fully regularized,
      which compromises the accuracy o f debt figures.
  (g) Extemal controls are still inadequate. The independent Court of Accounts (TdC) has yet
      to receive for review from Parliament the State's accounts for the period 1998-2003, due
      to failure to officially close accounts and transmit them to Parliament. While there is no
      indication that Parliament has in the past received misleading information from
      Government, the failure o f the TdC to perform this statutory task poses a significant
      fiduciary risk in the medium term. Internal controls are also weak due to inadequate
      capacity at the General Inspectorate for Finances (IGF).
  (h) Whileprocurement operations are basically sound, there is a lack of anoverarching legal
      framework to support andharmonize procurement activities and there i s limited capacity
      inthe countryto provide adequateadvice.

ExpectedResultsof PRSCProgram

 61.     By the end of the PRSC period (3 years), the Government expects to have attained the
 following outcomes:

  (a) Improved fiscal management andbudget allocations - contingent liabilities are controlled
       as witnessed by a reductioninrecourse to extraordinary expenditures;
  (b) Improved budget planning and preparation as reflected in further integration of the
      investment and recurrent budgets, the adoption o f budgets that respect MTEF ceilings
       andsector allocations inlinewith the priorities ofthe GPRSP;
  (c) Improvedmanagement and control o f tax proceeds resultingin an increase inthe number
       o f contributors and amounts collected, as well as number o f audits;
   (d) Improved budget execution via the introduction of financial controllers and
       deconcentration o f expenditure responsibilities to at least six ministries;
   (e) Improved monitoringo fpublic resources as evidenced ina decrease inthe supplementary
       budget period andbetter coverage o f autonomous institutes;



                                               20

   ( f ) Reinforced internal and external controls, with more timely presentation o f executed
         budgetsto Parliamentandreview bythe TdC; and increased activity o fthe IGF;
   (8) Improvedprocurement systemswhich result ingreater transparency, reduced unit costs of
         government purchases andbetter stimulus o fthe private sector.

Recent Progress, PRSC-1Prior Actions andPRSC-2 Triggers

 62.      The Government has already launched several initiatives under each o f the building
 blocks o f public expenditure management. They include (a) a study to compile all debts and
 contingent liabilities o f the State; (b) technical assistance to develop a MTEF; (c) work on an
 equivalent classification between recurrent and investment classifications of the budget; (d) a
 macroeconomic model to provide revenue projections; (e) the introduction o f the VAT; (f) the
 creation o f a task force to close past due accounts o f the State; (g) the regularizationo f arrears;
 (h) the integrationof domestic and external debt management with treasury operations; (h) an
 actionplanfor the CPAR; and(i) preparation o f laws on decentralization.
                                           the

 63.       PRSC-1 identifies the following prior actions in the public expenditure management
 area as critical for implementation success:

   (a) 2005 budget law takes into account, inter alia, adequate funding o f DECRP priorities,
         cross-cutting reforms for public administration and public expenditure management.
         This prior action aims at ensuring that the fungibility o f resources does not undermine
         priority programs supported by the PRSC;
   (b) Completed final draft o f a study compiling all debts and contingent liabilities of
         municipalities, autonomous institutes and State-owned enterprises. This prior action
         ensures that the medium-term fiscal assumptions are not threatened by unforeseen
         demands on the budget;
   (c) Presentation o f an action plan to process the 1998-2003 state general accounts and
         submission to Parliament o f the State General Accounts for 1998 and 1999. The current
         backlog shows an excessive gap between the executive branch o f Government and those
         inchargeofmonitoringits actions. Reinstatingregular checks-and-balances is asine qua
         non reform to satisfy donor fiduciary requirements.
   (d) CPAR action plan adopted by the MOFP. Clarity and organization in the procurement
         framework are equally important to satisfy donor fiduciary requirements.

 64.       To support the momentum o f the reform program, the triggers for PRSC-2 could
 include: (a) draft 2006 budget law takes into account inter alia, adequate funding o f DECRP
 priorities, cross-cutting reforms for public administration andpublic expenditure management;
 (b) planfor the settlement of contingent liabilities and debts approved by MOFP, (c) as part o f
 preparation o f the MTEF, provide a 3-year revenue forecast, and, for at least 2 sector
 ministries, prepare sectoral MTEF integrating capital and recurrent budget (d) 2000-2003 State
 General Accounts submitted to Parliament; and (e) approval by the Council o f Ministers12 o f

           B2.      CivilService, Decentralization and Judicial Reform

Key Issues

 65.     Annex 6 describes status and challenges o fpublic sector reform inmore details. Main
 issues are:

   (a) Uneven progress in public sector reform due to the absence o f an integrated strategic
       framework and appropriate structures for coordinating the reforms, creating a disconnect
      between various initiatives.
   (b) Civil service reform has not progressed much. Humanresource management remains
       centralized.   Implementation o f merit-based recruitment and evaluation i s lagging.
       Careers are not attractive for high-level professionals, which leads to a significant
       turnover at managerial positions. Job descriptions are lacking and there i s no formal
       policy for professional training. Inlieu o f a comprehensive reform, adhoc solutions have
       been introduced comprised o f specific schemes o f services for individual ministries or
       parts thereof, which has led to large variations o f salaries for similar positions between
       ministries or between central and local governments, and contributed to low morale.
       Creation of autonomous institutes has been used as a short-sighted solution to larger
       public administration problems, multiplying semi-independent bodies with more
       attractive benefits and working conditions to carry on some o f the mandates o f various
       ministries.    This creates distortions in public sector performance, potential hidden
       liabilities, anda dilution o fthe Government's core responsibilities.
       Decentralization o f responsibilities and resources to the 17 municipalities i s one o f the
       key vehicles chosen by the Government to improve service delivery. Public works, local
       roads and social promotion (pre-schools and other community services) are now the
       responsibility o f municipalities. However, municipal prerogatives and financing are
       currently defined under an outdated set o f laws, which i s being updated. Furthertransfers
       will need to be based on an adequate identification o f respective responsibilities and
       resource needs. Moreover, mechanisms to better coordinate municipal, central and
       deconcentrated government activities need to be developed. Capacity building activities
       for municipalities need to occur within an updated framework for human resource
       management at the local level that attempts to stabilize key staff. Training is currently
       providedmostly bybilateral donors.
       Financial autonomy o f the municipalities i s weakened by financing uncertainties. Their
       asset base is not firmly established, and transfers from the Government come in various
       forms and not always at planned intervals. The formula-based transfer system i s being
       reviewed-currently it cannot exceed 7 percent o f all taxes. Formula-based transfers plus
       other central transfers amounted to 5 percent o fthe Statebudget in2002.
       The financial management capacity o fmunicipalities is uneven. Turnover of skilled staff
       is an issue across all municipalities and affects their financial management processes,
       which are also underminedby the absenceo f standard procedures.
   (g) In a country setting where insularity adds specific challenges to responsive service
       delivery, citizens continue to perceive public administration as inefficient.


                                                22

    (h) Lack oflegalknowledgeanddifficulties inaccessingjudicial remedies continue to impair
          most vulnerable populations (including vulnerable female single-headed households) to
          benefit from legal security andprotection.

PRSCFocus andExpectedResults

 66.        The policy matrix was prepared with staff from the Ministry o f State Reform and
 Public Administration (MREAP), the MOFP and the Ministry o f Justice.                               Following the
 GPRSP priorities, the PRSC prioritizes key medium-term objectives, namely: (a) improve and
 integrate public sector reform management; (b) clarify respective mandates o f central and
 deconcentrated administration and municipalities and improve the financing o f municipalities;
 (c) improve human resource management and capacity; and (d) enhance legal and judicial
 knowledge andefficiency and promote access to justice.

  67.       By the end of the PRSC period (3 years), the Govemment of Cape Verde expects to
 have attained the following outputs:

    (a) Overall decentralization framework i s more conducive to progress in service delivery
           outcomes, with clear repartition o f functions and improved financial flows, including
          timeliness andvolume o f transfer^,'^
    (b) Adequate tools for human resource management are developed and operational, and
           various stakeholders are briefed on possible options for the reform o f the civil service, in
           order to forge consensus on a strategy to promote a qualified, motivated and accountable
           civil service;
    (c) Local capacity for training i s improved and professional training institutionalized;
    (d) Some ofthe most demanded services aremore easily accessedby citizens; and
    (e) Knowledge o f the law and access to justice are broadened especially for the most
           vulnerable populations, through establishment o f a Judicial Aid Fund and promotion o f
           Altemative DisputeResolution (ADR) mechanisms.

RecentProgress, PRSC-1PriorActionsandPRSC-2Triggers

  68.        To achieve these results, the Govemment has made recent progress in its reform
  agenda. A Reform Commission with representatives fkom key ministries was established
  under the chairmanship o f the MREAP. The finalization of the civil servants database, for
  which data were collected in 2002, is continuing and seen as key to provide a modem
  management instrument for humanresources, together with needed analysis to reform the civil
  service.        Key on the reform agenda i s the fusion o f investment and recurrent budget
  departments in ministries, in order to create resource management units with a clear mandate
  on managing resources and a capacity to monitor and evaluate activities. The creation o f a
  "public manager" career will provide various administrations with specialists in public
  management, who would lead the restmctured resource management units. Another focus i s


l3T h i s overall framework for decentralization o f service deliverywill be further supported by specific sectoral
strategiessuch as development ofan early childhood education strategy, development ofrevisedprotocol
agreements for social assistance, and identification ofdecentralization priorities inthe health sector, all of which
mustbe determinedincollaborationbetweenthe central and local governments. These areas are described in
greater detail inthe following sectoral sections andtechnical annexes.

 the creation of a "Citizen's House", that would allow for key public services to be accessible
 following a one-stop-shop model. Use o f IT would help overcome some o f the difficulties
 linkedto insularitywhile linking-upthe country with its expatriate community.

 69.     PRSC-1 identifies the following prior action in public sector reform: Civil servant's
 database updated, including inter alia validated individual information on grade and salary
 history for at least one-half o f civil servants inthe database. This is critical for implementation
 successbecausecompletion o f the database, long overdue, will allow for better management of
 humanresourcesandelaboration ofcivil service reform options.

 70.     In moving to the PRSC-2, priority triggers expected to be completed could include:
 (a) submit basic law (lei quadro) on decentralization to Parliament: this law will establish rules
 and methodology for transferring responsibilities to local governments, and establish the
 principle o f concomitant transfer o f resources and responsibilities, thus establishing a more
 secure and conducing environment for further progress on decentralization; (b) civil servant's
 database operational and up to date to be used to elaborate civil service reform options: this
 will reinforce the PRSC-1 prior action, and continue the progressive approach to civil service
 reform; (c) Citizen's House model validated and implementation started (d) Law on judicial
 assistance creating a Judicial Aid Fundapproved andpublished: this will contribute to expand
 access to formal legal services to the poorest segments o f the population; and (e) Law on
 Altemative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms approved and published: this law will
 regulate and contribute to promoting ADR, with an expected positive impact on speed and
 access to redressmechanisms for citizens andbusinesses.

Key Issues

 71.      Cape Verde's education achievements rank among the top o f Sub-Saharan Africa
 countries and other countries at the lower middleincome level, and it has virtually achieved the
 MDGs in education (for more details see Annex 7). Several studies have been completed by
 the Government, the Bank and others which diagnose the main issues inthe education sector14
 and identifyfiture challenges:

   (a) Expansion in coverage o f early childhood education is becoming a pressing need. Less
       than 50 percent of the 3-5 year olds attend early childhood education. Regional and
       socio-economic disparities in access to pre-school are strong. Early childhood education
       i s a decentralized prerogative, with program coordination carried out by the Ministry o f
       Education (MOE).
   (b) Greater voice should be given to parents and communities in deciding how schools
       should be governed, managed and financed in order to foster greater accountability
       among school administrators and support education quality. It is expected that some

 Two Public Expenditure Reviews (Government of Cape Verde 2002 and World Bank 2003) as well as the recent
Development Policy Review have analyzed the education sector.


                                                    24

      transfer o f power and resources from the central Government to the local Governments
      (municipalities) will contribute to providing a better response to the needs o f the people
      and improving the delivery o f education services.             Implementation o f national
      achievement tests will provide teachers, administrators and parents with better
      informationon education quality.
      Despite one o f the highest unit cost per student inthe sub-region, quality is an issue. The
      repetition rate inprimary education remains stubbomly highat 12percent mainly due to a
      low level o f academic qualification o f the teaching staff andthe deployment o f untrained
      teachers inpoorer municipalities.
      Despite recent investments in school infrastructure, secondary education i s ill-prepared
      for the growing demand from primary school graduates, with limited and unequal
      distribution o f facilities, a shortage o f teachers, and out-dated curriculum and teaching
      practices. More average size secondary schools are needed to provide equitable access to
      all the population andnot only those living inor inthe vicinity o fmajor urbancenters.
      The professional training system should be better structured to respond to social demands
       and to meet the needs of the labor market. Sector rules and responsibilities are unclear
       and few providers are certified. Access to professional training and apprenticeship for
      primary graduates remains too restricted. As a result, these youths do not find
       employment opportunities easily and are limitedintheir future job prospects.
       Demand for higher education will fkther strain resources. Support for study abroad has
       been reduced in recent years despite the rising number o f secondary school graduates.
       The number and relevance o f tertiary education institutions are insufficient to meet the
       needs o f Cape Verde's economic andsocial development
   (g) The teaching wage bill will need to be controlled.- Salaries consistently absorb about 90
       percent o f recurrent expenditures. While the average teacher salary relative to GDP for
       primary education is close to the regional average, the level for secondary education is
       muchhigher-andthis i s where system expansion will be concentrated.

PRSC Focus andExpectedResults

 72.    The Education Ministry contribution to the PRSC policy matrix for the education and
 training sectors prioritizes four main medium-termobjectives for the PRSC series, namely to:
 (a) improve the quality and efficiency o f education; (b) expand and diversify general and
 technical secondary education supply; (c) expand andbetter orient professional training service
 delivery; and (d) restructure higher education.

 73.    By the end ofthe PRSC period (3 years), the Government expects to have attained the
 following educational outcomes:

   (a) Improvements in the quality o f basic education, as evidenced by significant increase in
       the percentage o f teachers who have academic qualifications, a decrease in the repetition
       rate, an academic achievement test system designed and piloted, and a rise inthe share o f
       students completingprimary school;
   (b) Greater efficiency o f the education system, as evidenced by an increase inthe student -
       teacher ratio inprimary education andreduced drop out andrepetitionrates;
   (c) Expanded opportunities for children to get an earlier start in education as shown in an
       increase inthe share o f 3-5 years old enrolled inearly childhood education;


                                                  25

   (d) Expanded anddiversified general andtechnical secondary education supplywhich results
       in an increase in children completing 8 years of schooling, an increase in the share of
       students enrolled in technical secondary education and an increasing share o f poor
       students benefiting from support;
   (e) Better preparation for labor market needs through increased numbers o f students enrolled
       in the professional training sector and apprenticeship program and an increase in the
       number o f accreditedprofessional trainingproviders; and
   (f) A tertiary education sector that allows for increased enrollment and less reliance on study
       abroad within a limitedpublic finance envelope.

RecentProgress,PRSC-1PriorActions and PRSC-2Triggers

 74.     To achieve these results, the Government has made several recent advances in its
 reform agenda.      From 1999-2004, the M O E implemented an IDA-financed project to
 consolidate and modernize the education and training sector, mainly through the construction
 andequipment of new classrooms, the provision o f textbooks, and in-service teacher training.
 Inthe training sector, the project financed apprenticeship andprofessional training inorder to
 increase the employability o f the workforce and o f school dropouts.       Finally, the project
 financed technical assistance, studies and pilot testing that contributed to reinforcing the
 MOE's knowledge base and analytical skills (e.g. preparation of the education and training
 sector's diagnostic and education strategic plan). InNovember 2003, Cape Verde received a
 US$6.9 million grant from the Netherlands Government, administered by IDA, to provide
 resources channeled through the MOE's budget and allocated mainly to early childhood
 development; basic education and capacity building.

 75.     Interms ofrecent achievements, theMOEhastaken some measuresaimed specifically
 at improving the quality and efficiency o f basic education. They include the elaboration o f
 new training modules and use o f new pedagogical approach for in-service teacher training. In
 terms o f efficiency, new decrees were promulgatedto reform the graduating system inprimary
 and secondary education. This will reduce unnecessary repetition o f a grade which is costly
 and often leads to dropping out. Finally, confrontedwith rising costs due to the rapid growth
 o f enrollment, the MOE established a progressive parent's financial contribution to secondary
 education based on household income.

 76.     PRSC-1identifies the following prior actions inthe education sector as critical for
 implementationsuccess:

   (a) Teacher training priorities for public teachers inbasic education identified andthree year
       actionplanprepared; and
   (b) Elaborationandpublicationo fthe professional trainingdiagnostic, including inter alia
       economic and labor market analysis, identificationo ftraining providers and institutional
       framework for professional training.

 77.     Inmovingto PRSC-2, triggers expectedto becompleted couldinclude: (a) at least
 twenty percent o fthe teacher training action planfor basic education has been implemented;
 and(b) elaboration andpublication o fthe professional training strategic plan, includinginter
 alia, numbero fcourses, modalities, financing andtimeframe.

            C2.      Health Sector

Key Issues

 78.      Compared to other countries in Africa, Cape Verde's coverage o f health services i s
 good andthe country i s on track to achieve the MDGs. However, these good indicators mask
 significant regional disparities and are based on an unsustainable financial framework (for
 more details see Annex 8). Several studies have been completed by the Bank and others which
 diagnose the following main issuesinthe health sector (PER, DPR):

    (a) Inequities in health outcomes and access to health services persist. Access i s limited
        primarilyby geographic constraints and approximately 44 percent of the population does
        not use health services when ill.Medical evacuations are used extensively, accounting
        for nearly 13 percent o f total expenditures o f the National Institute for Social Protection
        (Institute Nucional du ProvidZnciu Social, INPS) and 5 percent o f the Ministryo f Health
        (MOH)." Differences in immunization coverage rates, which range from 91 percent in
        Sal to 41 percent inPaul, are an indication o f inequities inhealth services.
    (b) Problems with human resources limit the effectiveness o f the health system. These
        include: (i)   an insufficient number o f doctors, particularly o f specialists, due in part to
        migration; (ii)    poor distribution o f staff, with more than 80 percent o f doctors practicing
        in the two general hospitals; (iii) of incentives in the payment mechanism to
                                                     lack
        maximize efficiency, focus on the poor, prioritize certain services, or avoid over referral;
        and (iv) a growing number of public sector doctors working in an unregulated private
        sector. Civil service reform at the national level may address some o fthese issues.
    (c) Management ofthe system, including monitoring and evaluation, is hampered by the lack
        o f a functioning health information system. Health information is especially important
        for both monitoring the progress towards achieving the MDGs as well as the increase in
        noncommunicable diseases. Basic data such as service utilizationrates are not available.
    (d) Non-communicable diseases significantly hinder economic growth.                        Cape Verde is
        passing through an epidemiologic transition where increase in life expectancy and
        decrease in infant and child mortality rates over the last decade have led to an aging
        population. On average, men lose 13.6 years o f productive life and women 11.3 years,
        due to illness. There will be increasing pressure on expenditures as the population ages
        anddemands higher quality services -atrendobserved worldwide.
    (e) The public sector health system i s infinancial crisis, even though total government health
        spending in Cape Verde i s generous and financing by donors i s the second highest per
        capita in Africa at about US$10 per capita. The main causes o f the financial crisis are:
        (i)growingdeficitattheINPS,whichreachedUS$13millionin2002(comparedtoan
            a
        annual budget o f US$8 million in 2002)16, (ii)very high and rapidly increasing rate o f
                                                                  a
        expenditures on pharmaceuticals, and (iii)          increases in demand as incomes improve and
        the population ages. In 2002, total health expenditures equaled approximately US$29
        million (4.5 percent o f GDP) with an average total expenditure per capita around US$64.


l5Medical evacuations are both within the country when more serious cases are referredto the two mainhospitals,
and outside of the country, primarily for serviceswhich do not exist inCape Verde. The majority o fevacuationsare
for cancersand cardio-vascular diseases.
l6Infact, onanannualbasisthis deficit is coveredbythecurrent surplus inthe pension fund.



                                                        27

      Eighty-two percent of expenditures were public (MOH and INPS), equal to about 10
      percent of total govemment expenditures. Private, out o f pocket expenditures accounted
      for 18 percent of total health expenditures and 1percent o f total household expenditures.
      This suggests that there may be limits to the extent to which public sector health
      expenditures can grow. There i s some room for out-of-pocket expenditures to increase,
      as well as potential savings frombetter management o fpharmaceuticals.
  (0 Issues outside the control ofthe MOH, like inadequate and unsafe water, poor nutrition,
      andlack o f transport, are major contributors to health outcomes. Only 11percent of the
      poor have access to public water supplies compared with 51 percent o f the non-poor.
      Poor children are also more likely to be malnourished, with 13 percent o f those under the
       age o f one suffering from malnutrition versus 6 percent of the non-poor.
  (g) Financial protection is needed for the indigent.      According to the recent household
       expenditure survey, approximately 5 percent o f the population had health expenditures
       greater than 10 percent o f their income with health care expenses causing approximately
       1percent of the population to become poor. Ninety percent of total health spendingby
      the poor i s to purchase medicines.
   (h) Eventualdecentralizationofhealthservices to municipalities isunder discussion although
       details have yet to be determined.      Currently under discussion, a new law i s being
       formulated that would define the powers and jurisdiction o f the municipalities in such
       areas as health, education, and the environment. Decentralization o f health services
       could potentially have a significant impact on utilization o f health services and health
       outcomes by focusing more on the demand side rather than only supply as is suggested
       by some o f the reforms proposed above. Under the PRSC, assessing the impact of
       decentralization on health service delivery is included in the review o f the overall
       decentralization program.

 79.     The total cost o fhealthprograms to be implementedunderthe GPRSP is expected to be
 US$ 40.5 million in 2005-2007, o f which US$21 million i s to build new health facilities,
 rehbish existing facilities, and equipment and US$10 million for HIV/AIDS. For 2005,
 GPRSP expenditures are expected to total US$18.5 in comparison to a MOH 2005 budget o f
 US$32 million.      In the GPRSP, the increases in capital investment are accompanied by
 increased allocations for recurrent costs for the first year only, after which it i s assumed they
 will be included in the regular budget. The Government assumes the GPRSP will not entail
 any increase in staff costs since many of these positions are already included in the budget,
 even if currently vacant. The Government also assumes that some savings can be achieved
 throughimprovedservices inhealthcenters andprimaryreferralhealthstructures, thus limiting
 referrals to more expensive hospitals. Other cost savings include strengthened preventive care
 for chronic diseases, improved management o f health structures, supported by a reinforced
 health information system, and introduction o f lowest-cost, standardized care protocols for key
 diseases, and control o f drugcosts by openingthe drugmarket to competition.

PRSC Focus andExpectedResults

 80.     The PRSC policy matrix, which has been prepared by the Ministry of Health in
 collaboration with its mainpartners, reflects the priority activities described above. The main

objectives are to reduce the inequities in health outcomes and ensure financial protection for
the poor. Specific results include:

81.     Improvements inaccess to quality healthservices by the poor: This will be achieved by
expanding health infrastructure, particularly inremote areas, and training and deploying health
personnel to these areas. Other reforms planned for the civil service, such as introduction o f
incentives, will also improve health staffing inpoor areas. Not only will these activities have a
direct impact onhealth outcomes, but reforms such as the reduction o fmedical evacuations and
improvements inprescribingpractices, will reduce the cost o f services.

82.      Inequities in health outcomes will also be addressed by prioritizing the financing and
provision o f services for those diseases that have the most impact on the poor. The most
vulnerable women and children will continue to have access to vaccinations, pre-natal and post
natal care, prevention and treatment o f TB and HIV/AIDS. Surveillance o f these programs
will be a priority in order to ensure their effectiveness and impact on the poor. A push to
ensure attended deliveries will attempt to reduce the discrepancies between rich andpoor, with
the poor muchmore likely to deliver at home. The growth innon-communicable diseasesis a
priority given their growing prevalence. Introduction o f health prevention and promotion
programs i s likely to have the largest impact on health expenditures inthe future, particularly
for the poor who are least able to afford treatment. Participation o f the population in health
promotion and disease prevention is a priority, to be achieved in part by strengthening
cooperation across sectors andwith civil society organizations.

 83.     Improvements in health protection for the poor:        Several policies are proposed to
protect the poor from the highcost o f illness. Introductiono f user fees will allow more money
to be allocated to the poor assuming a system o f exemptions is put inplace. Expansion o f the
 existing social insurance program, INPS, i s also proposed with several options for covering the
poor under discussion.

RecentProgress,PRSC-1PriorActionsandPRSC-2Triggers

 84.     The Government has begun to address issues conceming access o f health services by
 constructing and rehabilitating selected health facilities inrural areas andtraining physicians in
 underrepresented specialties such as surgery, neurology, neonatology, public health, and health
 administration. Programs oriented towards pregnant women and children are underway and
 include training o f health staff, elaborating norms, and acquiring necessary equipment and
 supplies. Already an increase in vaccination coverage rates has been noted. A system o f
 surveillance o f some priority diseases such as TB, polio, andmalaria has been introduced and
 i s supported by a new network o f laboratories. Strategies for HIV/AIDS and TB have been
 approved. The national pharmaceutical policy has been revised to improve the availability o f
 essential drugs and privatization o f EMPROFAC is underway. INPS has implemented initial
 measures to reduce its pharmaceutical costs. Finally, a study o f health expenditures has been
 completed and data from the national household survey is being analyzed to assess inequalities
 inthe provisionandfinancing ofhealthservices.

 85.     Giventhe fiscal importance o f the INPS programs -both health andpensions - a prior
 action for PRSC-1 i s the approval by the Council o f Ministers o f a Decree-law to regulate



                                               29

 employee's and employers' social security contributions to W S . This reform was approved
by the Council of Ministers on February 16, 2004 (decree-law 5/2004) and began inApril o f
 2004. A further prior action i s the completion o f the first draft o f a Health HumanResources
 Strategy to improve the recruitment, training and deployment o f technical staff in the public
 health sector.

 86.      The following activities should be completed during the PRSC-2 time period:
 (a) initiation o f rehabilitation and equipping o f health facilities, with a priority to rural areas;
 (b) initiation of implementation o f the Health Information System strategy; (c) continued
 implementation o f priority health programs; (d) completion o f a plan o f action for non-
 communicable diseases; (e) initiation o f implementation o f the human resources strategy; and
 (f) development o f a medium term strategy for INPS coverage and financing. O f these, the
 expected PRSC-2 trigger i s the formulation o f a medium-term strategy for INPS addressing,
 inter alia, financial sustainability. This would addressboth the health andpension funds due to
 the large fiscal consequences and linkages betweenthe existingprograms.


    D.      Improve the Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Social Protection System

Key Issues

 87.      The Government's social protection strategy seeks to help vulnerable households to
 better manage risks and become less susceptible to potentially damaging welfare losses
 through a variety o f mechanisms, including labor market interventions, formal social security
 systems, social assistance programs and food security measures (for more details see Annex 9).
 Cape Verde has a relatively developed social protection system for Afiica, so the basic issues
 have more to do with reforms o f existing programs in order to increase efficiency, equity and
 coverage as well as fillinspecific gaps. The mainissues to be addressedare:
   (a) Facedwith recurrent drought and long-term reduction in soil productivity, the creation of
       temporary employment through labor-intensive public works schemes was a key feature
       o f rural survival in Cape Verde in the 1970-80s. Originally this temporary employment
        financed by food aid provided a minimum safety net for the rural poor. Over time the
       FAIMOprogramwas equated with people showing up to check their names off the lists,
       with limitedimpact ofinvestments, low laborproductivity and little skills accumulation;
   (b) Overall, about 21percent o fhouseholds report receiving a pension- 15 percent through
       national programs (INPS, AP and non-contributory pensions) and 6 percent from abroad.
       The long-run financial solvency o f contributory social security schemes i s at risk. The
       two main systems, the AdministraqZo Pziblica (AP) for civil servants and the INPS for
       private firms and some autonomous institutes provide pensions, health insurance and
        other benefits, covering about one quarter o f the labor force. The sustainability o f both
        systems i s in question due to generous benefits and cross-subsidies from the pension to
       the health insurance;
   (c) The Government's intention to expand the non-contributory pension schemes, including
        the Social Solidarity Pensions for ex-FAIMO workers and the PSM (Penslo Social
       Minima, Minimum Social Pension) for needy elderly and disabled, will need to be
        embedded in better selection and monitoring o f beneficiaries, modernization o f program



                                                 30

       administration includednew identity cards, and coherence inthe overall fiscal envelope.
       Evidence from the recent household survey shows that the targeting o f the PSM needs
       improvement.      Screening and selection processes and criteria used by the local
       governments has beenad-hoc and administration o fthe system needs strengthening;
  (d) Cape Verde is an example of good collaboration between central, municipal and non-
       governmental organizations for the co-production o f social assistance services, including
       the use of formal service contracts. Municipal governments routinely contract with local
        associations for the day-to-day management and operation o f nursery schools, training
       programs and other services. The central level has experimented with both contracting o f
       NGO service providers, as well as use o f direct financing o f community groups and
        farmer's cooperatives for development efforts.      The challenge i s to build on this
        experience, creating better systems for monitoring performance andimpacts; and
  (e) With little arable land, recurrent drought and declining soil fertility, food security has
       been a key motive o f migration to urban areas and outside the country. Overall, 14
       percent o f children from 0-5 are stunted. Market-oriented reforms have removed public
        sector management o f importation o f food stuffs. While prices have fallen significantly,
        the risk o f sudden food shortages on certain islands remains, and requires a coordinated
        policy approach, supportedby the National Food Security Agency.

PRSCFocus andExpectedResults

 88.      Under the coordinationo fthe Ministry o fLabor and Solidarity (MTS), the Government
 has prepared a policy matrix in consultation with other ministries, autonomous agencies and
 NGOs. The matrix prioritizes: (a) `Protection, Integration and Social Insertion', to redefine the
 regulatory framework for decentralized service delivery, improve planning and management
 instruments, improve management and coverage o f non-contributory pensions, increase access
 o f at-risk groups to education andprofessional training, health services, and nutritional support,
 and promotion and support for local community development initiatives; (b) `Protection of
 Children's Rights', to strengthen institutional mechanisms and reinforce technical capacity o f
 NGOs involved in youth and child protection issues; and (c) `Food Security', to prevent and
 manage food crises andstrengthen the institutional framework o f food security issues.

 89.      By the end o fthe PRSCperiod, the Government expects to have attained the following
 social protection outcomes. Thesetargets are ambitious but are anchored inexistingprograms:

   (a) Improvedability to planand monitor social assistance services as evidenced by complete
        andup-to-date information oncoverage andutilization;
   (b) A greater share and better geographical distribution of social services targeted to low-
        income andvulnerable groups through contracts with local governments andNGOs, with
        modest increases inutilizationrates (already at 85 percent) o f existing infrastructure;
   (c) Expanded coverage and better targeting o f the non-contributory pensions schemes, as
        seeninincreasedparticipation rates by the poor, with expenditures within the MTEF;
   (d) Increasedcoverage andquality o fNGOprograms for children at risk;
   (e) Increased access by the poor to education and health services, resulting in higher
        attendance rates insecondary education andbetter nutrition rates;
   (f) Less utilization o f emergency coping strategies for food security through better
        prevention andmanagement o f food crises.

RecentProgress,PRSC-1PriorActions and PRSC-2Triggers

 90.     Measures proposed under the GPRSP would continue and deepen reform efforts
 underway. The FAIMO system is revamped by (a) monitorable contracts with municipal
 governments for delivery o f infrastructure investments, (b) the introduction o f efficient
 contracting and execution o f public works to private firms through delegated contract
 management (AGECAB0)I7 financed by IDA; and (c) support to rural community-based
 organizations to directly execute small-scale infrastructure and income generating projects
 financed by IFAD and the US Government. In the social security system, a framework law
 passedinJanuary 2001 set out the broadreformparameters o fthe contributory pension scheme
 and a study of the targeting, administration and financial sustainability o f the non-contributory
 pension system i s underway.'* The Government is requiring tighter eligibility criteria o f the
 PSM. In social assistance, the MTS i s piloting service contracts with 6 NGOs. Targeted
 subsidies to encourage access to education and health by the poor are being tested, including
 subsidies for secondary school fees and access to medicines by the indigent.                        And, the
 institutional response to food crises is under reform, which started with the creation o f the
 National Food Security Commission in 1996 and the adoption by law in 2004 o f the National
 Food Security Strategy.         Cape Verde presented its action plan towards a national social
 protection strategy for international peer review at the WBI-sponsored Workshop on Social
 ProtectionStrategies inAfrica inFinlandinJuly 2004.

 91.      PRSC-1 identifies collection and processing o f data for the database on social services
 (Social Services Map) as a critical prior action in social protection as it will allow for better
 targeting and management of decentralized social services. In moving to PRSC-2, priority
 triggers expected to be completed include: (a) amendments, as needed, and implementation o f
 new protocol agreements for decentralized social promotion services in all municipalities;
 (b) improved identification cards issued to all non-contributorypensionrecipients and tracked
 through MTS; and (c) food security information system decentralized and functional in rural
 areas. These triggers represent significant milestones o fimprovedprogram management tools.

                                  A.        Implementationofthe Credit

 92.      The proposed operation would focus on implementinga medium-term policy agenda,
 with triggers and monitorable actions tied to completion of GPRSP targets. PRSC-1 will
 proceed following IDA and IMF's favorable assessment o f the GPRSP and the attainment o f
 critical prior actions. Box 1 summarizes prior actions for PRSC-1 and proposed triggers for
 PRSC-2.       The triggers for PRSC-2 are indicative and will be refined during PRSC-2
 identification and preparation.          As illustrated by Annex 5 (Result Chains) and the Policy
 Matrix in Attachment A, the focus i s not only on key reform actions, but the results and
 impacts o fthese actions on Government performance and improved service delivery.

                   B.     AdministrationandDisbursementProcedures


93.    A single tranche credit o f SDR 9.7 million &JS$l5millionequivalent) would be made
available to the Republic of Cape Verde uponcredit effectiveness, anticipated for March2005.
The closing date o f the operation would be March 31, 2006. It is envisaged that the follow-on
PRSC-2 will support the implementationof the GPRSP incalendar year 2006.

94.    The operation will follow IDA's simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment
operations and will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated single-tranche release
conditions. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no procurement
requirements are needed. Once the Credit is approved by the Board andbecomes effective, the
Borrower would open and maintain a dedicated deposit account in U S Dollars for the
Borrower's use. The proceeds of the Credit would be deposited by IDA in an account at the
Central Bank of Cape Verde at the request o fthe Borrower. If,after depositing inthis account,
the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Credit Agreement,
IDA would require the Borrower to either: (a) return the amount to the account for use for
eligible purposes, or (b)refundthe amount directly to IDA.

95.     Through the Ministry o f Finance, the borrower will (a) report the exact sum received
into the deposit account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the deposit account are for
budgeted public expenditures, except for purposes such as military expenditures or for other
items on IDA's negative list; (c) provide to IDA evidence that the ECV equivalent o f the
Credit proceeds were credited to the Consolidated Fund account and disbursements from that
account were for budgeted public expenditures. Within four months of a request by IDA, the
deposit account will be independently audited on terms o f reference acceptable to IDA. For
subsequent PRSCs, it i s expected that the TdC will provide IDA with its annual report on the
public accounts to parliament by the end o f the year following the execution o f the budget.
This reflects the schedule agreed upon with the IMF and in the context o f the CFAA action
planto clear the backlog ofpresentation o fpublic accounts to Parliament.

                       C.      Coordinationwith the IMFandDonors

96.     Cape Verde currently is supported by over one hundreddifferent extemal partners
providingfinancial and/or technical support. The GeneralDirectorate for International
Development Cooperation (Ministry for ForeignAffairs) has mapped out andprioritizedthese
externalpartners, classifylng 19 o fthem as first priority partners. Among these first priority
partners are IDA, ADB, the European Commission, Portugal (the traditional and still largest
bilateralpartner), Luxembourg, the Netherlands Cooperation and the United States.

97.     The GPRSP marksanotable shift towards budget support. The World Bank,the
EuropeanCommission, andtheNetherlands are movingtowards coordinatedbudget support,
andthe combinedamount o fthis budget support represents a significant share ofoverall
assistance. And the US, via its new MillenniumChallenge Account (MCA), is poisedto
become a major donor.




                                                34

  98.    The PRSC has been developed inclose coordination with the GPRSP process, and was
 based on a highly participatory exercise comprising all key ministries in Government, civil
  society, the private sector and donors (see Annex 10 on donor harmonization). The STAD
  organized workshops in October 2003 and in May 2004 to refine the strategic focus o f the
  GPRSP, discussproposals for the PRSC's selective support, link the frameworks o fthe GPRSP
  andthe PRSC; andseek consensusbetween donors on selectivity of support andharmonization
  o fprocedures.

  99.     Coordination between IDA, the Netherlands and the European Union has been
  especially strong, since all three donors are preparing budget support operations.         This
  collaboration was initiated with joint support for key analytical underpinnings, including the
  PERs, the CFAA, and the CPAR. By agreeing on the findings and recommendations o f these
  due diligence ESWs, the three donors have built an important technical basis to harmonize
  policies and support. Duringpreparation o f the PRSC, the Netherlands and IDA carried out
 joint pre-appraisal and appraisal missions, in consultation with the European Union. This
  harmonizationprocess will be carried forward through a Memorandum o f Understanding to be
  signed between the Government, IDA, the EUandthe Dutch Cooperation entitled "Partnership
  Framework between Budget Support Partners and the Government o f Cape Verde for the
  provision o f Budget Support".      The Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint
  reviews, harmonization o f indicators and prior actions, and synchronization with Government
  budget cycles with a view to reducing the transaction costs o f assistance to the Government
  (see draft MOUinAnnex 6).

  100.    The PRSC has beenprepared inparallel with the IMF's PRGF" reviews, following the
  agreed institutional division o f labor. The IMF i s taking the lead on macroeconomic issues
  while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. In a number o f areas where the
  mandates o f the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work i s being closely
  coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. IDA will rely on
  program reviews by the IMF to reach conclusions on the adequacy o f macro/fiscal
  performance, and the IMF will rely on IDA review o f public expenditure management to
  support the implementationo fmacroeconomic policies supported by the PRGF.

                               D.      Monitoringand Evaluation

  101.    The objective o f an M&E system for the PRSC would be to ensure timely access to
  relevant data inorder to monitor progress, evaluate the impact o fthe poverty reduction strategy
  and help define new orientations or make changes based on analysis o f current data. The
  monitoring and evaluation program for the PRSC builds from the proposals for an integrated
  national M&Esystem (Annex 1l),      the structure o fwhich i s shown inFigure 3.

  102. The specific monitoring and evaluation activities under the proposed PRSC will be
  based on, and reinforce, the system proposed for the monitoring and evaluation o f the GPRSP
  discussed previously. They will include: (a) annual GPRSP progress reports; (b) periodic
  reporting on achievement o f MDGs (supported by UNDP); (c) overall annual budget
  monitoring through public expenditure reviews; (e) annual sectoral budget execution and

  103.    The PRSC will reinforce a results-based M&E system. Although implementing the
  system and making it fully operational are a longer term process than the time-horizon o f the
  current PRSC allows, this initiative will help set up the basis for such a system and support a

                               E.     Issuesof SpecialAttention

CapacityBuilding

 104.    Achieving the results expected from the PRSC series will require strengthening the
 capacity o f several o f the Government agencies andministries involved inits implementation.
 Some o f the specific training costs associated with implementing reforms will be included in
the annual government budget cycle. Several of the donors have either expressed interest or
 are already engaged in significant capacity building efforts, including the WHO in developing
 sectoral approaches in health, the Government o f Portugal in strengthening the national
 statistics system among other areas, the European Union in the development of budget
planningmechanisms, the Dutchcooperation inthe implementationofthe C F M C P A R action
 plans, the French Government in supporting decentralization and municipal strengthening and
 IFAD, the ADB and USAlD in strengthening local associations and community-driven
 development approaches. The PRSC complements these efforts.              The Government itself
 financed a number o f technical assistance and capacity building efforts in preparation for
 PRSC-1, including expenditure tracking surveys in health and education, strategy and
 development o f instruments in the social protection system, implementation o f critical CFAA
 recommendations and studies, and institutionalization and analysis of the civil service
 database, all o f which will strengthen the capacity o f the Government agencies to carry out the
 PRSC.

 105.     The World Bank will remain closely involved incapacity building through three main
 channels: (a) technical advice from members o f the core PRSC team, through the policy
 dialogue in the context o f the PRSC or through background analytical work; (b) financial
 support through relevant TA components o f existing projects (e.g. the Growth and
 Competitiveness Project, the HIV/AIDS Project), and a new PRSP Trust Fund o f up to
 US$500,000 projected for 2006; and (c) complementary analytical work or financial support
 from other donors. Inthe context o f one o f the most effective collaborations, the Netherlands
 have committed Euro 2 million for the implementation of the CFAA and CPAR action plans.
 The EU has also earmarked over Euro 1 million for TA in the context o f the upcoming FED
 program. The UNDP will help organize the next Donor Roundtable, scheduled in mid 2005,
 duringwhich support for TA as well as financial support willbe discussed.

EnvironmentalSustainability

 106.     Vulnerability o f its climate and rainfall cycles, limited fresh water supplies, and
 reliance on tourism as an engine o f development puts sustainable use of resources and
 protection of the environment as central to poverty reduction. The Government, with support
 from the Netherlands cooperation and UNDP, has developed the National Environmental Plan
 (PANA, 2004-2014) through a multi-sectoral planning process completed in February 2004.
 PANA identifies policies, institutional and legislative mechanisms, investments and results
 indicators to promote environmental sustainability in the areas of: management o f hydraulic
 resources, pollution control and waste management, protection o f Cape Verde's unique


                                                37

biodiversity, tourism expansion, maritime and land resources, utilization o f efficient and
renewable energy systems, and environmental guidelines for industry and commerce PANA
provides a strategic orientation for the rational use o f natural resources and the sustainable
management o f economic activities. Its basic premise is that the sustainable use o f resources
and environmental protection are central to poverty reduction through the safeguard o f
environmental assets, improved food security, and employment opportunities. The Plan i s
comprehensive and is the result o f broad consultations. It emphasizes sectoral linkages and
management o f the environment at the municipal level and identifies three main environmental
issues that match the MDGs inthe areas o f water supply; sanitation, and marine and terrestrial
biodiversity.   Implementation o f the Plan will be overseen by the Department o f the
Environment, which was established in 2002 within the Ministry o f Environment, Agriculture
andFisheries.

107.    Within the fourth GPRSP pillar, "Develop basic infrastructure, promote rational land
use and safeguard the environment", the Government reiterates its commitment to PANA
implementation. The Government o f the Netherlands is currently preparing a budget support
programtargeted to the environmental sector. This would finance national level structures and
policies as well as municipal level environmental action plans that havebeen developed within
PANA. Critical prior actions and a set o f monitorable results indicators have been identified.
Based on reporting activities outlined in the budget support partner MOU, IDA will be
apprised o f on-going progress inthe environmental sector.

 108.   This first PRSC focuses on policy measures with little direct physical impact on the
environment, confirmed by the judgment o f the PRSC Working Group (OPCS, PREM, ENV,
LEG) that PRSC-1 conforms to the content of an adjustment operation (rather than a sectoral
adjustment operation). Therefore, the requirements o f Operational Directive 8.60 apply and no
specific environmental assessment actions are required. The PANA and other environmental
documentation will be reviewed by the Africa Region Safeguards Unit for feedback on the
adequacy of the national framework to support any future PRSC that may be designated as
sectoral adjustment operation.

GenderIssues

 109.    Women are more likely to be poor than men inCape Verde. Although a formal gender
 assessment has not yet been carried out for Cape Verde, a revised poverty and gender profile
has been generated based on analysis o f the 2002 household survey. Despite impressive gains
 for women in basic education and falling fertility rates, almost half o f adult women in rural
 areas cannot read, and domestic violence i s an issue.        Women are more likely to be
 unemployed andwhen employed to earn less than men, even at similar levels o f education and
 experience,

 110.    Gender issues are mainstreamed throughout the PRSC. Gender disaggregated
 performance indicators will be tracked in all relevant sectors. Specific priority interventions
 are included as monitorable targets inthe PRSC policy matrix. By the end o f the PRSC period
 (3 years), the Government expects to have attained the following monitorable outcomes:




                                              38

  (a) Within education, gender parity achieved in primary education would continue at the
      secondary level;
  (b) Within health, to have improved access o f poor women to health services, and
      specifically to have increased the presence o f trained staff including midwives in poor
      districts;
  (c) Within social protection, to have increased the number o f women benefiting from
      decentralized social services, as well as poor women receiving social pensions and
      support for essential medicines; and
  (d) Within justice, women will have benefited from community-based program on
      knowledge o flaw, and fromjudicial aid and altemative disputes resolutions.

                                  F.      Benefits andRisks

111. In terms o f benefits, the value added of the PRSC lies in both the nature of the
instrument andthe policy results that are expected:

   (a) Improved hctioning o f institutional framework, including national budget svstems.
       The PRSC increases the incentives to the Government to improve the design and
       management o f public expenditure and fiduciary systems. The benefits o f better budget
       planning, execution and control will have spill-over benefits beyond the PRSC itself as
       these systems are used to channel national Treasury funds as well as other donor budget
       support operations. Increasedtransparency and efficiency o f the public sector also sends
       important signals to the private sector, through better contracting processes and respect
       for rule-based transactions.
   (b) Reducedtransaction costs anddistortions o finternationalassistance. As a small country
       with many donors, Cape Verde's public sector can be overwhelmed with the many
       coordination demands and its staffing patterns disrupted through the creation o f multiple
       project units. The PRSC will put a premiumon donor harmonization and coordination,
       reducing the burden o f multiple monitoring systems and multiple and uncoordinated
       donor reviews o f Government performance.          In addition, the PRSC offers added
       flexibility to the Government to finance key parts o f the GPRSP, including expansion o f
       secondary education teaching staff, minimum social pensions for the indigent, or
       targeted support for medicines to the poor, that would be difficult to finance through an
       investment loan or a single sector adjustment project.
   (c) Better linkages between sectors and cross-cutting issues. In shifting from a sectoral
       investment project focus to the PRSC, the ability to embed sector policy within cross-
       cutting issues, including decentralization, improved expenditure management, and civil
       service reform will increase the sustainability and impact on service delivery. For
       example, the development o f a MTEF and its extension to sectoral areas based on
       programmatic objectives i s an innovation in Cape Verde and one that would be less
       likelyto achieve without the PRSC.
   (d) Improvedservice delivery for the poor. The PRSC would provide incremental resources
       to finance GPRSP priorities, which should translate into improved services to the poor.
       Specifically the PRSC will help support better schools through teacher training,
       educational materials, and classroom improvements, health promotion services,
       equippingand rehabilitation o f health centers inpoor areas, better distribution of health


                                               39

     personnel better targeted social pensions, and an increase in the quality and supply o f
      social services like daycare centers andprograms for the elderly at the municipal level.
 (e) Improved well-being o f the population. Better service delivery should translate into
      improved outcome indicators over time, such as higher secondary enrollment rates,
     better healthstatus, and increasedpublic satisfaction with services.

112.   The following risks andrisk mitigation strategies have been identified:

 (a) Macroeconomic shocks could undermine stability and growth. Cape Verde, as a small,
     island nation is particularly vulnerable to external shocks, including weather conditions
     and increases in world market prices for oil. Internally, macroeconomic stability is
    threatened by contingent liabilities discussed previously. These risks could threaten the
     fixed peg as a macroeconomic policy anchor and crowd out GPRSP priorities.               To
    mitigate these risks, the Government has managed to insulate the budget by phasing out
     oil subsidies for retail sales (except for natural gas) and liquidating certain non-
     performing State-owned enterprises. Control o f contingent liabilities is a key feature of
     PEM reforms.        Completion o f an inventory o f existing contingent liabilities o f
     autonomous institutions, municipalities or State-owned enterprises is a prior action.
 (b) The electoral cycle could bring about fiscal slippages and stall implementation of the
     more sensitive policy reforms. Legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for
     early 2006. Prior to the latest national elections, the Government significantly increased
     its spendingwhich caused some fiscal slippage. Another risk is that the electoral period
     may create some reluctance from the Government to carry out politically difficult reforms
     inanelection year. The PRSCprocesswill seekto shield the investment budget fromthe
     cuts it may suffer if fiscal contractions are required. The full effect o f the 2006
     presidential elections will more likely be felt during the PRSC-2 period, when triggers
     and prior actions will address the risks of over-spending.     Some potentially sensitive
     reforms have been pushed back to after the election period (e.g., adoption o f the new
     career and salary strategy).
 (c) Impact o f shift to using national budpet and administrative systems. The shift to
     programmatic lending calls for reliance on Government systems, as opposed to project
     implementationunits, to implement key programs that are becoming more ambitious and
     complex. While the pay-off to this approach in the medium to long term appears high,
     lack o f adequate capacity inthe public administration inthe short to medium term could
     become a bottleneck. This risk i s being mitigated in a number o f ways, including civil
     service reform as a core area o f the PRSC, attention to buildingbetter budget systems in
     the context of the PRSC, focusing reform efforts on systems and programs already well
     under implementation, increasing the complexity o f programs progressively over time,
     and substantial capacity enhancement activities, manyofwhich are supportedbydonors.

SUBJECT: Letter of DeveloDmentPolicv for PovertyReductionSuuuort Credit (PRSC)

Dear Mr Wolfensohn

     IamwritingonbehalfoftheGovernmentofCapeVerdetorequestacreditintheamountofUS$15
     million from the InternationalDevelopmentAssociation, to continue supporting the Government
     of CapeVerde's structuralreformprogram.
     This Letter of DevelopmentPolicy (LDP) i s a summary of the Growth andPovertyReduction
     StrategyPaper (GPRSP), andthat the details of thisprogramis embeddedinsaid GPRSP.
     The aforementionedcreditwill help to meet financingrequirements that CapeVerde faces to
     implementits Growth and PovertyReductionStrategy (GPRS).
     T h e new initiative GPRS, i s expected to run from 2005-2007 and will b e a continuation of the
     earlier programs documented in IPRSP. These are The Grand Options Plan (GOP) 2002-2005,
     which emphasised on growth, poverty and income inequity reduction among the households. To
     strengthen GOP, the GoCV in the same period initiated the National Development Plan
     (NDP) 2002-2005 that aimed at maintenance of the macroeconomic balances; strengthening and
     consolidation of the structural reforms; developing competitive advantages for the economy;
     promotion of the economic growth and employment.
  Recent developments
 5.  Cape Verde's economic performance has improved substantially over the past few years. Real
     GDP per capita is estimated at US$1,420 (2002), which shows a significant improvement since
     independence (1975), at which time it was US$ 190, or even as compared to 1990, when it was
     US$902. The average growth rates of GDP in the years 2001 to 2003 was 5,5%. This increased
     slightly to 4% in the year 2004. This strong and sustained economic growth has been anchored
     on the private sector development and integration of Cape Verde in the world economy. Private
     investment - especially external private investment - played a key role in the process by replacing
     public investment, which dominated untilthen.

 6.  The tertiary sector became dominant inthe productive structure, supported by strong growth
     intourism, as well as transports, bankingand trade. The primary sector movedslowly. With
     the growing rural population, and considering that agricultural incomes play a key role in
     the survival of one quarter of the labor force, the structural weakness of the primary sector
     had a crucial negative impact on the income and poverty risks facing rural workers

                                         GABINETE DO MINISTRO
   This gain in the growth o f the real GDP per capita is manifested by improvements o f the Human
   Development Index (HDI). HDI rose from 0.587 to 0.670 in the years 1990 and 2002
   respectively. At present, life expectancy i s 72 and 66 years for women and men accordingly. In
   addition, Human Poverty Rate (IIPR), which reflects deficiencies in terms o f life expectancy,
   income, education, literacy and other areas improved from 28.8% in 1990 to 17.7% in2002.

   Cape Verde's economic growth of the last decade resulted in an increase in the inequality of
   income distribution as shown by the Gini coefficient, which in 1988-89 was 0.43 and in 2001-
   2002 it increased to 0.57. The excessive concentration o f wealth i s illustrated by the fact that 10%
   o f the very poor population has only 1% of total income. The first seven deciles (70% of the
   f a d e s ) represent only 28% o f per capita expenditure, while the last deciles (the wealthiest 10%)
   account for 47% o f total expenditures.

   The island o f Sao Vicente has the highest concentration o f wealth, with a 0.60 Gini coefficient,
   whereas the national average i s 0.57. Next on the l i s t are the islands o f Santo Antao, Sao Nicolau,
    and Santiago, with 0.56.

10. The economic acceleration was accompanied b y deep structural change in the economy, with
    services strengthening on top. This situation had an important impact in terms of resource
    allocation among the sectors and o n factor output, and, thus, on income and wealth distribution, on
    a national level, as well as within each island. On the other hand, the strongexpansion in income in
    sectors such as tourism and other services worsened the imbalances in income distribution.
    Increasing demographic pressure, combined with erosion o f agricultural soils, led to a negative
    impact on rural per capita incomes, thus also contributing to increase inequalities in income
    distribution.

11. Causes of poverty relate essentially to living conditions in rural and peri-urban areas and to the
    low employability of the poor. The combination of the nature o f Cape Verdean agriculture, the
    high population growth rate, and the random nature o f the climate, explain the rural stagnation
    and low incomes. In fact, t h i s process may aggravate soil erosion, which reduces their
    productivity and availability.

12. To overcome the lack of resources in Cape Verde, the poor turn to migration and to the informal
    sector. At first, migration led Cape Verdeans abroad, but later, facing increasing difficulties in the
    host countries, they also started moving to the urban areas within the country. A clear evidence
    of this is the increase in population recorded in the city of Praia, with resulting pressure on
    sanitation, housing, education, and health facilities.

13. The FAIMO have become the main safety net in rural areas. Subsistence animal husbandry also
    plays a key role in rural areas, as it represents a security factor against the crises that follow
    periods of drought. In urban areas, informal activities are the main way out for many families, as
    indicated b y the surge in the informal economy. Women play a key role in this area, leading to a
    reduction in female poverty during the 1990s.

14. The budget deficit decreased largely from 19.1% of GDP in 2000 to only 3.2% in 2003. As a
    result of appropriate fiscal policies, current account deficit excluding grants dropped from 25.2%
    of GDP to 14.5% between 2000 and 2003. Meanwhile, the stock of external debt has decreased
    over the last decade. Despite this reduction, debt service remains a serious threat to any
    macroeconomic achievements and may impede and further delay the resilience of the economy.
    Moreover, external financing support to G o C V has steadily decreased from 16.5% of the GDP in
    2001 to 10.3% in 2003.

 15.InflaUon moved within reasonable boundaries during the period: from 3.8% in 2001 it dropped to
    1.2% in 2003, which i s comfortably below the reference threshold of 2.5% - ?",< that      1%necessary to
    maintain price stability and competitiveness of the economy vis-a-vis the country's main partners in
    the euro zone.
Program overview

 16.Cape Verde i s a small country geographically as well as economically. Findings from Household
    Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)/                 Household Living Conditions Survey (HLCS)
    conducted in 2001-2002 reveals that 37% of the population i s considered poor, with 62% living in
    rural areas. Further, about 54% of the total poor population i s considered to be extremely poor,
    while in terms of gender, about 51% of the poor are women.
 17.The Government's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), i s outlined in the Poverty
     Reduction Strategy Document (PRSP) 2004-2007, which was prepared with support from the
     World Bank. I t s main objective i s a substantial reduction inthe levels of absolute poverty in Cape
     Verde through the adoption of an all-around poverty reduction policy, covering macro-economic
     policies, public management policies, as well as sectoral and microeconomic policies targeting the
     poor.
 18.The GPRS i s part of a broader strategic planning exercise that has been under way in Cape Verde
     and has as main components the Grand Options o f the Plan 2002-2005 (GOP) and the National
     Development Plan (NDP). The link between the NDP and the GPRS ensures global coherence
     of the planning instruments, thus facilitating management and monitoring of the various
     programs, and avoiding duplication o f efforts and procedures. On the other hand, both the NDP
     and the GPRS include the same sectoral programs, thus guaranteeing coherence between the
     global growth and poverty reduction goals o n one hand, and the sectoral policies, on the other.
 19.The overall aim of the GPRS i s to further reduce poverty by implementing a series of basic
     policies that include consolidating macroeconomic stability, decentralizing public decision-
     making and service provision, and promoting employment by developing agriculture and other
     productive sectors with a multiplier effect on employment. Additional basic policies include
     income distributionand social protection, and environmental protection.
 20.From the above policies, the Government derived five strategic pillars setting forth the various
     forms of public intervention at the central and local level, using a combination o f programs and
     policy measures. The five pillars are: (i)   Promote good governance, reinforcing effectiveness and
     guaranteeing equity; (ii)   Promote competitiveness to foster economic growth and employment
     creation; (iii)Develop and upgrade human capital; (iv) Improve and develop basic infrastructure,
     promote land use management, and protect the environment; (v) Improve the effectiveness and
     sustainability of the social protection system. The 2005 budget law reflects adequate funding for
     these five pillars
 Promote good governance, reinforcing effectiveness and guaranteeing equity

 21.The G o C V realizes that the success of GPRS initiative will depend on good governance that
     focuses o n the effectiveness of the economic policies especially the pro-poor policies. Under t h i s
     program the G o C V aims to reform the public administration at f i s t place by introducing capacity
     building programs for the civil servants and enhancing manpower management skills. Particular
     emphasize will be in the area of information systems, communications technologies and human
     development planning. The government initiated the construction of a civil servant data base in
     2004 and intends to complete it by the end of PRSC2

22.Secondly, the objective i s to reform and to strengthen the judicial system by enforcing the rule
   of law, better knowledge of their rights, establishing regional funds for legal assistance and centers
   for alternative resolution o f conflicts are to be created. The GoCV has mandated the Ministry of
   Justice to coordinate all other relevant organs in Cape Verde such as the National Human Rights
   Committee, the Constitutional Tribunal, the Justice Promoter, Office of Attorney-General and
   the Cape Verdean Bar Association. At same time, the National Assembly i s working to establish1
   the Constitutional Tribunal.
23.Thirdly, the GoCV plans to continue with the reform of the State's financial management
   systemsunder transparent andparticipatory approach.The focus is on implementingthe Country's
   Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Public ExpenditureReview (PER) and the Country
   Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). This reform i s directed into Budget Programming and
   Preparation, Management and Control of State Revenues, Management o f the State's Treasury and
   the Public Debt, Conditions of Budget Execution, Management of MunicipalFinances, Capacities
   of the General Inspectorate for Finances, Management o f State Assets, FoodAid Management and
   Financial Reporting and finally to introduce the Public Procurement Code. The CPAR action plan
   i s already adopted and the GoCV i s taking all necessary measures for its implementation. In
   addition, the government is engagedinthe preparation o f state general accounts for the years 1998
   and 1999 to submit them to Parliament and in finalizing state general accounts for the period
   2000-2003. The action plan and evidence o f 1998 submition sent to the Bank and the general
   account for the year 1999 is expected to bubmitedby the end of this year. Finally, the GoCV is
   currently finalizing the study compiling all debts and contingent liabilities o f municipalities,
   autonomous institutes and parastatals in order to set up a plan for managing contingent liabilities
   anddebts approved.
24.Fourthly, is the fiscal reform that involves the introduction o f the consumption based Value
   Added Tax (VAT) in January 2004 as well as the streamlining of custom tariffs. The GoCV
   objective with these reforms is to increaseresources available for poverty reductionprograms.
25.Fifth, the GoCV plans to enhance decentralization program that seeks to shift the decision makmg
   power to the local structures, specifically the poor. T h i s wiu ensure a more equitable distribution of
   resource by establishing the Financial Equilibrium Fund (FEF)'. The plan also seeks to coordinate
   smoothly the operation of Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and that of Non-Governmental
   Organizations (NGO) inimproving the municipalities' capabilities in the provision of health, education,
   environment, land use planning and service delivery.


Promote competitiveness to foster economic growth and employment creation
26.The GoCV continues with its efforts o f advancing market economy by encouraging the
   establishment of domestic large, medium and micro enterprises, foreign direct investments, as well
   as promotion of partnerships with foreign investors. In view o f this, the government has launched
   a competitionpolicy that advocates entrance o f new businesses and fm in all the sectors o f the
    economy. For this purpose, the GoCV intends to continue investing in infrastructure and other
   basic conditions targeted to facilitate private investments.
27.In order to ensure efficiency in the provision o f goods and services the GoCV will continue
    implementing the privatization program. This i s expected to reduce the government deficits by
    eliminating subsidies, increases the government resources in the form of tax revenues and sale
   proceeds o f the privatized structures and support the growth strategy. Moreover, the process will
    fulfill the government's ambition ofprovidingthe poor with morevarieties of goods andservices at
    affordable prices.

2.8. Despite the fact that Cape Verde is considered a middle income country, still unemployment poses
     threat especially to the poor. In the year 2001/02 unemployment rate stood at 22% for the whole
     nation. About 33% of the labor force is poor based on the HLCS o f 2001l02. Indeed, 20% of the
     total poor population has been unemployed for more than 12 months while only 10% o f the non-
     poor population has been unemployed over the period under investigation. This implies that,
     unemployment greatly affects the poor population. In sum, the unemployment rate of the poor
    population is 33% while that o f non-poor is about 16%.
29. To arrest the situation the GoCV has initiated successfully an employment policy that is expected
     to createmorejobs and generate incomes to the poor. Attention has been directed towards programs
     such as public works that offer temporary employments at a lower pay in infrastructure projects:
     such as road construction, soil andwater conservation structures and reforestation programs.
30. At the same time the GoCV under the Ministries o f Labor (MOL)and Education (MoE) is
     coordinating various skills development programs to assist the poor in securing more jobs and
     increase their pays. This has led to the initiation of the employment and the professional
     trainingpoliciesunder the two ministries respectively.
31 Aside, the GoCV is supporting the reform of the land tenure system to encourage agricultural
   I

     sector employment that provides a livelihood o f the largest part o f the population. Moreover,
     strategic expansion o f the tourist industry is expected to increase employment and incomes o f the
     poor especially inthe islands o f Sal, BoaVista andMaio.
32. The development o f human capital depends on two important ingredients namely; education and
     health. The track record is impressivebut much remains to be done, particularly with regards to
     gender disparitiesbetweenrural and urban areas. For instance, Cape Verde has attained the goal o f
     universal primary education. However, it is necessary to improve the quality of the education
     system. Teacher training priorities is indentifiedand actionplandeveloped. Inaddition, students are
     to be encouraged to complete secondary or professional education in order to improve their
     chances of successfully entering the labor market. In this regard, a white paper diagnosing
     professional training i s prepared . Literacy rates improved significantly during the past ten years
     andmorewill be done over the coming years inthis regard.
33. Another aspect o f good health i s the reduction of child mortality as well as infant mortality.
     However, the country's high health risk vulnerability calls for constant preventive and curative
     measures including routine vaccination and improvement o f birth conditions in matemities. The
     goal o f reducingchild mortality by two thirds by the year 2015 may be achieved ifpast policies that
     led to the current results are strengthened. In this regard, the GoCV has already completed the
     analysis of health human resources and drafted a strategy to increase the ratio o f health
     professionals per inhabitant.
34. The fight against HIV/AIDS continues to be a concern for the GoCV. The GoCV realizes that
     there is a needto advocatebehaviour changesbasedon the current prevalence rate. There is a
     decline inthe reported cases of tuberculosis and the associated deaths considerably between 1989
      and 2002. Further, good results have also been achieved in treating t h i s disease and Malaria i s
     under control, except duringrainy season.

Improve and develop basic infrastructure, promote land use management, and protect the
environment
35. The G o C V recognizes the importance of basic infrustructure development that includes
    sanitation, water provision, and road construction and maintenance. In terms of sanitation, the
    government plan i s to enhance the collection and treatment of residual water in the cities of
    Praia and Mindelo and extend this to the other cities pending fund availability. There i s a serious
    problem on drainage system that threats the hygienic conditions o f the poor and forms a major
    source of pollution especially of the domestic water.

36. Given the current outdated land use policies the government i s underway to implement a
    comprehensive modern Municipal UrbanPlans that will replace the obsolete Land Use Plans. Thus
    the G o C V plans to reform the current basic cartography and cadastral systems to allow for
    property rights enforcement and municipal boundaries useful for other infrastructure
    development and property tax collections.

37. The most common environmental calamities such as soil erosion, coastline degradation, water
    and air pollutions, landslides, loss of biodiversity, waste accumulation and dispersion are
    ubiquitousto the GoCV. T o correct for the situation the GoCV has commissioned the second
    National Environmental Action Plan that seeks to outline the policy implications and
    management framework to mitigate the situation.

35. Other infrastructure development policies include road services, maritime transportation facilities
    and airport infrastructures. Inter-urban road transportation has been totally liberalized; the
    open policy for the maritime transportation policy originates from the liquidation o f the state-
    owned maritime company "Area Verde"; and the air code stipulates the regulations pertaining to
    the principles, rules and procedures to participate in international civil aviation industry and has led
    to the signingof some international air freight cooperation agreements.
38. This shows that the G o C V i s highly committed to introduce reforms and restructure the
    transportation industry that i s key to cost reduction and ensures effective delivery o f goods and
    services to the poor.
 Improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system

39. The current system of social protection under G o C V continues to suffer from weak targeting of
    the poor sections o f the population. T h i s has callled for a systematic strategy that involves
    protection and support mechanisms to the household members in a situation of need, risk
    vulnerability and social exclusion.
40. To counter this, efforts are already underway to implement a financially sustainable pension
    scheme and reform the social security system. Nevertheless, there i s a need to ensure that social
    protection transfers need to be well targeted to the poorest strata of the population if they are to
    have their desired impact on reducing poverty. Preliminary data tables submitted to Bank Data
    under-going. Currently undergoing final quality checks of data; it will sent CD-Rom by the end
    of December.

41. More specifically, the GoCV advocates the unification of the existing systems that provides
    employment such as the redefinition o f the FAIMO workers' benefits system and the
   reinforcement of the capacity o f the National Social Security Institute (INPS).           ',,Regulatory reform
    o f INPS, including inter alia reform of the method of payment o f worker's social security
    contributions, has been approved by Council of Ministry and initiated.It has been published by
    Decree-Law n05/2004 in Boletim Oficial dated o f 16 Feb. 2004 "Estabelece as bases de aplicacao
    do sistema de seguranra Social de trabalhadores por conta de Outrem".
42.Alternatively, the government emphasizes credit provision to support the poor and allow them to
     contribute into the production process. The aim i s to promote self- employment via access to
     micro-credit that forms important sources of financial capital, which empowers the poor as an
     income generating activities. This has been extended to the establishment o f the financial
     intermediation so as to guarantee greater coverage of the poorest zones and the neediest
     f a d e s .
43.With the same spirit the GoCV encourages sustainable agricultural development where the core
     of the initiative rests on the integrated enhancement of the agrarian resources and in the
     generalization of the micro-irrigation schemes.
44.In the area of food security, the GoCV provides guarantee of food availabllrty and stability in
      the supply of the central and periphery markets, assuring the normaloperation of the food
      markets and a management that involves the private commercial management in supplying
      the market..
Policyguidelines andexpected outcome
45,The GPRS will be implemented in a context of macroeconomic stability. T h e reference scenario
      used to design macroeconomic policies for the coming three years assumes a 6.5% average
      growth rate per year. Projected growth will be driven essentially by private and public
      investments, and exports. Supply side sectors expected to be more dynamic are hotels, industry,
      energy, fisheries and construction.
46.Fiscal performance will be guided b y prudence, in line with the overall policy of macroeconomic
      stability, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. As a result, the primary current balance will
      record a surplus for every year of the period, and average 3.8% o f GDP for the period as a
      whole.

47.Monetary targets are in line with the goals of price stability and credibility of the exchange rate
    regime reflected in the upward trend in reserves relatively to imports o f goods and services. It i s
    also consistent with the principle o f making internal resources available to finance the development
    effort. Inthis regard, credit to the economy as percentage of total credit i s projected to expand.

48.The current account balance, including official transfers, i s expected to evolve favourably in
    relative terms, leading to a significant reduction in the deficit, as a result o f a relative stabilization
    of imports and an increase in exports during the period. The current account balance is expected to
    consolidate below double digits, reaching an average of -7.1% o f GDP during the period. Gross
    international reserves are projected to reach 2.5 months o f imports of goods and services. At the
    same time, the G o C V intends to continue the dialogue with IMF for monitoring a sustainable
    macro-economic stability, after the end of on-goingPRGF, next April.

Program implementation

 49. The GPRS will be implemented within the public planning and budget systems, which are
     currently undergoing reforms. Implementation will be guided by strong participation of
     community-based organizations, decentralized entities, and private sector representatives.

 50. To support the process, the Government has decided to establish, starting with the 2005 national
     budget, a MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and a number of MediumTerm Sectoral
     Expenditure Frameworks          (MTSEF)     within key          line     Ministries     (Education, Health,
     Agriculture/Environment and Social Protection). It is expected that such a set-up will improve:
     i)prioritisingprogramsandprojectsthatdirectlycontributetowardstheGPRSobjectives and
     the sectoral objectives; ii)budgetingof programs and projects according to resources that can be
     mobilized; iii) term (three years) budget allocation according to priorities in order to reach
                   medium
     the established development targets.

 51. To implement these guidelines, the Government has begun a number of reforms to make the
     public management system more efficient, more reliable and more transparent. In this regard, a
     number of measures are being designed t o implement the recommendations from the PER, CFAA
     and CPAR exercises.
 52. 53 The institutional framework for implementing the GPRS will consist o f the existing
     administrative apparatus, after the necessary functional changes in structure : 4 w          introduced. The
     National Poverty Reduction Board is an advisory body that includes the main stakeholders, drawn
     from public administration, the private sector, and civil society. At the central level, the General
     Directorate of Planning, supported b y a Technical Secretariat, will be responsible for
     coordination and technical support. At the sectoral level, the Studies and Planning Offices within
     each line Ministry will prepare, monitor andevaluate priority programs and projects included inthe
     strategy. At the local level, there will be Regional Poverty Reduction Boards, advisory bodies that
     will secure the input from localstakeholders.

Programmonitoringand evaluation


 53. The GoCV will set up a monitoring and evaluation system for the GPRS to guide the actions of the
     various actors involved in promoting growth and poverty reduction. In addition to governmental
     departments, the system will include organizations from civil society, as well as the development
     partners.

 54. The Government intends to ensure the following functions in the context o f the monitoring and
     evaluation system: (i)    monitoring and analysis o f trends in growth, poverty, vulnerability and
     inequality; (ii)monitoring the execution of programs and projects that contribute to improved
     growth and poverty reduction; (iii)    evaluation of the impact of policies and programs related to
     growth andpoverty reduction.

 55. This system will be based on a network that is currently constructed by NOS1 (Information
     Technology Operational Unit). The system will include three core components and two support
     components. The core components will be (i)        a monitoringand trend analysis component, (ii)        an
     execution component, and (iii) impact evaluation component. The support components involve
                                      an

(i)creation o f a physical, technical institutional and human environment that i s conducive to better
circulation o f data, information and outputs between producers and users, and (ii)improving
information dissemination, aiming at a participated policy dialogue among the various stakeholders
and, eventually, better design and execution o fpublic policy

56. To guarantee smooth and efficient functioning o f this monitoring and evaluation system, the
     Government has decided to set up the following three-tiered institutional framework for monitoring
     andevaluation o fthe GPRS:
          (a) National Povertv Reduction Board (NPRB): a broad-based entity responsible for
             monitoring and supporting political decisions in the areas o f growth and poverty
              reduction. NPRB will be chaired by the cabinet member in charge o f Planning and will
              include 17 member institutions from line ministries, civil society institutions, NGOs,
              private sector representatives, and labor unions.
          @) Observatorv and Analytical Svstem (OAS): made up o f two sub-systems (The National
               Statistical System and the National Planning System), the OAS will guarantee the
               necessary observation andanalysis, and supply the National Poverty Reduction Board the
               inputs (namely studies) for monitoring and drafting growth and poverty reduction
               policies.
          (c) Regional Povertv Reduction Boards (RPRBs): The RPRBs play an advisory role that
               essentially covers, at first, approving activity proposals for the GPRS and validation of
               the annual GPRS progress report. They will include, in each case, the Municipality
               and the municipal offices of relevant line ministries as well as the regional or local
               stakeholders board
Conclusion

   57. The Government remains committed to its overall objective of poverty reduction through
       sustainable economic growth. To this end, the Government intends to bringnew dynamics
       to the reform process, in a manner that i s technically and administratively feasible and
       consistent with the proposed overall objective. In this matter, a switch from project aid to
       budget aid is desirable, at both the global and sectoral levels. I r                 i s therefore the
       Government's hope that IDA will grant the requested credt to assist in implementation of
       envisaged reform program to reduce poverty through implementation of the Growth and
       Poverty Reduction Strategy.

forthcoming GPRSP. The Bank's current strategic focus supports efforts in the areas of
(i) macroeconomic management and institutional capacity building; (ii) reforms in
                                                                           policy
support of private sector development; and (iii) resource development and poverty
                                                  human
reduction. Bank-supported interventions aim at broadening the basis of private sector
participation in Cape Verde's economy and enhancing private sector competitiveness.
Componentso f the strategy include the following: 1) improvingthe investment climate;
2) buildinginstitutional capacity; 3) implementing pension reforms; 4) and modemizing and
restructuring the financial sector.

3.    The current World Bank portfolio focuses on capacity buildinginthe social, public, and
infrastructure sectors, and to the careful introduction of market-based incentives for private
sector development. These central themes have also been identifiedinthe country's GPRSP
as keypillarsonwhich to basethe future o fthe country's development strategy.

4.    Instrengtheningthe country's physicalinfrastructure, aproposedRoadSector operation
i s currently under preparation. The Energymater Project aims to improve the supply o f
power, water, and sanitation systems, to increase operational and end-use efficiency in the
power and water sectors, to lower the barriers to the development of renewable energy
sources, and to foster the sound management o f water resources.           The Growth and
CompetitivenessProject supports the private sector development strategy.

5.    In the social sectors, the Social Sector Development Supplemental Credit supports
poverty reduction for the 30 percent o fthe population livingbelow the poverty line by
(i) assisting the Government in restructuring the labor-intensive public works program
(FAIMO) by creating an institutional capacity (AGECABO) to execute public works; (ii)
strengthening   the capacity o f municipalities,       communities,   and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) incarrying out cost-effective poverty alleviation interventions; and (iii)

establishing a central capacity to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the poverty alleviation
programs. An HIV/AIDS project went into effect in 2002. The credit supports (i)     mitigation
of the health and socioeconomic impact o f HIV/AIDS at individual, household, and
community levels, thus sustaining an economically productive population, and (ii)
establishmentof a strong andsustainablenational capacity to respondto the epidemic.

6.   The Bank's medium-term approach will selectively identify some of its programs for
focused assistance and advice. Financial support is expected to take the form of a Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) which will provide budgetary support on the basis o f an
agreed reform program. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA will continue to coordinate their
respectiveroles to supportdevelopment activities inCapeVerde.


Assessment of countrypolicies

7.    The authorities of Cape Verde and development partners, including the Bank, have
undertakena substantialbody of analytic work over the past two years to assess key social,
structural, and sectoral development policies and identify policy and institutional reform
priorities for poverty reduction. Regarding strategic policymaking, the Bank has provided
advice on the PRSPand sector strategies.

8.    Inthe areaofpublic sectormanagement,the authorities have soughtpartners' advice on
strengthening the administration's capabilities. In that connection, the Bank has produced a
study on the role of the state and a public expenditure review, is leading a study of the
pension system, has participated in a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (along
with the Netherlands and the European Union) and is carrying out an assessment of the
procurement mechanisms o f the state, and supporting important statistical work (such as a
household survey).

9.    As of January 10, 2005, IDA had extended 21 credits to Cape Verde, amounting to
about US$198 million equivalent, of which about US$174 million equivalent has been
disbursed. Sixteen credits have closed, and the current portfolio includes five credits, with
associatedcredit amounts o f about US$58 million equivalent and an undisbursedbalance of
about US$25 million. The involvement o f the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in
Cape Verde is limited.

World Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas

10. The Fund and the Bank continue to collaborate in many areas, including fiscal
operations and tax reform; public enterprise reform and privatization; utility regulation and
private sector development; and the strengthening o f human resource development and the
poverty reduction strategy. In close collaboration with the World Bank, the Fund staff has
discussed andreachedunderstandingson a structural reformprogramwith the Government of
Cape Verde in the context o f the PRGF arrangement. The Fund and the Bank have
collaborated in the areas o f the privatization program, utility regulation, public expenditure
management, andcivil service andpension systemreform.

I. BACKGROUND

PASTBANK INVOLVEMENT

1. Cape Verde, during the past 15 years, has moved on various fronts to reform its public
administration : (i)progressive disengagement of the State from the production system, (ii)
introductionof anew career and salary system (PCCS) to strengthenprofessionalism of the workforce,
(iii) ofaseriesofreformsofpublicexpendituremanagement,stronglysupportedbydonors,in
     launch
order to strengthen control and improve planning and execution of expenditures, (iv) political
devolution o f some service delivery functions to elected municipalities. Cape Verde is progressing in
implementing key reforms ill.public management with the overall objective to improve effectiveness
and eMiciency of the public sector. The GOCV reform efforts have strong implications on capacity
buildingneedsandadministrative structures andorganization.

2. IDA has supportedpublic sector reform in Cape Verde through two investmentprojects, the
first and second Public Sector Reformand Capacity buildingprojects (PSRCBI from 1994 to 1999,and
PSRCBII from 1999 to 2002). Civil service reform, economic management and decentralization were
the focus o f the first project. Under the first project (Public Sector Reform and Capacity Building
Project-PSRCBP), the Government supported various areas o f reform: (i)        civil service reform (civil
servants training, design of an early retirement program and implementation o f a pilot voluntary
departure program); (ii)economic management (use of a macroeconomic model for economic
planning, developmentof Public Investment Program, creation ofNational Instituteof Statistics, NIS);
(iii)decentralization (Local Finance Law, delegation of specific financial responsibilities to
municipalities), and (iv)judiciary (new legislation for notary, registry and commercial transactions).

3. The second project continued past efforts and endeavored to set the agenda for further
reforms. Inorder to cope with the increasingly more complex social and economic environment the
Government decided that: (i)   macroeconomic planning, publicresources management, and the judicial
system must be further strengthened; and (ii)     the modernization o f public administration must be
continued during a next phase o f public sector reforms. The second project had two development
objectives: (i)to consolidate and deepen past reforms in the areas o f economic and financial
management, regulatory and legalreforms; and (ii)    to prepare the nextphase o fpublic sector reform to
achievethe Government's vision o f an efficient andproductive public sector.

4. Outcomes of the second project. It yielded significant outcomes on legal and judicial reform,
assisted the decentralization process (fiscal management capacity strengthened in municipalities),
strengthened the statistical and planning capacity within the Ministry o f Finances (including
continuous support to the NIS and inparticular progress inthe creation of a National Database), and
contributed to public administration modernization through the broadening of an intergovernmental
computerized network, which is also used as the support for various modem management tools.
However, this short project did not address key reforms in improving personnel management systems
(recruitment, organizational planning and career management), and in preparing the next phase o f
public sector reform.

5. Analytical basis for current reforms. The inclusion o f a comprehensive assessment o f the
judiciary inthe country led to the preparation o f a detailed implementation plan for the reform o f this
sector. And various studies carried-out through the project provide an analytical basis to pursuepublic



                                              71

sector reform: the survey on citizen expectations is been used as a basis for administrative
simplification program, the study on the one-stop-shop serves as the basis for the current project, and
the creation of a human resource database for civil servants, once finalized, will be the basis for
modem humanresourcesmanagement.

6. Implementationchallenge of a self-standinginvestmentoperation. Intenns o f implementation,
the use o f a free-standing Project Implementation Unit proved detrimental to the performance of the
project. Better job conditions offered within the PIU created distorted incentives for its staffing, and
led to difficult cooperation with regular public services, and poor ownership of the refomis. Toward
the end o f the project implementation, it was decided that IDA support to public sector reformwould
be continued through the PRSC to allow a continuous dialogue on the activities previously financed
through the project, and their sustainability.

Public Sector Reformprogress and challenges

7. Check-and-balance institutions, albeit relatively new in the Cape Verdean setting, are more
and more playing their role of watchdogs. The National Assembly is beingtransformed into a more
professional body, better able to fulfillits mandate of legislative power and oversight. The Judiciary is
going through a far-reaching reform process, with a dual goal o f increasing the independence o f its
magistrates and broadening access to its service. Still, capacity of the Court of Accounts and the
Auditor general office could be improved, and the backlog in closing the national accounts (1998-
2003) is aremaining stumblingblock to soundaccountability.

8. The current administrative system is characterized by a lack of regulatory authorities. There
i s no overarching coordinating body for leading and implementing the reform, nor i s there any o f the
keypositions that have arole inregulating structures (positions such as secretary generalsexist invery
few ministries, but not with the traditional authority to manage resources, and financial controllers
havejust beencreatedbutwithout implementation yet).

9. Human resources managementremains centralized, implementation o f merit basedrecruitment
and evaluation is lagging, careers are not attractive for high-level professionals, which leads to a
significant turnover at managerial positions. Turnover is damaging because job descriptions are
lacking andthere is no formal policy for professional training. Inlieu of comprehensivereforms, an ad
hoc solution has been the introduction of specific schemes of services for specific ministries or parts
thereof, which led to large variations of salaries for similar positions between ministries or between
central and local governments, contributing to low morale. The planned reform o f the career and salary
systemwill to addressthese issues.

 10. Public expenditure management reform have yielded some results,but budget processes are
still characterized by an annual, one-year fiscal framework and a dual budget prepared separately by
two distinct governmental departments. Moreover, the system fall short o f providing needed
information for financial transfers to local governments, since expenditures are not always
disaggregated by geographical zones and planning of recurrent costs for investment spending is
insufficient.   Ongoing reforms focus on establishing a comprehensive budget, and introducing a
medium-termexpenditure framework (MTEF).

 11.   The political decentralization process started concomitantly with the democratization
process, and all actors concur that decentralization, though improvable, is positive for the country.
Implementation difficulties are linked to the weak resourcebase of most local govemments, as well as
to their poor capacity. Another caveat is that the impact o f decentralization on central and
deconcentrated structures o f the State has not been looked at in a systematic way, while transfers o f
responsibilities sometimesoccurred inahastedmanner.




                                               72

12. Cape Verde's government is struggling to reduce the size of its public sector, while
rationalizing it and making it more efficient. Despite more than a decade of public sector reform,
citizens continue to perceive their public sector as inefficient and unresponsive. At the same time,
according to the 2004 Afrobarometer surveyl, 73% of Cape Verdean think that "all civil servants
should keep their jobs, even ifpayingtheir salaries is costly to the country", which reflects a context of
decreasingopportunities for emigration andhighunemployment, and constrainsreform options.

13. It is importantto notethat, unlike in manycountriesinthe sub-region, the residents of Cape
Verde generally don't perceive corruption as a major issue, as shown in the Afrobarometer
survey2. Nonetheless, public expenditurereform inparticular will contribute inkeeping corruption at
low levels.

14. An urgent issue is to prevent reforms to evolve haphazardly on various fronts, with some
sectors advancing faster than others, while synergies are necessaryto the success of the reform agenda.
Beyond the vision, the practical agenda of reform remains unequal across sectors, and if there is more
clarity for the public finances agenda, civil service reform for instance remains in its infancy.
Structures are currently shifting in different direction without guidance, and there are no plans for
strengthening human resources. Low level of coordination and lack of arbitrage between reforms
reinforce opportunities for isolated actions, theoretical approaches, and oversized projects which
impede small, low-keys, highimpact reforms to take place. To some extent, E-Government initiatives
are a case in point. Meanwhile, ad hoc initiatives are taken to overcome some rigidities of general
public management rules, such as the creation of specific schemes of services and the creation of
autonomous institutes. The two key players of the reforms, the Ministry for State Reform and Public
administration (MREAP) andthe Ministry of Finance, suffer from a lack o f a minimumlevel of human
resources, bothinnumber o f staffs and interms ofprofessional skills.

15. The proposed instrument to coordinate reforms could be strengthened. Recent actions for
reforming the public administration include the creation o f a Reform Commission, which entails
various representativesfrom key ministries, under the chairmanship of the Ministryfor State Reform
and Public Administration. It could be strengthened by being clearly supported at the level of the
council o f ministers, and operationalized at two technical levels : (i) the level of each ministry, to
                                                                           at
integrate sector reforms in a clear vision focused on key priorities and (ii) the interministerial level,
                                                                                at
to organize, sequence andmonitor the reform agenda ina coherentand sustainableframework.

11.      PROMOTINGGOOD GOVERNANCE,THE FIRSTPILLAR OFTHE GPRSP


16. The first pillar of the GPRSP is "PromotingGood Governance, StrengtheningEfficiency And
Equity", which emphasizesthe following:

0    Create an institutionalframework for State reformandprepare anational reformplan
0    Improve accountability andmonitoring and evaluation o fpublic resources
0    Reform human resourcesmanagement, including adoption of long-term training policy and focus on
local capacity for training (reform o fthe national training institute for public servants, the INAG)
0    Continue decentralization policies as away to encourageparticipation of citizens
     Simplify administrative proceduresfor most usedservices anduse IT as ameansto this end
0    Strengthen the rule of law and promote a transparent legal and regulatory framework as a means to
encourageentrepreneurshipandprivate sector growth.

III. PUBLICFINANCE

17. The issuespresentedhavebeendiscussedthoroughly inthe context of the CFAA, PER,
and CPAR exercises. The Government's reform agenda is based on the diagnostics of these
studies. Together, these analykal pieces provide a comprehensive overview o f the critical
weaknesses inthe public financialmanagement system.

18. The fiscal slippages of 1999-2000 were in part caused by public expenditure systems
that could not control the accumulation of expenditure beyond the means of the State,
either in the form o f oil price subsidies, restructuring expenses, or university scholarships. The
Government and external partners agreed that this episode demonstrated a clear need for a
sustained dialogue in matters o f budget systems, not only to help control the use o f the State's
resources, butalso improve their pro-poor targeting.

19.      The Bank, the Netherlands, the EU and UNDP have since launched in close
partnership three sweeping studies of the State's budget systems, which are now all
complete. Tellingly, all o f them were new to Cape Verde. The CFAA analyzed the fiduciary
integrity o f fmancial management systems. The PER followed with a complementary analysis
that confronted past expenditure trends with the weaknesses o f the current financial
management arrangements, often confirming the risks identified by the CFAA. Finally the
CPAR completed the analytical work with a review o f procurement systems. This analybcal
work has led to far-reaching policy discussions between the leading development partners and
the authorities.

20. The resultingrecommendations,which are fully internalizedbythe Government inits
GPRSP, have been the basis on which partners propose to provide financial assistance
through the Government's budget systems. The main findings of these three analyses are
detailed below, and are followed by the specific policy recommendations that are at the heart o f
the agreed PEMreformprogram.

RecentTrends in Expenditure by FunctionalClassification

22. Cape Verde has consistently allocated an important share of its budget to the
social sectors. Educationhas had the highest share of the three sectors inall years, with
a higho f almost 27% o f expenditure in2001 (8.5% of GDP). This share, as percentage
o f GDP, also remains fairly stable from year to year, due to the importance o f teachers'
salaries inits composition. Healthhas had about 6.5% o f the budget on average3,which
represents approximately 2.5% o f GDP, with little volatility.                     Together, these two
sectors account during any given year for not less than 30% o f expenditure4, or 13.O%
o f GDP. This establishes the Government's strong developmental credentials, since few
countries inthe sub-region allocate as much as it does to social sectors.




  This figure represents the expenditure administered directly through the central Government. It does not
 factor indirect transfers to the two main referral hospitals, which have grown from CV Esc. 205 millionin
 1998 (equivalent to 0.4% o f GDP) to CV Esc. 305 millionin2002 (also equivalent to 0.4% of GDP).
  To the exclusion o f subsidies andrestructuring costs in2000.

Sector budgets, as YOof GDP (reported execution)




Source: GOCV, IMF, and staff estimates

23.     The ministry of agriculture and fisheries has had less than 9% of the budget on
average, albeit with wider fluctuations from year to year. This volatility i s due mostly to
uneven performance in mobilizing external resources, while recurrent expenditure, as for the
social sectors, has ebbed down as a percentage o f GDP. Overall, agriculture's share o f GDP has
nonetheless shown a growthtrend from 1998 to 2002 (from 2.6% o f GDP to 3.3%).

24.    Justice, Public Administration, andInfrastructure and Sanitation are the other three
sectors that are allocated more than 1% of GDP. Their allocations are fairly stable, and
average (in percentage of GDP and percentage o f the budget), 1.6% (5%), 1.5% (4.5%), and
2.0% (6.5%), respectively. Together, they account for about 15% o f the budget. All o f these
sectors canjustifiably claim to have an important impact on poverty reduction.

25. In marked contrast with other countries in the sub-region, defense spending is low, at
2% o f the budget on average (0.7% o f GDP), and i s falling in line with the recurrent allocations
o f other line ministries. Moreover, the role o f the armed forces i s expanded to provide civil
security, as duringthe eruption o f the volcano in 1995.

26. Many of the achievements in poverty reduction can be credited in part to functional
budget arrangements. It i s therefore critical that they be adapted in all their dimensions
(budget preparation, execution, reporting, controls, etc) to improve their effectiveness, correct
their perverse side effects, and mitigate the risks o f expenditure overruns. The different aspects
o f P E Mare detailed below.

1. BUDGETPREPARATIONANDADOPTION

28. The budget elaboration cycle is carried out according to a reliable schedule, which is
usually strictly respected. The draft budget is submitted in October by the Government to the
National Assembly. The budget law i s voted during the 2nd week o f December. The National
Assembly then has 6 weeks to study the project. The president o f the finance committee
believes that this period o ftime is sufficient.

29.     The first stage of the budget elaboration process is not sufficiently developed. The
lack o f information on the annual budget preparation process points to the need for a real
medium-term expenditure framework.           The accumulation o f specific analytical deficiencies
reduces somewhat the usefulness o f the exercise o fbudget preparation, and makes it difficult for
the state to estimate the financing needs o fpublic services. There are three main analyhcal and
informational shortfalls:



                                                  76

30.   Firstly, the presentation of a true general policy framework is lacking in the call
circular at the begmning o f the annual elaboration budget cycle. This informational gap has
consequences for the coherence o f the sectoral budget programming and on the final quality o f
the overall budget.

31.   Second, the call circular sent by the MOF to the various l i e ministries does not
communicate all the relevant information. Recently presented in the shape o f a single
document, this circular synthesizes the recommendations expressed by the services o f the
General Directorate for the Budget @GO) concerning the elaboration o f the recurrent budget.
The opinion expressed by the Planning General Directorate @GP) concerning the elaboration o f
the investment budget is also includedinthe text, which i s a strong point. However, there is no
real analytrcal articulation between these two components. However, the absence of information
in the circular on the past year's execution leads to new allocations based on cost estimates o f
previous years. This practice o f incremental adjustments risks creates a gap between the budget
appropriations and the real needs of the services and risks jeopardizing the administrative
reforms (see PSR Annex).

32. Third, the macroeconomic framework is not taken into account. The MOF has a poor
grasp o f the real time macroeconomic situation o f the economy. Remedying this shortfall would
help provide a notional budget envelope in the call circular. One of the reasons i s the lack o f
macroeconomists to complete this work. A macroeconomic model is being procured to fill this
gap.

33. The budget preparation is carried out by 2 different departments, on the basis of two
separate budget classifications    -  this affects its consistency and comprehensiveness: the
DGP for investment operations and the DGOfor recurrent operations. The procedure o fbudget
preparation suffered, during last years, from a confusion in the distribution of the
responsibilities between the various directorates o f the MOF. The last revision o f the organic
law brings substantial improvement, since it entrusts the responsibility to coordinate the
preparation o f the draft budget to the DGO. The double intervention o f the DGP and the DGO
has recently seenprogress intheir coordination, butmainly because o f the strongpersonal bonds
betweenthe two departmentheads, andwithout a clear equivalencebetween expenditure line sin
the budget. This informal arrangement does not address adequately the difficulties inevaluating
the recurringcosts o f the investments andto integrate them into the budget.

2. TAXADMINISTRATION

34.    The General Directorate of Contribution and Taxes (DGCI) and the General
Directorate of Customs (DGA) are the main units responsible for tax assessments and
collection. The General Directorate o f Contribution and Taxes is in charge o f the income tax.
It is organized in 15 Repartigoes de Finangas (RF) in the different communes to assess,
communicate and collect taxes due. While the legal framework (codigo gbral tributario and
codigo deprocess0 tributario) is outdated, NOS1(see chapter 9 o f this Annex) is proceeding to
harmonize the IT systems o f the different RF. In spite o f the progress made, the organization of
DGCI is still not able to carry out some basic functions, such as internal controls, and taxpayer
audits, especially on more remote islands.          By contrast, the DGA is a well structured
organization with antennas inthe different regions5.



 The DGA is collecting as much as twice the receipts collectedby DGCI, including 19taxes other than
custom duties.


                                                  77

35.   The level of compliance of taxpayers with the income tax is not clear. DGCI has an
agreement with the largest commercial bank (Banco Comercial do Atlantico) to collect income
taxes and transfer them to the Treasury account. The reconciliation between the amounts
collected by BCA and taxes i s not done regularly, and therefore does not allow a close
monitoringo f the effectiveness o fthe arrangement.

36. The taxbase is probably significantly underestimated. The taxpayer registry @IF) has
not been updated inmore than 5 years, nor has there recently been an exercise to broaden it to
potential new taxpayers. Moreover, there are various other registries (e.g. land) for which it i s
impossible to establish equivalences with the income tax registry, and therefore cross-check
available information.

37. Delays in issuing tax notifications are pervasive - taxes o f 2000 were not yet notified in
2003. -This causes a growing disconnect between the accounting o f domestic revenue on an
accrual basis, and accounting o f it on a cash basis. Rapid improvements are necessary to avoid
the accumulationo farrears.

3. BUDGETEXECUTION

Recurrent expenditure

39. The following paragraphs first present the procedure such as it i s defined by the texts in
force, then, ina second part, the real procedure used inpractice untilthe new Decree-Law came
into effect (January 1,2004).

40. The procedure described in the texts is prescriptive, with specific features that are
inspired by the Napoleonic system. The system currently in force i s highly centralized at the
level o f the MOF. This method o f centralization, on the one hand, has the advantage o f allowing
an effective control o f expenditure flows, thanks to their control by the Directorate for Public
Accounting (DCP). But on the other hand, it presents the disadvantage o f making the sectoral
ministers less responsible for their budget, and causing delays in policy implementation more
 generally. There are 6 phases inthe expenditure stream :
 .
 .   Emissiono f a requisitionby the concemed technical ministry ;
     Validation o f the requisitionby the DCP. This operation, which consists inchecking the
 availability o f the appropriations, i s called "cabimento";
     Retumof a copy o f the "cabimento" to the technical ministryfor order o f work or supply;
     After execution o f the service, liquidation o f the amounts due by the DCP.The liquidation
 consists in calculating the national debt and certifying the effectiveness o f the expenditure,
 thanks to the documentary evidence providedby the qualified service o f the line ministry;
     Emissiono f an order to pay by the DCP;
     Payment, to be carried out by the Directorate for Payment Services (DSP) o f the Directorate
 General o f the Treasury (DGT).

 41. The practice is largely different from the texts, especially because of the recurring
 treasury problems experienced by the State.               For many transactions, commitment and
 liquidation are done simultaneously, whereas these two stages should differ in time. It also
 happens that, at the request o f the suppliers who may fear late payments, payment is in effect
 done before the delivery o f the supplies or the completion o fthe work.




                                                      78

42. The control of the effectiveness of the expenditure, which is entrusted to the services of
the line ministries, is poor. The cash shortage that the State experienced during the last few
years led to a loss o f trust o f the suppliers inthe State. Indeed, the expenditure procedure was
lengthened, leading to doubts that the payment would ever occur. In order to cover this risk,
when they agree to contract with the State, the suppliers raise their prices, or ask for payment
before the service is provided. Since the ministries are not informed o f when the payments are
made, their operations are disturbed, insofar as the programming o f the commitments i s done
without real-time information on the status o f liabilities toward their suppliers.

43. Reliable reporting is made more difficult by a supplemental period that allows for the
inclusion of an unlimited number of transactions during at least 3 months after the end of
the fiscal year. A 2 month period would be largely sufficient inthe near term, with a view to
limit it to one months to improve the ability o f the Government to make timely and informed
policy decisions. Moreover, some data retention keeps execution data incomplete, which i s part
o fthe reason that the state general accounts have not been closed since 1998.

44. The absence of handbooks of procedures is strongly felt. This deficiency is made worse
by the little knowledge about ongoing reforms, which is resented as being imposed randomly
and arbitrarily. The drafting and the distribution o f these documents would aim at ensuring
greater respect o f the written procedures, but also facilitating the integration o f the new data-
processing tools inthe services (see later chapter on ongoingreforms).

45. The lack of a single accounting system6prevents the aggregation of the financial data
from all public institutions. It i s therefore very difficult to carry out a consolidation o f
accounts, and inparticular to determine their debt and arrears, which i s all the more perturbing
that the State may have to ensure the payment o f these liabilities.

46. Finally, budget execution does not reflect the management of the public debt, since it is
not managed through the current accounting system. The estimation o f the debt and related
payments is made with extra accounting tools. Moreover, the DGT i s unable to provide the
amount o f the stock o f arrears concerning the current fiscal year and previous fiscal years.

Investment expenditure

47. The procedures for investment expenditure vary according to their source of
financing: domestic revenue, or external financing. The modalities are describedbelow.

48. The procedure followed for investment expenditure financed from domestic revenue is
the same as for recurrent expenditure, but procedures for effecting expenditure fmanced
by external financing are disparate and difficult to monitor. The management of most
investment projects i s done within the framework o fproject coordination units. The DGP takes
part only in the monitoring. It carries out the disbursements in isolation from the other
departments that keep accounts o fpublic expenditure. It i s difficult for this type o f expenditure,
as for the expenditure on counterpart funds, to carry out a typology o f the used procedures,
insofar as each donor asks for the application o f its own procedures. It i s thus very difficult to
gather the necessary information for the compilation o f the General Accounts o f the State. This
partly explains the important delay inthe closing o f accounts and thus inthe production of this
document for the Tribunal de Contas.


6 The term "single accounting system" covers the concepts o f integrated data-management arrangements,
and an integrated accounting framework (from equivalent charts of accounts, or a single one).


                                                    79

49. The regulation applicable to the autonomous accounts of projects is also far from
being respected. Further consideration will be given to this problem in the chapter relating to
the cash management. Indeed, many accounts are still open at institutions other than the Central
Bank(BCV). Large amounts inproject accounts are thus not captured inthe state's accounts of
executed expenditure (accrual or cash basis); they would be easier to track and consolidate if
they were all at the BCV and clearly tagged as project accounts in a sub-account o f the State's
main account. This situation i s not conducive to a practical management o f public funds, nor a
timely collection o f information necessary to the closing o f the General Accounts o f the State.
Therefore, the rate of execution o f investments i s very difficult to evaluate.

50. A common feature of the various types of mechanisms for the financing of investments
i s the inabilityto carry forward unspent expenditure from one year to the next, Regardless
of the type o f financing o f the investment, and in the absence o f timely information on
execution, there is no mechanism with an automatic "forward carry" o f the appropriations not
used during a fiscal year to the next. This risks causing the premature end o f work on a given
program, ifthe appropriations are not reallocated.

4. PROCUREMENT

5 1. Cape Verde does not have a consolidated legal and regulatory framework for all public
sector procurement (central and local administration and public institutions). Indeed, only a
decree-law exists for public works. For acquisition o f goods, equipments and services, there are
only few indications in several dispersed laws and the annual law for budget execution, but no
real guidelines and principles on the procurement process. The preparation o f a new National
Procurement Code i s expected shortly; it will clearly define the concept of "Public
Procurement" and the general principles which govern it.This Code will also introduce entirely
new concepts, like the concession o f public utility (such as Build Operate Transfer - BOT,
BuildTransfer -BT or BuildOperate Own-BOO). Inaddition, the legal framework will also
be complemented by a law on the Delegated Management Contract, to consolidate the good
performance o f AGECABO on managing small works contracts at the municipal level. The
same legal documents will also apply to the Municipalities, with the necessary adaptations and
simplifications.

52. The institutional framework reflects the absence of a comprehensive legal framework:
there are several institutions intervening in the procurement process with little or no
coordination: the Ministry of Infi-astructureand Transports (MIT) and AGECABO (at the local
level) for the civil works, the Directorate General o f Public Assets (DGPE) for some centralized
contracts (water and energy, telecommunications, insurance, hel) and all public institutions
(ministries, institutes, municipalities) for small acquisitions o f goods, equipments and services.

53. Procurement processes are being slowed by a dilution of responsibility, as most
ministries and institutions are not responsible for their own procurement (although the
procurement o f civil works i s always supported by the MIT). AGECABO, despite its proven
efficiency, is not always invited to provide services for municipalities for small public works
contracts. An authority for contract homologation (for example the ministry o f tutelage) also
needs to be introduced in the system. Prior reviews for contracts above a certain amount would
have to be approved by the Prime Minister, based on recommendations from an ad hoc
committee putinplace for such contracts.

54. The absence of effective recourse mechanisms (with the power to suspend the
execution of the contested contract) is being remedied, in the form o f Arbitration and



                                                   80

Mediation Centers, to be created in the chambers o f commerce (initially, for private sector
commercial disputes). These centers are to have decisional power (instead o f the administrative
courts) for litigations on attribution and execution o f contracts.

55. Procurementproceduresand practicevary widely, except for the civil works. There are
no standard bidding documents, request for proposals, or evaluation reports. The lack o f
consolidated regulatory framework leads to different practices from the participants on the
public procurement system, with negative impact on the private sector intervention.

56. Human resources are currentlyunevenly distributedandbroadly inadequate.The MIT
has qualified personnel to handle procurement, but limited innumber to respond to all requests.
For the other sectors, there are no qualifiedpeople working specifically on procurement. Neither
is there, within Cape Verde, adequate training on offer to improve the situation.

57. The ex ante control is currently done by the Tribunal de Contas, which i s also the
authority for ex post review. As mentioned above, in order to avoid this situation o f conflict o f
interest, ,there are plans to make give these attributions to the Prime Minister cabinet, through
ad hoc evaluation committees (for big contracts). Small contracts will be managed by the
ministries/institutions responsible for their own procurement process. The ex post review will
remain a responsibility o f the Tribunal de Contas. The ex-post review i s currently undermined
by the delay injudging the state general accounts to provide a context to the contract review.
Nor does the TdC have authority to extract effective compensation to enforce itsjudgments.

58. An analysis of the privatesector hadshownthat there is enough capacity to participate
in most of the public procurement processes. However, there is limited information on
procurement opportunities. The availability o f the intemet is not being leveraged to make
available electronic versions o f all the documents to guide public purchasers. The use o f the
intemetwill also be critical inpromoting transparency.

5. CASHMANAGEMENT

59. Cash is managed only on a daily basis and is hindered by the presence of many
accountsopenedin the bankingsystem. Itis the responsibility o fthe Resources Programming
and Management Directorate (DGPR) and the Payment Service Directorate (DSP) o f the
General Directorate o f the Treasury (DGT). It is specifically regulated by Decree-Law # 29/98
on norms andprocedures pertaining to the management o f the Treasury account.

60. The DGPR has been given the task of developing monthly and annual treasury
budgets. Informationon the estimated level o f the receipts comes from the General Directorate
for Taxes (DGCI) and the General Directorate for Customs (DGA). The DGO provides
information regarding the expenditure side. The annual programming exists only in theory.
Because o f past fiscal slippages, the State cash management reflects a very short-term vision
(sometimes almost a day-by-day management), intended to face the needs qualified as urgent.
The medium-term programming is quasi-non-existent.

61. There are many unrecorded accounts open in the banking system. This is the case for
extemally financed investments projects, some ministries, and the autonomous institutions.
However, the latter are prohibited from opening a bank account in a primary bank. The
existence o f these accounts does not allow an effective treasury management and generates
important financial costs. Indeed, the State i s forced to borrow to face its financing need,
whereas some o f these accounts have a large credit position. A decision had been made in 1999



                                                  81

to close all these accounts. Itwas only partially implemented, andremaining accounts are being
counted. At the end o fthis work, only the strictly necessary accounts will be kept.

6. EXTERNAL INTERNAL CONTROLS
                   AND

62. Except for the internal financial control, which is only partially operational, Cape
Verde presents a complete audit system. Its various components are detailed below, and
followed by discussions o f some recommendations.

Internal auditing

63. Insofar as the ex-ante financial control i s not yet inplace, and since there i s no operational
structure o f internal audit at the level o f the directorates, this task will be analyzed only through
the mandates and activities o f the General Inspection for Finance (IGF), which answers to the
MOF. Two essential texts providethe legalbasis :
.
     Decree-Law # 30-2001of November 26th, 2001 relating to the organization o f the MOF
(Article 57) defines the IGF as an administrative entity placed under the control o f the Minister
o f Finance;
.
     Organic Decree-Law # 130-92 o f November 23, 1992 deals with its statute and its field o f
intervention.


64. I t s field of investigationis broad. It includes: (i)    general services o f the MOF and the line
ministries; (ii)   the whole o f the public establishments and institutes; (iii)     municipalities and
embassies; (iv) public companies and autonomous funds; (v) companies, as regards the control
o f their tax obligations.

65. Specific missions are also entrusted to it: (i)             controls o f the financial transactions
c o m i t t e d with public funds; (ii)  training activities to improve the operation o f the State
services; (iii)   audits o f the services at the request o f the State administrators, under the control
o f the MOF; (iv) technical Support to the cabinet o f the MOF.

66. The operations of the IGF are seriously weakened by insufficientmeans at its disposal.
Itis hinderedby lack o fqualifiedpersonnel, equipment, and authority to fulfillitmandate. The
existing personnel o f the IGFhas strong technical qualifications, but its limited headcount does
not make it possible to organize the services as stipulated by the decree-law. Currently, the IGF
i s made o f a brigade o f 12 inspectorsplacedunder the authority o f a director. The IGF therefore
adopted a work organization that makes it possible to mitigate the staff shortage. Inpractice, the
inspectors work by team o f two and are placed under the control o f the director to answer the
most urgent requests o f controls and audits. At the time o f the mission, 70% o f the inspectors
were focusing on the sector o f the local communities because o f the preparation o f local
elections. Two important factors harm the possibilities o f recruitment and personnel turnover
within the IGF:(i) private sector offers better remuneratedpositions or often more attractive
                      the
carrier plans; (ii)  the unmitigated use o f temporary assignments out of the primary department
accentuates the mobility o f the personnel and harms the continuity o f the services. Both should
issue should be addressedby institutionalreforms described inthe next technical annex.

67. The recurrent appropriationsavailableto the IGF are very limited. This situation does
not make it possible to organize audits in sufficientnumber, and more particularly inthe various
islands o f the archipelago or in the embassies. The IGF also works out o f an architecturally
arcane building.A new buildingfor IGFi s planned.


                                                      82

The externalaudit

68. In general, the bodies for extemal audits, namely the Tribunal de Contas and the National
Assembly, operate independently from the other audit bodies.

The Tribunalde Contas

69. The Tribunalde Contas has beencreatedby Law # 84/IV/93 of July 12,1993, and has
the administrative autonomy and is independencefrom the politicalpowers. Although it
does not have financial autonomy, it masters its financial management and has its own bank
accounts. The budget o f the Tribunal de Contas i s negotiated annually with the Minister o f
Finance, on the basis of the Court's proposals.

70. The Tribunal de Contas is a jurisdictional body endowed with a vast field of
competencesand broad capacities. Law # 84/IV/93 confers on the Tribunal de Contas great
investigative powers. They apply to all entities which manage public fund; and all financial or
contractual transactions which commit the State or affect public finance management. It has
therefore been in charge o f the ex-ante monitoring o f large public contracts that commit the
State.

71. Work relatingto the analysisandthe auditing of the GeneralAccounts of the State has
suffered important delays. The Law authorizes the audit by the Tribunal de Contas of the
State General Account submitted by the Minister o f Finance. Following this audit, the Tribunal
de Contas simultaneously emits comments to the Prime Minister and to the President o f the
National Assembly. These points o f information are then published in the State Official
Bulletin. At present, the last General Accounts o f the State submitted to the Tribunal de Contas
by the MOFdatesback to 1997. Since this date, no reportrelatingto budget executionhasbeen
communicated to the Court. This important delay considerably decreases the impact o f the
comments made by this body, knowing that these elements should make it possible to improve,
from one year to the other, the public finance management.

72. The Tribunal de Contas has insufficient means to fulfill1 its mandates. One o f the
reasons o f these difficulties lies in the high cost o f the transport means connecting the various
islands o fthe archipelago. This situation limits the capacity o ftraveling for the staff o f the Court
as well as o f carrying out investigations in the field. This situation is all the more prejudicial
that Cape Verde is developing a policy of decentralization and deconcentration of its
administrations. The problem i s the same concerning the audits o f the embassies, which are
administratively autonomous.

73. The Tribunal de Contas is not sufficiently involved in the process of the reforms in
progress. It does not have an "intranet" server connection to the server o f the DGO, which
would facilitate and guarantee the transmission of quantitative data.

The FinanceCommitteeoftheNationalAssembly

74. The NationalAssembly is to isolatedto carry out its monitoring.The Government does
not send the quarterly execution reports intended to allow the Committee to monitor the budget
duringthe fiscal year. This is nonetheless compulsory from the law text. The commission does
not have access to any data and it should be noted that, contrary to the other audit entities, it i s
not connected to the Intranet network, which accentuates its isolation. As specified above,
insofar as the State's General Accounts have not been produced since 1997, the National



                                                  83

Assembly has only limited leverage to carry out its political ex-post audit o f the budget's
execution. It should also be noted that the National Assembly is also isolated about the reforms
inprogress relating to the public finance management and for which it is not recipient of any
information.

7. PROGRESSONTHEREFORMS             OFPUBLICEXPENDITURE          MANAGEMENT


Organization of the Reform Process

75. The appreciation of the situation concerning public finance management in Cape
Verde cannot be done without taking into account the various reforms in progress. These
reforms are carried out by the RAFE, an organization with the mission o f modemizing all the
aspects o fpublic management. The original 3 year mandate has come to an end in2003, and the
RAFE's existence has been continued under the supervision of the Prime Minister's office, and
under a new name: NOSI. This change thus constitutes recognition o f its merits and effectively
represents a widening o f its competencies. To ensure the continuity in the implementation o f
reforms, it has been decided that one o f its priority tasks will consist in the maintenance o f the
information data-processing systems already in place. With regard to the aspects o f its mission
that involve public accounting, NOSIis working on the following points:

At the legaland regulatory level:
.
     The regulation on Public Accounting. Set by the Decree-Law # 29/2001 o f November 19,
2001, this reform took effect on January 1, 2004, and specified that certain data-processing
aspects were set up on January 1, 2003. The new Decree-Law i s largely inspired from the
system in force in the French-speaking countries. Its most notable new elements are: (i)the
formalization o f the role o f authorizing officers and o f the phases o f expenditure; (ii)     the
decentralization of the spending decision by giving the sectoral ministers the responsibility o f
authorizing officers, (iii)the creation o f an ex-ante financial control o f expenditure and (iv) the
definition o f a modem accounting system.          This new text, which applies to the central
administration as well as to institutions with financial autonomy and all publicly-owned
institutions, i s a great improvement in the budget execution process. It defines the rules
applicable to public finance management, and sets in practice the principles o f checks-and-
balances and transparency.
 ..  The budget nomenclature which, although not yet completely finalized, was already
implemented on January 1,2003;
     The State chart o f accounts, which i s operational since January 1,2004; with the new chart
o f accounts, information about the level o f arrears should experience notable improvements.
Under the condition that information enters the system; the accounting system will be able to
present the figures concerningthe stock o f the foreign debt, as well as the domestic debt.
 .
     The improvement o f revenue collection: there i s currently no check between the sums
 collected by the banking system concerning the taxes and the customs duties on one side, and
the sumseffectivelydepositedinthe Statetreasury account. The trust inbanksis suchthat there
i s currently no service, which would monitor and validate the amount o f the receipt carried out
by the DGA. W E is programmed to work as o f the summer o f 2003 on this topic with the
DGA.The goal is to leave open only one bank account inthe name ofthe DGA.

At the data-processing level:




                                                  84

0   A new computerized expenditure stream, which has been deployed on a limited basis on
January 1, 2004. This i s the second version o f the software specifically adapted to the needs of
the municipalities;
0    An information data-processing system for humanresources management, which will make
itpossible to exploit data fromthe civil service census inprogress;
0    Regarding the national debt, interface software. It will allow, in connection with the
software for the simulation o f the debt, to carry out the interface between the software for the
debt management andthe accounting system.;
0    The development o f a process o f on-line maintenance from Praia o f the information data
processing systems and the software installed on the islands.


76. All these reforms represent an important cultural change. In addition, the institutional
aspects risk being occulted by the data-processing aspects. NOSI's initiatives have been
imposed within very tight deadlines. Although they work with executives specialized on the
regulatory aspects, the decision makers o f this structure are tempted to computerize as fast as
possible. The pace thus adopted risks harming a good buy-ino f these reforms by the personnel
incharge ofitsimplementation, or the correct use ofthesetools.

77. There are issues with the management of the reform itself. First, the services o f the
DCP are poorly informed o f the content o f the future State chart o f accounts. According to the
elements received fkom the coordinator o f NOSI, the data-processing application will generate,
inan almost automatic andtransparent manner, the majority ofthe accounting operations. This
methodhas the advantage o f effectiveness andreliability. However, it presents the disadvantage
o f masking the aspects relating to the accounting technique, and i s therefore not didactic. It
tends to make the personnel in charge o f the data-processing and recording less responsible.

78. Second, the new budget nomenclature has been developed without collaboration with
the concerned services of the ministries, which i s likely to cause some degree o f rejection by
them.     The hasty character o f the implementation o f the software leads to misunderstandings
and misuses, andultimately misreporting.

79. Both risks also affect the adaptation of the software to municipalities' needs. Although
the new accounting directive is not yet in force for municipalities, the information data-
processing system has been especially adapted to their needs, and has been already installed on
 3 sites for tests. One o f the consequences o f the lack o f proper coordination i s evidenced by the
 fact that NOSI has taken a decision to have the municipalities use the State's budget
nomenclature, while the administration in charge o f the management o f the municipalities i s
designing a new accounting directive which will comprise a different nomenclature, without any
linkto the State budget nomenclature. Past experience proves that computerization should not
precede the institutional aspects, butto the contrary, follow them.

IV.       CIVIL SERVICEREFORM

 80. Past reforms have tried, with limited success, to improve personnel systems and
 services, such as recruitment, organizational planning and career management, and to
 streamline the civil service. A new career and salary system (PCCS) was adopted in 1992,
 with progression not solely based on seniority and promotion done through competitive exams.
 Implementation o fthe system has proven difficult (resistance from the agents, weaknesses o f the
 system o f competitive exams). Human resources management remains centralized at the




                                                   85

MREAP. Top positions remain strongly politicized, as demonstrated by multiple changes
following elections (national or local).

81. Despite the fact that the State is the first employer in the country, civil service
positions fail to retain qualified professionals. Today, there are few high level and
experienced staff, staff at managerial positions are visibly overstretched, andsome key positions
are filled by international experts on secondment. The absence o f a clear professional training
strategy deepens the problem. Professional training remains a mainly donor-financed activity,
organized on an ad hoc basis, outside the purview o f an underdeveloped school o f
administration. The high turnover o f managerial staff and the fact that individual positions are
not governedby clear mission statements make public action a stop and go activity.

82. The ad-hoc proliferationof specific schemes is detrimentalto sound human resources
management. Inorder to try to remedy the unattractive package offeredby the "general" civil
service pay and employment scheme, an ad-hoc solution has been to allow sub-sets o f civil
servants to be ruled under specific separate schemes with a more attractive package. The civil
service database counts 49 specific schemes o f services, with two main caveats to this situation.
Inthe absenceofclear criteria for establishing such schemes, their adoption is moretheresult of
bargaining positions within the govemment than the result o f an informed analysis on needed
qualifications and skills within the state apparatus.          It has not been accompanied by
implementation o f an evaluation system that would justify salary increases by higher monitoring
o fperformance.

83. A comprehensivecivil service census was conducted in 2002. Finalization o f data input
took place in 2003, but validation o f the data i s lagging, because o f lack o f strong political
commitment and appropriate management o f the project, which has so far prevented this
databaseto become a tool o fhumanresources management and reform.

84. The NDPidentifiesthe revision of the 1992 PCCSas an importanttarget. Many issues
will need to be reflected upon in elaborating this new document, among which the degree o f
decentralization o f human resources management, the future o f the various specific schemes o f
services, the use o f contract positions, the number o f political appointees, salaries and benefits,
the geographical distribution o f skilledprofessional and incentives to work inremote areas.

85. Currently, there are few procedures and instrumentsto translate reform strategies in
concreteand realistic activities and steps. Insome cases, the only action taken to implement
change is enacting a law, without estimates o f expected cost, time, or impact on existing
structures. Many laws are moreover enacted, butnot followed by the related decrees that would
make them operational.

86. Current changes in public management need to be accompanied by restructuring
efforts. Lack o f coordination between different ministries and different levels o f govemment,
and inadequate linkages between sector policies and budget allocations are epitomizing the
challenges ahead.     The Cape-Verdean administration i s moving towards new principles o f
public management, based on a clear articulation between strategies, allocated resources and
expected results.    To accompany this trend and ongoing public expenditure management
reforms, the Govemment i s planningto merge existingunits currently incharge o f recurrent and
investment budgets in a single unit. This will be completed by the creation o f a "public
manager" career to provide various administrations with specialists in public management and
retainthem inthe administration.




                                                  86

V.        DECENTRALIZATION

87. Decentralization is one of the key vehicles chosen by the Government to improve
service delivery. Political decentralization in the country started in 1989, with four local
elections between 1991 and 2004. The legal framework for decentralization gives the 17
municipalities broad attributions (including health and education).        Transitory rules for
implementation specify that attributions will be delegated progressively. To date, four areas
have been transferred: public works, roads, social promotion and municipal taxes.

88. Implementation difficulties are due to a poor adaptation of central government and
de-concentrated agencies to a decentralized setting, poor coordination between the various
actors, lack of clarity and planning of transfers and weaknesses in the legal framework.
Both municipal prerogatives and financing are currently defined under an outdated set o f laws
which i s being updated. Further thought also needs to be given to the channels through which
municipalities and the central government coordinate their interventions. Today, municipalities
take actions that have a bearing on the central state budget without prior dialogue with relevant
authorities, there is overlapping o f mandates, and some sectors fall between the cracks. Since
there i s no institutionalized coordination mechanismthat would bringtogether all local actors at
regular intervals, collaboration depends too muchon interpersonalrelationships.

89. Two major stumbling blocks remain: financial and human resources.                   Financial
resources. Municipal resources are composed o f central transfers (the formula-based Financial
Equilibrium Fund (FEF) and contract programs), local taxes and proceeds o f decentralized
cooperation. The FEFi s the main source o fresources for most municipalities, and its formula is
criticized since it does not adequately reflect poverty levels, and can be a disincentive to
improve tax collection. A draft law proposing a revised formula i s inpreparation. Devolution o f
local taxes to the municipalities proved difficult to implement, due to weakness in
administrative capacity to collect, uncertainties (outdated cadastre) and weak resource base o f
most municipalities. Another problem i s that there i s no comprehensive knowledge o f the
municipalities' resources, since municipal budgets do not follow a standardized format, and
proceeds o f decentralized cooperation or one-off revenue such as the sale o f landmay represent
an important source o f financing.

90. Human resources.         Attracting qualified personnel outside the capital, particularly in
smaller islands, i s difficult, and this especially since municipalities do not benefit from a
specific, more attractive scheme o f service. In order to accompany transfer o f competencies,
various solutions were found (secondment, partial transfer, etc), which have not always been
satisfactory. There i s a need to revisit, from the viewpoint o f the municipalities, the need for
staffmg, in the context o f the broad HRMreform, and elaborate various options, which would
give municipality flexibility inhiringand retrenching while encouraging use o f existing staff in
the public service.




VI.       E-GOVERNMENT

91, `E-Government' has advanced in its conception and implementation in recent years.
The Govemment o f Cape Verde sees applying modem information technologies as a core
opportunity to improve the effectiveness, outreach and transparency o f public services, a goal
directly related to successful poverty reduction strategies. Use of IT is particularly attractive in


                                                 87

a discontinuous geographical setting and in a country with a very important expatriate
community.

92. There is local capacity to design IT systems. Created in 1997 to oversee and manage the
financial reform process, the mandate o f the State Financial Administration Reform (RAFE) i s
to strengthen the institutional capacity to manage public resources and to create the necessary
instruments to do so, including the implementation o f information technologies. RAFE has
grown into a more ambitious unit, dealing with various ITmodernization projects inthe country
(single-windows in the municipalities, development o f websites,            central government
networking).    In 2003, RAFE was renamed NOSI (Operational Nucleus for Information
Systems) and attached to the Prime Minister's office, to underline its crosscutting mandate.

93. While IT activities have shown results, the IT capacity has not always been matched by
organizational, financial or institutional capacity. There is an urgency to match NOSI's
activities with sufficient buy-in from the services, appropriate changes in structures, necessary
training,   and reengineering o f processes. Establishing a multi-year action plan, based on
prioritization, cost estimates and absorptive capacity - emphasis on change management and
restructuring parallel to IT introduction- would help. At the very least, any activity undertaken
by NOSIshould follow a strict protocol, including earmarking of expected recurrent costs. (cf.
part 3 on PEMrelatedNOSI's activities).

94. A current focus of public administration reform is the creation of "citizen houses", a
one-stop-shop that would provide a unique entry point for most used services to users. The
model, which will rely on IT, is been developed. This could, if rightly implemented, translate
public sector reforms into visible benefits for the users.

VII.     LEGALAND JUDICIAL REFORM

95, A high profile study, "Study Assessing the Judicial System in Cape Verde" was
conducted in 2002 with strong top level commitment from the Ministry o f Justice to combine
different sector and projectcomponents into a comprehensive reform strategy.

96. The Ministry of Justice has adopted a Strategic Plan for 2003-2005 in which it has
defined priorities for the sector, among which: (i)the promotion o f sensitization and
communication campaigns to enhance knowledge and adequacy to the rule o f law; (ii) and   fkee
easy access to justice for the poor; and (iii)   the creation and promotion o f alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms for the poor. The protection and promotion o f human and citizen's
rightso fthe mostvulnerable groups is explicit inthe draft GPRSP.

97. Broadening knowledge and access to justice is a priority to create conditions for the
creation of an environment conducive to the effective exercise of individual and collective
rights, and increase legal security as a fundamental aspect of economic development. This
first priority will be dealt with through community-based programs, in order to enhance
ownership and impact of the actions. Following a growing consensus among legal professionals
that legal andjudicial assistance (in and outside the court rooms) need to be totally re-organized
and re-designed, the reform o fjudicial aid i s another key priority.

98. Judicial aid and alternative dispute resolutions are key instruments to broaden access
to justice.    The allocation o f fbnds for judicial aid by the Ministry o f Justice for the
compensation o f attorneys involved in the judicial protection o f poor persons incourts needs to
be strengthened as demand for these services i s expected to grow rapidly. The third priority i s


                                                  88

the increase o f the offer of Alternative DisputeResolutions (ADR). Conciliation and mediation
of private disputes, on a voluntary basis, have proved in many countries to be an efficient and
effective tool to solve small disputes. They also help reduce courts' backlog and delays.
Conciliation and mediation require an adequate legal framework and service infrastructure
(places where they can be carried out with a highlevel of confidentiality; a good training and
the adequacy to a strong ethic code for conciliators and mediators; a clear knowledge from
parties about what these mechanisms entail; the definite and absolute prohibition to bring any
aspect of any conciliation and mediation procedure to a judicial forum, etc.). A law i s been
preparedto that effect.

Background
1. Cape Verde has made a commitment to work towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals in education (MDG#3 is to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere,
boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling). Over the
past 5 years, the Government has achieved quasi-universal primary enrollment. In 2002-03, it
was estimated that over 80 percent o f the students graduated from primary school and the
transition rate to secondary for those graduating from primary was estimated at 70 percent.
Illiteracy for the population over 15 years o f age has been halved since 1981, and currently
stands at 25 percent. Illiteracy is concentrated among adults (particularly rural women), with
literacy rates among 15-24 year olds at 95 percent due to gains in schooling over the last 20
years. Gender equity is achieved at the primary level, and girls outnumber boys slightly at the
secondary and tertiary levels. Cape Verde's education achievements now rank among the top o f
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries andother countries o f lower middle income level.
.
=    Among the strengths o f the Cape Verde's education sector, it is importantto point out:
     a highand stable level o fpublic financing for education which has been maintained roughly
around 8 percent o f GDP over the years;
.
     a lean administration o f the Education Ministry, with 2 percent o f staff in central
administration, 10 percent o f staff in delegations, and 88 percent o f teachers in teaching
assignments andmainly inprimary education where most students are enrolled; and
.
     a high level o f capital expenditure allocated principally to secondary education in order to
prepare the surgingdemand for this education sub-sector.


Mainissues inthe education sector
2. Several studies have been completed by the Government, the Bank and others which
diagnose the mainissuesinthe education sector'. Briefly, these issues include:

     0   An inadequate coverage of early childhood education. Less than 50 percent o fthe 3-
         5 year old attend early childhood education (ECE). Regional and socio-economic
         disparities in access to ECE are extremely strong. This sub-sector is characterized by
         the insufficient and unsatisfactory competence o f its teaching staff; the lack o f
         pedagogic materials; the low level and unpredictabilityo f its financing; and, the absence
         o f well-established rules and responsibilities interms o f service delivery.

     0   The quality of primary education remains unsatisfactory. Despite one o f the highest
         unitcost per student inthe sub-region, the average repetitionrate inprimary education
         remains stubbomly around 12 percent. This i s inpart due to a low level o f competence
         o f the teaching staff. A third o f the teachers have no academic qualification. The
         deployment o f untrained teachers inpoor municipalities (district) reinforces the regional
         disparities. The low quality o f primary education also stems from the use o f inadequate
         pedagogy, in particular in regard to the teaching o f Portuguese and Math. Finally,
         school autonomy is weak. There are few opportunities for schools to work together,


  The education sector has been reviewed inthe PER, DPR and draft Poverty Assessment.


                                                  92

       share information and look for innovative solutions. The link between the school and
       the community has not been sufficiently developed.

       A surging demand for secondary education. As a large share o f students graduates
       from primary, secondary education has to cope with mounting pressure to improve the
       range and quality o f its offerings.      Despite some recent investments in schooling
       infrastructure, the secondary education sub-sector i s ill-prepared for the surge in
       enrollment. There are a few large secondary schools (with a capacity between 2,000
       and 5,000 students) but not enough medium size lower secondary schools.            School
       facilities are unequally distributed between islands and within islands.       There is a
       shortage o f teachers. The curriculum is outdated. Front teaching i s prevalent with little
       recourse to experimentation and practical exercise.        Secondary technical education
       remains marginalized. Students enrolled in technical education do not benefit from
       complementary professional training which would facilitate their entry into the job
       market.

       A professional training system flawed. The professional training system is not
       structured to respond to the social demand nor to meet the needs o f the economy in
       qualified labor force. Rules and responsibilities governing the sector are unclear. Very
        few providers are certified. There i s no pedagogic supervision. Curriculum content i s
        sometimes random anddegrees are not always accepted by the private sector.

        Tertiary education supply is insufficient. Grants and opportunities to study abroad
       have been reduced in recent years whereas the number o f students completing upper
        secondary i s growing rapidly.       The number and relevance o f tertiary education
        institutions are insufficient to respond to the demand and meet the needs o f Cape Verde
        economic and social development.

        Teacher salaries are crowding out other types of recurrent expenditure. Salaries
        consistently absorb about 90 percent o f recurrent expenditures, and could be construed
        as a measure o f inefficiency. While the average teacher salary relative to GDP for
        primary education i s close to the regional average (but higher than the ratio o f 2.0 for
        countries with similar levels o f income), their level for secondary education i s much
        higher, and contributes to the high percentage of personnel charges in recurrent
        expenditure.

EducationReform Strategy
2.    The priorities for the Government's educationpolicy are spelled out in the Major
Options of the Plan and the National DevelopmentPlan (2002-05). These priorities are as
follows:
        promoting equity and improving the functioning o f preschool education in order to
        create the conditions o f its progressive generalization;
        improving the quality o fprimary education;
        aligningthe resources o f secondary education on the requirements for development;
        supporting the development o f tertiary education;
        reducing illiteracy and supporting adult educationflife-long learning;
        developing professional training as a means for upgrading human resources and
        equipping them to meet the requirements o f the exercise o f citizenship and o f economic
        growth ando f increased competitiveness;
        consolidating school welfare programs; and
        promoting a national policy o f youth and sport to ensure a better integration the young
        generation into social life.



                                                  93

3.   Overall budget constraints put a premium on increases in efficiency to permit further
system expansion. The Education Ministry is considering two measures to improve efficiency
inprimary andsecondary education. The first measure aims at increasingthe pupilheacher ratio
(PTR) andimproving deployment o fteachers. This will permitto reduce the number o fteachers
and the overall salary recurrent expenses (of course additional teachers will have to be recruited
because o f the expansion o f access to secondary). Inprimary education, it i s expected that the
PTR will increase from 27 to 35 by 2009/10.             The other efficiency measure specific for
secondary is the number o f teaching hours per teacher which i s expected to increase from 18 to
22 hours per week. Other measures are related to the improvement o f intemal efficiency. In
primary education, it i s expected that the percentage o f graduate will increase by 2% points per
year as o f2004/05. Inthe meantime, repetition and dropout rate are also expected to improve,

4.       Some efficiency gains will only be possible if the quality of education improves.
Important efforts are currently made to improve the skills and proficiency o f primary teachers.
These will continue through at the implementation o f the PRSC. It will also be necessary that
all children enrolled have access to proper learning materials and that teachers know how to use
them. A student achievementtest will also be introduced inorder to measure student leaming in
key subject matters, such as Portuguese and mathematic. More regular testing will provide
useful information in order to better monitor progress achieved to improve education quality,
but also to identify specific student groups who are falling behind. In secondary education,
recent data show that the intemal efficiency i s worsening. The percentage o f repeaters in each
grade i s increasing. That situation i s partly due to rapid increase in secondary enrollment with a
sub-education level not ready to cope with this situation both in terms o f physical facilities, but
more importantly in terms o f number o f qualified teachers per subject area and leaming
materials available. It i s also possible that a number o f primary graduates entering secondary
education do not have the academic level. Finally, pressure to work or support families (indirect
cost o f schooling) is stronger in secondary than inprimary resulting in a lower attendance from
secondary students. To improve intemal efficiency insecondary the Ministryo f Education will
have to address the issues described above. Better trained teachers, some curriculum revision,
more intense pedagogic support, and availability o f teaching and learning materials in the
classroom will contribute to improve education quality and thus graduation rate. Efforts inthat
direction have already started and will intensify via the PRSC.

4.     Buildingon these priorities, the Government presented inMarch 2003, its Education
Strategic Plan focusing on six main areas, namely: (i)the consolidation and gradual
expansion o f all sub-sectors o f the education system; (ii)  the overall improvement o f the quality
and efficiency o f the education system; (iii)   the strengthening o f cultural and civic values; (iv)
the modernization o f the education system; (v) the transformation o f the education system to
support social progress and alleviate poverty; and (vi) the development o f partnerships to
improve the management and sustainability o f the education institutions.
Current Status


5.     Since 1999, the Education Ministry of Cape Verde has been implementing an IDA-
financed project aimed at consolidating and modernizing the education and training
sector. The achievement o f the project development objectives and implementation progress
are satisfactory. The project has supported the Education Ministry in its efforts to improve
service delivery in basic education mainly through: (i)      the construction and equipping o f new
classrooms; (ii)  the provision o f textbooks; and (iii) in-service teacher training. In the training
sector, the project has financed existing programs supporting apprenticeship and professional



                                                   94

training inorder to increasethe employability of the workforce and of school dropouts. Finally,
the project through financing of technical assistance, studies andpilot testing has contributed to
reinforcing the Education Ministry's knowledge base and analflcal skills (e.g.: education and
training sector's diagnostic and education strategic plan elaborated). The closing date of the
Credit was June 30,2004.

6.     In November 2003, Cape Verde received a US$6.9 million grant from the
Netherlands Government to support the implementation of its Education for All @FA)
plan of actions. This grant provides incremental financial resources channeled through the
Education Ministry's budgetand allocated mainly to: (i) childhood development; (ii)
                                                            early                              basic
education; and (iii)   capacity building. The Education Ministry has already received a first
installment ofUS$2.3 million.

7. In terms of recent achievement, the Education Ministry has taken some measures
aimed specifically at improvingthe quality and efficiencyof basic education. They include
the elaboration of new training modules and use of new pedagogxal approach for in-service
teacher training. Interms of efficiency, new decrees were promulgated to reform the graduating
system in primary and secondary education. This will contribute to reducing unnecessary
pupils'repetitionofa grade which is costly andoften leadsto droppingout. Finally, confronted
with rising costs due to the rapid growth of enrollment, the Education Ministry established a
progressive parent's financial contributionto secondary education basedon household income.



EducationPrioritiesinthe CapeVerde's GPRSP


 8.     The Government has underlinedthe centralityand the importanceof educationin
 its strategy of development. For this reason, the third pillar o f Cape Verde's PRSP aims to
 develop and upgrade human capital which includes notably the health and education sectors.
 The general objective set up by the Government for the education i s to improve the
 employability and skills of the labor force as a means to support economic growth and alleviate
 poverty inCape Verde. The accumulation andupgradingofhuman capital entail to improve the
 education system and to reinforce professional training. In particular, the Govemment has
 emphasizedthe needto: (i)    overcome barriers that preventthe poorest from accessing secondary
 education; (ii) improve teacher training in order to increase the education system's intemal
 efficiency, thus reduce school wastage at all levels; and, (iii)  reinforce the linkage between the
 education system and the labor market by ensuring that the skills and knowledge acquired are
 those neededby the economy.

 9.     Aligned with its Education Reform Strategy, the Government in its PRSP vows to
 expand access to the Early Childhood Education. Particular attention will be given to
 increase significantly the quality of education in all sub-sectors taking into consideration the
 reduction of regional, gender and socio-economic inequities. Promoting access to secondary
 education, diversifymg supply of vocational and professional training streams, and providing
 better schooling orientation and specialization will allow to raise the overall level of education
 of the population and to facilitate the entry of young graduates inthe active life. Strengthening
 and expanding the professionaltraining sector i s a keypolicy priority to reducepoverty, because
 this will enable to raise the skills/proficiency of the future workforce and to improve their
 adaptability, flexibility and sustainability to better respond to the need of a rapidly changing and
 growing economy.         Finally, developing and organizing tertiary education, in particular




                                                    95

supporting science and technology will create opportunities for the population to further their
education.


Financing of the GPRSP


10.     The overall cost of the consolidation, modernization and expansion of the education
system (89Y0 of all education programs in the PRSP) is expected to cost an estimated
US$37 million between 2005 and 2007.               Fifty-seven percent is equivalent to capital
expenditure and 43 percent i s equivalent to recurrent expenditure (based on the costing
documentsincluded inthe PRSP). Expenditures to increaseaccess to education includemainly:
(i) constructionofearlychildhooddevelopmentcenters;(ii) expansionandrenovationof
   the                                                             the
school facilities in rural, poor areas; and (iii)the construction and equipping of secondary
schools in rural areas; (iv) the expansion of the tertiary education infrastructure. Expenditures
to improve education quality include mainly: (i)   the revision of the basic education curriculum
and textbook collection; (ii)   the training of preschool and basic education teachers; (iii)    the
reformulation of the objectives of the secondary education curriculum; (iv) the equipping of
libraries, laboratories, computer labs; (v) training of trainers inadult education; (vi) distribution
of a free hot meal to all children enrolled in preschool and basic education in disadvantaged
areas; and (vi) the strengthening of school health interventions. Additional spending, such as
the recruitment of new teachers and running o f school facilities inparticular in early childhood
and secondary education to meet the expansion of access to education has not been included,
and mustbe accountedfor.

11.      However, the quantitative targets in terms of the expansion of access to education
inearly childhoodand secondary educationbetween2005 and2007 are quite modest. As a
result, the fiscal impact of the expansion of the education system should remainmanageable and
in particular in regard to the increase of education recurrent expenditure. Furthermore, it is
expected that local elected governments, community based organizations and parents will
contribute to the financing of children's enrollment in early childhood centers. O f course,
resources from local governments will have to be raised through local taxes and/or through
transfer from the central government.

12.      Most of the new recurrent expenditureswill stem from the expansion of secondary
education and particularly the objective of achieving universal basic education of eight
years. The Government has already adopted a cost-sharing mechanism resulting in parents
takmg a larger share of the cost o f their children's educationbased on their taxable income. In
addition, it is likely that private secondary schools will emerge in greater number catering to
those who can afford it and thus freeing resources to be allocated to subsidize access to
secondary education for the most disadvantaged. This i s the population that the Government
wants to reachthrough its PRSPinorder to achieve its enrollment targets.

13.      Finally, in professional training, the Government will reinforce its normative and
quality control role by creating a proper framework for the development of professional
training, as well as providing incentives. In fact, the private sector and the beneficiaries will
support most of the cost of professional training. The market mechanisms and inparticular the
skill demandfrom the labor market shouldregulate the supply o fprofessional training.

                                                  96

14.     The EducationMinistryhasprepareda draft matrixfor the educationand training
sectors which prioritizes four main medium-term objectives for PRSC 1, PRSC 11and
PRSC 111, namely: (i)    improving the quality and efficiency o f education; (ii)    expanding and
diversifyinggeneral and technical secondary education supply; (iii)     expanding and diversifying
professional training service delivery; and (iv) consolidating and restructuring tertiary
education.

15.     Improving the quality and efficiency of education. The main activities supported
consist in editindelaborating a new curriculum for primary education supporting a pedagogic
approach by learning objective or competency.            Simultaneously, the initial and in-service
teacher training system will be reformed to strengthen its capacity to better andmore efficiently
train primary and secondary education teachers. Teachers currently in classrooms with no
formal academic training andor less than nine years o f education will be given priority access to
teacher training opportunities. A national testing system will be set up in order to evaluate
student academic outcomes inprimary education. This will allow to measure progress achieved
inincreasingstudents' proficiencyandoverall educationquality.

16.      Expanding and diversifying general and technical secondary education supply.
The priority consists in identifying the geographical disparities in the supply o f general and
technical secondary education. Through this school mapping exercise, it will become possible
to select sites for the construction o f medium-size secondary schools to better respond to the
needs o f the population. Simultaneously, the Education Ministry will initiate a revision o f the
curriculum content to select priority leamindacademic areas for the development and
modemization o f general and technical secondary education streams. Finally, school welfare
activities will be expanded to facilitate access o f the poorest to secondary education.
17.      Expanding and diversifying professional training service delivery. The priority
consists indeveloping a national policy and a legal framework to structure and consolidate the
delivery o f professional training services.     In particular, the Government will support the
establishment o f mechanisms of quality insurance and accountability through the accreditation
o f professional training institutions and certification o f degrees. This is expected to create a
pool o f well-trained graduates from professional training institutions on which the private sector
can rely upon to meet its requirement for a qualified workforce.

18.      Consolidating and restructuring tertiary education. The priority is to elaborate a
legal framework and define an organizational structure for the creation o f Cape Verde first
public university.

PRSCindicators

19.      Ten indicators were chosen for the education sector in this PRSC matrix. This i s a
limited selection o f education indicators included inthe PRSP. For the most part, the indicators
usedinthe PRSC are outcome indicators.

InstitutionalArrangements

20.      TheEducationMinistrywill haveprimaryresponsibilityfor implementingthese
reformmeasures. However, partnership with the Ministryo fLabor andSolidaritywill be
sought intwo main areas: (i)   supporting access to education of the poorest through social
welfare programs; and (ii)  developingprofessional training activities to upgrade the skills o f the
workforce.

Background

1.      Health outcomes in Cape Verde have been steadily improving over the past two
decades and are amongst the best in Africa. Infant mortality per 1000 birth is 32.2 (SSA
average i s 105'), child mortality per 1,000 i s 28.2' and life expectancy at birth is 69 (SSA
average is 46").    Cape Verde is very likely to achieve the health MDGsand i s passing through
an epidemiological transition moving more towards chronic diseases. Nevertheless, resurgence
o f endemic disease mainly due to vaccine coverage decrease i s cause for concern and points to
the vulnerability o f past achievements. The country also has significant differences inhealth
outcomes by district (Table I).

2.       In 2002, total health care expenditurein Cape Verde was around 4.5 percentof
GDP or $64 per capita (2002)." The Ministry o f Health accounted for 54 percent of total
expenditures (6.5 percent o f total Government expenditures)"            while the social security

system (INPS), which covers approximately 30 percent o f the population, accounted for 28
percent. Private expenditures, equal to $11.4 per capita, were 18 percent o f total pend ding.'^
Within public expenditures, salaries account for 64 percent, medication for 16 percent, and
medical evacuation for 5.4 percent. Execution rates typically exceeded 100% for operating
expenses over the past two years while the rate for the capital investment budget was much
lower at 65 percent in 2002. The system still relies on medical evacuations, which limits
significantly the accessto certain types of care services to parto f the population.

The primarysources of financing o f the health system are the regular budget o fthe Ministryof Health
(39%); external aid (16%); the INPS (28%) andprivate expenditures, including user fees andpremia for
private insurance (18%).14 (table 2) Cape Verde considers all donor assistance to the health sector to
be "investment" regardless o f type o f assistance. This i s managed separately from the MOH
budget.

 3.  Significant pooling of revenues and spreading of financial risk does take place in
 Cape Verde, but inequities persist. The Ministry o f Health budget, which finances the
recurrent health expenditures o f all public health facilities, includes revenue from not only
budget transfers but also contributions from civil servants (equal to 2% o f salary)" and a
 lump sumtransfer from INPS o f 100million CVE. Beneficiaries include all indigents, self-
 employed (including most of the ruralpopulation) and civil servants. This covers most o f the
population not covered by the INPS. The average expenditure per beneficiary o f GOCV
 financing is around 5100 CVE. (US$44)              .16

 l4Local delegations also raise revenue for the healthsector through such things as fees for sanitary
 inspections. The amount ofthese revenuesvaries from delegation to delegation andhas not been
 estimated inany of the previous studies onhealth expenditures. However, one estimate for Santa
 Catrina putthe amount as high as 8.6 millionCVE.
 ''There   are approximately 44,000 civil servants inCape Verde, and along with their dependants, they
 comprise approximately one third o f the population. Inthe case of civil servants, Civil servants andtheir

4. Most people are not required to pay fees at the health facilities. Itis estimated that more
than 95 percent o f the populationdoes not pay fees, but instead only pays the minimal "tickets
moderateurs" which i s equal to 50 ECV. Of those who do not pay, 84 percent are considered
indigent and 14 percent are government employees. Even with a low collection level, fees
account for 15.5 percent o f revenue at Praia Hospital, in comparison to 5.6% which they collect
from INPS and2.4% from private insurance.

5. The INPS also pools revenue of those who are employed outside of the civil service. An
8 percent tax on payroll is split between employer and employee, and managed along with the
pension funds by INPS. There are currently 98,516 beneficiaries in the system, including 4,000
pensioners. The average expenditure per INPS beneficiary i s 28,000 CVE (US$240).             INPS'
beneficiaries use public facilities, for which INPS contributes 100 C V million CVE, 60 million to
the Treasury and 40 million to the hospitals directly. The amount o f this transfer fkom INPS to
the MOH has not changed in more than ten years and it i s clear that the MOH now highly
subsidizes health care services for INPS beneficiaries. The INPS contracts with privateproviders
for dentistry and physiotherapy services. A new law concerning INPS, effective as o f April 1,
2003, opens the door for the INPS to contract with other types o fprivate providers inthe future.

6. The level of out of pocket spending, which is unpooled resources, is relatively low in
Cape Verde. Based on a 2003 national survey, average out o f pocket spending is approximately
560 million CVE, or 1,332 CVE per capita (US$11.4), equal to approximately one percent o f
household spending. Data from the survey have not yet been analyzed to determine the level of
spending across income groups, but one proxy, urban versus rural, showed that those from urban
 areas accounted for nearly 75 percent o f all out o f pocket spending. In general, out o f pocket
 spending poses the highest risk for the population given its unpooled nature, particularly for the
poor.

 7. The provision of health services is primarily public with a growing unregulated private
 sector. The system i s fairly centralized with salaries and pharmaceuticalsbeing paid directly by
 the MOH. The two large hospitals in Praia and Mindelo have been granted some amount o f
 managerial autonomy.        Accessibility to health care varies tremendously by Island. INPS
 contracts mostly with the public sector facilities except for dentistry. At the moment, there i s no
 correlation between the costs of care and the public health system budget allocations. Financing
 at the government and social insurance levels are based independently o f costs and services
 deliveries. Although the current incentive system brings certain advantages, it also brings high
 risklevelandits implications needto bebetterunderstood.

 8. Health services are the responsibility of the central government and most expenditures
 such as salaries and drugs are centrally controlled. Municipalities are provided a budget for
 fuel, food, and administration. In2002, a law has been passed devolving more responsibilities to
 municipalities. However, implementation o f the law has been stalled because of a lack o f clarity
 o f functions and responsibilities. Formulating a new law defining the powers andjurisdiction o f
 the municipalities i s a priority in the GPRSP and included inthe PRSC. Until this framework i s
 agreed upon, it will be difficult to proceed with planned health reforms in areas such as human
 resources and health financing.

 9.    Health status is affected by factors outside of the health system, including nutrition
 and accessto safe water. Cape Verde produces only 10to 15% o f its food consumption needs.
 The situation i s specially serious inrural areas, where most o f the poor live. Cape Verde imports
 most o f its food needs, and i s highly dependable on foreign aid. Water access is still limited in
 Cape Verde. Only 25 percent of households have access to a public water system. Water access



                                                   101

drops significantly inrural areas, where only 7.1 percent o f the populationhas access to a public
water system, Most o f the ruralpopulation still relies on water fountain (45 percent), and natural
source o f water o f doubthl quality continues to be the only source o f water to manypeople.

Main issues inthe health sector

10.         Several studies have been completed by the Bank and others which diagnose the main
issues inthe health sector (PER, DPR, PRSP, and PND). Briefly, these include:"

       Inequities inhealth outcomes and accessto health services: Access i s limitedprimarily by
       geographic constraints and approximately 44 percent o f the population does not use health
       services when ill.Lack o f health facilities contributes to disparities in utilization o f health
       services, which is higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Health outcomes also vary by
       island, however access to health services does not account for all o f the disparities inhealth
       outcomes. (Table 1) Differences inthe access to water, sanitation, and child nutrition are also
       important factors.

       Extensive use of medicalevacuations, both within and outside o f the country, are necessary
       because o f a lack o f specialist and diagnostic equipment in remote areas.           Evacuations
       account for 5 percent o f the Ministryo f Healthbudget and 13 percent o f I"S        expenditures.
       After salaries and pharmaceuticals, they are the third largest expenditure category. These
       numbers underestimate the real cost o f medical evacuations because the Government o f
       Portugal has long had a policy o f covering the cost o f medical care for those Cape Verdeans
       who are sent to Portugal. ,An increase innon communicable diseases i s has contributed to
       an increasing need for evacuation which are primarily for chronic diseases such as cancer and
       cardiovascular. In2002 there were 214 intemational and 3657 national evacuations. Unlike
       other countries, evacuations have not been a privilege o f the elite, but are based on need.
       Reducing the need for evacuations i s now a Government priority because Portugal has
       indicated its intent to no longer cover the health care costs o f those who travel to Portugal for
       treatment.


0      Increase in non communicable diseases and decreases in infant and child mortality rates'*
       over the last decade have led to an aging population. Life expectancy i s 66.5 for men and
       74.9 for women.         Ten percent o f the population i s over 60 years o f age. Today non
       communicable diseases (NCD) significantly hinder economic growth. On average, men lose
        13.6 years o f productive life and women 11.3 years, due to illne~s.'~Addressing these NCDs
       through health promotion and prevention programs has become a major priority. However,
       recent outbreaks o f cholera and measles are an indication that the country cannot abandon its
       efforts on infectious disease control, which disproportionately affect the poor.


 0      Challenges in human resources: While the ratios o f various types o f health workers per
        inhabitant are notbad? they mask large inequities between districts as well as a reliance on a
        large cadre o f Cuban physicians (52 o f 163). For example, there i s a six fold difference inthe
        doctor population ratio in Sao Vicente and Port0 Novo. The main challenges include: (i)         an
        insufficient number o f doctors, particularly o f specialist, due in part to migration; (ii)  poor

 ''Thisi
      Some, butnot all o f these issues have beencaptured inthe Government's PRSP.

     distribution of staff, with more than 80 percent of doctors practicing in the two general
    hospitals; (iii)  lack of incentives inthe payment mechanism to maximize efficiency, focus on
     the poor, prioritize certain services, or avoid over referral;21and (iv) a growing number of
    public sector doctors working inanunregulatedprivate sector.22

     Lack of health information: There is a surprising lack of informationonhealth services and
     outcomes in Cape Verde. Data on utilization and cost are essential for basic monitoring and
     evaluation as well as management. This suggests that investments in health information
     systemsat all levels of the system may berequired.

     Fiscal instability: The public sector health system is in financial crisis, even though total
     government health spendinginCape Verde i s generousand financing by donors is the second
     highest per capita inAfrica.23 The main causes of the financial crisis are: (i)       a growing deficit
     at the INPS, which reached US$13 million in 2002 (compared to an annual budget of US$8
     million in 2002), (ii)a very high and rapidly increasing rate of expenditures on
     pharmaceuticals, and (iii)    increases in demand as incomes improve and the population ages.
     In2002, totalhealthexpendituresequaledapproximately US$29million (4.5% of GDP) with
     an average total expenditure per capita around US$6424.Eighty-two percent of expenditures
     were public (MOH and INPS), equal to about 8 percent of total government expenditures.
     Private, out of pocket expenditures accountedfor 18% of total health expenditures and 1.1%
     oftotal household expenditures.25This suggestthat there may be limitsto the extentto which
     public sector health expenditures can increase and that there i s room for out-of-pocket
     expenditures to increase andpotentialsavings frombetter managementofpharmaceuticals.

     Financial protection: According to the recent household expenditure survey, approximately
     5 percent of the population had health expenditures greater than 10 percent of their income
     with health care expenses causingapproximately 1percent of the populationto becomepoor.
     Ingeneral, private spending is progressive, with the poor spending a smaller percentage of
     their total income on health than the rich. A majority of private expenditures are for drugs,
     which account for more than 90 percent oftotal spending for the poor, comparedto around 50
     percent for the rich.

     Decentralization: Decentralization of health services to municipalities is planned although
     final details will only become known when the Govemment completes its overall framework
     for decentralization for the country - a PRSC 1 measure. Most of the health reforms
     proposed by the Government are supply oriented and decentralization may have a significant
     impact on utilization and outcomesby focusing more on the demandside.

 Reform Strategy

11.       The Government's reform strategy (Programa Reformar o Sistemapar Promover a
                                                                  -
Saude 2002-2005) maps the country's health priorities into four programs: (i)                      Structural

infrastructure, and pharmaceutical policy; (ii)          Reproductive and Child Health activities that
addresses in great part the issue o f deteriorating health sector indicators through a combination o f
strengthening existing programs, providing training, and improving the referral system; (iii)
Prevention of Communicable and Non-communicable Diseases which aims to strengthen the
capacity o f the health service to detect potential epidemics, improve surveillance at all levels of
the health system, and increase participation o f the population in health promotion and disease
prevention; and (iv) Human Resourcesto improve the management o f humanresources, improve
the quality o f care, improve distribution o f human resources, and improve conditions of
employment for health professionals.             For each o f the four programs, objectives, targets,
strategies, and monitoring indicators have been identified. Note that issues related to health
financing, andparticularly the INPS, are not includedas part o f the strategy for the MOHbut are
assumed by other government ministeries.

Current Status

         Structural Issues: Progress has been achieved in several o f the components o f this
         program. For example, an infrastructure development plan, targeted towards improving
         access and quality o f health services in rural areas, has been developed and
         implementation has begun26. The national pharmaceutical policy has been revised with
         the objective o f improving the availability o f essential drugs o f good quality. A study o f
         health expenditures has been completed and development o f a new health financing
         policy is underway.
     e   Reproductive and Child Health: Several specific programs oriented towards pregnant
         women and children are underway, including Malung Pregnancies Safer, Primary Health
         andNutrition Care, andImproved Service Standards and Mother-and- ChildHealth Care.
         Prevention of Communicable and Non-communicable Diseases: Examples o f progress
         include: (i)   introduction o f a system o f epidemiological surveillance o f priority diseases
         (TB,malaria, polio, etc) includinganewnetwork oflaboratories; (ii)             approval of national
         strategies for HIV/AIDS and TB; (iii)           improvements in the diagnostic capabilities for
         HIV/AIDS; and (iv) increases in vaccination coverage rates following a national
         campaign.
         Human Resources: A priority has been to continue to improve access and quality by
          supporting training, particularly o f nurses and specialists.           Training, both within the
          country and abroad, has begun in areas such as surgery, neurology, neonatology, public
         health, andhealthadministration.

 Prioritiesinthe GPRSP

 12.     Consistent with the national health strategy and NDP, The GPRSP identifies the
 following activities which are assumed to have a significant impact on poverty27:




 26Several health facilities have been constructed (or rehabilitated) andequipped, most o f which are inrural
 areas. These include construction of areferral hospital for the region of Sotavento andconstructionof new
 healthcenters inMaio, Mosteiros, Tarrafel, andBoa Vista.
 27Note that this is not an exhaustive list o fhealth priorities inthe country. The DECW tries to identify
 those with the greatestpoverty impact. Noticeably missing is mention of a new health fmncing policy
 although this i s mentioned inother policy documents. To a certain extent, issues of financial protection for
 the poor are covered under social protection but that does not eliminate the needto develop a more
 sustainablefinancing policy.


                                                        104

   Expand the network of healthfacilities and equipment to respond to the lack of capacity
   to diagnose health problems with priority to be given to the poorest districts. This will
   improve health outcomes by providing access to care.              However, this i s a supply side
   approach and also requires a demand side reform in order to achieve this objective.
   Furthermore, future efforts in prevention o f NCDs are likely to impact the demand for
   curative health services.
   Limit treatment overseas by improving availability of these services by training
   specialists and improving healthsector infrastructure. Redistributiono f staff and training
   o f additional health specialist will also improve efficiency and reduce reliance on medical
   evacuations. These improvements in access should lead to improvements in health status.
   Reduced cost should allow reallocation o fresources to other priority programs.
   Develop methods to improve planning and management of human resources, in
   particular, decentralize financial management of HR to hospitals. The number and
   distributiono fhealth humanresources i s expected to improve, leadingto greater accessibility
   and better quality o f care. Redistribution o f staff and training o f additional health specialist
   will also improve efficiencyandreduce reliance onmedicalevacuations.
   Strengthen the health information system to better treat communicable and non-
   communicable diseases. A comprehensive, integrated health information system will help to
   improve the efficiency o f health service delivery. Improvements inefficiency ensure the best
   use o f scarce resources and allow the Government to reallocate resources to other priority
   programs. Accurate data are important to monitor the incidence o f disease which allows the
   Government to better target its resources andimprove health status.
   Reinforce the priority health programs such as IMCI, EPI, HIV/AIDS, TB, and
   Reproductive Health, including the surveillance system, by financing personnel,
    equipment, and consumables. This activity focuses on those diseases which have the
    greatest impact on the poor. Early detection and rapid responses should lead to improve
    health outcomes, particularly for the poor.
    Define a strategy to combat non communicable diseases (NCDs): While not as prevalent
    in the poor today, successful control of NCDs requires a long term approach that will
    improvehealth outcomes o f the poor inthe future.
    Reinforce the citizen participation in health promotion and disease prevention by
    strengthening cooperation across sectors and with civil society organizations. This
    should lead to improvedhealth outcomes fiscal savings are fewer resources will be needed to
    be spent on curative services ifthese programs are effective.

Financingof the GPRSP

13.      The total cost of health programs to be implemented under the GPRSP i s expected
to be US$ 40.5 million between 2005 and 2007, o f which US$21 million i s earmarked for
buildingo fnewhealthfacilities, refurbishingexisting facilities, and equipment (54%) andUS$10
million for HN/AIDS.28 For 2005, GPRSP expenditures are expected to total US$18.5 in
comparison to a MOH 2005 budget o f US$32 million. Increases in capital investment are
accompanied by increased allocations for recurrent costs for the first year only, after which it i s


28 2004 US$, Based on U S Treasury exchangerate on June 30,2004: 1US$=92ECV. I t is important to
note that many important priorities under the PRSP that will havea significant impact on health are costed
under other sectors: US$35 million); food security (US$12million); electricity (US$6million);
construction ofroads inisolatedareas (US$62 million); andpromotion of access to health care for the poor
(US$2.3 million).

assumed they will be included in the GOCV regular budget. The Government assumes the
GPRSP will not entail any increases in staff costs because many of these positions are already
includedinthe budget, even ifcurrently vacant.

14.      The GOCV assumes that some cost savings can be achieved through an improved
level of care in services in health centers and primary referral health structure, thus
limiting the need to refer to more expensive hospitals. Other cost savings reforms include
strengthened preventive care, particularly for chronic diseases, improved management of health
structures, supported by a reinforced health information system, and introduction of lowest-cost,
standardized care protocols for key diseases, and control of drug costs by opening the drug
market to c~mpetition.~~    Fundingfor the remainingactivities is unclear although the GOCV may
be able to approach donors for increasedaid, particular for capital investments. Over the next
year the Government intendsto articulate anewhealthcare financingpolicy.

Health sector within the PRSC

15.      The health sector portion of the PRSC is drawn from the above Government
strategies detailed in its own health strategy paper and the priority activities laid out in the
PRSP. The Ministry of Health has prepared a draft policy matrix for the health sector in
collaboration with its main partners. Consequently, the medium term for PRSC1, PRSC2, and
PRSC3 are the same as those that appear inthe PRSP. These include improvinghealthoutcomes
by: (i)  improving access and quality o f health services by improving the availability and quality
of health infrastructure and reducing the need for medical evacuations; (ii)               improving the
capacity to identify, prevent, and treat communicable and non communicable diseases, especially
those related to matemal and child health, by improving the health information system,
establishing key health promotion programs to address the growing number of non-
communicable diseases, and implementing a set of priority programs to focus particularly on the
needs of women and children which disproportionately effect the poor; (iii)             strengthening the
ability o f humanresources to participate in the provision services, especially by improving the
planning and management of health sector personnel and following the overall civil service
reforms to be implemented by the GOCV and (iv) ensuring the financial sustainability of the
system and protection for the poor by developing and implementing a new health finance
policy.3o

Indicators

 16.      The PRSC uses indicators from the PRSP and PNDin most instances. The indicators
are a combination o f health outcomes and system outputs, including coverage o f services and
availability of key staff, used in the PRSP. System reform indicators, like the level of debt of
INPS, will helpmeasure financial sustainability.

InstitutionalArrangements

 17. While the Ministry of Health will have primary responsibility for implementing these
 reform measures, a significant level of inter-sectoral cooperation is expected, especially for
measures related to financial protection, where collaboration i s expected with the Ministry of
 Labor and Solidarity. Other implementingagenciesinclude the Ministry of Education and INE.


 2qNote that quantification o f the cost savings from these measureshas not yet been done.
 30Note that several analytical reports havebeen completed with suggestionson how to improve the
 financing of health care inCape Verde, butnon have been announced as government policy.

Background


1. The Government's social protection strategy seeks to help vulnerable households to
better manage risks and become less susceptible to potentially damaging welfare losses
through a variety of mechanisms: Cape Verde has a relatively developed social protection
systemfor Africa, so the basic issues have more to do with reforms o f existing programs inorder
to increase efficiency, equity and coverage as well as fill in specific gaps. Key elements o f the
existingsystemare:
    Active labor market interventions. Cape Verde has a longtradition of active labor market
    interventions.      Foremost among these historically has been the creation of temporary
    employment during off-agricultural cycles through labor-intensive public works schemes
    (Frente a Alta Intensidad de Mano de Obra - FNMO) financed largely through monetized
    food aid. Duringthe mid-l990s, FAIMO-type temporary employment, mainly on roads and
    soil conservation projects, covered an estimated 10-15% of the active labor force, or up to
    20,000 workers. Wages were low, equivalent to halfthe threshold of extremepoverty and no
    real skills were accumulated. While originally this employment provided a minimumsafety
    net for the rural poor to survive periodic droughts and precarious agricultural cycles, over
    time the FAIMOprogram was equatedwith people showing up to check their names offthe
    lists, with little to show inthe way o f effective investmentsandlow labor productivity.
    Social securitv svstems. There are two main social security systems for formal sector
    workers3'. The Administracao Publica (AP) scheme covers approximately 13,000 civil
    servants, while the Instituto Nacional dePrevidencia Social (INPS) estimated around 31,000
    contributors from private sector fm in 2001. They provide varying degrees o f old age
    pensions, disability, and health insurance. Together the schemes cover one quarter of the
    labor force and currently pay pensions to about 6,000 people. The longrunsolvency of both
    systems is in question due to generous benefits and outstanding government arrears in
    meeting its financial obligations to both systems. Inaddition, two non-contributory schemes
    provide income support to the poor. The Minimum Social Pension (PSM) provides a small
    stipend (about 1,300 CWmonth) to the elderly, handicapped, or otherswho are identifiedby
    local governments as inneed o f critical support. Inrecent years the budget both in terms o f
    number of beneficiaries (6,500) and amount received has been capped. Evidence from the
    recenthousehold survey shows that the targeting of the PSMneeds improvement as it is only
    mildly pro-poor.        Screening and selection processes and criteria done by the local
    governments has been ad-hoc and administration of the system weak. A pension is also
    available to workers who participated in the FAIMO program (Pensao de Solidariedade
    Social). Ex-FAIMO workers over 65 who worked for more than ten years in FAIMO
    programs receive 3,200 CVE/month. The program currently covers about 10,000 people.
    The annualcost o f the non-contributory programs i s aboutUS$4.8 million.
    Social Assistance. Targeted social assistanceprograms, such as nursery schools, nutrition for
    at-risk children and elderly, training for disabled, subsidizeswater and sewerage connections
    for poor urban households, youth and community centers etc,. support specific vulnerable
    groups and are carried out through governmental and non-governmental agencies. A recently
    completed Social Services Map identified 645 social service facilities in the country, the
    majority o fwhich are nurseryschools. The mainactors are:


31Overall, about 21 percent of Cape Verdian households report receiving a pension- 15 percent through
national programs (INPS, AP andnon-contributory pensions) and 6 percent from abroad.


                                                   107

   -   The Direction of Solidarity of the Ministerio de Trabalho e Solidaridade (MTS) provides
       a range of assistance programs, includingservice contracts with NGOs that support at-
       risk elderly, children and youth; financing evacuationof indigent sick for treatment, and
       support to low-income secondarystudents.
   -   The autonomous Instituto Caboverdiano d 'Accion Social Escolar (ICASE) supports
       students o fpoor families for schoolmeals, educationalmaterials and subsidies for paying
       school expenses at the primary and secondary levels. School meals reach almost all
       basic education students and 13,000 pre-school students.        As school fees have been
       introduced through the education reformprogram, subsidies for the neediest children are
       channeledthrough ICASE.
    -  The Instituto Caboverdiano de Solidaridad (ICs) and the Instituto Caboverdiano de
       Menores (ICM) target children at risk through social services, shelters , medical and
       psychological support, training, emergency centers for abused and mistreated children

    -  andadolescentswith drugproblems.
       The Programa Nacional de Luta Contra a Pobreza (PNLP), a community-driven
        development (CDD) oriented program under the MTS, constructs and equips a variety of
        social infrastructure through municipal govemments and local associations, includingan
        innovative model of multi-use community centers that house a combination of nursery
        school, training programs, community library, an outreach agent o f the municipal
        administration, and other locally identified needs which builds synergies between social

    -   services and reducesunit costs at the local level
        Municipal governments carry out activities with MTS as well as own-financing, with
        growing activities in day care, feeding and other social services, consistent with the
        current decentralization framework.      The Decentralization Law formally transferred
        responsibility for what is termed `social promotion' to local governments. This included
        placing M T S social workers within the municipal administration. However, more explicit
        agreements on norms and standards as well as municipal interface with national
        programs like the Minimum Social Pension are needed to improve quality and
        monitoringo f social services.
    -   NGOs and local associations, cany out a broad range o f activities, including significant
        programs through the RedCross andCaritas.
    Food Securitv. Periodic drought, low availability and productivity of agricultural land, and
    long-term soil erosion has brought crippling famines to rural Cape Verde in the past. The
    structural vulnerability in this area, with only 10 percent o f basic cereal needs covered by
    national production, has been a key motive o f migration to urban areas and outside the
    country. Overall, 14 percent o f children from 0-5 are stunted, with almost as much - at 12
    percent - observed among the non-poor. Market oriented reforms have liberalized imports
    and removed public sector management of importation of food stuffs. The availability of
    food aid has contracted over the last ten years despite a rise in absolutenumbersof the rural
    population andis not expectedto rebound.

2.   Cape Verde is an example of good collaboration between central, municipal and non-
governmental organizations for the co-production of social assistanceservices, including the
development of formal contracting relationships.           For example, municipal govemments
routinely contract with local associations for the day to day managementand operation ofnursery
schools, training programs and other services. The central level has experimented with both
contracting o f NGO service providers, as well as use of direct financing of community groups
and farmer's cooperatives for development efforts.          The MTS has piloted a successful
collaboration between a national NGO, a local neighborhood association, the municipal
Govemment o f Praia and the private water company, Electra, to carry out social connections of
water and sewerage inpoor neighborhoods.

3. Several studies and evaluationsJ2have identified the key issues in the social protection
agenda inCapeVerde over the nextseveralyears:

         Build on the gains made in the reconversion of the FAIMO system in favor o f
         strategies to exit out o frural poverty;
    0    Rework the basic parameters and reform the two formal social security schemes to
         promote long-run financial solvency andincreased coverage;
         The non-contributory schemes need to be based on financial sustainability and
         targeting effectiveness;
    0    Continue the transition from centralized social assistance service delivery in welfare
         state-mode to subcontractingthrough NGOs and localgovernments andbetter overall
         targeting andmonitoring o f supply o f social services;
    0    Move food security agenda from reactive to preventionand mitigationof food crises.

4.     The Government has a clear reform path for its social protection system to make it
more effective and sustainable. The strategy seeks to move from the more reactive, coping
strategies drawing from the welfare state legacy to increased attention to risk mitigation and
prevention measures, and to decentralize and contract out delivery o f services in line with the
broader reforms o f the state underway inCape Verde33.

5.     Main areas o f the reform strategy are:


(a) Conversionof the FAIMO system infavor of higher impact, more efficientinvestments.
     The FAIMO system is gradually being reconverted to reflect current realities (rising incomes,
     urbanmigration, reduced share of food expenditures by households hence less absolute food
     insecurity, and reduced availability o f food aid), and to increase the long-run poverty impact
     o f its public works programs through (i)         the introduction o f contracts with municipal
     government for delivery o f specific infrastructure investments, (ii)the creation of
     AGECABO, a delegated contract management agency working with municipalities to
     introduce efficient contracting and execution o f civil works using private firms and paying
     private sector wages, including training for small entrepreneurs and unskilled laborers to
     improve productivity and employability; and (iii)       support to farmer's cooperatives and rural
     associations for the execution o f small-scale infrastructure, including micro-irrigation, and
     income generatingprojects that boost ruralp r o d ~ c t i v i t y ~ ~ .
(b) Improvements in the contributory and non-contributory pension systems to increase
     long-term financial sustainability and expand coverage. A framework law passed in
     January 2001 set out the broadparameters of the contributory pension system in Cape Verde,
     including setting the foundation for shifting all civil servants under the AP system into the
     I"S    ~cheme'~.On the non-contributory side, the Government is in the process o f revising
     the minimum social protection system. The benefits under the Minimum Social Pension
     were adjusted upwards slightly and an increase in coverage sought in the 2004 budget.
     Revised legislation requires tighter eligibility criteria and expands benefits to include access
     to essential medicines.       The Government is preparing new identity cards linked to an
     administrative tracking system to better target andmonitor outlays.


32 Poverty assessment, studies under the Social Sector Development Project, country reports.
33 CapeVerde has participated inthe WBI sponsoredtraining program to buildcapacity in social protection
strategiesfor African countries since 2001 and its social protectionreform strategy effectively integrates
the social risk managementframework.
34 The reconversionof FAIMO is a central element ofthe National Poverty Alleviation Program (Programa
Nacional de Luta ContraPobreza, PNLP). The PNLP andthe creation of AGECABO has been supported
through the Bank-financed Social Sector Development Project (Cr. CV-32240) scheduledto close March
2005. The PNLP will continue to implement CDD-type project financedby IFADand AfDB.
35 The World Bank has beenworking with the Govemment of Cape Verde to reform the pension system
and improve the financial sustainability of INPS through the Growth and Competitiveness Project


                                                    109

(c) Strengthening of the capacity of local actors (community organizations and municipal
   governments) to address the needs of vulnerable populations. Government strategy is
   that the State should not provide services directly, but rather contract out to NGOs and local
   associationsto develop activities in support o f social policy. The Govemment will mobilize
   resources (extemal and intemal) and monitors performance. Service contracts with NGOs to
   reach specific vulnerable groups and developing revisions to protocols for service delivery,
   including application o fnorms and standards and introduction o f improvedmonitoring, to be
    carried out by municipal governments are being designedand piloted under MTS's Direction
    of Solidarity.
(d) Expansion of access to health and education services by the poor. The Government is
    working with the ILO to support the development o f health insurance schemes to extend
    coverageamong the poor. Inaddition, the MTS is launching a programto expand access to
    basic medicines by the indigent. ICASE has initiated targeted subsidies for school fees for
    needy secondaryeducation students. Studentsare selectedby committees at the school level
    and ICASE transfers the fee amount. This protects the principal that every child must pay
    fees, as opposedto fee waiver programs.
(e) Promotion of food security among vulnerable groups. The National Food Security
    Commission, created in 1996, coordinatespolicies andprograms to: (i)        increaseproductivity
    anddiversification ofagricultural andfish production; (ii) the availability and stability
                                                                   ensure
    of food stuffs in commercial markets; (iii)      improve access to basic food stuffs among the
    poor; (iv) promote mechanisms to prevent and manage food crises; (v) build institutional
    capacity and governance o f food security; and (vi) ensure quality o f water and food products
    to protect public health. Central to this is the implementation of a food security information
    system that would provide early warning o fproduction shortfalls and other food insecurity.

Current Status

6.      In 2003-2004, the Government has made important advances in implementing its
reformstrategy. The Govemmenthasbuiltan adequate analytical and strategybase, including:
    0   Interms ofsocial assistance,pilotprogramshavebeeninitiatedinNGO servicecontracts
        for support to vulnerable women (micro-credit, social housing, and training) and
        subsidies to the poorest households to connect to public water and sanitation systems
        through an NGO-managed revolvingfundsystem.

         Launch of a study to reform the non-contributory pension system (to be completed early
         2005).

Priority in GPRSP and Financing

7. The fifth pillar of the GPRSP entails "Strengthening the Equity and Sustainability of
the SocialProtectionSystem". This draws from the broadorientations provided inthe Grand
Options document and the specific investment program identifiedinthe National Development
Plan. The GPRSPpresents five medium-term objectives inline with the reform strategies
underway inthe country, namely:
(a) developing institutionalcapacity insocial protection, @) strengthening and extending



                                                   110

programs that reachdisadvantagedgroups(including social pensions, social assistance and health
insuranceprograms); (c) promotinglocal initiatives and community development; (d) promoting
the rights o fchildren, and
 (e) improvingmechanismsto prevent andmanagefood crises andstrengthenfood security.

8. The DERPobjectives are achievable,though bettertargeting of resourcesonthe
neediest will benecessaryto expand coveragewithin fiscalconstraints.While there is no
consolidated data on all socialprotection expendituresundertaken, the 2004 budget shows 7
percent o f the operatingbudget and2 percento fthe investmentbudget devotedto social security
andsocial assistance, though this does not include educationsubsidies andprograms
implemented bymunicipalities. The expansionproposedfor MinimumSocial Pension
beneficiaries is modest, adding about $550,000 to annualcosts bythe endo fthe GPRSPperiod.36
Financingpriority GPRSP activities will be included within the on-going andproposedprogram
to improve budgetallocations through the development of the MTEFandprogram-basedbudgets
incoreministries, includingMTS.

Socialprotectionactivitieswithin the PRSC

9.    Coverageof social protection issues within the PRSC is fully consistentwith the areas
of emphasis within the GPRSP. Under the coordination o f the MTS, the Government has
prepared a policy matrix in consultation with other ministries, autonomous agencies and NGOs.
The PRSC would engage the Bank in technical and policy dialogue along the broad strategic
lines o f (a) Protection, Integration and Social Insertionto redefine the regulatory framework for
decentralized service delivery, improve planning and management instruments, improve
management and coverage o f non-contributory pensions, increase access o f at-risk groups to
education and professional training, increase access of at-risk groups to health services, increase
access o f at-risk groups to nutritional support, and promotion and support for local community
development initiatives; (b) Protection of Children's Rights to strengthen institutional
mechanisms and reinforce technical capacity o f NGOs involved in youth issue; and (c) Food
Security, to improve prevention and management o f food crises and strengthen the institutional
framework o ffood security issues.

10. A series of monitoringindicatorsdrawn in part from the NDP havebeen developed in
the GPRSP. These indicators track coverage, targeting and impact of social protection
measures. A core set o f these indicators are taken up in the PRSC. Critical process indicators
have been identified with the Government including a set o f prior actions and triggers that serve
as benchmarks for the PRSC to progress. These targets are ambitious but are anchored in
existing programs and Government institutions with good track records for implementation.


InstitutionalArrangements

11.    The NationalSocialProtectionCommissionunder the M T S will coordinate, monitor
and evaluate the implementationof Cape Verde's socialprotectionstrategy. Core members
of the commission are representedinthe GPRSP Steering Committee to ensure consistencywith
broader poverty reduction strategies and monitoring systems. The PPF will finance finalization
of the social protection strategy document, technical assistance in revising protocols for social
promotion services between the MTS and local governments, an assessment of NGO roles and
strategiesinsocial protection and anational forum on social protectionto discuss andvalidate the
strategy, among others, and assistance to develop new IDcards to better monitor PSMrecipients.

                                  Approach for BudgetSupport Operations

CapeVerde context

1. Cape Verde has a successful track record as a good performing country with relatively
strong institutions. The country is still heavily dependent on donor support (US$ 92 million in
2002; second highest aid per capita ratio worldwide), yet the form of donor support as well as aid
managementanddonor coordination mechanismshavebeenquitetraditional so far.

2. Cape Verde currently is supported by in total 137 external partners providing financial
and/or technical support, almost exclusively at the project level. The General Directorate for
International Development Cooperation (Ministry for Foreign Affairs) has mapped out and
prioritized these external partners, classifylng 19 of themas first priority partners. Among these first
priority partners are IDA (who has become over the last decade the largest donor partner), AfDB,
the European Commission, Portugal (the traditional and still largest bilateral partner), Luxembourg
(secondlargestbilateralpartner), andthe UnitedStates.

3.  The GPRSP marks a notableshift towards budgetsupport. The World Bank, the European
Commission, The Netherlands, and the African Development Bank are movingtowards coordinated
budget support, and the combined amount o f this budget support represents a significant share of
overall the overall assistance. And the US, via its new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), is
becoming a major donor.

4. The GPRSP provides an opportunity for better donor alignment. The GPRSP as a strong,
coherent and integrative medium-term country strategy implementation framework could become
the single anchor for aligned donor support. The GPRSP is derived from the existing development
strategies and is designed as an overarching medium-term strategy implementation framework,
aimed to becomethe anchor for all donor support as is the case inmany other countries. Donors are
seeking to strengthen coordination among each other and align their support with the GPRSP in
terms o f (i)priorities; (ii) indicators; and (iii)
                           M&E                         Government budget andplanningcycles.

5. However, currently most donors have their own programming cycles which do not
necessarily follow the country's planning cycles. The current country assistance programming
cycles of major donors will end by: EU (2007), UNDAF (2005), World Bank (2004), Luxemburg
(2005), Portugal (2004), AfDB (2004).           Most donors provide their assistance "off-budget",
administeredthrough extra-governmental andnot adequatelyrecorded inthe governmentbudget.

6. Cape Verde's main mechanism for overall donor coordination is the Round Table
mechanism.The last Round Table took place in April 2003, based on the PND 2002-2005. The
planningand organization of the Round Table was supportedby UNDP and The World Bank,The
joint support of UNDP and the Bank was an innovation compared to previous Round Tables. The
Round Table provided a starting point for discussions about new modalities o f donor coordination
and alignment, including the possibility of designating a donor "chef de file" for thematic or sectoral
areas. It was agreed that, as a follow up, specific thematic Round Tables would be established. This
decision has not been implemented yet.

7. In addition to the overall donor coordination mechanism, each donor has establishedits
own bilateral coordination mechanism with the Government, mostly comprised of annual
consultations. The possibility of Government-led donor coordination is made more difficult by the
fact that severaldonors do not have arepresentativeinthe country -some donors have representation




                                                 113

in Dakar (World Bank, African Development Bank, Netherlands) while others work from their
respective headquarters(Switzerland, Sweden, USAvia MCA).

8. Cape Verde's governance structure for donorcoordinationis split between the Ministryof
Finance (coordinationof mainly multilateral institutions, includingIDA) and the Ministryfor
ForeignAffairs (coordination of bilateralpartners),This division interms ofresponsibilities has
become a significant problem, andthe Cape Verdian authorities are awareo f this.

PRSC and DonorAlignment

9. The preparationprocessofthe RPSC hasmovedthe harmonizationagenda forward. Based
on consultations throughout the preparation process, including joint pre-appraisal and appraisal
missions with the Dutch Cooperation, a Memorandum o f Understanding Cooperation entitled
"Partnership Framework between Budget Support Partners and the Govemment of Cape Verde for
the provision o f Budget Support". Was signed between the Govemment, IDA, the EU and the
NetherlandsEmbassyon January       ,..,2005. The Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint
reviews, harmonization of indicators and prior actions, and synchronization with Government
budget cycles with a view to reducing the transaction costs of assistance to the Government (see
below).

                                      PartnershipFramework

Draft, dated 13" January 2005

Partnership Framework between Budget Support Partners and the Government of Cape
Verde for the provisionof Budget Support

1. MainPrinciples
The Government o f Cape Verde (GoCV) is strongly committed to take its Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) as one of the guiding documents for the future socio-economic development
of Cape Verde     . The GoCV considers the use of budget support as the preferred financing
mechanism to implement the PRSP and its overall cooperation programme. Hence, the overall goal
of budget support is to contribute to efficient and effective poverty reduction and a successfulPRSP
implementation in Cape Verde and reinforce the guiding principles o f alignment, accountability,
ownership andcoordination.

This Partnership Framework presents a set of operational principles for the provision o f budget
support to Cape Verde. The objective of these principles is to harmonise Budget Support Partner
behaviour, strengthen government systems and procedures, reduce transaction costs for both GoCV
and its development partners, harmonise aid modalities, performance benchmarks and dialogue
between the parties, increase the predictability of provision of budget support and to link funding
commitments by the partners to achievement o f targets set. This will benefit overall economic
developmentsand the implementation and efficiency o fprogrammes inpriority sectors.

2       Participants
The participants to this PartnershipFramework (PF) are the Govemment of Cape Verde, represented
by the Ministryo f Finance and Planning, the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, and the members of the
Budget Support Group (BSG):
0   The World Bank.
0   The European Commission, represented by the European Commission's Delegation to Cape
    Verde (EC)
0   The Netherlands,representedby the RoyalNetherlands Embassy inDakar, Senegal.

The BSG is open to other development agencies and financial institutions (`partners') who provide



                                                 114

or plan to provide some form of budget support (i.e. general, sectoral o f specific) to Cape Verde.
BSG members will urge other potential budget support partners to join this framework, and will
seek to provide direct general budget support as a growing share o f their overall support to Cape
Verde, although BSG members may continue a portion of their support to Cape Verde via
investment projects, direct technical assistance or other forms.

BSG Membersmay use different methodologies and apply different criteria to decide on their level
and type (general, sectoral or specific) of budget support; details of each BSG member's use of
methodologies/criteria are described in the attached technical note. However, the goal of this MoU
is to institutionalize ongoing efforts to harmonize budget support for PRSP implementation. To that
effect, memberso fthe BSG group will endeavour to

    -
    -    harmonize their methodology for assessmentofprogressinPRSP implementation;
         harmonizetheir key criteria for disbursement;
    -    harmonizetheir timingfor disbursement, as well as their missions schedules.

Incase of discrepancybetween this PartnershipFramework and the individualbilateral agreements
between a Partner and the Govemment, the bilateral agreements will prevail. However, it is the
intention of the Parties to establish bding agreements that are compatible with the provisions of
this PartnershipFramework.

3        ReviewProcess

Regular dialogue between GoCV and BSG members, of satisfactory quality and transparency, to
review the progress inthe implementation of the PRSPandto discuss conditions for disbursementof
Budget Support, is critical for the sustained provision o f budget support. This dialogue will take
place within the formal coordination mechanismsestablishedby GoCV,

Inview of the large donor's interest inPRSP implementation, the GoCV invites other partners to
participate into the annualevaluation o f PRSPimplementation.

The dialogue will be organisedas follows:

 Tobeprepared by the GoCV:
     Annual financial and progress reports on the PRSP (May-June) including on individual
     government sectorsthat receive sectoral Budget Support fromBSG Members
     Annual State General Accounts reviewedbythe Tribunal das Contas
     Annual financial statements documenting the flow of budget support funds into the Treasury
     andto the individual Sectors(where applicable)
     Transmission to BSGpartners o f copies o fquarterly reports onbudget execution

 On the basis of these reportsthefollowing IndependentReviewInstruments may be applicable:
     Annual Evaluation of the PRSPprogress (May-June), to be conductedjointly by BSG members.
     Meantto replacebilateralreviews.
 0   Public Expenditure Review (PER).
 0   Independent Sector Reviews for sectors that receive sectoral Budget Support from BSG
     members(May-June).
     Annual conformity test to check the internal GoCVprocedures.

 On the basis of thisinformation thefollowing Joint ReviewMechanism will be applicable:
     Based on the information resulting from all the above, the BSG members will record their
     assessmento fthe situation intheir respective Aide Memoires.
     For policy areas of common interest, such as macro-fiscal policy and financial management,
     BSG members will put together ina single document their joint assessment o fprogressmade on



                                                  115

    reforms in the context o f joint missions to evaluate their budget support programs. They will
    discuss it jointly in draft form with the authorities before leaving. BSG members will
    communicate to the Government a formal assessment within a month o f the last mission leaving
    the country.
    The BSG memberswill then prepareand send out to the GoCV ajoint letter highlighting main
    issues andpoints o funderstanding, at leastfour weeks before the Annual Review Meeting.
    Annual Review Meeting (September). Duringthis meeting, BSG members will aim to provide
    the Govemment with confident predictions of funding for the coming financial year, making
    clear what factors would affect the volume of funding. The principles of tranche calculations
    and the timingo freleases for each BSG member will be definedina Technical Note. As much
    as possible, BSGmemberswill try to coordinatetheir schedules.

Audit
GoCV will provide to BSGmembers their annual audited State Accounts for both central and local
governments within the applicable statutory time limit The annual audits will be made by the
Tribunal das Contas inaccordance with Cape Verdean legislation. BSG members will not normally
seek additional accountability outside of these requirements,but may reservethe right to undertake
independentgeneralor sectoralauditing where required.

Additional Partnership Framework coordinationmechanisms may include thefollowing:
    Progress meetings for e.g. the state of flairs of public financelprocurement review
    (CFWCPAR), PRSPandPRSC implementation.
    Achievement o ftargets definedthrough key sector review processes.
    Preparationo fJSAN reports.

Participants inthis PartnershipFramework will strive to be active partners inthe above coordination
mechanisms.

The participants to this Partnership Framework recognise that it is the delivery of results and the
achievement o f a limited number of outcome indicators that are ultimately most important, and
reports willbedrafted and discussedto reflect this.


4       Internalproceduresamongst the BSGmembers
Before each Annual Review Meeting, BSGmemberswill agree on one o f them serving as aback-up
secretariat to the Government secretariat that will prepare the review (e.g. be in charge of co-
ordinating meetings, etc.) before and during the review, and coordinate on preparation of various
donor reports and instruments.

When one of the BSG members is in the process of establishing a new budget support agreement
with Cape Verde, that member will share draft agreements with the other BSG members. BSG
memberswill aim to develop new agreements collectively, and will seek to align their timetables as
far as possible.

5       Responsibilitiesof the GovernmentofCapeVerde

Responsibilities for implemeiitation o f this Partnership Framework on behalf o f the Government o f
Cape Verde are shared between the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, and
specifically their respective focal points in the Director General o f Planning and the Director
Generalof IntemationalCooperation.

The donor support towards the Partnership Framework is based upon the understanding that the

6.      Responsibilitiesofthe BSGmembers
The BSG members are committed to working in Partnership with the Government o f Cape Verde
and wish to facilitate implementation of the PRSP through financing governed by this PF and/or
complementary support providedthrough their wider development cooperationprogrammes. Within
existing administrative and statutory provisions including individual bilateral funding agreements
with Cape Verde, which ultimately govern decisions on disbursements and commitments, the MSG
members commit themselvesto:
    Provide information on future disbursements in advance o f the budget year, and based on a
    financial framework reflecting identical reform commitments of the Government vis-$-vis all
    partners.
0   Disburse all o f the commitments madewithin the Cape Verdean budgetyear and attempt, where
    possible, to front loadtheir disbursementswithin the first quarter.
0   Change fundingonly for the nextbudget year by referenceto the implementation of measuresin
    PRSPand IMFassessmentso fmacroeconomicperformance.
0   In-year cuts will be avoided except inthe most serious of circumstances.
    Co-ordinate their disbursements in line with the Government's budgetary requirements as
    presentedby the GoCV.
0   Harmonize their prior actions for areas o fjoint concern.

The partners will endeavour to follow the principles enshrined in the PF and assess performance on
the basis of the PRSP progress report. Reference to these key processes should be included in
individual bilateral funding agreements to the maximum extent. These agreements will mainly
provide further details on the obligations of both parties and the procedures for disbursing funds
together with any standard conditions for development cooperation that the individual donor may
have. The parties agree to keep such generalconditions to a minimum.

BSG members will seek to reach a common assessment of compliance with conditions, and will
consult each other and GoCV in the event o f a dispute, Judgments on disbursement will be the
responsibility o f each individual BSG member. It is recognised that not all BSG members will
choose to emphasise all aspects o f the Partnership Framework in their bilateral agreements with
GoCV.

                              Monitoring and Evaluation System

Monitoring and Evaluation of the GPRSP

1. Monitoring and Evaluation of the GPRSP will be results-oriented. To this end, the M&E
system has three main objectives: (a) monitoring and analysis of economic growth and poverty
reduction trends; (c) monitoring of the execution of priority programs and projects that contribute
to growth and poverty reduction; and (c) impact evaluation o f the key policies and programs on
growth andimprovedlivingconditions.

2. Monitoring and evaluation of the GPRSP builds off of the national systems for
investment planning, budget control, as well as development of national and sectoral
statistics (see Figure below). The main actors andresponsibilities are:

               National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional da Estadistica - INE). INE is
            legally mandatedas the responsibleagency for the National Statistical System. INEhas
            prepared a plan to develop this system called the Statistical Agenda (Agenda
            Estadistica). Within GPRSP monitoring, INE is responsible for (a) collection and
            treatment of general economic and social data, including household and enterprise
            surveys, the Social Services Map, and other data collection instruments; (b) the
            production of current statistics, including poverty profile data, national accounts, social
            indicators; and (c) the validation of official data published by the public sector and its
            storage and dissemination through the Database of Official Statistics (Base de Dados
            Estadisticas Oficiais-BDEO).
          0    General Directorate of PlanninP (DGP) and its Technical Secretariat to S u ~ ~ o r t
            DeveloDment (Secretariado Tkcnico de b o i o ao Desenvolvimento           - STADI. The
            DGP/STAD is responsible for : (a) the development and maintenance of the national
            Database on Policies and Projects (Base de Dados de Medidas e Projectos - BDMP);
            (b) the selection and specification ofmacroeconomic and sectoralindicators andtargets
            for these indicators; (c) carry out and facilitate analysis o f macroeconomic and sectoral
            results and impact indicators ofthe GPRSP from dataprovidedby INE; (c) utilization of
            a macroeconomic model to link macro provisions with available government resources;
            (d) overseepreparation ofthe Annual PRSPProgressReport.
               General Directorates of Planning, Budget and ManaPement within the sectoral
            ministries. These sectoral units are responsible for: (a) participate in the selection of
            indicators and targets for the GPRSP; (b) production o f sectoral statistics and
            calculation o f secotral indices; (c) analysis o f GPRSP impacts in their respective
            sectors; (d) provide inputs into the Annual PRSP ProgressReport and other monitoring
            instruments.
           0   The General Directorate of Budget and its ManaPement Information Svstem for
            Budpet and Finance.         The Budget Ofice provides updated information on all
            Government revenue and expenditures. The MIS will include all financial and public
            expenditure management indicators to be tracked inthe GPRSP. Tliis office oversees
            the development of the medium-term expenditure framework and the program
            budgetingto be carrie3dout inthe sectoralministries.
               NOSI. or the Nhcleo OReracional da Sociedade da Informacdo (ODerational
            Nucleus for Information Systems), is responsible for the information technology
            backbone o f the monitoring and evaluation system.           This network allows for the
            processing, storage and communication o f all public sector information, based on the
            application o f Oracle technology. This network currently includes the MIS for Budget

           and Finance (above), including a basic data sheet on every project financed by the
           Treasury. The system is currently being expanded at the municipallevel.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of GPRSP implementation will be carried out through an
integrated institutionalframework. Overall coordination is overseenby a GPRSP Coordinating
Commission comprised of representativesErom the core and sectoral ministries, the associationof
municipal governments, the central bank, the National Statistics Institute, the chamber of
commerce, private sector, specialized institutes, unions and NGOs. Consultative commissions at
the decentralized level will be headedby the respectivemayors. The DGP/STAD has day-to-day
responsibilities to provide technical guidance, monitor program performance including reporting
on the core set ofmonitoringindicators, andinform intemal and externalpartnerso fprogress.

MonitoringandEvaluationof the PRSC

The PRSC will be accompanied by a results based M&E system in line with the GPRSP
M&Esystem. The specific monitoring andevaluation activities under the proposedPRSCwillbe
based on, and reinforce, the system proposed for the monitoring and evaluation of the GPRSP in
general.  They will include:      (a) annual GPRSP progress reports; (b) periodic reporting on
achievement o f MDGs (supportedby UNDP); (c) overall annualbudget monitoring through public
expenditure reviews; (e) annual sectoralbudget execution and service delivery targets preparedby
line ministries; (f) periodic follow-up household surveys to track poverty and access to services
carried out by the National Statistics Institute (INE), (g) stakeholder surveys and qualitative
monitoring o f government performance and poverty impacts contracted through the STAD; (h)
analysis of fiduciary performance; and (i) studies. See ResultsChainfor M&E inAnnex 5;
