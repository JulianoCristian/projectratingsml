located in the central part of Kwara\n            State. Support services will include extension advice, crop\n            protection measures, improved seeds, fertilizers, and the\n            provision of credit facilities. Physical infrastructure will\n            include constructing and improving 300 km of gravelled\n            feeder roads, the maintenance of up to 1000 km of feeder\n            roads, the establishment of a project headquarters and the\n            construction and improvement of 20 farm service centers. A\n            project management unit with appropriate technical and\n            administrative staff will be established to implement the\n            project and to develop guidelines for future projects.\n            Facilities will be provided for training both agricultural\n            field staff and senior specialists. Consultant services will\n            be engaged to review agricultural policies and prepare\n            feasibility studies for a second phase project. An\n            additional subproject will be to finance the preparation of\n            13 feasibility studies for other agricultural projects which\n            may be ready for implementation after 1982."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
