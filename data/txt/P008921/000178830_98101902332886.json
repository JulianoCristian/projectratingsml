expansion of grain storage\n            capacity; increase TMO's operational capability to\n            market grains; and encourage improvements in agricultural\n            commodity price support policy, input subsidy programs and\n            agricultural land-use policies. The Project includes: (i)\n            construction of 860,000 tons of inland and 50,000 tons of\n            port storage silos; (ii) improvements in two existing port\n            silos; (iii) provision of 300 automatic loading rail hopper\n            wagons; (iv) improvements in TMO's management data\n            processing and communications system; (v) training of silo\n            managers and staff; and (vi) a study of Turkey's\n            land-use strategies and the measures required to improve\n            them, particularly as regards the price support and input\n            subsidy programs."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
