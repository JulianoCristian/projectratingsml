in undertaking the second phase of a\n            medium-term reform agenda, aimed at addressing systemic\n            governance issues in order to raise the quality, and\n            cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and improve equity\n            of access to secondary education. The reform agenda focuses\n            on: 1) Accountability, - with reforms enforcing the\n            establishment of institutions, and institutional mechanisms\n            to link school subventions to objective measures of school\n            performance. 2) Equity - through demand-side interventions\n            to encourage rural girls' attendance at secondary\n            schooling. 3) Administration/Capacity Building - to\n            strengthen MoE's planning and policy making capacity,\n            and, towards greater implementation responsibility at lower\n            levels. 4) Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination -\n            significantly emphasizing program evaluation and monitoring\n            to guide policy and planning. Public expenditure tracking\n            surveys and impact evaluation of programs are being\n            undertaken. 5) Teachers' Quality -through the\n            establishment of an autonomous Non-Government Teacher\n            Registration and Certification Authority, responsible for\n            the development and selection for the pre-qualification and\n            certification of teachers. An apex institution will be\n            responsible for the management of teacher training, and to\n            regulate training institutions. 6) Textbook Production and\n            Curriculum Development - through the National Curriculum and\n            Textbook Board (NCTB), a transparent process of textbook\n            evaluation and approval will be achieved, with the\n            curriculum wing of NCTB being strengthened to enable its\n            performance effectively. While risks exist, namely in the\n            macroeconomic aspect, political climate, in corruption, and\n            capacity constraints, actions are being taken in economic\n            management and fiscal adjustment; there is strong\n            stakeholder support, and reforms are being openly\n            publicized; and, the project strategy is designed to deliver\n            benefits that far outweigh the risks."}, "docdt": "2006-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
