Sector\n            Development Support Credit Project for Bangladesh were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, the Borrower performance was satisfactory,\n            sustainability was likely, and institutional development\n            impact was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            is recommended that the grant-based financing scheme be\n            piloted in new schools to test its attractiveness and\n            merits, its potential impact on school performance as well\n            as to appreciate the degree of buy-in by teachers and School\n            Management Committees (SMCs). Ministry of Education (MOE) is\n            shifting to grants-based financing system, where resources\n            going to institutions will be linked more closely to\n            students on a per capita basis, rather than to teachers as\n            it is currently the case. A draft grants-based financing\n            system has been finalized but not yet adopted and a decision\n            was taken to suspend Monthly Pay Order (MPO) for new non\n            government schools. As a result, newly registered schools\n            are likely to experience financial constraints which may\n            have adverse effect on their performance. There is a need to\n            improve the capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Education\n            Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) to provide regular\n            updates on schools and better monitor education outcomes\n            since the last school census was conducted in 1999 and an\n            update was undertaken in 2005. BANBEIS is expecting to start\n            by June 2008 the next census as it is already approved and\n            the process of releasing the funds has begun. There may also\n            be a need to develop a platform for integrating multiple\n            databases that fall under MOE as was already evidenced by\n            the uniformization of school codes between Education Boards\n            and BANBEIS. This integration process, across various units\n            of MOE, would, for instance, help to institutionalize\n            student learning assessment as Secondary Education Quality\n            and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) project intends to\n            do by benchmarking learning levels in Bangladesh to\n            international standards such as Trends in International\n            Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) or Program for\n            International Student Assessment (PISA)."}, "docdt": "2008-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
