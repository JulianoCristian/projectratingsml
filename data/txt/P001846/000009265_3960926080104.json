  adjustment project is to help the Government achieve its\n            medium term goal of economic growth of about 2.5 percent\n            rate per annum. To achieve this objective the Government has\n            developed and adopted the following: 1) a growth strategy\n            based on fisheries and rural sectors; 2) a program to\n            improve economic management; and, 3) a program to promote\n            the private sector. In addition, detailed action programs\n            have been developed for macroeconomic management, civil\n            service, public administration, the banking sector, energy,\n            agriculture, food policy, fisheries, and private sector\n            promotion. These action programs would be implemented over\n            the next twelve months."}, "docdt": "1987-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
