APPRAISAL OF SAPH RUBBER PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
Project Background
1.01      The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to assist in
financing its first large-scale rubber smallholders' project. This report
appraises a project designed to plant 3,000 ha of rubber smallholdings around
existing estates belonging to the Societe Africaine de Plantations d'Heveas
(SAPH), and the establishment of a fully Government-owned 2,000 ha nucleus
rubber estate on another site, at Songan, around which future smallholdings,
starting with 500 ha included in this project, would be developed and managed
by SAPH. All these plantings would be in the southeastern region of the Ivory
Coast.
1.02      The project was identified and prepared by SAPH.  Two other co-
lenders, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France, and the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom, would also
assist in financing the project, and participated in its appraisal.
The Agricultural Sector in the Economy
1.03      Ivory Coast's population, estimated at 7 million (mid-1975), has
been growing at about 4.3% annually, including 1.3% from immigration. GDP
growth has been high, averaging 7% a year in real terms over the past decade.
This rapid economic growth has been based on the agricultural and forestry
sectors which account for about 50% of the country's domestic product, and
whÎch will continue to be important factors in its economic development.
Abundant land, immigrant labor supply and generally favorable world markets
for its products have assured rapid agricultural growth. About 70% of the
population depends on agriculture and forestry. The estimated value of
agricultural production in 1976 was US$2.1 billion, of which industrial crops
accounted for about US$1,500 million, food crops US$400 million and livestock
US$150 million. From 1974 through 1976 annual exports averaged US$1,400
million of which the three main commodities--coffee (29%), timber (20%), and
cocoa (25%)--accounted for 74%. Another 12% of GDP is produced by the expand-
îng industrial sector. However, most of these economic activities are con-
centrated in the south, thus creating large regional disparities in per capita
income (which in 1976 was US$610 for the country as a whole but much lower in
rural areas; US$150 for the savannah region and US$290 for the forest zone).
These income disparities account in part for rural-urban migration and, within
the next decade, population is projected to grow in the cities at around 10%
per annum, in the forest zone at about 4%, and to decline by about 0.5% in the
savannah.
1.04      Until recently the Government has concentrated its efforts on in-
creasing the area devoted to export crops. But growing urbanization and the
increasing demand for food have drawn the Government's attention more towards
integrated regional development. New programs have been designed to include



-2-
food crops in the same areas where export crops are produced. A case in
point is the cotton and food crops program in the savannah region which
started in 1974 with Bank assistance (Loan 1077-IVC). Over the past few years
the importation of foodstuffs per rural inhabitant has declined from 200 kg to
160 kg, indicating that these measures are proving effective. This approach
is also expected to help alleviate rural poverty and reduce regional income
disparities, thereby slowing the urban drift.
Institutions
1.05      Overall development planning is in the hands of the Ministry of
Planning while detailed agricultural development programs are the responsi-
bility of the Min-istries of Agriculture and of Livestock. Execution of these
programs was previously entrusted to autonomous development agencies 1/ set up
by the Government to promote one or more specific crops. However, as part of
a general reorganization of responsibilities in the agricultural sector,
Government has decided to implement agricultural projects through regional
agencies. Although details of the reorganization are not yet available, this
approach is basically sound and is expected to facilitate development of
smallholders projects aimed at improving the regional distribution of income
(para 1.03). In the meantime, some of the other crop-specific agencies have
been dissolved, including SODERIZ (for rice) and SOCATCI (rubber), and the
status of the remaining agencies has not yet been determined. Responsibility
for rice will probably be shifted to the regional agencies. However, imple-
mentation of Government rubber projects is under the direct responsibility of
the Ministry of Agriculture and is carried out under management contracts,
with SATAC/ Michelin for the Grand-Bereby Project (Loans 938-IVC and 1575-IVC)
and with SAPH for the proposed project (para 4.08). In October 1977, a
special unit called "Cellule Hevea," was set up within the ministry for the
supervision and the technical follow-up of all rubber development projects.
1.06      The Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des Productions
Agricoles (CSSPPA) is responsible for carrying out Government's agricultural
price support policies. It supports producer prices for cotton, cocoa,
coffee, palm oil and copra in a conventional manner, by paying a guaranteed
minimum price fixed annually, and by controlling the sale of the commodities
on the world market. Accumulated surpluses of such operations are used to
build reserves for future stabilization activities, and for financing part of
the Government's Investment Budget.
1.07      Agricultural research is undertaken by several French organizations
under a bilateral agreement. Programs and budgets are reviewed and approved
by the Ministry of Scientific Research, and costs are shared equally by the
two countries. Rubber research is undertaken by the Institut de Recherches
sur le Caoutchouc (IRCA), which acts also as the Technical Advisor to the
Ministry of Agriculture for the implementation of the rubber development
program.
1/   Societes de Developpement (SODEs).



-3-
1.08      The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole (BNDA), the main
source of agricultural credit, has been active so far in short-term credit
using a line of rediscount with the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de
l'Ouest (BCEAO). For other agricultural activities it has operated through
the SODEs which administer the credit in their respective subsectors. BNDA
has used its equity, and in some cases international funds such as CCCE's
participation in the first Grand-Bereby rubber project and IBRD funds under
the two Cocoa projects. BNDA is active in establishing branches in the rural
areas with the purpose of dealing directly with the farmers and farmers'
groups.
Development Strategy
1.09      The Government's primary goal has been, until recently, to promote
rapid growth. The focus of this goal was agricultural export crops and for-
estry, although a policy of fiscal incentives designed to promote private
investment supported industrial growth. While adhering to this goal, the
growth objective was conditioned by three considerations. First, diversifi-
cation was required to increase the stability of export earnings and of the
economy. Thus, in addition to coffee and cocoa, new export crops, such as
oil palm and rubber, were promoted. Second, it was recognized that growth
had been uneven and that regional income disparities (para 1.03), which
were detrimental to national unity, existed and should be reduced. Finally,
in the long run, reliance on foreign factors of production should be reduced
and labor and capital should be gradually Ivorianized.
1.10      With the generally rapid growth of the economy (para 1.03) which has
provided a more substantial basis upon which to generate savings, investment,
and future growth, Government has become increasingly concerned with improving
the distribution of income. The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture
(para 1.05), with its emphasis on regional development, is a reflection of
this concern. In dealing with income disparities, Government's policy now
gives special emphasis to increasing agricultural productivity in less devel-
oped areas through projects adapting service delivery systems to reach the
smallholder in annual crops, and the development of smallholder components of
more traditional perennial crop projects. The Cotton Areas Rural Development
Project (Loan 1077-IVC) is an example of the first approach, while the small-
holder component of the Fourth Oil Palm and Coconut Project (Loan 1382-IVC),
the pilot smallholder component of the proposed Second Grand-Bereby Rubber
Project both in the southwest, and this project to be implemented in the
southeast, are examples of the second.
The Rubber Subsector
1.11      Commercial rubber production started in 1962 when plantings made in
1955 came into bearing. The total planted area has grown at a modest rate,
reaching about 23,350 ha by the end of 1977. Of this, about 14,300 ha were
in production, although only half had reached peak yield. Details of the
status of the subsector in 1977 are provided in the following table:

1.12      With the exception of some 300 ha of smallholder plantings, about
half of which were initiated by Government in the Anguededou area in 1968 as a
pilot project presently run by SAPH, all of the country's rubber is grown on
estates. A French company (Compagnie de Caoutchouc et de Pneumatiques - CCP)
owns and operates 2,650 ha; Societe Africaine de Plantations d'Heveas (SAPH),
in which Government has a 60% majority share, owns another 12,800 ha, and
Government itself owns a further 7,600 ha. Of these, about 5,600 ha have been
planted under the Grand-Bereby Rubber Estate Project (Loan 938-IVC), for the
operation of which Government has secured the services of the Michelin Group
through a managemernt contract. Another 1,400 ha have been planted at Anguede-
dou, and operated for account of Government by SAPH on the basis of management
fees; the remaining 600 ha are operated by the Rubber Research Institute,
IRCA.
1.13      In 1977, total rubber production amounted to about 18,000 tons, 90%
of which was exported, representing about 0.6% of world natural rubber trade.
The country's industry is well advanced technologically since it has taken
advantage of the experience gained in other producing countries and is sup-
ported by effective research.
1.14      IRCA (para 1.07) has been active in the selection of high yielding
planting materials, studies concerning nutrition of the crop, the development
of new tapping systems and other production techniques. It is also respon-
sible for advising Government on agronomic and technological problems asso-
ciated with the development of the rubber industry in Ivory Coast. IRCA



-5-
also operates in Cameroon and carries out consultancy work in other African
countries.
1.15      Overall Government rubber development plans involve:  (a) the com-
pletion of about 700 ha of smallholder rubber in association with the existing
estate at Anguededou; (b) the planting of a 2,000 ha estate and 3,500 ha of
smallholdings in the southeast, which is the subject of this report; and (c)
in the southwest, completion of (i) a 4,500 ha estate at Rapides-Grah, and
(ii) the Bank-assisted Grand-Bereby project which is being extended in a
second phase to 13,500 ha. Further possible developments in the southwest
might be about 15,000 ha in the Lower Cavally area (at Grabo) some of which
could be smallholder operated. If this projected development program is
completed in full, it would increase the country's rubber area to about 60,000
ha by 1985. In that year, production would amount to only about 30,000 tons
most of which would be exported. This would represent less than one percent
of projected world natural rubber exports. At full development, in 1990,
total rubber production is expected to reach 110,000 tons, or about two
percent of world exports.
Bank Lending in the Subsector
1.16      The proposed project would be the third Bank operation in the sub-
sector; the first two operations covered the creation of a rubber estate in
Grand-Bereby, in the southwest. The first Bank-assisted rubber project in
the Ivory Coast, financed by Loan 938-IVC, originally envisaged the planting
of 13,500 ha of rubber between 1972 and 1979 in Grand-Bereby. Between 1973
and 1976 project implementation was difficult. Inefficient management in the
early stages and labor recruitment problems due to the location of the scheme
in the largely underdeveloped southwest have slowed down execution of the
project. At the end of 1977 only about 5,600 ha were planted, compared
with an appraisal estimate of 7,500 ha. It is expected that a total of 7,000
ha will be planted by the end of 1978. The higher project costs were the
result of labor shortages and inefficient management during the start-up
period. The problem was further compounded by a higher-than-expected infla-
tion rate in the 1972-75 period. Recognizing these factors, the Executive
Directors approved in September 1976 an amendment reducing the area to be
planted by the end of 1978 to 7,000 ha (R76-240). A follow-up project,
approved by the Board in May 1978, would maintain the 7,000 ha until entry in
production, extend the plantation to 13,500 ha and build processing facilities.
1.17      Following exchange of views between the Bank and the Government
during negotiations of the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project, it was agreed
that the rubber industry has expanded to the point requiring the introduction
of an overall planning and coordinating program. Government agreed to prepare
and submit a policy paper on the development-'of the rubber subsector to be
discussed with the Bank by December 31, 1978.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
Smallholders' Plantations
2.01      Smallholding development under the project would take place ini-
tially in the vicinity of SAPH's existing industrial plantations at Toupah
and Bongo and in association with the ongoing estate and smallholder scheme
at Anguededou (see Map). In these regions, the soils are derived from ter-
tiary sands. The vegetation is largely degraded forest, secondary bush or
savannah. The ar,ea is at an altitude of between. 50 and 100 meters, with a
mean temperate in the range of 25°- 27°C, and above-average rainfall in the
main wet season, which brings the total precipitation to around 2,000 mm.
2.02      Most of the land available for rubber planting in these areas has
already been farmed. Some is currently under food crops, some is planted
with old coffee and cocoa which are unproductive and require replacement,
while the remainder is under bush fallow often dominated by Siam weed
(Eupatorium odoratum) which is fast becoming one of the major weed problems
in West Africa. There is virtually no undeveloped virgin forest in the
region.  Consequently, preparation of the-land for rubber planting should
not require more than about 60 mandays per hectare and is not expected to
jeopardize normal food farming activities upon which the farming families
depend for their subsistence.
2.03      The rural population in the southeast region where the project is
situated is about 900,000 with an average family size of 8.3 persons per farm,
making about 108,000 farms. The average farm size is about 6.8 ha. About a
quarter of the population are immigrants from neighboring countries such as
Upper Volta, Ghana and Mali and many of these work as laborers on Ivorian
owned farms. The area is characterized by a marked orientation towards a
cash crop economy. Of the total cultivated area of about 730,000 ha, between
one-half and two-thirds of the land is planted with cocoa or coffee. However,
the economic importance of these crops in the project area should not be over
valued. Many of the plantings are old, yields are low and many tree crop
plantings consist of sporadically planted trees intercropped with foodcrops.
The major food crops grown are maize, yams, cassava and plantains. These
crops have traditionally been grown for subsistence but are finding a
growing market outlet in nearby urban centers, particularly around Abidjan.
Nucleus Estate
2.04      InitialLy two zones were proposed as potential sites for the pro-
posed project's nucleus estate: one within the forest reserve of Tamin in
the Department of Aboisso, the other in the forest reserve of Songan, Depart-
ment of Abengourou (see Map). These selections were based on data obtained
from the Institutes of Tropical Geography, Abidjan.  Subsequent studies resulted
in the rejection of the Tamin site, largely due to the terrain which was con-
sidered, in some parts, to be too broken for satisfactory rubber development
and, in others, too swampy and difficult to drain.



- 7 -
2.05      Governnent has delimited a 5,000 ha concession in the Songan
Forest Reserve, about 70 km south of Abengourou and some 25 km west of the
frontier with Ghana (see map). The soils are strongly leached schist-derived
laterites. Some contain large quartz boulders, there are extensive areas of
coarse gravel and some zones of cemented hard pan. However, preliminary
prospection of the area indicates that about 2,600 hectares should be suitable
for planting with rubber. The location of the factory has not yet been selec-
ted. Furthermore, when the possibilities for development of the smallholder
plantings have been ascertained, it might be advisable to implant the factory
outside the present boundaries of the estate. A decision, however, would not
be needed before 1986, and whatever the final site chosen, no problem is
foreseen in securing an appropriate location.
2.06      Prospection has been carried out by the IRHO (Institut de Recherches
pour les Huiles et Oleagineux). Their report has delimited 2,000 hectares of
soils of sufficient quality to justify the retention of the yield forecasts on
which the estate component has been evaluated. Studies have also been carried
out to determine the phasing of the development operations and such factors as
the location of villages and the layout of the road system. Clearing of the
forest for the first plantings is expected to commence by the end of 1978, and
would be spread over three years. Since these areas would be completely
recovered within seven years with a closed canopy of rubber trees, and in any
event, would affect only 40% of the estate concession, or 10% of the current
classified forest, no adverse ecological effects are expected.
2.07      The project area is all under medium to dense evergreen forest
from which most of the marketable timber has already been extracted. Outside
the forest reserve the principal perennial cash crops are coffee and cocoa; it
is among the growers of these crops that potential rubber smallholders would
be recruited.
2.08      The climatic conditions are similar to those obtaining around Toupah,
Bongo and Anguededou. The altitude is between 50 and 100 meters above sea
level, the mean temperature is in the range of 250 - 27 0C and the annual rain-
fall is between 1,600-1,700 mm. The principal dry season occurs in December,
January and February, and the annual moisture deficit is between 300 to 350 mm.
While not ideal, these conditions are considered satisfactory for rubber and
are indeed typical of those found in many of the rubber growing areas in West
Africa.
2.09      Communications.  Access to smallholders plantings in the vicinity
of existing SAPH estates would be possible through the feeder roads already
existing on these estates. The Songan concession can be linked to the main
road network either through Adzope, to the west, or through Abengourou, to
the north. While the northern link to Abengourou is adequate, it lengthens
the distance to Abidjan (where estate production would eventually have to be
evacuated) by 180 km per round trip; the shorter western link is dependent,
however, on a ferry connection at Betie, right on the western limit of the



-8-
concession. To ensure regular connection, this iferry must be rehabilitated,
and an assurance to that effect was obtained dur:ng negotiations.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project, which would be implemented over a seven-year period,
which represents the gestation span of rubber trees, would finance the plant-
ing of a total of 5,500 ha of rubber, and comprise:
(a)  planting of 3,000 ha of smallholding rubber around Anguededou,
Bongo and Toupah, on land that would be manually cleared by
participating farmers;
(b)  the development and planting of a fully Government-owned
2,000 ha nucleus industrial estate ta be managed by SAPH
on land to be selected within a 5,000 ha concession in the
Songan Forest Reserve; clearing would be carried out under
contract using heavy mechanical equipment;
(c) the plarnting of 500 ha of smallholdings in association with
the new estate at Songan;
(d)  the maintenance of all young rubber planted under the project
for the duration of the project period:;
(e) the setting up of training and extension services to ensure the
proper guidance and supervision of participating farmers; and
(f) the finédicing of a socio-economic study of the region around
the Songan concession to determine the rate of implementation
and likely eventual extent of rubber smallholding development
in association with the new estate. The likely impact of such
plantings on other cash crop activities and the effect that the
introduction of a new perennial tree crop might have on food
production both for subsistence and trade would also be
investigated.
3.02      The project is envisaged as comprising the first phase of a con-
tinuing program of' rubber smallholding development in the Ivory Coast. A
follow-up project would be required for maintenance up until rubber production
commences on the Songan estate areas already planted under the proposed
project and the construction of a new factory to process the crop from the
new estate at Songan and its associated outgrowers. Depending on the degree
of interest among farmers around Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou, further invest-
ments might also be necessary to expand the existing factory capacity at these
centers (para 3.08).



-9-
Planting Material for the Project
3.03      SAPH would produce budded stumps for distribution to smallholders
and grafted polybag plants for the nucleus estate at Songan. The advantages
of the polybag system are recognized by all concerned; but vith the sandy
soils in the nurseries, especially at Toupah where the greatest concentration
of smallholding development is expected to take place, it would not be possible
to transport bagged plants, often over poor roads, and still retain a good
ball of earth. The risk of transplanting losses would therefore be as great
or greater than with well grown and properly prepared 20 months old bare-root
stumps.
3.04      The choice of clones would be reviewed annually in the light of the
latest data available from IRCA and current experience on the SAPH estates.
It is probable that GT 1 would be used most extensively. Other clones avail-
able in SAPH's existing budwood gardens include PR 107, Avros 2037, PB 235,
PR 261 and RRIM 600. Over the project period there would be 78 ha of stump
nurseries; 67 to supply Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou smallholders and Il ha
for those around Songan. For estate planting at Songan, there would be 26
ha of polybag nurseries. A 5 ha budwood garden would also be planted in
anticipation of further smallholder development in the Songan area.
Land Clearing and Planting Techniques
3.05      The project has been costed on the assumption that land clearing
for Songan estate would be fully mechanized and would be carried out under
contract since the estate would be too small to justify the purchase of heavy
equipment. Smallholdings, which are not, for the most part, expected to be
developed directly from forest land, would be manually cleared by the farmers
themselves.
3.06      Planting density would be 568 plants per ha (8m x 2.2m) on the
estate, with two stage thinning to give 450 trees per hectare at opening.
Smallholdings would adopt a symmetrical 4.75 m triangular planting system in
order to achieve a closed canopy as rapidly as possible. The lower initial
density (512 plants per ha) is desirable because of the farmers known re-
luctance to thin out subsequently. In all cases a leguminous cover crop
(Pueraria) would be established in the planting year and maintained as long
as possible, i.e. until shaded out by the closing of the rubber canopy. Weed-
ing would be largely chemical on the estate and manual on the smallholdings.
3.07      Tapping would commence during the last three months of the sixth
year after planting, with production anticipated at 150 kg/ha from the small-
holders and 200 kg on the estate. The substantially lower yield expected from
the smallholdings is in line with experience elsewhere. Neither the quality
nor the regularity of tapping is of the same high standard as should be
attainable with a disciplined estate work force. It has been assumed that all
areas would be tapped on a half spiral (S2), twice weekly (three and four day
intervals alternating - d3/d4) basis. This relatively low tapping intensity
effects substantial economies in labor: a yield stimulant, probably Ethrel,
would be used as necessary to maintain the required level of production. Crop



- 10 -
collection has been costed as for liquid latex on the estate and coagulated
cup lump from the smallholders. Because of the use of stimulants, it has been
assumed that 25% of the estate crop would be of secondary grades (cup coagulum
from late dripping, tree lace bark and ground scrap). Over the seven years
that would elapse before the first plantings under the project come into
bearing it is expected that some of the newer techniques for harvesting rubber
will be further developed; e.g. micro-tapping and periodic collection. Their
impact on the project benefits would be expected to be favorable.
Processing
3.08      The existing SAPH factories at Toupah and Bongo and the Government
factory at Anguedeidou are all designed to produce SMR-type block rubbers from
granulated coagulum. Rubber produced under the project would be processed in
these factories or in extensions to them. Rubber production in the Songan
area would start only in PY 8, with 60 tons, and increase to about 400 tons
in PY 9; this production would be coagulated and transported to existing SAPH
plants, as quantities are too small to justify advancing processing invest-
ments, which should be available only in PY 10. A follow-up project would
provide financing for maintenance of immature estate areas until they all
reach production, and the construction of a new factory to process the crop
from the new Estate at Songan and its associated outgrowers. Depending on
the degree of interest among farmers around Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou
further investments might also be necessary to expand the existing factory
capacity at these centers.
Cost Estimates
3.09      Project costs during the seven-year investment period, inclusive
of taxes are estimated at CFAF 4,353 million (US$19.8 million), of which the
foreign exchange component would be CFAF 1,739 million (US$7.9 million) or
40%, and local currency CFAF 2,614 million (US$11.9 million), or 60%. Exclu-
sive of taxes, the total project cost would be CFAF 3,532 million (US$16.1
million). In addition, debt service during the project period would amount
to CFAF 1,039 million (US$4.7 million).
3.10      Cost estimates, based on mid-1978 prices, include direct and
indirect taxes amounting to 821 million (US$3.7 million) or 19% of total
project costs and contain the following contingencies: (a) physical contin-
gencies of 10% on civil works and 5% on all other costs, salaries and cash
advances excluded; and (b) price contingencies applied on base costs plus
physical contingencies compounded yearly as follows: for civil works 8% in
1979, 7.5% in 1980 and 7% thereafter; for vehicles, equipment and field
inputs; 7% in 1979, 6.5% in 1980 and 6% thereafter; on all other costs, 7%
throughout.
3.11      Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis amount to 19%
of project costs or 23% of base line cost estimates. Detailed estimates are
summarized in Table 2, and a yearly breakdown is given in Annex 1, Table 1.

Proposed Financing
3.12      Three foreign lenders together with Government would finance the
project. A Bank loan of US$7.6 million is proposed. In addition, the Common-
wealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom, and Caisse Centrale
de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France, would participate in the financing
with CFAF 660 million (US$3.0 million) and CFAF 330 million (US$1.5 million)
respectively. Government would finance the balance estimated at CFAF 1,691
million (US$7.7 million).  While CDC would finance jointly with the Bank all
project components, CCCE would limit its part to the financing of the 3,000 ha
smallholder component. A condition of effectiveness would be the effective-
ness of the CDC and CCCE loans.
3.13      The financing would be as follows:

3.14      The Bank loan of US$7.6 million would be made to Government for a
term of 17 years including a four-year grace period at the prevailing interest
rate (estimated at 7.9%). The other colenders' loans also made to Government
are expected to have different interest rates, and grace periods and maturity
vary:  CDC's would be 7.5% (seven-year grace period and repayment over 13
years) and CCCE's wrould be 5.5% (six-year grace period and repayment over
eight years). The Bank loan would finance 47% of project costs excluding
taxes, and 38% of total project costs. Total external financing of CFAF 2,662
million (US$12.1 million) would cover foreign exchange cost, US$7.9 million,
plus US$4.1 million of local costs, or 75% of total project costs excluding
taxes. This high percentage of foreign financing is justified on the ground
that Government will have to incur substantial expenditure for maintenance of
the estate, continuation of the smallholder operation and debt service (paras
3.09, 3.16).



- 13 -
3.15      Government and CDC would finance start up costs during the first
year of the project. They would be joined by the Bank and CCCE for following
four years when the bulk of the investments would be carried out and all
plantings would be completed. Government alone would finance years six and
seven. Government's contribution to project costs during tne first five
years are estimated at CFAF 850 million (US$3.9 million); details of project
costs over the five year period are shown in Annex 1, Table 1. Each yearly
allocation, which would cover all project costs and farmers' credit, would be
made available to SAPH and BNDA by Government at the beginning of the year on
the basis of a budget and schedule of operations, presented by SAPH three
months in advance and approved by Government. Copies of these budgets would
be sent to the Bank for review as soon as they are prepared. Government
would draw on colender loans after expenditures have been incurred, according
to documentation prepared by SAPH and BNDA. During the seven-year project
period, the total financing.available for the project CFAF 4,353 million
(US$19.8 million), originating from colenders CFAF 2,662 million (US$12.1
million) and Government CFAF 16 million (US$7.7 million), would be deployed as
follows:
(a) CFAF 3,128 million (US$14.2 million) would be passed on to SAPH
as agent of the Government to cover all project costs for the
Songan nucleus estate and the setting-up and operation of a
smallholders' extension service;
(b) CFAF 563 million (US$2.6 million) to cover the amounts of the
loans to be granted to smallholders would be on-lent by
Government to BNDA at the same interest rates as those on
the external loans to Government (plus, in the case of the
Bank and CDC loans, 1% to cover the foreign exchange risk,
which would be borne by Government). Government's own funds
would carry no interest and the average cost to BNDA would
be about 5.5%; and
(c) CFAF 662 million (US$3.0 million) would be held to cover
contingencies.
3.16      Additional financing would be needed after the seven-year project
period, and until PY 12 when the cash flow would become positive (Annex 1,
Table 2), to bring the estate to maturity, to continue the operation of the
smallholders extension service, to provide additional processing facilities
necessary for the project production and to ensure debt servicing of the loans
incurred to finance the project. This additional outlay, net of income from
sales and smallholders debt repayment, is estimated at CFAF 2,446 million
(US$11.1 million), and would be provided by Government. Assurances to that
effect were obtained during negotiations. The surplus generated by project
operations in PY 12 would amount to CFAF 384 million (US$1.7 million) increas-
ing to CFAF 1,706 million (US$7.8 million) in PY 16 at which time all project
costs would have been fully recovered. In PY 19, when all trees reach peak
yields, the annual surplus would increase to CFAF 2,410 million (US$11.0 mil-
lion) and by then all loans would have been fully repaid, with the exception
of the last CDC installment in PY 20 of CFAF 81 million (US$0.4 million).



- 14 -
Procurement
3.17      The following procedures would be applied during the five-year
disbursement period of the external loans. Contracts of US$50,000 equivalent
or more would be made through international competitive bidding, in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Goods and services so procured are estimated to cost
US$3.9 million consisting mainly of estate land clearing (US$2.2 million), and
vehicles and equipment (US$1.7 million). An exception would be made for the
first 300 ha of land clearing and preparation (US$0.4 million), which, in
order to take advantage of the 1978 dry season so as not to delay the first
year of planting, would be carried out under a negotiated contract acceptable
to the Bank. Individual contracts for the vehicles and equipment for less
than US$50,000, would be awarded on the basis of local procedures acceptable
to the'Bank (total cost estimated at US$0.4 million). Civil works, mainly
housing and field offices, amounting to US$1.6 million, scattered over a large
area and unlikely to attract foreign bidders, would be contracted according
to local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Bank, or after specific approval of the Bank, would be carried out under force
account by SAPH. Field inputs consist primarily of planting materials, US$0.7
million, to be produced by SAPH. The rest (mainly fertilizers and chemical
sprays), US$0.6 million, would be procured in bulk by SAPH, together with
their own purchases of which they would constitute about 20%, through local
competitive bidding, consultations with suppliers, or negotiated contracts,
acceptable to the Bank. The remaining project costs (US$8.4 million) would be
for consultant services for studies, US$0.2 million, for salaries and adminis-
trative overheads, US$3.1 million, estate agricultural development costs,
US$2.1 million, operations and maintenance, US$2.1 million, and cash advances
to the smallholders, US$0.9 million.
Disbursement
3.18      The Bank loan would be disbursed over four years to cover:
(a)  45% of the cost of the smallholder components for:
(i)  procurement costs of vehicles and equipment (US$0.1);
(ii)  construction cost (US$0.1 million);
(iii) farmers credit in kind and cash (US$0.9 million);
(iv)  salaries, administration, and other operating costs
(US$0.9 million); and
(b)  55% of the cost of the Songan estate for:
(i)  procurement costs of vehicles and equipment
(US$0.5 million);
(ii)  construction costs (US$0.6 million);
(iii) land clearing costs (US$1.2 million);
(iv)  field development costs (US$1.0 million);
(v)  consultant services, salaries, administration and
operating costs (US$1.3 million).
US$1.0 million would be unallocated.  A schedule Df disbursements is at Annex
1, Table 4. Disbursements for (a)(i) and (ii) and (b)(i), (ii), and (iii)



- 15 -
would be fully documented. Disbursements for the other categories would be
against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which would be
retained by SAPH and BNDA for inspection by supervision missions.
Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
3.191    SAPH would manage the project accounts, and keep records consistent
with sound accounting practice and adequate to reflect its operation and
financial situation. These records would also show the accounts of the res-
pective project components and the position of the outgrowers' loans and
repayments. Government would cause SAPH to appoint independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and their reports would be of such scope and in such
detail as the Bank may reasonably request. These reports would be sent to
the Bank not later than six months after the closing of the financial year.
In addition, quarterly progress reports would be required to keep Government
and the co-financiers informed of project progress. Assurances to that effect
were obtained at negotiations.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Executing A,ency
4.01      The Societe Africaine de Plantations d'Heveas (SAPH) would be
entrusted by Government with the implementation of the project. Rubber
smallholder development would take place around SAPH's existing estates under
SAPH management; the new estate at Songan, which would be Government-owned but
managed by SAPH, would serve as a nucleus for future smallholder development
in the Songan area.
4.02      SAPH was the first rubber plantation company to be established in
the Ivory Coast. It was formed in 1956 by a group of French companies which
had been operating for many years in Vietnam and Cambodia. In 1964, the
share capital was increased and the Government, through Societe Nationale de
Financement (SONAFI), acquired a majority interest. SONAFI currently holds
60.42% of the issued share capital of CFAF 3,364 million (US$13.7 million),
with the remainder being held by subsidiaries of the French privately-owned
Banque de Suez et de l'Indochine (BSIC), of which the Societe Indochine de
Plantations d'Heveas (SIPH) is the principal.
4.03      SAPH owns and operates three estates at Toupah, Bongo and Rapides
Grah and, in addition, manages an estate at Anguededou on behalf of the
Government (para 1.12) under arrangements similar to those proposed under
the project. SAPH has land concessions of over 25,000 ha, of which 12,600
ha had been planted by end of September 1977, and of which 8,350 ha were in
production. In the year ending September 30, 1977, the estates of Toupah
and Bongo (Rapides Grah being not yet in production) produced 11,235 tons of
rubber. SAPH has a staff of over 5,000 of whom 72 are in management positions,



- 16 -
including 19 expatriates. Most of the expatriates are seconded by Societe
de Developpement des Cultures Industrielles (SODECI), a subsidiary of SIPH,
with whom SAPH has a technical assistance contract.
4.04      A summary of essential financial data for SAPH is at Annex 1,
Table 6. For the year to 30th September 1977, SAPH made a profit before tax
of about CFAF 700 million (US$2.9 million). Sales totalled 10,183 tons of
rubber at an average price realized of CFAF 216.3 (US$0.88) per kilo against a
cost of production of CFAF 130.6 (US$0.53) per kilo excluding depreciation and
CFAF 150 (US$0.61) per kilo including depreciation. SAPH's first dividend
was paid on the 1974 results. Since that time, the Board has resolved to
distribute by way of dividend 55% of the net profit of any year. The undis-
tributed profits remaining have since been contributed to SAPH's investment
program; also for the financing of this program, SAPH had borrowed CFAF 2,145
million (US$8.8 mi:Llion) up to September 30, 1977, almost wholly on conces-
sionary terms, provided mainly by CCCE and CDC. SAPH is a well-managed com-
pany, its financia-L situation and policies are sound, and its administrative
procedures, internal control and cost-accounting are among the best in the
Ivory Coast.
Project Implementation
4.05      SAPH would manage the project for the Government and would even-
tually also be responsible for the processing of rubber produced on the
nucleus estate at Songan and by smallholders associated with each of the
four centers of development. The project planting program, which would be
completed by PY 5, is expected to be:

The Songan estate planting program would not commence until PY 2 in order to
provide SAPH with time to undertake detailed land surveying and to make pro-
visions for the necessary contractual arrangements, administration and prelim-
inary infrastructure required for this new venture in an as yet undeveloped
area. Smallholder plantings in the Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou areas would
be expected to start on a small scale in PY 1 - planting material and the
nucleus of an extension staff structure (para 4.06) are already available -
and would gather momnentum reaching an expected planting rate of between
700-850 hectares durin'g PYs 3-5. The smallholder program within the vicinity



- 17 -
of the new Songan estate would not commence until PY 4, in order to ensure
the initial establishment of the estate to act as a nucleus for the outgrower
development.
4.06      The staffing of the nucleus estate would be assured by SAPH either
by internal transfers or by recruitment. An Ivorian manager has already been
nominated to take charge of the smallholder component of the project and would
be assisted by an expatriate rubber specialist seconded to SAPH by IRCA. It
is expected that this specialist would be replaced by an Ivorian national at
the end of PY 5. During his tenure of office he would be responsible for
staff training, organization of demonstrations and training for participating
farmers and for the monitoring and evaluation of progress under the project.
Assistant staff would be recruited from within SAPH, thus ensuring the imme-
diate availability of people of supervisory grade with the necessary knowledge
of rubber cultivation. The deploynent of key staff is expected to be as
follows:

During the seven-year investment period, a total of 21-1/2 man-year of expa-
triate assistance (*) is scheduled, at a total cost, in 1977 terms, of about
CFAF 235 million (US$1.1 million). Average expatriate man-year cost would
be about $50,000 (80% for salary, and 20% for social benefits and home-leave
travel), which is justified by the professional qualifications and expertise
required. Housing and local travel costs, which would be provided by the
project for all key staff, are not included in the estimate.
SAPH's Fees
4.07      SAPH would enter into a management agreement with Government.  This
agreement would determine the grades of senior management personnel which SAPH
would make available to the project, the equipment which it will lend to the
project, the services which it would provide and also the fees that would be
charged. As regards personnel, it is envisaged that SAPH will recover from
the project the full cost of the individuals including their salaries and



- 18 -
salary on-costs with the addition of a further .10% as a fee to SAPH. Equip-
ment hired to the project by SAPH would be charged at a fee to cover nominal
operating costs and depreciation. In addition, SAPH would be remunerated
for management services provided to the project by the general fee. For the
estate, it is envisaged that this will be as follows: (a) during development,
8% of basic field development costs, and 2.5% oi- the cost of buildings and
basic infrastructure; (b) during production, 2% of fob sales and CFAF 3,000
(US$13.6) per ha in production. The total fee cluring the development period
is estimated at about CFAF 104 million (US$473,000) and during exploitation
about CFAF 23 million (US$101,000) per year. For the smallholder components,
it is envisaged that the fee would be 7% on totaLl supply of inputs to farmers,
excluding cash advances, and at crop maturity 2% on purchases of rubber from
the outgrowers. The total fee during the development period is estimated at
about CFAF 88.8 million (US$404,000) and during exploitation about CFAF 12.6
million (US$57,000) annually. The level of fees is reasonable and below what
is practiced in the Ivory Coast by consulting firms offering that type of
technical assistance.  It reflects SAPH's readiness to assist Government in
the execution of this project.
4.08      Financial control would be assured by the general and analytical
accounting services of SAPH, these services being provided in return for an
agreed fee tentatively estimated at CFAF 8 million (US$36,000) per year (in
1977 terms). All of the above arrangements would be part of a management
contract to be signed between Government and SAPH, which among other features,
will determine SAPH tasks and responsibilities, the form of Government's
supervision, the payments to be made to SAPH to cover the costs of the creation
of the Songan nucleus estate, the setting-up and operation of the smallholders
extension organization and any other services, including agreements on rates
and fees, the flow of funds and reporting requirements.  The contract will
specify under what conditions SAPH would process, in its mills, the rubber
produced by the smallholders. A draft of the proposed contract was reviewed
during negotiations, and the signature of such a contract would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
4.09      While SAPH would be fully responsible for all the technical aspects
of the project, smallholder credit would be provided by BNDA (the National
Agriculture Development Bank) from funds on-lent by Government (para 3.15).
Responsibilities of each one of the two agencies are shown on the Chart at the
end of this report. The arrangements covering the terms and conditions of
Government's loan to BNDA and BNDA loans to farmers would be specified in
a contract to be agreed upon between the two parties and which would specify
the amortization schedule of reimbursement to Government of its loan to
BNDA. The role of BNDA in conjunction with SAPH in the appraisal of farmers
applying participation in the program, the flow of funds from BNDA to the
farmers and to SAPU (for inputs supplied to farmers on credit), and the reim-
bursement to BNDA of loan installments collected by SAPH when the smallholders
tap and deliver thes raw rubber to SAPH would be specified in an agreement
between BNDA and SAPH. A standard form of disbursement and amortization
schedule for a loan to a farmer for one hectare of rubber cultivation would
be part of the agreement, which would also indicate the legal basis on which



- 19 -
the loan agreement between BNDA and the farmers would be drawn. Drafts of
the proposed contract and agreement were reviewed during negotiations and
their signature would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Training and Extension
4.10      Training would be an important, though relatively inexpensive com-
ponent of the project since a residential training center already exists among
the facilities available at Anguededou and practical field work would be
performed on the existing SAPH estates. A detailed training program is to be
drawn up by SAPH and would be presented for review by the Bank not later than
December 31, 1978. An assurance to that effect was obtained during negotia-
tions. The two principal components of this program would relate to staff
training and farmer training respectively.
4.11      Since staff would be already experienced in the practical aspects
of rubber husbandry their training needs would be related more to the tech-
niques of communication, effective supervision and motivation of participating
farmers. Such staff, however, would require training in the preparation and
maintenance of appropriate records relating to work progress on individual
farms.
4.12      Would-be participants in the smallholding scheme with no previous
experience of rubber growing would be given a brief introductory course prior
to being formally accepted into the program.  This would ensure that they
fully appreciate the nature of the commitment they were undertaking both as
regards the physical work involved and the financial obligations entailed in
eventually repaying the debts incurred through acceptance of cash credit and
the various material inputs to be provided by SAPH. Subsequently, farmer
training would mainly be by practical demonstration either on site or, where
appropriate, to selected groups brought together at the Anguededou center or
on one of the SAPH plantations.
4.13      Instruction would be provided by the staff from the Rubber Research
Institute and SAPH personnel as appropriate. For the initial five-year phase,
necessary expenditures are included in the project costs; there would be no
need for consultant services. In the longer term there would be a need for
the establishment of a more broad-based farmer training and agricultural exten-
sion service which would be regionally organized rather than crop specific in
its activities.
4.14      Because rubber would be a new crop to the project participants, in-
tensive supervision and guidance would be required. SAPH would appoint one
extension worker for every 20 farmers during the land preparation and planting
period and 1:40 subsequently. In each of the four areas the extension staff
would be under the direction of a sector chief. There would also be, in each
sector, a mobile team (consisting of a supervisor and three skilled workers)
which would provide technical assistance to the extension workers in the
demonstration and supervision of key operations requiring prior rubber
experience.

Size of Smallholder Plantings and Criteria for Smallholder Selection
4.15      The typical smallholder is expected to plant between 1 and 4 ha
of rubber. Government wishes to accept into the scheme a certain number of
farmers able to plant more than 4 ha, because these farmers, already employ-
ing hired labor, would be more likely to make a success of the operation and,
by their success, encourage the eventual particiLation of smaller farmers who
initially may be reluctant to embark on a new venture with a crop about which
they are at present largely ignorant. This wouldl be of importance, particu-
larly during the initial stages of smallholder development.  However, suffi-
cient interest exists among farmers in the project area (para 7.09) to aim
towards the smaller farmer. In this way a larger number of family farms could
become project beneficiaries and a stated Government objective - a better dis-
tribution of resources and wealth - would be realized. Government and project
management would aim, through an appropriate screening process of applicants,
to encourage the smaller family farm which would plant one to two hectares of
rubber. However, a few larger farm enterprises are considered acceptable at
this stage, providing that they have the farm labor resources to carry out
their undertakings. Nevertheless, there would be a maximum area of 10 ha per
family and an assurance to that effect was obtained during negotiations.
4.16      It is not intended that there should necessarily be any formal
grouping of farmers as a prequalification for participation. However, such
groups on either an informal or an organized cooperative basis would be
actively encouraged by the extension staff. The following specific criteria
for the selection of smallholders would be applied:
(i) The appl:icant would be engaged full-time in agriculture and
would derive the major part of his income from these activities;
his cred-Ltworthiness would be investigated by SAPH and by BNDA.
(ii)  The land proposed should be suitable for planting with rubber,
should be accessible to an all-weather road and should be
within an economical collecting radius from either an existing
factory or the factory to be built on the new estate at Songan.
(iii) The target group would be farmers interested in planting between
1 ha and 4 ha of rubber. The maximum area to be planted under
the project by any one farmer would be limited to 10 ha, and
it would not be admissible for other members of the farmer's
immediate household to participate independently in the project.
(iv)  SAPH would require evidence that the farmer has disposition of
sufficient family or hired labor to take proper care of his
rubber without jeopardizing his existing food-farming activities.
(v)  Farmers fulfilling the above criteria would be required
to enter into contractual agreements with SAPH and with BNDA
recognizing their obligations to cultivate their rubber



- 21 -
according to instructions issued by SAPH and to meet their
debt commitments with BNDA.  Since these debts would be
repaid by deductions from the money paid by SAPH for their
rubber, farmers would undertake to sell the whole of their
crop to SAPH until .debt service is completed.
4.17      A survey of smallholders in the Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou areas
has already been carried out and shows sufficient response to ensure an
enrolment adequate to achieve project targets. A socio-economic study of the
areas immediately surrounding the site of the Songan Estate would be con-
ducted to determine the rate of implementation and the eventual extent of
smallholding development there. SAPH would commission consultants in PY 1,
on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to produce a report by not
later than the end of 1979. A total of about twelve consultant man-months
would be required, at an average cost of about US$9,000 (of which 50% would
be for salary, 17% for international and local travel, and 33% for local
subsistence). Total estimated costs, including local supporting staff
and in-the-field expenditure, would be about CFAF 30 million (US$136,000)
in 1977 terms.
Farmer Credit and Output Pricing Arrangements
4.18      To assist the farmer in meeting the cost of establishing his rubber
plantings, credit in kind and in cash would be provided during the crop in-
vestment period.  Participating farmers, accepted in the program and for whom
BNDA would open individual accounts, would be able to purchase on credit,
during the first seven years of the crop's life, all field inputs required for
planting and maintenance, and also the initial equipment for tapping. Such
inputs would be supplied directly to farmers by SAPH at cost and the farmers'
accounts at BNDA would be debited accordingly. In addition, in order to
provide some immediate financial compensation to the farmer for his labor
input on the crop, during the five-year period before the trees can be tapped
project participants would be eligible for cash advances on credit. These
advances would be based on a value of CFAF 300 per manday - the Government's
minimum rural daily wage - times a previously estimated manday requirement for
each crop year. This amount is somewhat less than the opportunity cost of
labor (para 6.03), but is considered adequate since future income, rather than
immediate compensation, is expected to provide the primary incentive for farmer
participation. Total estimated manday requirements per hectare from Crop
Years 0 to 5 are 244 days making a total cash advance on credit of CFAF 73,200
or US$333 per hectare (1977 terms).  Disbursements of the cash credit would
be conditional on SAPH having certified that the required agricultural work
had been satisfactorily carried out.  The total cost of field inputs from Crop
Years 0 to 6 amount to CFAF 106,300 or US$482 per hectare making a total
provision of credit per hectare of CFAF 179,500 or US$816 (1977 terms).
4.19      Interest on provisions of credit would be capitalized during the
first seven years of development which would include the first year of tapping
when only 150 kg/ha of rubber are produced. During the eighth year, interest
only would be charged. The loan would then be repaid over the succeeding



- 22 -
nine years with the principal being repaid in proportion to the farmers
yields, thus sheltering the farmer from unduly beavy repayment burdens during
the first few years of tapping when his yields would be lower. Interest would
be charged each year on the balance of the farmer's outstanding principal.
The loan would be fully repaid by the sixteenth year after planting.
4.20.     Credit would be supplied at an interest rate of 9% yearly (1% for
life insurance, about 2.5% to cover BNDA's administrative cots, plus the
average cot of funds to BNDA of about 5.5%).  This interest rate represents a
slight increase firom the 8% limit previously in effect for agricultural
credit. Domestic inflation has averaged about 10% in the past three years but
is expected to drop to an annual rate of 7% over the life of the farmers'
loans.
4.21      The recommended price to be paid to the farmer is CFAF 130/kg of
dry rubber (1977 terms). This recommendation and the credit arrangements
outlined above are based on assessments of the impact of this and of alter-
native financial arrangements upon farmer incomes and incentives and upon the
project's financial and economic rates of return.  The farmer's cash flow
resulting from the arrangements proposed above is illustrated in Annex 1,
Table 7. A commentary on the impact of these arrangements and upon the likely
impact of alternative arrangements is provided in Chapter VI.
V. MARKETS AND PRICES, PRODUCTION
Markets and Prices
5.01      The world market price for natural rubber is currently at about
US$0.43/lb (RSS1 quality), which is slightly below the average price in 1977
terms during the period 1970-74 of US$0.46/lb. The price of natural rubber
fell sharply in 1975, to US$0.33/lb, due to depressed industrial activity
in consuming countries. As a result of a general manufacturing recovery,
demand for natural rubber increased in 1976 and the real price returned
towards its former level.
5.02      In estimating the future market prospects for natural rubber,
account has been taken of supply projections and of industrial demand. On
the supply side, world production of natural rubber is expected to increase
by only about 4% per annum during the 1980s. This increase would be mainly
due to increased yLelds rather than new plantings, as producing countries
responded to the depressed 1975 prices by cutting down their rubber expansion
programs. Goncerning demand, this is related both to the level of manufac-
turing activity and to the relative price of synthetic rubber. Natural
rubber has a quality advantage over synthetic rubbers for uses such as for
heavy duty and rad-Lal tires, but overall demand for natural rubber is never-
theless substantially dependent upon the price of synthetics which comprise
two thirds of the world market for rubbers. Forecasts of natural rubber
prices have therefore been based on the expected prices of its synthetic
substitutes which in turn are related to crude oil. prices. Crude oil prices
are expected to remain at about the present level in constant terms but slight
increases in the cc>sts of manufacturing synthetic rubbers are expected in the



- 23 -
longer term.  Accordingly, the trend of natural rubber prices in real terms
ls therefore expected to remain at around the present level during the 1980s
although a slight increase to US$0.45/lb (1977 terms) is expected by the 1990s.
During this time, natural rubber's share of the world market for rubber is
estimated to fall from its present 35% share to slightly below 30%. In view
of this expectation and of the future forecasts of natural rubber prices,
further expansion of world natural rubber production appears to be justified.
5.03      All current SAPH production is sold as block rubber which has an
advantage over sheet rubber in that its technical qualities can be specified
accurately. Block rubber is accordingly in demand by manufacturers, with the
higher grades of block rubber attaining a price premium over RSS1 (quality sheet
rubber). Given the market advantages of block rubber, SAPH is expected to con-
tinue to process its rubber in this form and the estimations of processing costs
and the cost of future factory construction have been based on this assumption.
Over 90% of SAPH's present production is exported, mainly to European countries
of which France is the main importer taking about 55% of SAPH's production.
Exports are sold through EURONAT, a SIPH subsidiary, costing a 2.5% commission
on the CIF value, which includes guaranteed recovery of proceeds.
5.04      The value of the project's future output is calculated in Table 3
on the assumption that project production would be 100% exported. Project
output values are based on the forecasted CIF price for RSS1 with reductions
to allow for transportation costs. To allow for quality differentials from
RSS1 rubber, the reference price for smallholder output, which would be
collected as cup lump resulting in secondary grade rubber, has been adjusted
downwards by 3.6%. By contrast, production from the Songan estate, which
would be collected as latex, is expected to have a quality premium on RSS1
of 2%. These quality factors are based on calculations of average price
differentials obtained in the Ivory Coast for different natural rubber speci-
fications and upon the estimated average qualities of rubber that would be
produced under the project. Estimated future average prices - FOB Abidjan,
1977 constant terms - are CFAF 216/kg (US$0.40/lb) for estate production and
CFAF 204/kg (US$0.38/lb) for smallholder production.
Production
5.05      At peak production, yields of 2.1 and 1.5 tons for estate and
smallholders respectively are expected. The tapping life would be 30 years
for the estate and 25 years for smallholding rubber. It has been assumed
that fields would be opened for tapping in June/July of Year N+6 and yield
forecasts are for the fiscal year October 1 to September 30.
5.06      IRCA's trials at Bimbresso have demonstrated that GT 1 is capable
of yielding well over 2 tons/ha in controlled experiments; SAPH has recently
obtained over 2 tons in commercial plantings; and large scale trials in
Malaysia show that this clone is capable of sustained mature yields in excess
of 2 tons. The genetic potential of this now very popular clone is thus
established beyond doubt. It is felt that even under the less than optimal
climatic conditions anticipated at Songan, the yield estimates that have been
estimated are realistic.



- 24 -
5.07      Total production expected from the 3,5()0 ha of smallholdings and
2,000 ha of estate plantings is shown in Annex 1, Table 8. The peak of 9,450
tons represents an average of 1,718 kg per hectare which is maintained for
nine years, i.e. PY 19 to 27.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Traditional Farming Systems
6.01      Estimated net returns from the main crops grown in the project
area (para. 2.03) and returns on a per farm basis for three model farms which
are considered typical of this area are summarized in Annex 1, Table 9. Per
capita farm incomes vary from about CFAF 53,000 (US$240) to CFAF 92,000
(US$420). Returns per labor day worked are fairly uniform on a farm basis -
about CFAF 1,100 (US$5.00) per manday - but vary considerably by individual
crop. Crop returns per manday are relatively low for maize (CFAF 240; US$1.10)
and yams (CFAF 870; US$4.00) and are fairly high for the tree crops - coffee,
.cocoa and oil palm - and also for cassava (all within the range CFAF 1,200-
1,700; US$5-8). On a per hectare basis the situation is partially reversed
with the tree crops having lower returns per hectare than the food crops
(except maize). Plantains are highly remunerative both on a per hectare and
a manday basis - although a market outlet, and hence the area planted, is
limited.
6.02      There are labor constraints on production due to the seasonal nature
of agricultural activities during the year, with partially coinciding peak labor
demands for food crops such as yams and maize and also for cocoa and coffee.
Thus, only 55-80% of each farm model's estimated labor capacity is utilized.
While diversification of farm activities'reduces the labor peak problem -
for instance a higher proportion of annual labor capacity is utilized on the
more diversified farming systems (Annex 1, Table 9) - this problem would
remain with the current emphasis on cocoa, coffee and food crops.
6.03      Rubber cultivation, with its fairly even distribution of labor input
requirements throughout the year, is attractive in view of the seasonal labor
constraints in the traditional farming systems. Thus, it is estimated that
one or two hectares of rubber could be introduced to any of the three farm
models with very little displacement of the without-project farm activities.
It is therefore considered that the cost of such an adjustment - measured
in terms of net foregone real output per day worked on the rubber holding -
would be well under the estimated returns per labor day worked on the three
farms illustrated in Annex 1, Table 9. These returns are in the range of CFAF
1,000-1,200 (US$4-5). However, as an estimate of the opportunity cost of a
day's work on the rubber crop, a value of about CFAF 500/manday is judged
realistic. This is in accord with alternative indicators of the opportunity
cost of labor: (1) current daily wages paid by farmers for hired labor
typically range from CFAF 300 (plus board and lodging) for permanent labor, to
CFAF 1,000 for seasonal workers during peak periods of the agricultural year
and for 10-hour daily inputs (as opposed to the average of six hours per
manday assumed in the analysis of this report); and, (2) Government's minimum
rural wage is CFAF 300/manday, while net-of-tax estate wages paid by SAPH rise
to about CFAF 500 (plus provision of housing) per manday for skilled laborers.
Nevertheless, since the estimated opportunity cost of smallholder labor of
CFAF 500/manday is recognized as subject to error, it has been sensitivity
tested for alternative values in the financial and economic analysis.

Smallholder Returns from Rubber Production
6.04      The financial arrangements for smallholders described in paras 4.18-
4.21 would provide farmers with suitable remuneration and incentives while
providing Government with an adequate financial return (paras 6.09-6.12).
6.05      Net returns to the farmer from participation in the scheme would
pick up steadily after the six-year investment period. By the eighth year
after planting, returns would reach CFAF 1,100 (US$5.00) per manday and
CFAF 89,000 (US$400) per hectare, and returns would peak at CFAF 2,300
(US$10.50) per manday and CFAF 187,000 (US$850) per hectare by the seven-
teenth year. The evolution of net returns per manday and per hectare from
smallholder rubber cultivation is summarized in the table below (further
'details in Annex I, Table 7):

6.06      The financial rate of return to the smallholder's rubber enterprise
is estimated at 20%. Main factors affecting this return are farmgate price
or yield variations, and variations in the farmer's assessment of the value
of his labor iniput. Such influences are illustra.ted in the table below:

assumes that no credit is supplied for inputs or for cash advances and
that there are, accordingly, no credit repayments - and with an assumed
opportunity cost of the farmer's labor input of CFAF 500 per manday -
see para 6.03 on the economic valuation of labor.
2/   Yield changes would have minimal effect on labor and other input require-
ments and can be approximated by a change in sales revenues.
6.07      At crop maturity, smallholder net returns from rubber cultivation
would compare favorably with net returns per manday and per hectare from the
traditional farming system and would also be attractive in comparison to
returns from individual crops (para 6.01). While there is a long time period
before production begins, the labor requirements for maintenance during this
period are low (averaging only 28 days/year/ha during the five years after
planting) and the investment has a high financial rate of return. Further,
the farmer has the incentive of obtaining a defined ownership of a productive
asset.
6.08      The approximate effect on farm and per capita incomes from introduc-
ing rubber into the traditional farming system is illustrated in the following
table utilizing the farm models of Annex 1, Table 9. Per capita incomes
without the project range from US$240 to US$420. With the introduction of two
hectares of rubber, per capita incomes at crop maturity are increased to
between US$510-590 with the per capita income on the smallest farm being
doubled. Thus, with two hectares of rubber, the per capita incomes of project
participants at full development (1990) would be approximately half the
project's national average at that time. The introduction of larger areas of
rubber to the farm systems illustrated would probably require the hiring of
additional labor. Any such hirings would provide further employment opportuni-
ties to the known large numbers of relatively new settlers in the project area
who have not yet fully established their own fully self-supportive farming
operations.

/1   At peak output (Years 17-25), the net revenue per hectare from rubber is
US$849 which must: be decreased by an assumed redluced agricultural output
from the "without project" cropping system of US$184 (CFAF 500 per manday,
with 81 mandays per ha of rubber). Thus net incremental revenue resulting
from the addition of 1 hectare of rubber is US$849 less US$184 = US$665.
Financial Returns to Government
6.09      An illustrative Government Project Cash Flow is shown at Annex 1,
Table 4.  High investment costs in the early years result in a cumulative
deficit of CFAF 1,530 million (US$7.0 million) by PY 5; a further CFAF 3,638
million (US$16.5 million) would be required between l'Y 6 and PY 10 to bring
all plantings into production, resulting in a peak cumulative deficit of
CFAF 5,168 (US$23.5 million) in PY 11. However, there would be annual sur-
pluses as from PY 12 and all project costs would have been recovered by PY 16,
when the cash flow shows a cumulative surplus of CFAF. 637 (US$2.9 million).
Annual surpluses, from that year on, would progressively increase from CFAF
1,907 million (US$8.7 million) in PY 17 to CFAF 2,41Cr million (US$11.0 mil-
lion) in PY 19 when peak yields would have been reached in all plantations.

/1   Main assumptions are:  Costs include physical contingencies; benefits
and costs in constant 1977 terms; taxes are netted out of costs as they
are reimbursable to Governnent's account.  Inflows are from sales of
rubber and reimbursements of credit from smallholders. Outflows are
all project-induced costs including supplies of credit and payments
to farmers for purchases of rubber.
An overall reduction in benefits of 10% or a cost increase of 10% would reduce
the project's financial rate of return to about 7.5% which would still cover
debt servicing of project loans, although it would be lower than the oppor-
tunity cost of money in Ivory Coast estimated at about 10%. The highly sen-
sitive financial rate of return of the smallholder program is particularly
notable and is discussed below.
Financial Implications of Producer Pricing Policy
6.11      As described in para 6.10, Government's financial rate of return
from the project's smallholder component is at a marginal level - about 8% -
and is highly sensitive. Assuming that the interest rate of 9% to out-
growers receiving credit is predetermined for the project period, the key



- 30 -
variable under Government control is the price offered to the farmer. The
effects of varying the farmgate price, on the assumption that yields do not
change, are illustrated in Annex 1, Table 10. Also illustrated are the
influences upon the financial rate of return of a reduction in yields. Thus,
if a producer price of CFAF 120/kg was chosen instead of the recommended CFAF
130/kg, the financial rate of return to Government would rise, ceteris paribus,
from 7.8% to 9.5%. But, if farmers responded by reducing the regularity of
tapping, and yields fell by an average of, say, 10%, the financial rate of
return to Goverrment would fall back again to 8.7%.  Thus, a price-influenced
reduction in yields would oppose, and could even annul the impact of the pro-
ducer price reduction upon Government's financial rate of return. Further-
more, in parallel with this (Chapter VII), the project's economic rate of
return would alsco fall.  In view of the importance of achieving project yields
that would ensure satisfactory economic and financial rates of return for the
project, farmers must have adequate incentives to maintain and, in particular,
to tap their plantings on a regular basis. Under the proposed credit and
producer pricing arrangements (paras. 4.18 to 4.22) the incentives are judged
to be there (paras. 6.04 to 6.08). Nevertheless., it should be anticipated
that during seasonal labor peak periods, farmers might neglect their rubber
tapping in favor of other agricultural activities. While such an outcome has
been anticipated (partly for this reason, smallholder yields are estimated at
about 70% of the estate yields), farmgate prices should be kept under careful
review so as to maintain farmer incentives at appropriate levels and thereby
to minimize the possibility of irregular tapping.
6.12      Depending upon knowledge gained about producer price responsiveness
during project implementation, the recommended producer price of CFAF 130/kg
(constant 1977 ternms) could be adjusted appropriately. Downward adjustments
can be made by al;Lowing inflation to freeze real values; upward adjustments
by simply raising the price. It is recommended that all such adjustments
should be made in a gradual rather than a "sudden jump" manner so as ta mini-
mize farmers' uncertainties. Some early information on producer incentives
and price responsiveness is likely to be forthconling from the already underway
pilot smallholder scheme at Anguededou (paras. 1.12 and 7.09). Further
discussion and recommendations are found in para. 7.10.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      The proposed project would further Goverament's program of agricul-
tural diversification and of rural development in the southeast region and
would provide inaugural experience for Ivory Coast in smallholder rubber
production.
7.02      For the economy as a whole, increased rubber production would help
reduce the dominance of a few major industries in Ivory Coast's national
income and export base. At present three main corlmodities -- coffee, timber,
and cocoa - accounit for about 74% of Ivory Coast's exports. Ivory Coast is



- 31 -
seeking to diversify its production base and expansion of rubber production
is one element in Government's plans to achieve this. At peak project output
in 1995, about 9,500 tons of rubber would be produced by the project which
represents about half of Ivory Coast's present rubber production. The net
annual foreign exchange earnings from the project would be about CFAF 1,800
million or US$8.2 million (in 1977 terms).
7.03      For the southeast region, the introduction of rubber production
on a smallholder basis would allow diversification of the rural economy away
from the present major emphasis on cocoa and coffee. The smallholder develop-
ment during the project period of 3,500 ha is expected to involve about 1,000
farming families and for the larger farms would also create employment oppor-
tunities for the large number of recently settled families in the project area
who have not yet established fully viable farm units for themselves. Net in-
creases in farm incomes generated from project participation at crop maturity
are high, averaging about CFAF 146,665 (US$665) per hectare or CFAF 510 mil-
lion (US$2.3 million) in total, and can be expected to be distributed among
about 8,000 persons providing average increases in per capita incomes of
about CFAF 64,000 or US$290 for participating families. This would raise
the average per capita incomes of participating families from about US$300
to US$590, which is high by rural standards, slightly less than the current
national average of US$610 (para 1.03), and about half the expected national
average in 1990.
7.04      Economic rates of return have been calculated for each project com-
ponent separately and for the project as a whole. Economic cost and benefit
streams are shown in Annex 1, Tables 11 to 14. The following assumptions were
used in the analysis:
(i)  benefits and costs are expressed in constant mid-1977
prices net of identifiable taxes;
(ii) cost estimates include physical contingencies at the
levels specified in para 3.10;
(iii)  the project's rubber output is assumed 100% exported and
valued on the basis of forecasted world market prices
for rubber (paras 5.01 to 5.04) and production levels as
described in paras 5.05 to 5.07;
(iv) the exchange rate is taken at CFAF 245:US$ (para 7.05);
(v)  each component is assumed to have an investment life of
30 years;
(vi) the opportunity cost of labor is taken for all categories,
with the exception of smallholder labor to be represented
by the net of tax wage, and for smallholder labor is costed
at an estimated valuation of foregone output from other
rural activities of CFAF 500 per labor day worked on the
rubber plantings (para 7.05); and



- 32 -
(vii) transfer payments such as cash advances on credit and payments
to outgrowers for rubber purchases are not included.
7.05      The costing of labor is based on the premise that in Ivory Coast
there are no maior^ distortions in the wage market that would justify a depar-
ture from the valuations of labor reflected in net remuneration levels.
Managerial and skilled categories bear wages and associated benefits (e.g.
quality of housing) representative of the scarcilty of their qualifications.
For semi-skilled and unskilled manual laborers the same applies, and net
remunerations (inclusive of premiums on wages, quality of housing and social
infrastructure) also vary by location approximately reflecting the value of
alternative real income earning activities available to the laborers. For
instance, in the proposed project, labor for the Songan estate has been costed
in both the financial and economic analysis with premiums in excess of basic
rural wage levels to allow for the higher income--earning possibilities in the
project area than in the poorer sahelian regions of Ivory Coast. The valua-
tion of outgrower labor at CFAF 500 per labor day is based on the findings
of Chapter VI.  I. view of the absence of reliable information on the produc-
tivity levels of traditional farms with and without the project, the assump-
tion has been tested for sensitivity in the analysis. The exchange rate is
the one used by the Bank at the time of appraisal. and consistent with the
price projection in Table 3. Given the slight net protectionist impact of
Ivory Coast's present structure of import and export tariffs and subsidies, an
argument could be made for adjusting the CFAF's value downwards. The precise
magnitude of the downward shift that would be appropriate is under review.
While adjustments of this nature have not been done in the economic analysis,
the effect of using the previously accepted figure for the standard conversion
factor (0.83) has been estimated to be an improvement of about one percentage
point in the project's rates of return. The assumed project life of 30 years
corresponds to the estimated economic life of smallholder rubber investment
although estaté plantings are expected to remain viable for a further five
years. The rate of return has been tested for sensitivity to the assumed
life of the plantings.
7.06      Economic rate of return results are presented in Table 4.  The rate
of return for the whole project is estimated at 13.1% and for individual com-
ponents at: main .3,000 ha smallholder program, 15.5%; Songan estate, 10.9%;
500 ha smallholder program at Songan, 17.6%.  Rates of return are only moder-
ately sesnsitive to changes in costs or benefits, the whole project rate of
return falling to about 10% with a 20% increase in costs or decrease in bene-
fits and rising to about 16% with a 20% decrease in costs or increase in
benefits. Concerning analytical assumptions, an assumed investment life of
35 years raises the whole project rate of return to 13.5% and a choice of 25
years lowers the rate of return to 12.2%. Under two alternative assumptions
on the costing of smallholder labor of CFAF 300/manday and CFAF 700/manday
considered to encorapass the likely range of estimation error, the rate of
return on the main smallholder program becomes 17.4% and 13.7% respectively.
7.07      In order to test the likely economic impact of further rubber small-
holder development in the Ivory Coast, and to assess the economic viability



of the Songan nucleus-estate development in this wider context, an additional
exercise was undertaken assuming a further 3,000 ha development around Songan
after the project period. The 500 ha smallholder program at Songan was
assumed to be followed by a further smallholder development of 750 ha per
annum from PY 6 - 9. As with the 500 ha smallholder development starting
in PYs 4 and 5 at Songan, some initial establishment costs are avoided for
further smallholder developments following on from the inaugural 3,000 ha
development at Toupah, Bongo and Anguededou begun in PY 1. 1/ The rate of
return for a further 3,000 ha smallholder development at Songan is accordingly
slightly greater at 18.6% than the project-initiated development. In addition,
the opportunity cost of smallholder labor at Songan, although the value of
CFAF 500/manday has been retained in the analysis, is likely to be lower than
the opportunity cost around Abidjan as the value of alternative agricultural
activities is less with the greater distance from a large urban food market.
When combined (appropriately lagged) with the project-financed Songan estate
and 500 ha smallholder development, such a further 3,000 ha smallholder
development around Songan would raise the economic rate of return for the
entire Songan area development to 13.5%.
Risks
7.08      The project's economic viability is expected to be fairly resilient
to the main risks that could be associated with the project investments. Cost
and yield estimates are based on SAPH experience and costs include physical
contingencies. Further cost increases of 20% would reduce the project's rate
of return from 13.1% to 10.4%. A reduction in world prices of 15%, which
corresponds to the index of fluctuation of rubber prices based on a five-year
moving average, reduces the rate of return to 10.8%.
7.09      Delayed or incomplete project implementation is not considered to
be a major risk: the project executing agency, SAPH, is an established and
experienced corporation and the estate development rate, which would only
commence to be planted in PY 2 with 300 ha in that year, is fully within its
capabilities. For the smallholders, considerable interest exists among local
farmers--in an enquiry conducted in the Toupah and Anguededou areas in
November 1977, over 500 stated they wished to participate. This interest
has been stimulated by the initial success of the Anguededou scheme where
some farmers have already begun tapping and in which overall crop management
and tree growth is generally good.  The Anguededou scheme has provided SAPH
with valuable experience and the Anguededou farmers would provide a useful
demonstration of the potential benefits to be gained from participation. The
nucleus of an SAPH smallholder management unit, including both senior staff
positions, is already in place and the field staffing of the smallholder
extension service has been deliberately planned to provide a thorough farmer
coverage.
1/   For instance some economies of scale on management staff and central
facilities such as the training center. Account has, however, been
taken of higher costs of transport from factory to port at Songan.



-34 -
7.10      A potential risk that could affect the smallholder program relates
to the standard of crop husbandry and the future levels of the farmgate price
offered the smallholder. Maintenance of attractice producer prices is consid-
ered crucial to the regularity of smallholder tapping and hence of yields.
Yield reductions of 20% would reduce the economic rate of return of the main
smallholder program from 15.5% to about 12.2%, and would also have a dele-
terious impact on the smallholder program's financial rate of return (paras
6.10-6.12). While the choice of harvesting technique--cup lump, tapped twice
weekly--minimizes outgrower labor demands, incomplete tapping is a character-
istic property of traditional rubber cultivation by smallholders in the Far
East and should be considered a potential problem in the proposed project.
Three steps are considered necessary to counteriact such a possibility.
Firstly, the contract between the smallholder and the project-executing and
credit-providing agencies should contain clauses stipulating crop husbandry
and exploitation in accordance with high manageulent standards. Secondly, the
smallholder extension service should continue aifter the project period to be
staffed at levels adequate for thorough supervision. Thirdly, producer prices
should be carefully monitored in order to maintain adequate incentives for
tapping. Assurances and appropriate arrangements on all three of the above
matters were obtained during negotiations.

1/ Based on data supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, a survey conducted by SAPE staff of potential project
participants in the Anguededou and Toupah areas and appraisal estimates. Accurate data on farm sizes, cropping
systems and rural incomes in the project area are limited and these estimates should be recognized as indicative
only.
2/ Yields are based on estimated traditional sector yields vith the exception of oil palm which is based on estimated yields of
smallholders under the SODEPALM Project. Pure crops stands are assumed. Coffee and cocoa yields are taken at peak crop
production. Prices for coffee, cocoa and oil palm ffb are official Government prices. For foodcrops, prices are estimated
at veighted average farmgate sale revenues. These vary considerably throughout theyear depending primarily upon foodcrop
supply conditions in the local market.
3/ Assumed foodcrop mix is as follows:
