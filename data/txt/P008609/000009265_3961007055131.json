implementation cost of the Debt and Debt Service Reduction\n            Program. The program is in the form of a) release of the\n            Set-Asides from three existing adjustment operations; b) a\n            stand-alone debt and debt service reduction loan; and c) a\n            partial waiver of the negative pledge clauses in the loan\n            and guarantee agreements. This will eliminate a source of\n            business uncertainty, and will contribute to increasing its\n            productive potential and its medium- and long-term rate of\n            growth. The main concern is presented by the greater\n            inflexibility of the resulting debt structure after the\n            execution of the DDSR, which could endanger repayments if\n            the economic condition deteriorated. This risk would be\n            compounded by slippage on the economic policy front."}, "docdt": "1994-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
