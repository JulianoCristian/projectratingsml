The three\n            projects covered by this audit report comprise the entire\n            International Development Association (IDA)/Bank assistance\n            to Bolivian agriculture in general and rural development in\n            particular, between 1976 and 1987. In the mid-1970s, the\n            Government's strategy for agriculture and rural\n            development emphasized the reduction of the country's\n            dependence on imported foodstuffs and the alleviation of\n            acute poverty and underemployment in Bolivia's\n            highlands, the Altiplano. For the latter objective, public\n            agricultural investment was directed towards integrated\n            rural development projects to provide basic social services\n            to increase the productivity of subsistence agriculture. The\n            Ingavi Project was the first example in Bolivia of such an\n            integrated approach and was followed, relatively quickly, by\n            the Ulla Ulla and OmAsuyos-Los Andes projects as development\n            models for the region of the Altiplano and the adjoining\n            intermediate valleys. Earlier IDA assistance to Bolivia\n            included two simple agricultural credit projects for\n            commercial beef development in the tropical lowlands and\n            another two credit operations (1971-1980) in support of\n            small-scale farmers in the Altiplano. This projects aimed at\n            increasing crop or livestock production and beneficiary\n            incomes by forming farmer groups to facilitate delivery of\n            services (technical assistance and credit), and providing\n            social infrastructure on a province-wide basis in\n            Bolivia's Altiplano."}, "docdt": "1988-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
