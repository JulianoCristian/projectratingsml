The\n            reallocation is necessary to shift proceeds of the loan\n            across categories of expenditure as presented in detail in\n            table no. 1. The reallocation will shift US$400,000 from the\n            unallocated category of Expenditures to part C.1 of the\n            project in order to adequately finance the justice services\n            map implemented under the Ministry of Justice and Law. The\n            justice services map allows citizens to access, via the web,\n            a directory of geo-referenced judicial institutions in order\n            to locate the closest institution to initiate the procedures\n            required to enforce users' rights. In order to improve\n            the usefulness of the justice services map, by making the\n            system's information more user-friendly and ensuring\n            that the information contained therein is current and\n            addresses the different queries of citizenship, it is\n            necessary to carry out a process of updating the\n            portal's information system (legal and contact), as\n            well as its graphic design to align it with the image of the\n            Ministry of Justice and Law and the provisions of the\n            'online government'. The goal of this initiative\n            is to diminish the delay in the resolution of certain types\n            of cases, such as, debt cases where there is no opposition\n            of the debtor and the plaintiff is a bank or other financial\n            corporation. The reallocated amounts will also be used for\n            initiatives related to the creation of the electronic file\n            ('e-file') in the labor, civil and family courts.\n            Due to their nature, these activities will require a\n            considerable investment in technological equipment to allow\n            the judicial branch to improve the organization of their\n            archives by improving the search process of files, as well\n            as to significantly reduce the space required for archiving\n            facilities. Finally, a minimal amount of the resources\n            reallocated to category one will be used to complete the\n            funding of other activities that are currently under execution."}, "docdt": "2013-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
