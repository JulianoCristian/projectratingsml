         The current inventory of the civil, family and labor courts in the six cities is of 547,963 cases, reducing the number of
         cases in nearly 1,086,000. This important reduction was due to the measures promoted by the Project and the
         application of lapsing (perencion) and desist (desistimiento) tools of the new code.

         638 cases per judge), the rest of the cities clearly exceeded the proposed target (Barranquilla, 741; Bucaramanga,

         The decentralized units have already been adapted. The number of users attended was not measured. However, it is
         important to notice that the decentralized units are available for the whole population in the particular locations where
         the centers are. The potential population, according to local census carried out by local governments, in Barranquilla is
         270,000 habitants; in Bogota, 567,861; in Bucaramanga, 350,000; in Cali, 700,000; in Cartagena, 90,000; and in
         Medellin, 1,500,000.

               The management model had to be adapted to the new General Judicial Process Code. Up to date, the model has
               been implemented in all the labor courts in Barranquilla, Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cali and Medellin (102
               courts). After the new code came into force, the model began being applied in all labor courts in the country. The work
               developed in the six initial cities will be useful for the whole country.

               Justice Services Map has been updated. The map includes the justice service offer in the whole country, not only regarding jurisdictional
               offer but also alternative dispute resolution methods.
               The map has been updated five times and it allows users to identify clearly where they should attend to solve its dispute, according to the
               controversy they are facing. In this sense, this has been an important tool for potential justice services users that facilitates effective access
               to justice.
               Since its implementation, in December 17, 2013, until September 2014 the map had been consulted or used by 250.911 users.

               Comments
               55 mediation centers have been certified, and the Project has also supported other 30 centers. The support to the other mediation centers
               consisted of the presentation of good practices to improve performance in these centers.
               This additional support is importantbecause the centers must be certified to officially operate and was an initial step to unify procedures,
               generating trust and equal attention in all centers.
