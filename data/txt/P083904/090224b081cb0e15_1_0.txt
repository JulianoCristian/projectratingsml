                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of June 1, 2013, the Project has successfully completed the timely implementation of activities scheduled under the AOP for CY12, while continuing the implementation of
                         activities scheduled for CY13. The Project’s Procurement Plan and AOP for CY13 have been approved by the Judicial Branch with the inclusion of a series of initiatives that

                         of ICT equipment for selected courts, and the implementation of an Action Plan to support the implementation of the New Procedural Code (Código General del Proceso). Project
