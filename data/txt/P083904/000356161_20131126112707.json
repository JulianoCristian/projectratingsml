This\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of an extension to\n            the loan's closing date for a period of six months. The\n            new loan closing date will be June 30, 2014. Another reason\n            supporting the need for closing date extension is the entry\n            into force of a new regulation, the Codigo General del\n            Proceso (CGP), (New Procedural Code). The CGP is focused on\n            implementing the oral system in the resolution of civil cases."}, "docdt": "2013-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
