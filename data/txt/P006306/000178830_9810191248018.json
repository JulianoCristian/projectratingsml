It includes the connection of about\n            35,000 new low-income urban consumers. CEEE's overall\n            program, of which the project forms a part, will provide the\n            facilities required to serve the expected loads in\n            CEEE's service area, mostly related to industrial\n            growth. The program will also make public service\n            electricity available to about 12 new rural consumers. The\n            project includes the following: construction of about 90\n            circuit-km of subtransmission lines at 138 kV, and about 550\n            circuit-km at 69 kV, and installation of about 1,000 MVA of\n            additional transformer capacity; construction of about 800\n            circuit-km of distribution lines at 23 kV and 13.8 kV, about\n            6,000 circuit-km of low voltage lines, and installation of\n            about 300 MVA of additional transformer capacity and about\n            580,000 meters, for the connection of about 325,000 new\n            consumers; study on conversion of rice irrigation pumping\n            throughout the State of Rio Grande do Sul from direct diesel\n            drive to electric drive; and about 300 man-months of\n            consultants' services for a program to improve\n            CEEE's operations."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
