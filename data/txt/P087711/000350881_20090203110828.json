          efficiency of the water supply and sewerage systems of State\n            Water Company of Espirito Santo (CESAN) by supporting its\n            efforts to operate on a commercial basis with financial\n            self-sufficiency; and (b) to increase the coverage level of\n            CESAN water supply and basic sanitation services in the\n            urban areas of the municipalities of the metropolitan region\n            of Grande Vitoria. The additional costs of building the\n            water and sewerage works have resulted from design changes\n            brought about by updated and more detailed engineering\n            analyses, particularly: (a) the adoption of higher technical\n            standards to better satisfy environmental concerns\n            (including more rigorous implementation arrangements in\n            densely urbanized areas with intense traffic and the\n            building of sludge treatment units); (b) the introduction of\n            technology improvements; (c) a larger than estimated\n            population size in the cities targeted by the project; and\n            (d) bringing forward the third phase of the Mulemba sewage\n            treatment plant."}, "docdt": "2009-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
