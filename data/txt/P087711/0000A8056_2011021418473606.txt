                         The development objectives of this additional financing will be to meet the original objectives of Project Brazil - P006522 - Espirito Santo Water & Coastal
                         Pollution: 1. Improve the efficiency of the water supply and sewerage systems of the State Water Company of Espirito Santo (CESAN) by supporting its efforts
                         to operate on a commercial basis with financial self-sufficiency. 2. Increase the coverage level of CESAN's water supply and basic sanitation services in the
                         urban areas of Grande Vitoria, Guarapari, Castelo, Iuna, Sao Gabriel de Palha, Nova Venecia, Concepcao da Barra, and other towns located in the Santa Maria
                         and Jucu river basins. 3. Provide appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areas of Grande Vitoria and Guarapari. In addition,
                         additional financing will allow the project to meet its original objective of strengthening SEAMA and IEMA environmental management capacity.
