The agricultural sector\n            public expenditure program (PROAGRI) pioneered a sector-wide\n            approach to agricultural development, pooling donor support\n            to underpin a three-phase, 15-year development program with\n            a significant focus on policy and institutional actions. The\n            ministry of agriculture (MINAG) has been strengthened and\n            has moved from a focus on direct interventions to a focus on\n            regulation and facilitation, and from a top-down operational\n            style to a decentralized, client-focused one. Subsequent\n            phases of PROAGRI are expected to continue financing\n            MINAG's essential functions, with government gradually\n            assuming full responsibility for the recurrent costs over\n            the course of a 15- to 20-year period."}, "docdt": "2007-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
