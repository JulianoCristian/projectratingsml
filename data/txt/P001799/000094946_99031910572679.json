The program's components\n            are grouped into three subprograms: 1) the institutional\n            development will focus on an analysis of the structure of\n            the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP), its\n            decision-making, and restructuring. Included is an\n            assessment of its human resources, in accordance with the\n            civil service reform. Strengthening MPA, at both the central\n            and provincial levels, will improve its management,\n            monitoring and evaluation, among other areas. The\n            development of an agriculture information system is\n            included, as well as the potentiality for MAP to formulate\n            policy analysis; 2) the agricultural support services will\n            include agricultural research in farming systems'\n            technologies, increasing farmers participation, as well as\n            developing partnerships in extension services for production\n            intensification, further involving gender and environmental\n            issues. Legal and regulatory enforcement will support crop\n            and livestock production; and, 3) the natural resources\n            management will focus on the development of a conservation\n            program for forestry and wildlife management. Thus, support\n            for land management and irrigation development will be provided."}, "docdt": "1999-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
