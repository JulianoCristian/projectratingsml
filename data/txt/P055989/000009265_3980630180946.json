     Support Operation Credit Project is to support the\n            completion of an important phase in the Ghanaian reform\n            program. In particular, it recognizes the significant recent\n            progress made in restoring macroeconomic stability. The\n            Credit Project also seeks to support the Government's\n            efforts to lay the foundations for the next phase of\n            difficult and complex reforms in the areas of public sector\n            reform, public expenditure management, privatization, and\n            the energy and cocoa areas. The Credit Project will help\n            cover the external financing requirements of Ghana in the\n            context of a vulnerable external position and low level of\n            external resources. The components include: (a) promotion of\n            the private sector; (b) Accelerated Divestiture Program\n            (ADP); (c) human development and poverty reduction; (d)\n            public service reforms; (e) privatization, of the\n            Electricity Company of Ghana and the Produce Buying Company;\n            and (f) re-organization of the functions and procedures of\n            the Office of the President and The Cabinet Secretariat."}, "docdt": "1998-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
