development of IBY as an effective development finance\n            company (DFC) with the institutional capability for making\n            sound investment decisions to promote and implement viable\n            industrial ventures consistent with YAR's economic\n            development plans and priorities. The project would enable\n            IBY to play the pivotal role envisioned for it by the\n            Government in the development of YAR's nascent\n            industrial sector. It would provide IBY with: (i) funds to\n            meet about half of its resource requirements from 1981-1983;\n            and (ii) technical assistance for institution building. In\n            addition, the project would also provide for the\n            strengthening of the capability of the Government's\n            Department of Industry to prepare the Government's\n            plans, policies and priorities for the industrial sector.\n            The project faces no special risks, and measures to be taken\n            during project implementation will ensure that the risks\n            involved are minimized to the fullest extent possible."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
