Development Program (NHDP) Project for Guinea-Bissau were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  Focused\n            activities and a flexible implementation design can improve\n            service delivery in a fragile post-conflict context. The\n            NHDP contributed to a positive trend in service delivery\n            indicators with the bed-net and vaccination outcomes\n            standing out. This was achieved by a focus on priority areas\n            which helped overcome the weaknesses in sector and country\n            context and by a flexible, annual work-plan approach which\n            helped adapt NHDP activities to changing needs. Effective\n            action at the community level requires concurrent\n            strengthening of the government system. The Bamako\n            Initiative was rapidly scaled up after the war, with Bank\n            support, as a means to improve sector financing. Failure to\n            link financing for this with improvements in Ministry of\n            Public Health (MOPH) capacity was a major oversight as the\n            MOPH was unable to guide, supervise, and control the system.\n            A stronger MOPH is needed to ensure that community-based\n            actions work correctly and equitably. The major external\n            assistance programs available to health should incorporate\n            systems strengthening measures. Large-scale programs with a\n            relatively vertical focus frequently do not address systems\n            issues explicitly despite depending on a strong and reliable\n            delivery system. The Bank could assist with this in\n            Guinea-Bissau (and elsewhere) through partnership arrangements."}, "docdt": "2008-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
