The\n            project components are four. The first provides basic\n            minimum packages of cost-effective integrated preventive and\n            curative health services in health centers and secondary\n            health care in the regional hospitals; and rehabilitates,\n            constructs, equips, and furnishes health centers and\n            regional hospitals. The second component strengthens\n            institutional capacity at the central, regional, and local\n            levels by financing operating costs and technical assistance\n            for financial management, equipment and furniture.\n            Professional managers will be trained, and an information\n            system will be established to monitor the program. This\n            component also assists community management and financing,\n            uses a monitoring system, adopts a legal and regulatory\n            framework for private sector participation, and introduces a\n            service delivery system. The third component improves human\n            resources management at both the central and regional levels\n            by financing consultants and graduate medical training and\n            improving motivation and working conditions. Component four\n            focuses on activities to improve hygiene, to space births,\n            and to prevent STDs/AIDS."}, "docdt": "1997-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
