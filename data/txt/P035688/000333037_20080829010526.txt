F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the National Health Development Program (NHDP) is to improve
the health status of the population, particularly women and children, through strengthening
the national public health system, service delivery, management structures and processes.
Specific objectives are (i) to increase the use and effective coverage of primary health care
services and referral centers; (ii) to strengthen the institutional capacity at all levels; (iii) to
improve the quality and the management of human resources; and (iv) to reinforce
                                                                                                  v

intersectoral coordination and action in health-related activities in order to promote better
health among the population.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
A supplemental credit has been approved by the Board on December 16, 2004. The PDOs of
the original credit remain relevant. However, the original indicators have been formally
revised to reflect the revised and more realistic targets according to the new closing date of
December 31, 2006. New indicators have been introduced to monitor (a) the vaccination rate
against key communicable diseases of childhood under the Expanded Program of
Immunization (EPI); and (b) the utilization of Impregnated Bed Nets by children and
pregnant women.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. Country context. The National Health Development Program (NHDP) was appraised in
1997. Then, as now, Guinea-Bissau was one of the least developed countries in sub-Saharan
Africa. Poverty was high, estimated at 49% in the 1994 Poverty Assessment, and concentrated in
rural areas where 85% of the poor lived. Institutional capacity was remarkably fragile: the
government paid wages with significant delays; civil servants lacked training, skills, and
motivating conditions; reliance on technical assistance was high; and political indecision was a
concern to development partners. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society, and
the private sector were limited in scope and effectiveness, and largely concentrated in Bissau.
Government spending had long prioritized defense and foreign relations at the expense of the
social sectors, with the 1996 Public Expenditure Review (PER) finding government expenditure
on health and education just over 50% of the sub-Saharan average.

2. Sector context. Unsurprisingly, Guinea-Bissau's health sector at the time of appraisal
underperformed in almost all areas. Outcomes were poor: at 138 deaths per 1,000 live births,
infant mortality exceeded the regional average (92 per 1,000) and child mortality was high (240
per 1,000). Maternal mortality was also a concern, with an estimated mortality ratio 700 per
100.000 live births). Malaria, posting high rates even compared with neighboring countries, was
the leading cause of death in children; diarrheal disease ranked second. HIV also appeared to be
on the rise with HIV-1 prevalence estimated at over 2% and HIV-2 prevalence at 5% in
serosurveillance in Bissau's main maternity service.

3. Health service performance and quality were similarly lackluster. According to the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), only 30% of one-year olds were fully immunized; contraception use
was low, particularly in rural areas (around 1%); and health infrastructure and equipment were
old and largely in disrepair. The health workforce suffered from the problems common to
Guinea-Bissau's civil service, compounded by isolated and difficult conditions in field posts.
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) itself had recurrent operating budget shortfalls and
difficulties maintaining appropriate staff in key posts, all contributing to a history of slow
implementation of even priority policy initiatives such as cost recovery. Donor support to the
sector was significant but also fragmented in technical focus and funding mechanisms.

4. Rationale for Bank assistance. The social sectors, including health, were a priority for the
Bank's assistance to Guinea-Bissau at the time, with the third pillar of the 1997 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) emphasizing linking efforts to improve health outcomes with poverty
reduction. One reason for supporting the sector through the NHDP was the need to continue
activities started under three other projects which included the sector. Another reason was the
need to increase sector resources, aiming to use IDA funds as last-resort financing to the
government of Guinea-Bissau's (GoGB) first health-sector plan (Plano Nacional do
Desenvolvimento Sanitário (PNDS)) finalized in 1997. The third argument for Bank assistance
was to support the MOPH and donors in planning and coordinating activities through a
programmatic approach, the Bank being well placed to integrate sector activities into the overall
country strategy through analytical work and engagement with other levels of government.



                                                                                             11

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5. The overall objective of the NHDP was to improve the health status of the population,
particularly women and children, through strengthening the national health system, service
delivery, management structures and processes. Specific objectives were (i) to increase the use
and effective coverage of primary health care services and referral centers; (ii) to strengthen the
institutional capacity at all levels; (iii) to improve the quality and the management of human
resources; and (iv) to reinforce intersectoral coordination and action in health-related activities in
order to promote better health among the population. The key indicators (addressed in detail in
section 3.2) covered high-level mortality, morbidity, and fertility impact, performance of
immunization and obstetric services, availability of minimum primary care services, and
government performance in terms of budget allocation and salary payments.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
6. The PDO and specific objectives were not revised during implementation as they were
considered still to be appropriate after a review of the sector's needs following the 1998-1999
civil conflict. However, the supplemental Credit, approved by the Board on December 16, 2004,
introduced new indicators to monitor (i) the vaccination rate against key communicable diseases
of childhood and (ii) the utilization of impregnated bed nets by children and pregnant women. It
also deleted the indicators for mortality, morbidity, fertility, government budget allocation, and
primary care service availability. The stated rationale was to reflect revised targets according to
the new closing date for the NHDP of December 31, 2006.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
7. The primary target groups identified were women, children, and the poorer segments of
Guinea-Bissau's population. The NHDP aimed to reach these groups through support to primary
health care facilities and the health workforce, community health-care financing, and population-
based health promotion on the assumption that the poor, women, and children particularly
benefit from basic medical and preventive services. Although not explicit in the PAD, two
secondary beneficiary groups can be identified: (i) the MOPH as an institution, from capacity
building at the central and peripheral levels, and (ii) health-care staff from better human resource
management with a focus on timely payment of salaries, better working conditions, and
satisfactory career path development.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
8. The NHDP included four components which paralleled the design of the government's
PNDS. The PAD identifies activities within each component only for the first two years of
implementation, consistent with the approach of using IDA as last-resort financing after
commitment of government and donor funds for each annual action plan. This section therefore
summarizes the aim of each component as laid out in the PNDS and then identifies the focus
areas for which NHDP financing was initially planned.             Costs are totals for the PNDS;
component costs for the NHDP were not estimated separately.

9. Component 1: Utilization and coverage of primary health care centers and referral
centers (total cost $37.5 million). This component aimed to develop health services at the
primary and referral levels which provided quality, comprehensive, and integrated health care
with a focus on rural areas. The first subcomponent, Physical coverage of health facilities,


                                                                                                   12

aimed to improve health center and hospital infrastructure and equipment; the second
subcomponent, Availability of a minimum package of care, aimed to reinforce delivery of the
service package through strengthened outreach and drug supply. The component also aimed to
improve quality of care through integrated (multi-department) supervision.

10. NHDP support in the first two years was for health facilities and staff housing in three
regions (Bissau, Bafatá, Cacheu), the national start-up drug and contraceptive stock to support
community drug funds, and measures to standardize and rationalize prescribing.

11. Component 2: Strengthening of institutional capacity at all levels ($12.8 million). This
component aimed at improving the sector's organization and management capacity to make
resource use more efficient, equitable, and transparent. Its first subcomponent, Planning of
activities at all levels, focused on sector planning including data collection, analysis, and use in
management and policy. The second subcomponent, Administrative and financial management,
aimed to standardize financial management (FM) processes, establish an FM information system,
and build staff administrative capacity in the centre and regions. The third subcomponent,
Coordination of external assistance, was to establish a Directorate of External Aid Coordination
and a donor data base. The fourth subcomponent, Community management and financing,
supported implementation of community revolving drug funds; the fifth subcomponent, Assets
management, aimed to establish a preventive maintenance and repairs system for the sector; and
the sixth subcomponent, Legal framework for the health sector and private sector participation,
was to update the legislative framework for inspecting and monitoring health services, including
standards for private practice.

12. NHDP financing for the first two years was for supervision costs to support the sector's
planning process, technical assistance and operating costs to improve the FM system, support to
training and establishing the community committees, and technical assistance for the assets
management system and legal framework revision. The NHDP also planned to finance a
Program Manager and Accountant placed under the Directorate General of Public Health to
support line departments and the Directorate of Administration and Finance (DAF).

13. Component 3: Management and development of human resources ($12.6 million). This
component aimed to improve the quality, efficiency, and distribution of human resources by
strengthening personnel management and training. Its first subcomponent, Management of
human resources, planned to set up a human resource information system and revise personnel
management norms; the second subcomponent, Improvement of the motivation, working
conditions, and career prospects of health personnel, aimed to develop a career path structure
and introduce incentives for isolated postings; and the third subcomponent, Training of
personnel, was to train professional groups in short supply and develop a medium-term training
plan.

14. NHDP support was foreseen for the human resources management system, the revision of
career paths and incentive payments system, post-graduate training of medical doctors, and
overall supervision of training.

15. Component 4: Promotion of better health ($3.2 million). This component aimed to
improve intersectoral activities to promote better health with a focus on hygiene behaviors, birth
spacing, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. It planned to develop a

                                                                                                 13

strategy for health-related behavior change to be implemented through interpersonal (clinical)
communication and the mass media. Its main element was to be a coordination mechanism to
bring together the MOPH, the private sector, NGOs, and communities. The NHDP planned
support for knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys and social marketing of condoms.

1.6 Revised Components
16. The NHDP's components were not formally revised but the priority activities within them
evolved in response to the changing sector context, with a significant redefinition by the team at
the mid-term review (MTR) in April 2002 and, formally, under the supplemental Credit in
December 2004 (table 1). These changes responded to the impact of the civil conflict which
started three months after effectiveness and saw the destruction of key health infrastructure, a
reduction in government revenue, the departure of many donors from the sector, and skilled staff
emigrate to Portugal and neighboring countries.

                                                                   control.
                                                                  · Developed sector communications
                                                                   strategy.


1.7 Other significant changes
17. Supplemental Credit. A supplemental Credit of $4.0 million was approved by the Board on
December 16, 2004 to provide additional financing for the sector after the war, balance increased
unit costs for civil works, and offset the reduction in government counterpart funds required
under the original Credit as approved by the Board in August 2003.

18. Reallocations of proceeds. Reallocations were approved in February 2000, October 2002,
February 2005, and July 2007.

19. Extensions. Extensions to the original Credit were approved in June 2002(??), July 2003,
August 2004, and July 2006. The supplemental Credit was extended in July 2006.



                                                                                                        14

20. Project management. A national consultant health economist and procurement officer were
added to the Management Unit of the MOPH, the Célula de Gestão (CG), in 2004. The Guinea-
Bissau Executing Agency of Public Works and Employment Creation (AGEOPPE), the
government agency subcontracted for procurement, was replaced by a private firm in 2005

21. Co-financing. Donors suspended aid during the civil conflict and many did not return to the
health sector or reduced their support subsequently (see annex 1 for a sector financing summary).
The Government of the Netherlands provided co-financing through a Bank Trust Fund, closing
in December 2002. All other financing to the PNDS was parallel.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22. The NHDP was conceived as an "AIDS and health" operation with a project design and
relatively focused technical areas, but was revised in 1996 to become a sectoral program as
preparation of the PNDS advanced. This approach, and the preparation process more broadly,
showed several positive features:

23. Continuity with other projects and incorporation of lessons learned. The NHDP's technical
focus areas and activities continued or complemented the three other Bank projects involving the
sector (Population, Health and Nutrition Project (Credit 1800-GUB), Social and Infrastructure
Relief Project (Credit 2020-GUB, Credit 2020-1-GUB), Social Sector Project (Credit 24650-
GW), providing continuity in the Bank's engagement. It also incorporated the major lessons
emerging from these operations, particularly the appropriateness of a sector-program approach
and integration of project management within the MOPH as a means to strengthen its capacity.

24. Analytical work during preparation. NHDP preparation benefitted from technical assistance
financed by a PHRD grant of ¥34.3 million. PNDS preparation received support from the
Netherlands government, WHO, and other donors. This technical assistance covered the major
areas of concern: hospital planning, human resources policy (led by WHO), the national TB and
HIV programs, mother & child health, blood safety, and primary health care. The government
also developed a Health Map as the reference for facility and staffing decisions.

25. Government ownership and a participatory approach. Government ownership of the PNDS
was strong, with the Directors-General of the MOPH leading the preparation committee and
coordinating inputs of the numerous consultants working on technical areas. The MOPH also
led the donor round table in 1997 which was to define the financing plan. Preparation was
inclusive of the MOPH's different technical departments and donor partners.

26. Project design. The NHDP's specific objectives and components paralleled the PNDS's
design, improving understanding of the operation by counterparts, and its institutional design
followed the MOPH's departmental structure. Overall responsibility lay with the Directorate
General of Planning and Cooperation (DGPC) and fiduciary responsibility with the DAF. The
NHDP built in flexible financing through a large unallocated line, which became important
during implementation when the sector's needs changed. The clear identification of areas for



                                                                                              15

support, including three priority provinces, in the first two years was a potentially important aid
to early implementation.

27. Experienced government counterparts. The MOPH brought in a national consultant from
the Bank's Social Sector Project, then nearing closure, as the main counterpart in preparing the
PNDS and the NHDP. This person's experience with Bank procedures helped the MOPH to
understand the implementation and fiduciary design issues and improved overall coherence
between the NHDP and the PNDS.

28. Despite these positive elements of NHDP preparation and design, several areas could have
been strengthened:

29. Financing plan and commitment of donor funds. Only the World Bank and the AfDB
formally committed financing for the PNDS's five-year implementation period. Most other
donors were limited to verbal commitments during the 1997 round table. This clearly limited the
MOPH's ability to plan; interestingly, a lesson learned in the 1996 ICR for the Social and
Infrastructure Relief Project was the need for a financing plan guaranteed by donors prior to
Negotiations.

30. Risks and mitigation measures. The main risks identified at preparation related to the
government's management and technical capacity, donor coordination, and borrower
commitment. Although briefly acknowledging the need for reliable donor and government co-
financing, the PAD did not address these directly or propose mitigation measures. These were
particularly important given the informal nature of donor commitments and the fact that
government co-financing had been a problem in the Social Sector Project. Another major risk
not addressed in the PAD was that weak government capacity would lead to de facto
implementation through technical assistance, putting the NHDP's capacity-building objectives in
question. Finding the balance between consultant support and government ownership was a
challenge which an institutional assessment may have helped address.

31. Monitoring & evaluation. Monitoring & evaluation (M&E) design included high level
indicators which were both difficult to influence and to measure, did not have baseline or target
values for many indicators, and set ambitious targets for others (e.g. assisted delivery coverage
increase from 30% to 50% over 5 years).          Further, the NHDP's planned support to M&E
capacity, which focused on operational costs and some training, was modest compared with the
significant needs to follow the results framework for the sector effectively.

2.2 Implementation
32. A civil war broke out in Guinea-Bissau three months after NHDP effectiveness. Lasting 18
months, it saw the destruction of considerable health infrastructure, primarily in Bissau; the
emigration of skilled health staff (exact numbers not known); and a fall in sector financing
through reduced government revenue and the departure of donors.              The Bank suspended
disbursements from June 1998 until May 1999.             Essentially all implementation therefore
occurred in the post-war period.




                                                                                                16

33. As shown by the NHDP's four extensions, implementation was difficult but had obvious
successes. To start with a review of factors which positively influenced NHDP performance
over this time:

34. Continuity of the CG. The CG had the same national consultants, almost all with prior Bank
experience, for most of its life. The Project Manager, Accountant, and, later, Procurement
Officer ensured correct operation of the NHDP despite the major gaps in MOPH capacity. They
also contributed some institutional memory about the PNDS and donors' engagements during
frequent changes of political leadership.

35. Mid-term review, QER, and follow up. A well prepared MTR in April 2002 helped refocus
the project. With a new Task Team Leader (TTL) in the lead-up to the MTR, the team
downgraded the ISR ratings to unsatisfactory, encouraged an external review of the NHDP for
the government, and arranged a QER which suggested refocusing and simplifying activities.
Following the MTR, a Dakar-based member undertook interim missions to help implementation.

36. Flexibility in Bank procedures. The Bank responded to the changed fiscal context after the
war by removing government co-financing requirements in February 2000, increasing the
procurement thresholds for national competitive bidding and international shopping in
September 2002, and approving the four extensions to the original Credit. These helped to
reduce fiduciary and co-financing related implementation delays.

37. Flexibility in using NHDP proceeds and approval of the Supplemental Credit. The flexible
Credit allocation mechanism allowed the NHDP to finance the new warehouse for the Central
Drugs Procurement Agency (CECOME) and to co-finance the national TB reference hospital,
both bombed during the war. The Bank agreed to an unplanned partnership with a large
international NGO in the rehabilitation of the TB hospital and accepted significant financing of
operational costs ($1.65 million). The Bank also provided additional financing through the
supplemental Credit on the grounds that additional resources were needed to achieve the PDO,
given increased sector needs and unit costs after the conflict.

38. Netherlands grant financing. In April 2001, the Government of the Netherlands made 2.5
million available to the NHDP as a Bank-administered trust fund. This helped increase sector
resources after the civil war and partly offset the reduction in financing planned at the time of
PNDS preparation.

39. Recent increase in donor financing. Immediately following the war, the World Bank and
the African Development Bank (AfDB) were the main financiers for the health sector. Since
2004, new donors--the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization Alliance (GAVI) and
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)--have made major
financial contributions to the vaccination program and malaria and HIV programs respectively;
the Bank's MAP project, started in 2004, has also contributed to HIV activities.

40.   However, many factors impacted negatively on the NHDP's performance during
implementation:

41. Political instability in sector leadership. Political instability during and after the war
undermined the sector vision laid out in the PNDS, with ten changes of Minister of Health during

                                                                                              17

implementation and consequent changes in key civil service positions including the Directors-
General and the DAF.

42. Failure to appoint key counterpart staff. Despite requests during supervision missions, key
positions--particularly the directorships of the DAF and the Department of Hygiene and
Epidemiology (DHE), two target departments for the NHDP--were not filled by individuals with
adequate experience and capacity. This prevented transfer of skills and systems reforms planned
under the NHDP.

43. Low sector capacity and staff motivation. MOPH capacity was very low in terms of staff
skills and numbers; persistently late salary payments further undermined staff motivation. This
low capacity shifted responsibility for implementation to the NHDP-funded consultants in the
CG, with the PNDS becoming synonymous with the World Bank for some years. Low capacity
in the AGEOPPE, the government agency contracted for civil-works procurement, also delayed
civil works until its replacement in 2006.

44. Slowness in key government processes. The government has taken over 18 months to put 69
nurses trained with NHDP financing on the pay-roll, creating dissent amongst staff and delayed
strengthening primary health care services.

45. Unrealistic Bank supervision in the immediate post-war period. Despite documenting
serious difficulties, the Bank team rated the NHDP as Satisfactory from early 2000 to October
2001 and so failed to bring the operation to management's attention and contributed to slowness
in refocusing the NHDP's activities. However, ongoing political instability and difficult country
conditions, such as delayed reopening of the private bank which held the Special Account, made
this a difficult period.

46. Large shortfall in sector financing. MOPH data show a 55% shortfall of (nominal) sector
financing against the estimates for the PNDS at preparation (annex 1) largely owing to a
reduction in donor assistance. Recurrent suspensions of the AfDB Credit because of failure to
pay arrears or provide co-financing compounded this. Finally, Guinea-Bissau received only
interim debt relief, in the form of discounted debt service, owing to difficulties meeting the HIPC
targets: a significant flow-through of these resources to the health sector is not evident.

47. Deteriorating macrofiscal conditions. Guinea-Bissau's difficult macro situation made the
health sector dependent on donor financing for all investment and non-salary recurrent
expenditures. This meant that the government could not continue activities supported by the
NHDP, such as integrated supervision missions which staff reported as useful but undermined by
the lack of financing to implement recommendations.

48. Lack of a donor coordination mechanism. Meetings, chaired by the Minister of Health or
delegate, and attended by representatives of the Management Committee (Comité de Gestão) of
the MOPH and of donors involved in the sector have taken place since October 2006. However,
no formal health-sector donor coordination mechanism exists although the need for one was
recognized in the NHDP design. The CG developed this role de facto for the World Bank and
the AfDB but most donors continued to work in a relatively parallel way. This was a lost
opportunity to improve efficiency through collaboration in the sector.


                                                                                                 18

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49. Design. The NHDP's original M&E framework was not well adapted to tracking progress
towards the PDO.       Although common at the time, its PDO indicators were impact level
(mortality and morbidity, fertility) and so neither readily measurable nor attributable. Output
indicators had similar limitations, being difficult to measure regularly and accurately (% of
patients successfully treated against malaria). Few baseline and target values were included and
targets, when included, tended to be ambitious. In contrast, the Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) revised by the supplemental Credit focused on fewer, lower-level outcomes to which the
NHDP could reasonably contribute. It also ensured baseline values for all indicators and revised
the realism of some targets. However, some indicators were difficult to influence in a short
period of time (% of births attended by trained midwives); many targets were unrealistically high
(% of fully vaccinated children, which was increased at the supplemental); many indicators
double counted the same programs (6 of the 11 were for vaccination, 2 for malaria); and
capacity-building efforts to improve M&E performance were not meaningfully revised.

50. Implementation. Aide-mémoires show little attention to tracking indicators until the MTR,
limited by the effort and financing needed to collect the original indicator set and the theft of the
health information system data-base during the war. Data were not available for most indicators
at the MTR but the team did link indicators with activities to help prioritize interventions.
Contracting a national NGO in 2006 to provide the KPIs from their own population cohorts, in
theory in collaboration with the DHE, significantly improved the quality of data collection. The
NHDP also co-financed the MICS 2006 with UNICEF but methodological issues limited its
usefulness.

51. Utilization. Since the M&E framework was not followed in the project's early years, it
could not be used in NHDP decisions. As noted, the MTR used the KPIs to focus the NHDP's
activities and link resources with expected outcomes. Once the KPIs were revised and regular
data became available through the contracted NGO, the M&E framework was mainstreamed into
NHDP management. The Bank team used progress towards indicators to prioritize activities,
with an emphasis on obstetric care and vaccination coverage in the final two years. This
emphasis on results against the NHDP's M&E framework probably contributed to the MOPH's
recent use of indicators in its own assessment of sector performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
52. Safeguards. The NHDP was rated as an environmental category C on the grounds that
planned civil works were small scale without population displacement and that improved
hygiene in health facilities would have a positive environmental impact. The C rating remained
at the Supplemental Credit, noting no safeguards concerns from the major unplanned civil works
for the CECOME warehouse and the environmentally acceptable products to be used in bed net
impregnation. A health-care waste management plan was completed under the MAP.

53. Financial management. The FM system in place within the CG met Bank requirements,
with the notable exception that FM Reports were not sent to the Bank on a regular basis. Audit
opinions were unqualified over the duration of the NHDP. However, the computerized FM
system was not adapted to the MOPH's needs, with reports being compiled manually. Further,
the FM system as it evolved differed from the original design: lying entirely within the CG, it



                                                                                                  19

came to be isolated from the DAF, whose capacity it was designed to strengthen. The principal
accountant took on the DAF's role for most FM apart from salary payments.

54. Procurement. The procurement system within the CG also met Bank requirements. The
original design subcontracted procurement management for civil works to the AGEOPPE, an
AGETIP-type agency, to overcome gaps in procurement experience within the MOPH.
However, procurement delays led to, firstly, adding a local consultant procurement specialist,
who had previously provided punctual support from the Bank's Basic Education Project, to the
CG in 2004 and, secondly, to replacing the AGEOPPE, whose capacity was lower than
anticipated, with a private firm based in Dakar to handle civil works in 2005. These changes
improved the rapidity and quality of non-civil works procurement. However, as for FM, this
system also failed to improve the capacity of the MOPH as planned in the NHDP's design.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
55. At the time of the ICR, the MOPH was developing its PNDS-2 (2008-2013) which will
provide the framework for maintaining operation of the NHDP's investments. Technically, it
plans to maintain the core elements of the NHDP; institutionally, it plans an umbrella Public
Health Institute to regroup the DHE, the national laboratory, and the technical departments' data
functions. However, the PNDS-2 is at a relatively early stage, lacking operational, monitoring,
and cost details. Further, financing is unsecured. Apart from GAVI and the GFATM, few
donors have committed medium-term funding; in particular, systems- and financing-
strengthening measures are not yet funded (negotiations with the European Union and the West
African Health Organization for a maintenance project being a notable exception). The impact
of largely vertical programs may be affected by an environment where the systems-strengthening
financing is significantly reduced. Important capacity lies in the CG, which will be supported by
the AfDB for 2008 and may be taken on by the GFATM subsequently.

56. There are several possibilities for follow-on Bank support to help sustain the benefits of the
NHDP's investments. The gap in support for systems and financing reform is obvious: a focused
Bank operation in this area could leverage the more vertical financing available through GAVI
and the GFATM. Such an approach could also implement the recommendations of the NHDP-
funded PER and revised national human resources strategy. The MOPH's vision for a new
Public Health Institute could benefit from Bank support, linking improved health information
into the wider systems agenda. At the community level, additional support to the revolving drug
funds system would help address the gaps in management and supervision and improve
understanding of the equity impact of the current system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
57. The relevance of the NHDP is considered substantial.

58. The NHDP is highly relevant to Guinea-Bissau's development priorities as laid out in its
most recent policy documents, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2005 (PRSP) and the Public
Investment Program 2008 (PIP). The PRSP identifies strengthening the health sector as one of
the axes in the fight against poverty, emphasizing in particular the key elements of the NHDP:
primary health-care, outreach activities, human resource policy, and community health financing.


                                                                                               20

The PIP identifies social services, including health, as a priority area of action and underscores
the importance of basic infrastructure, including health centers, in public investment. At the
sectoral level, the implementation approach and technical interventions included in the NHDP
are consistent with the policy developed in the draft PNDS-2.

59.   Assessing the NHDP's relevance to the Bank's current strategy for Guinea-Bissau is
difficult as this has not been officially updated since 1997. With reference to the 1997 CAS, the
NHDP aligns with the third pillar which prioritizes social development and emphasizes the need
for closer donor coordination and increased engagement with communities. Similarly, the
NHDP fits with the recommendations of the 1997 PER to increase social sector resources so as
to improve service access, quality, and management.               The Bank's current approach
acknowledges that the health sector is a development priority for Guinea-Bissau in which other
donors are taking the lead financing role. For example, resources have increased significantly in
recent years largely through the GFATM and GAVI. Consequently, the current IDA lending
pipeline does not include direct health sector financing but rather looks to benefit the sector
indirectly through flow-on benefits from energy and infrastructure projects. Some direct sector
financing is being sought through the LICUS trust fund. This approach represents prioritization
of the constrained IDA envelope for Guinea-Bissau rather than a downgrading of the health
sector's relevance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
60. The achievement of the PDO is rated modest. The NHDP strengthened primary health care
facilities and contributed to improved vaccination and bed net coverage but made little
sustainable progress towards the systems-, management-, and capacity-building elements of the
PDO. Further, the impact of strengthened primary health care facilities on utilization cannot be
judged owing to under-reporting related to accounting for user-fee revenue.

61. Methods and reliability of data. Indicator data are taken from a population cohort
followed by a local health-research NGO contracted by the project. The research team's regular
visits to households may have artificially inflated these indicators, particularly in Bissau where
they promoted vaccination. However, some data for 2007 were collected early in the year and so
underestimate progress if performance improved over the 12 months.              Overall, these are
considered the best available estimates since collection was good quality, biases are likely to
balance out, and the figures are broadly consistent with the government's routine information.
The MICS 2006, the other potential data source, was not used as its data were now at least two
years old (and older for child mortality) and the quality of field work has been questioned. The
MICS report still had not been officially released at ICR preparation.

62. Achievement of indicators. The indicators are one tool in evaluating the NHDP, with
limitations noted above. The NHDP's achievements need to be measured against both the
outcome and intermediate outcome indicators in the original and the amended indicator set. With
regards to the outcome indicators (Annex 2), three of the original indicators cannot be assessed
as they are too high level and were not tracked. The three other outcome indicators show a clear
improvement but did not reach their targets:
    i. Percentage of assisted deliveries increased from 30 to 35% (target 40%);
    ii. Percentage of children less than one year old completely vaccinated increased from 35%
        to 62% (original target 75%, 2004 revised target 78%);


                                                                                               21

    iii. Timely payment of salaried increased from 80% to 93% (target 100%).

63. The first two indicator targets were ambitious since these indicators are known to be affected
by cultural and other factors beyond the health sector's sole influence. The third indicator is
calculated from the number of months paid for all of 2007 measured in January 2008 and is
therefore a major overestimate: it does not reflect the seriousness of the repeated delays in salary
payments, which continue to be a major issue for staff.

64. With regards to the intermediate outcome indicators, only two of the three original indicators
can be evaluated. These show:
    i. an improvement in the number of health zones meeting the minimum norms for personnel
         and equipment (90%) which exceeds its target (83%); but
    ii. a shortfall in the proportion of the government budget allocation to health (8.7% against a
         target of 11%).

65. Although these indicators were replaced in 2004 by others better adapted to measuring the
PDO, they suggest a strengthened primary health care system but without improvements in
government resource allocation to the health sector.

66. Progress against the indicators revised under the supplemental Credit is consistent with this
observation. To avoid double counting, these indicators can be collected into the groups of
vaccination (5 indicators), bed net promotion (2 indicators), and health information (1 indicator).
These show:
    i. a clear improvement in vaccine coverage, with almost all target values either achieved or
         exceeded except that for measles;
    ii. a clear improvement in the utilization of bed nets by children and pregnant women, where
         the target values have been significantly exceeded (81% against a 30% target for children,
         72% against 30% for pregnant women);
    iii. a stagnation in the completeness of the health information system (93%). Owing to a
         revision of the target in 2006, the final target value (90%) is lower than the baseline (96%
         in 1998) allowing this indicator both to deteriorate and also reach its target.

67. Overall, the vaccination and malaria indicators indicate strengthened preventive health care
performance linked to improved primary health care but the health information system indicator,
an indicator of capacity building and system performance, shows no improvement.

68. Achievement of each specific objective. As the indicators cannot cover all the NHDP's
interventions, a review of the achievement of each specific objective can provide additional
information. The four specific objectives correspond to the four components of the NHDP and
therefore also help assess the performance of each component.

69. Specific objective 1: increase the use and effective coverage of primary health-care services
and referral centers. Primary health care coverage was strengthened by the NHDP's investment
in infrastructure, staff housing, essential drugs supply, and staff training for peripheral postings.
The NHDP's direct contribution here is clear: it financed 57% of total primary health-care
facilities and 34% of new staff housing under the PNDS period and covered over a third of the
national essential drug supply in the post-war period. This is an important achievement, noting
the extreme difficulties facing the sector after the war.

                                                                                                   22

70. Specific objective 2: strengthen the institutional capacity at all levels. Institutional capacity
at the MOPH did not show any meaningful improvement during the NHDP. There is little
evidence of any skills transfer from the CG or the NHDP-financed consultants to their MOPH
counterparts.    The health information system and the FM system, in particular, were not
improved as planned. The few achievements in this area include the NHDP-supported PER, the
findings of which are feeding into the PNDS-2, and the establishment of the CECOME
warehouse and community drug-management committees. The CECOME is worth highlighting,
as NHDP support helped to establish it as an autonomous drug procurement agency which has
the potential to improve drug availability in the country.

71. Specific objective 3: improve the quality and management of human resources. The quality
(and number) of human resources improved during PNDS implementation in large part owing to
the NHDP's financing for midwives, nurses, and laboratory technicians. The MOPH recently
started to use a new human resources data base and finalized, just after NHDP closure, the new
human resources strategy co-financed with GAVI. The contribution of IDA resources here is
again important: the NHDP financed the training of 60% of new staff graduating during the
PNDS and NHDP-financed housing also increased staff availability in the periphery.

72.   Specific objective 4: reinforce intersectoral coordination and action in health-related
activities to promote better health among the population. Health promotion was successful in
promoting bed nets and condoms; a communications strategy was developed (with WHO, rather
than NHDP, consistent with the NHDP's "last resort" financing approach); and the MOPH did
establish approximately monthly meetings of its Management Committee to improve information
sharing and coordination between MOPH departments and donors. These positive elements
were nonetheless offset by the failure to set up an intersectoral coordination mechanism within
the MOPH, which was the aim of this specific objective. The NHDP did not succeed in
improving coordination between ministries and the engagement with the private sector was
fragile. The fragility of the NGO specialized in social marketing established with NHDP support
is evidence of this, noting that bed net promotion is better placed owing to UNICEF and
GFATM support.

73. Reaching target groups. Given its contribution to primary health-care services, the NHDP
probably reached its primary target groups of women and children--although the impact on
utilization is unknown--and it also partially improved working conditions for health sector staff,
one of its secondary target groups. However, the impact on the poor is not clear: better primary
care would normally benefit this group but the weakly supervised cost-recovery system may
have had an adverse impact.

74. Disconnect with last ISR ratings. The disconnect with the last ISR ratings is due to the
indicator data for end 2007 only becoming available in February 2008 at the time of the ICR
mission. The impression from the status of project indicators as of end June 2007 was a trend to
improvements in most indicators; however, these improvements ultimately were insufficient to
meet the M&E and end-of-project targets.




                                                                                                  23

3.3 Efficiency
75. Efficiency of the NHDP's investments is rated modest as its highest expenditures were on
generally cost-effective interventions in a very difficult sectoral context, despite concerns about
the opportunity costs of some specific activities.

76. The most important interventions financed by the NHDP were those usually considered to be
cost-effective in the health sector. These include the broad investments in primary health-care
services as well as in prevention activities through vaccination, bed net distribution, and condom
promotion. The Credit's expenditure on primary health care was high: 58% of the IDA Credits
and the Netherlands grant was used for the first component and 29% to the second component, in
large part to staff training. Another factor suggesting that cost-efficiency was good was the solid
procurement management in the NHDP, which should have assured low-price inputs.

77. The most important factor working to reduce efficiency is the low sustainability, and so low
total benefit value, of the NHDP's activities. It should, however, be noted that the NHDP did try
to mitigate this risk by supporting the sector's policy framework through the PER, a revised
human resources strategy, and PNDS-2 preparation; if financed, these could improve the life
expectancy of the NHDP's other investments. The other major efficiency concern is the co-
financing for the national TB referral hospital ($1.5 million), which used Credit resources to
subsidize a system which, although high quality, also is high cost for Guinea-Bissau's context.
The opportunity cost of this, for example in terms of health centers not built, is high.

78. The benefits brought by the NHDP need to be seen against the counter-factual of sectoral
collapse, which was the risk facing Guinea Bissau when the project relaunched implementation
in 1999. In the absence of other donors and falling government revenues, the NHDP become
"first line financing" and helped to prop up the health system (see figure, annex 1), maintain staff
in health services, and support the MOH's daily functioning by financing the CG consultant
team. Together with funding for the essential drug supply and operating costs, this support from
the NHDP is widely considered to have helped prevent further deterioration in the sector. A fair
estimation of the efficiency of the NHDP has to assess benefits against this very low base, rather
than the pre-war situation of 1998.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory.

79. With relevance rated substantial and achievement of PDO and efficiency rated modest, the
overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
80. The main poverty concerns are the potential negative impact of primary health-care user fees
expanded with NHDP support. There is no formal exemption system for indigent households;
individual health workers take this decision on an ad hoc basis, which is an approach known to
perform poorly in terms of targeting and leakage. There are also incentives to impose payments
on all patients, including the poor, because of health facilities' high dependence on user fees to
finance recurrent costs and, with weak supervision, the possibility of using user fee revenue to
supplement wages. Although there is no information on the cost of primary care to poor


                                                                                                 24

households, a study in Bissau reported relatively high user fee charges for pediatric hospital care.
The MOPH is aware of these concerns and intends to address them under the PNDS-2.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
81. Discussed above.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
82. None raised.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
83. Not undertaken.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

84. There are many risks to the NHDP's development outcome from within the sector, the
government, and externally and so the risk to development outcome is rated high.

85. Firstly, there is no maintenance system or budget for health facilities, putting the primary
health care outcomes--the NHDP's main achievements--at risk.               A field visit showed
degradation of health centers built only a few years previously. Secondly, maintaining primary
health-care staff is also at risk since the new human resources policy is yet to be implemented.
Thirdly, the community-based revolving drug funds are precarious, with high member turnover
and increasing regional debt to CECOME.           Fourthly, the sector's financial situation and
management capacity is fragile. Despite improvement in 2007, government revenue is unlikely
to cover the operating expenses financed by the NHDP and so activities needed to maintain
outcomes, such as supervision, are at risk of not continuing. External financing for the PNDS-2
is not yet available: in particular, as the major donors (GFATM, GAVI) focus on specific
programs, financing for health systems issues is not ensured. These vertical programs are also at
risk of underperforming since the health system is no longer supported (i.e. quality of services
provided by staff). The MOPH has plans to address the above technical issues and intends to use
the PNDS-2 launch to renew donor support. However, based on the situation at the time of ICR
preparation, there are major uncertainties facing the NHDP's benefits and mitigating
arrangements are not yet in place.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

86.   Overall, the Bank team prepared a well designed project in collaboration with the
government and donors. The Bank team worked with development partners to support the
government in preparing its first health sector strategy. It also ensured that the NHDP's design
aligned well with the PNDS, potentially simplifying implementation, and promoted


                                                                                                 25

implementation readiness by defining support for the first two years. The team effectively used
lessons learned from Bank projects in the health and other sectors in project design and
developed appropriate fiduciary and institutional arrangements given the sector context. Finally,
the team provided a balance of operational and technical skills, including consultants with the
skills to appraise the PNDS and the NHDP's proposed support. Some questions regarding the
Bank's performance nonetheless stand out: the M&E design, the lack of an institutional
assessment to guide capacity-building approaches, the gap in reviewing the AGEOPPE's
capacity which may have prevented procurement delays, and the weakly committed financing
plan. Although the Bank team evidently could not influence donor commitments, the risk
analysis did not recognize the threat from, or build in mitigating measures for, major financing
shortfalls.

87. On balance, shortcomings in the Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry were
considered moderate and so it is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

88. There were many positive aspects to the Bank team's performance in supervision. Firstly,
the team's efforts to identify blockages and flexibility in responding to the sector's changing
priorities helped maintain relevance. Evidence of this is the flexible use of funding for the
CECOME warehouse despite this not being in the PAD, amendments of the DCA to remove
subcomponents no longer considered priorities, and a good quality MTR which used QER and
Bank management advice. Secondly, the team effectively dealt with partnership issues in the
Netherlands Trust Fund and procurement difficulties in the co-financing for the national TB
hospital, helping to maximize external resources available to the sector. Thirdly, the Bank team
used Dakar- and Bissau-based Bank staff for interim visits after the MTR and significantly
improved the realism of ISR ratings. Fourth, the team made an effort to link funding with
development objectives from 2002 onwards and, in the last three years, brought progress against
indicators to the forefront of supervision missions. Finally, the team worked well with UN
agencies and re-engaged with donors as they returned to the sector. This included discussions
with AfDB in 2006 to secure ongoing financing for NHDP activities.

89.   In contrast, some important areas of Bank supervision were deficient.          The Bank's
performance in the immediate post-war period was weak: frequent changes of TTL (3 in 2 years)
undermined continuity at a time when the government was also undergoing frequent changes.
Supervision missions at this time tended to focus on documenting the sector's expanded needs
and exhorting the government to accelerate revision of the PNDS, rather than agreeing upon and
responding to simple priority interventions with NHDP funds. ISR performance and risk ratings
were inappropriately positive, as noted by the QER, which delayed bringing the project to
management attention and initiating remedial actions. Further, the team at the supplemental
Credit established some M&E targets which were unrealistically high for the NHDP's context
and did not review the NHDP's systems ambitious reforms objectives in light of the increased
institutional fragility after the conflict.

90. Given an overall solid performance but with shortcomings in significant areas, the Bank's
performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.


                                                                                              26

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

91. With quality at entry and quality of supervision rated moderately satisfactory, the overall
Bank performance rating is moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

92. The GoGB performed positively in some areas despite a difficult implementation context
which included factors, such as the outbreak of the war and the attempted coup d'état, clearly
beyond its control.     Positive aspects included its support during PNDS preparation and
prioritization of the payment of health salaries (second to the armed forces) in the post-war
period. However, the GoGB could have provided a much stronger enabling environment for the
NHDP.      The frequent changes of Minister of Public Health (10 in 10 years) undermined
continuity in sector leadership and the failure to achieve political stability nation-wide slowed
the return of donor financing and so contributed to the sector's funding shortfall. Whilst
acknowledging the country's macrofiscal difficulties, health sector funding as a percentage of
government budget was not increased to the 11% agreed by covenant; further resources were lost
to the sector because of very low budget execution for most of the NHDP's life (e.g. 25-35% in
2002-2004). Further, late payment of salaries was not effectively addressed, undermining staff
morale and performance, and poor management of arrears and co-financing payments to the
AfDB led to recurrent suspensions of this important funding source for the sector.

93. Overall, there were major shortcomings in the GoGB's performance in supporting efforts to
achieve the NHDP's PDO and so government performance is rated unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

94. The MOPH was the official implementing agency for the NHDP, with daily operations
handled by the CG. Overall, the CG performed well: FM compliance was good, procurement
was slow but correct, and support to the MOPH technical departments and regions in
implementing activities was solid.     The fact that the CG was entirely staffed by national
consultants is noteworthy.    The MOPH itself appeared committed to the NHDP, showing
leadership during preparation and ownership of the program throughout implementation. MOPH
authorities also supported continuity in the CG consultant staff and the various Directors-General
usually supported the regions and the departments in implementation of NHDP activities. These
factors contributed mainly to the primary health-care outcomes.

95. However, the MOPH did not create the necessary institutional environment to sustain the
NHDP's primary health-care outcomes or to achieve its systems, management, and capacity-
building goals.    Frequent changes in senior positions in parallel to ministerial changes
undermined continuity and leadership; key counterpart positions (DAF, DHE) were never filled
by adequately skilled staff, despite mission requests to do so; budget execution was low; and
there were delays in finalizing key documents, including the human resources policy, revised


                                                                                               27

only at the end of 2007, and the PNDS-2 necessary for sustained operation of the NHDP's
investments. An important point is that these failings were not confined to the immediate post-
war period, clearly constrained by factors beyond the MOPH's control such as the delayed
reopening of the commercial bank which held the Special Account, but continued up until Credit
closure.

96. On balance, the failures to improve the institutional context and promote sustainability
outweigh the good performance by the CG. Shortcomings are therefore considered significant
and so the performance of the MOPH as implementing agency is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

97.   With government performance unsatisfactory and implementing agency performance
moderately unsatisfactory, ICR guidelines require an overall Borrower performance rating of
unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

98. Focused activities and a flexible implementation design can improve service delivery in a
fragile post-conflict context. The NHDP contributed to a positive trend in service delivery
indicators with the bed-net and vaccination outcomes standing out. This was achieved by a focus
on priority areas which helped overcome the weaknesses in sector and country context and by a
flexible, annual work-plan approach which helped adapt NHDP activities to changing needs.

99. It is unrealistic to expect IDA support to help stabilize a sector after civil conflict and also
establish sustainable outcomes, grounded in systems reforms, over a single project lifetime. In
retrospect, the NHDP was too ambitious after the war in expecting to deliver rapid improvements
in service delivery and to implement systems reforms in a relatively short timeframe.

100. A phased approach may be more appropriate and effective in such a setting. This would
focus explicitly on stabilizing service delivery before addressing sustainability and systems
issues.   Given the average 5-year project lifespan, such a phased approach may require
commitment to follow-on projects.

101. Appropriate M&E can help focus the Borrower on achieving priorities. The M&E
framework, once revised and with a measurement system in place, showed itself useful in
focusing the MOPH on target areas. However, an incomplete indicator set (e.g. utilization of
health services) and lax definitions (e.g. "timely" salary payment) can distort government focus
away from unrepresented but nonetheless crucial areas.

102. Under flexible financing to a sector program, the economic analysis should provide
guidance on how to select cost-effective or efficient interventions for IDA support. Some NHDP-
financed activities were not planned in the original PNDS (e.g. co-financing the national TB
referral hospital) and so not reviewed on efficiency grounds during preparation. Guidelines on


                                                                                                 28

assessing the economic rationale for these post hoc investments would help prioritize amongst
the range of "emergencies" which come up during implementation.

103. Competent project management consultants facilitate implementation but also provide
cover for weaknesses with the Borrower may otherwise be forced to address. The relatively
strong CG was the institutional driver for the NHDP's results and the NGO contracted for M&E
provided good quality indicator data useful to implementation. However, the capacities of these
two groups allowed the MOPH to avoid dealing with the major staff capacity issues in key
departments (DAF, DHE), paradoxically undermining consultants' ability to transfer skills to
their MOPH counterparts.

104.    Effective action at the community level requires concurrent strengthening of the
government system. The Bamako Initiative was rapidly scaled up after the war, with Bank
support, as a means to improve sector financing.      Failure to link financing for this with
improvements in MOPH capacity was a major oversight as the MOPH was unable to guide,
supervise, and control the system. A stronger MOPH is needed to ensure that community-based
actions work correctly and equitably.

105. The major external assistance programs available to health should incorporate systems-
strengthening measures. Large-scale programs with a relatively vertical focus frequently do not
address systems issues explicitly despite depending on a strong and reliable delivery system.
The Bank could assist with this in Guinea-Bissau (and elsewhere) through partnership
arrangements.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This brief review of the economic and financial aspects of the NHDP focuses on a qualitative
appreciation of the operation's performance. This uses the ICR guidelines' approach of asking
whether the costs involved in achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with
both the benefits and with recognized norms. No attempt was made to calculate the economic
rate of return for the NHDP owing to the well known difficulties in quantifying the benefits flow
from health and other social sector projects. Further, no attempt was made to repeat the original
economic analysis as described in Annex 4 of the PAD as the necessary data were not available
and the operation changed somewhat from that originally envisaged during design.

Cost-effectiveness of interventions. Many of the interventions financed by the NHDP were
amongst those usually considered to have good cost-effectiveness. These include the support to
the primary health care and to preventive measures, notably vaccination, bed-net use, and
condom promotion. These interventions have had measurable impact: both vaccine coverage
and bed-net coverage increased according to project indicators and the supply-side elements of
primary health care (availability of staff in decent quality facilities with regular drug supply) also
improved. There are questions about the effectiveness of some of the particular technical
responses within these areas (e.g. bicycles with carts to transport pregnant women to higher level
facilities), the NHDP's focus on primary health care and selected prevention activities are in
favor of an acceptable level of efficiency during implementation.

In contrast, some other interventions have low cost-effectiveness. An obvious questions relates
to the $1.5 million support to the reconstruction of the national TB reference hospital through co-
financing with a large international NGO. Although probably not foreseeable at the time that
this support was decided, this subsidized a system of care for HIV and TB patients which is
entirely operated by staff of this NGO. It provides very high quality care with a relatively high
level of technological support (e.g. routine viral loads for HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral
therapy), but is a high-cost model not consistent with the streamlined approach to scaling up care
now common in African countries. The opportunity cost of the NHDP funds used to subsidize
this system, for example in terms of health centers not rehabilitated or health-care staff not
trained, is high.

Low-cost inputs. The generally good procurement management of the NHDP should have
ensured low-cost inputs. No comparative data were available to evaluate this.

Efficient use of inputs. The low-capacity environment in which the NHDP operated limited the
efficient use of many inputs. An example is the low utilization of certain equipment items
financed by the NHDP, such as the electric autoclave provided to a hospital which had no
functional generator (noted during a field trip; the autoclave had not been used in the six months
since delivery.) No systematic review of the use of NHDP-financed equipment was undertaken,
but there is a genuine risk that items are not delivering benefits because they cannot be fully
used. Another example is the bicycles for the health posts, some of which were seen to be in
their original wrapping during the ICR mission field visit.

The NHDP also financed several short-term, ad hoc interventions which had limited impact
because the MOPH was unable to sustain them. The clearest example of this is the support to
integrated multi-department supervision missions for two years mid-project.                 Although

                                                                                                   35

potentially a cost-effective intervention, the lack of government funding to follow up in the
supervision visits' recommendations meant that the NHDP investment in supervision activities
brought little benefit. Similar comments apply to efforts to improve capacity of the DAF and the
DHE, where inability to engage with the MOPH counterparts limited the impact of the NHDP
financing directed to these areas.

Duration of benefits flow. The major concern regarding efficiency of the NHDP is the
anticipated short life of the flow of benefits from its investments. This is the result of the low
likelihood of sustainability for the reasons outlined in the ICR text. The achievements in primary
health care are particularly at risk: new health center infrastructure is already suffering from lack
of maintenance, staff retention is at risk without the new human resources plan in place,
community revolving-fund drug management is fragile, and regional drug depots have increasing
debt with the CECOME warehouse, putting drug supply also at risk. It should, however, be
noted that the NHDP did try to mitigate this risk by improving the sector's policy framework
through the PER, a revised human resources strategy, and PNDS-2 preparation; if financed, these
could improve the life expectancy of the NHDP's other investments.

The counter-factual. The benefits brought by the NHDP need to be seen against the counter-
factual of sectoral collapse, which was the risk facing Guinea Bissau when the project
relaunched implementation in 1999. In the absence of other donors and falling government
revenues, the NHDP become "first line financing" and helped to prop up the health system
maintain staff in health services, and support the MOH's daily functioning by financing the CG
consultant team. Together with funding for the essential drug supply and operating costs, this
support from the NHDP is widely considered to have helped prevent further deterioration in the
sector. A fair estimation of the efficiency of the NHDP has to assess benefits against this very
low base, rather than the pre-war situation of 1998.

Fiscal impact. Related to the question of sustainability is the fiscal impact of the NHDP's
investments. Clearly, limiting Bank support to that which was fiscally sustainable in Guinea-
Bissau's health sector would have seriously constrained the NHDP's activities and adversely
affected service delivery to the target population. However, the NHDP's interventions have led
to increased recurrent costs in terms of operations and maintenance of infrastructure, equipment,
and vehicles as well as staff salaries. This is particularly concerning to the government in the
absence of a follow-on Bank project to support reforms which aim to improve the MOPH's own
ability to finance these costs (as well as possible short-term direct financing, as currently
envisaged for teacher salaries).

The efficiency picture for the NHDP is clearly mixed. The emphasis on generally cost-effective
areas is offset by the shortened life of the operation's benefits (as well as the low impact of some
investments). However, its benefits over the context of sectoral collapse in the post-war period
are important and so, on balance, a modest rating was given.

I.      Introduction

The National Health Development Program ­ NHDP (Plano Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Sanitário - PNDS) is a reference document that defined the objectives, strategies, and priority
activities in the sector for the period 1998 to 2002. Execution of the program was shared among
the government, development partners, and the community.

Due to the political-military conflict of June 1998 and its consequences, implementation of the
program was impaired. Key development partners departed; health facility infrastructures had to
be repaired, and human resource personnel fled the country. This forced a reprogramming of
activities according to the priorities defined in the NHDP as revised for the period 2003 to 2007.

The overall objective of the NHDP was to improve the health status of the population,
particularly women and children, through strengthening the national health system, service
delivery, management structures and processes.

Specific objectives were, among others: (i) to increase the use and effective coverage of primary
care services and referral centers; (ii) to strengthen the institutional capacity at all levels; (iii) to
improve the quality and the management of human resources; and (iv) to reinforce intersectoral
coordination and action in health-related activities in order to promote better health among the
population, portrayed in four components.

In the framework of partnership with the international community, the government benefited
from various sources of support for execution of activities under the NHDP. This report
highlights the support from the World Bank.

Supplemental Credit (IDA No. 3010 -1)
Started in 2005 and ended on December 31, 2007

Component I ­ Utilization and coverage of primary health care centers and referral centers. The
results obtained with support from the WB represented 54.54% of the financing, including funds
from The Netherlands grant.

In the area of accessibility, infrastructures valued at US$ 4,877,266.00 were constructed and
rehabilitated, representing 24.80%.

Essential drugs; equipment; medical materials and furniture, insecticide-impregnated mosquito
nets, impregnation materials, and computer equipments.

After the mid-term review mission and revision of priorities, and considering the lack of
government funding, support was given for the pursuit of advanced strategies and integrated
supervisions (from the central offices out to the regions and health areas (áreas sanitárias)) and
regional supervisions (from the regions out to the health areas), until the end of 2005.

Priority programs such as AIDS also benefited through the purchase of a vehicle, social
marketing of condoms (PSI), and conduct of a survey Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices survey
(PSI).

The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) received a provision of a cold-chain unit,
motorcycles, bicycles, spare parts for the cold-chain unit.

The National Anti-Malaria Program received a supply of impregnated mosquito nets, products
for use in treating bed nets, establishment of centers for bed net impregnation, and training of a
technician in this field.

The Reproductive Health Program received 200 bicycles with carts to transport pregnant women
from their communities to the nearest health center, and materials for functioning and retraining
of the community health units on the importance of breastfeeding for the Nutrition unit.

Component II ­ Strengthening of institutional and management capacity at all levels. The
support provided represented 45.45% of the total amount of the financing.



                                                                                                43

II.1. (a). Human resources management and development

For the results mentioned below in the area of training, US$ 1,518,635.00 was spent, which
represents 7.72%.
Clinical Area­ 12 doctors (Horizontal), Public Health area ­ 21 (final year of training),
polyvalent training (male nurses/midwives) (69) ­ Ilhas, course in General Nursing (31), course
in General Midwifery (31), course for Laboratory technicians (30), and training of mid-level
administrative technical personnel (22).

II.1. (b). In the area of technical assistance, $ 5,626,986.00 was made available, representing
28.62%, making it possible to obtain results such as: the update of the NHDP in order to
reprioritize the activities, revising expenditures in the health sector, revising the PNDS,
following up on key NHDP indicators, final evaluation of the NHDP, studies and inspection of
the construction works, organization of files and human resources records.

II.2. In the context of effective, efficient, and transparent management of sector resources,
the results obtained were related to training of mid-level administrative technical personnel (22),
acquisition of computer equipments for 11 health regions, follow-up on application of financial
management procedures, establishment of Management Committees (mobilization, raising
awareness, elections, training members), retraining members from the Management Committees
that faced problems, reinforcing the health information system (DHE and HR).

In the operational realm, US$ 1,791,118.00 were spent, which, in percentage terms, represents
9.11% of the total amount of the two credits and the fund managed by the Bank.

On the component of intersectoral collaboration and cooperation, partnership, and
promotion of better health, the amount spent represented only 0.01% of the total figure.
However, we must emphasize that management functions were delegated for carrying out the
social marketing of condoms, such expenses were charged to "strengthening capacity at all
levels" category.

Although most of the established objectives were not achieved, (except BCG coverage before
first birthday, TT2+ and the percentage of children up to age 5 and pregnant women sleeping
under an impregnated bed net on the night before the survey, goals that were achieved and
surpassed), the overall outcome is positive. In general, there has been an improvement in the
indicators, which demonstrates that the country, despite all the vicissitudes it has experienced, is
on the right road to improving the health of Guineans and to achieve, by 2015, some of the
MDGs.

                                                                                                         46

With regard to the Bamako Initiative and the recovery of costs, participation by the general
public was less than expected due to the shortage of personnel available to exert an effective and
transparent financial control by the regional offices, resulting in diversions of funds. Legal
measures were taken against Management Committees and/or regional financial management
staff. Human resources staff is still insufficient in terms quantity and quality and staffing is still
largely dependent on foreign aid.

Cooperation between the public and non-profit private sectors (faith-based organizations and
NGOs involved in health-related activities) continues but much remains to be done, especially in
terms of harmonizing interventions according to priorities. However, we should point out that
there has been good collaboration and coordination with some non-profit sectors, causing the
public sector, due to its inability to perform certain functions (for example, studies of the base
population), to use the existing capacity of private institutions.

With respect to the promotion of better health, the activities promoted by the Information,
Education, and Communications in Health Service (Serviço de Informação, Educação e
Comunicação em Saúde) were quite visible in the development of tested materials (pamphlets,
posters, and billboards) designed to educate the public on matters of prevention (cholera,
diarrhea, condom use, and the importance of going to health care facilities to give birth.)

II.     Results
The general and specific objectives of the NHDP were not fully achieved. We should point out
that, although it is one of the world's poorest countries, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau has made
an effort, both in the health and education sectors, to improve its socioeconomic situation and the
well-being of its population. This is illustrated, for example, by the slight improvement in the
maternal mortality rate (700/100,000 live births).

However, the worsening of the infant mortality rate and that of children under the age of five is a
cause for concern. (See Table 1).

                     Table 1 ­ Indicators for the specific objective of the NHDP (Impact)

Indicator             Value (year - 1998)      Reference              Value (year - 2007) Reference

age of 5 years        births (2000)            MICS-3 (2006)          births (2006)


The degree to which general and specific objectives were achieved is also shown by the values of
the performance indicators defined in the NHDP and the goals set for each.

The NHDP defined objectives for performance evaluation of the programs and their relationship
to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Given their interconnection with the MDGs,
the proposed objectives also enable us to perceive something about the achievement of the
general and specific objectives (Annex 1).


                                                                                                      47

We should point out, however, that there are major regional asymmetries in terms of the
indicators. In general, the SAB shows higher values (sometimes attaining the proposed national
objectives) and Tombali exhibits the worst, and it is likely that these asymmetries extend to the
Health Areas within a single region.

One of the results expected from the NHDP was that "health services, at the level of primary
health care centers as well as at the level of referral centers, provide good quality,
comprehensive, continuous and integrated health care accessible to all" (NHDP, 1998). The
strategies for achieving this objective related to the construction, rehabilitation, and expansion of
health care infrastructures and staff housing for professionals, purchase of equipment, and
improvements in the conditions prevailing in the health care areas (availability of water, drugs,
vaccines, and materials needed for care). Analyzing the suggested indicators for this expected
result (Table 2), we conclude that, in general, there was an improvement, although in some cases
it was very modest (for example, the percentage of births attended in specialized establishment).

During the life of the NHDP, an effort was made to endow this country with health care
infrastructure, with a total of 57 construction/rehabilitation projects undertaken, three of which
were not been foreseen. In this regard, i.e., the preventive maintenance of the infrastructures of
health care units, except for training provided with ADB's assistance, almost nothing was done
due to the lack of funds.

The establishment of VHF radios in the health care infrastructures was not finished, but 54 radios
and solar panels purchased will be installed in the first quarter of 2008, except at the
epidemiology service. Out of 114 health care infrastructures, only 97, or 85.08%, are equipped
with functioning cooling system.

Another effort made to achieve better access was the advanced strategy. However, the advanced
strategy offers a limited package of services and needs to be strengthened by adding other
services according to the health realities of each health area, and the schedule needs to show firm
dates.

Various databases still coexist, which means that indicators are not consistent with each other,
hence the need for gradual database integration into a Health Observatory that would bring
together the different "owners" of the databases (The Bandim Health Project, National Survey of
Multiple Indicators, the Hygiene and Epidemiology Bureau).

Technical capabilities in the financial management framework were also reinforced by recruiting
consultants or consulting firms. Aspects related to construction were initially delegated, through
a contract to the firm AGEOPE, but due to the weak structure of this firm, an external study firm
had to be recruited to continue the programmed activities.

III.    Strong points in the implementation and execution of the NHDP:

        - Existence of a strategy for the health sector (NHDP);
        - Consensus as to the real health needs of the country;
        - Convergence of vision about the way to solve health problems;
        - Clear definition of the minimum funding requirements by type of health service and
        type of infrastructure;

                                                                                                   48

      - Increase in health care infrastructures and improvement in accessibility,
      - Improvement in some indicators.

      Difficulties:

      - Institutional instability (9 Ministers), which had a negative impact on the appropriation
      of the framework document;
      - Lack of national counterpart funds;
      - Withdrawal of main partners in the sector due to country instability,
      - Lack of funds from the General State Budget to meet operating expenses, making it
      necessary to use funds from both the project and the Bamako Initiative;
      - Technical staff widespread lack of motivation, due to delays in salaries' payment of
      shortage of qualified personnel.

   IV.    Weak points in the implementation and execution of the NHDP:

      · Lack of financial means to implement the programmed activities, caused by the
          departure of main donors.
      · Emigration of skilled staff due to the June 1998 conflict;
      · Political-institutional instability (between 1998 and 2005, there were 9 Ministers of
          Health);
      · Delay in implementation caused by the country's instability (1999 to 2001).
      · Need to reprogram needs and priorities because of losses resulting from the conflict;
      · Lack of monitoring and evaluation of the activities, failure to readjust them;
      · Lack of training of technical personnel and week capacity to train them;
      · Lack of managerial skills and insufficient managers at both central and regional
          levels;
      · Insufficient appropriation on the part of actors in the health sector, both public and
          private, due to insufficient publicity of the NHDP;
      · Poor management of Bamako Initiative financial resources, because the lack of
          capacity and insufficient managers at both the central and regional levels did not
          permit effective management decentralization.

   V. Lessons Learned:

       Anticipated objectives, strategies, and actions must be as realistic as possible and
       focused on priorities;
       Insufficient participation by the government in the bulk in financing the NHDP;
       Increased dependency on foreign aid;
       Probability that the sustainability of the results achieved cannot be guaranteed.

VI.   Relationships:

         Improvement of relations with World Bank's management team and flexibility on the
       team's part in solving priority problems of the sector;
         Need for the World Bank continuous assistance to the sector in order to guarantee the
       sustainability of the results achieved,


                                                                                              49

       Improvement in government appropriation and integration of the funds management
      structure.

VII.  Recommendations

         To revise the National Health Policy so that the strategies would be developed in a
         broader context of the government's social and economic policy, integrating
         development indicators and welfare of the population and reducing inequalities
         among health regions;
         The appropriation of the NHDP-II as a reference for all interventions and to make an
         effort to publicize it more widely among professionals in the field;
         To improve interventions' coordination and distribution among different sector
         partners of the NHDP-II implementing and executing mechanisms and the to apply
         functional mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation;
         To strengthen partnership mechanisms with donors by expanding and formalizing
         existing public-private partnerships through gradual decentralization of executive and
         funds management powers (outsourcing);
             To create a centralized system for management of sector funds, regulation of
         mechanisms holding those responsible accountable for deviating from procedures and
         to create, in the regional structures, own accounting mechanisms;
         To create a "single" information system that would facilitate the transmission of data
         among different levels of the health care system;
         To promote a more comprehensive view of health and to improve mechanisms for
         intersectoral collaboration
         To strengthen national capacity at all levels in order to facilitate access to primary
         health care as well as to provide quality health care;
         To increase the number and to improve the quality of professionals by establishing
         mechanisms that enhance professional motivation and bring about improved working
         conditions, distribution, and retention;
         To combine efforts and to create mechanisms to promote community participation in
         health care services (mutualism, social security, etc.);
         To guarantee performance sustainability achieved and to implement the process under
         way (NHDP-II, etc.);
         To consider strategies and objectives in order to be able to deal with emergencies and
         natural disasters,
         To strengthen, at the national level, the supply and availability of essential drugs to
         facilitate access to primary health care was well as to facilitate the provision of
         quality care.

VIII. Conclusions

         The results achieved were, in general, satisfactory even though the coverage rates of
         some key public health indicators were not attained;
         Development of managerial capacity associated with experiences gained made it
         possible to accentuate the solid foundations for the prospects of sector resources
         management in the spirit of the declaration of Paris (global resources management of
         the sector).
