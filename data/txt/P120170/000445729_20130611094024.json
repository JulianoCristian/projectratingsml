This study\n            identifies the key factors that explain these socio-spatial\n            differences in terms of resilience and vulnerability to\n            climate change, along with public policy options at\n            different levels of government to strengthen resilience and\n            reduce the vulnerability of poor households in exposed\n            areas. The study addresses three key questions regarding the\n            social factors that explain vulnerability to climate change:\n            (1) Who is vulnerable and where they are located; (2) How\n            will climate change affect welfare (income and nutrition) of\n            vulnerable households in Mexico; and (3) What public\n            policies and institutional reforms can strengthen the\n            resilience of the most vulnerable social groups in the most\n            exposed areas? The study is mainly based on a spatial and\n            temporal analysis of secondary data from various sources\n            that capture aspects of exposure in the city and home,\n            sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change."}, "docdt": "2013-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
