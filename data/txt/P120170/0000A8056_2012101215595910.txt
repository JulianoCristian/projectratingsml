                         adaptation planning oriented to the state level; (b) disaster risk reduction and territorial development actions oriented to the municipal level; and (c) sustainable
                         community forest management at the community level. A multi-sectoral DPL to enhance climate change adaptation capacity is anticipated in the CPS.

                            Yes           No
