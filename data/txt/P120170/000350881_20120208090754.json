level; and (c)\n            sustainable community forest management at the community\n            level. This development policy loan will focus on the\n            following areas: (1) Long term adaptation planning. Number\n            of States designed Climate Change Action Programs during\n            2012 that have included specific measures to promote civil\n            society participation in the design of social resilience\n            initiatives.
