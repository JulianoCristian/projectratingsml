Social\n            Resilience to Climate Change Project for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: sustained engagement on the\n            part of the Bank is critical to effectively support reform\n            processes over the medium and long term. The Bank's\n            support program has also included credit enhancement,\n            hedging swaps, catastrophe risk management, and advisory\n            services to support the evolution of the government's\n            climate program through the years in a consistent manner.\n            National Institute for Ecology and Climate Change (Instituto\n            Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico) (INECC) recognized\n            the positive impact of development policy loan (DPL) for\n            encouraging the strengthening of social resilience, as there\n            is still a gap in assessing the social impacts of climate\n            change, and most climate change planning instruments tend to\n            focus primarily on mitigation. As a coordinator of state\n            climate change action programs and municipal climate action\n            plans, INECC should emphasize the importance of focusing on\n            adaptation measures, establishing clear actions with the\n            institutions that are responsible for them, defining\n            indicators with baseline values and goals, and including a\n            description of their monitoring and evaluation (M and E)\n            systems. The creation of stakeholder forums at the national\n            and subnational level presents an opportunity to share\n            information and generate feedback on adaptation measures.\n            The operation's policy content and prior actions should\n            reflect the Borrower's own program and priorities\n            developed with the benefit of a national policymaking\n            process that involves broad public consultation. Prior\n            actions should be limited to a few key policy and\n            institutional reforms. During the program preparation it is\n            important to define indicators to which the federal\n            government is committed as part of their existing programs\n            and initiatives. Given the innovative nature of the actions\n            supported, a DPL was the most appropriate financing\n            instrument. One of the challenges related to focusing on\n            institutional arrangements is the longer term and indirect\n            impact on the goal of shared prosperity and eliminating extreme."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
