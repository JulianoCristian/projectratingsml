The key lessons learned\n            from the project include: 1) Project preparation should take\n            account of project risks as comprehensively as possible and\n            should reduce the complexity and extent of the project on\n            the basis of the magnitude and probability of these risks.\n            2) The relationship between IDA and the government during\n            project negotiation should be weighed carefully. 3) The\n            involvement of multiple agencies/ministries make project\n            implementation more difficult. 4) Critical policy reforms\n            should be pursued as project outcomes rather than upfront\n            conditionalities. 5) Compliance to these covenants and\n            conditionalities should be within the purview of the\n            implementing agencies. 6) Project components should be\n            designed with an internal logic behind them and not merely\n            used as baskets to put activities in need of funding. 7)\n            Economic liberalization and related macroeconomic reforms\n            provide strong underpinnings for sector reforms and\n            significantly enhance their achievement. 8) Baseline data\n            and performance targets should be defined at project\n            appraisal. 9) For skill-scarce countries or sectors,\n            training should be conducted as soon as possible. 10)\n            Counterpart funds should be calculated globally for the\n            whole project, rather than on a contract-by-contract basis,\n            and should take into account extra-budgetary resources\n            generated from project-supported initiatives."}, "docdt": "1999-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
