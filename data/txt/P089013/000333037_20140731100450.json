the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: large, complex integrated urban development\n            projects require consistent effort over long periods of\n            time. Infrastructure projects should focus on identification\n            of the most efficient technical solution on a case-by-case\n            basis. Risks posed by changes in government should not be\n            underestimated and must be mitigated. The Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) and the intermediate results\n            indicators should be as few, simple and unequivocal as\n            possible. Excessive preparation periods should be avoided,\n            and technical readiness at rollout assured, to conserve\n            commitment. Resettlement under urban slum upgrading projects\n            in Brazil frequently determines the timeline for the entire\n            project. Compliant resettlement in dense urban areas is\n            often slowed by the availability of nearby suitable urban\n            land for the building of substitute housing. When working\n            with urban projects at subnational level, the Bank must\n            ensure that the gaps in institutional capacity are\n            adequately addressed earlier in project concept and\n            preparation. This includes identifying challenges, defining\n            activities to confront these, and assigning resources\n            sufficient to complete those activities satisfactorily."}, "docdt": "2014-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
