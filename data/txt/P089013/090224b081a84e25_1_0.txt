                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is proceeding Moderately Unsatisfactorily. The loan is currently scheduled to close on June 30, 2013, but project disbursements have only reached 51% of the
                         total loan amount and key works contracts will not be completed by then. The main works being carried out include: development of three parks along the riverbank, rehabilitation of
                         urban roads, construction of a bridge over the Capibaribe river, houses to accommodate populations living in vulnerable areas around the bridge, rehabilitation of macro drainage
                         canals, renovation of an income and jobs generation center. Although these works represent significant gains, costs escalations and overall implementation delays have deterred

                         roads subsystems and integrated sanitation in non-vulnerable areas).

                         As a result the Project is currently not on track to reach its Project Development Objectives and the Implementation Progress is below expectations.
