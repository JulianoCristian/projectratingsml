                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has made some progress. Activities are moving towards the achievement of expected results and development objectives. The Borrower prepared an action
                         plan to improve implementation, increase disbursement of loan funds and optimize both financial and human resources. The implementation of such action plan is ongoing and
                         results can already be reported in both project management and implementation of activities.

                         The first set of works - construction of a new park and rehabilitation of two existing parks started in May 2011, as planned, and are supposed to be completed in 15 months.
                         Procurement for the works under ICB 1/2011 (Road Systems A, B and C, and a Bridge crossing the Capibaribe River) has received the No Objection from the Bank and the bidding
                         has been published. An ICB for the construction of Housing to accommodate families to be resettled is under preparation. The Borrower also performed bids for the works for
                         rehabilitation of drainage canals, to be fully financed by counterpart funding.

                         The actual cost estimation to implement the project is considerably above the initial estimation. As a result, there is a need to increase counterpart financing. The Borrower is also in
                         the final steps to sign an agreement with the Federal Government under the PAC program to finance other works included in the project's scope, namely the integrated sanitation and
                         related housing program. Once these agreements are effective and works contracted, the amount of counterpart financing will increase considerably to a level much higher than
                         initially estimated. As a result of the existing financing gap and changes in counterpart financing the project may be restructured upon the Mid Term Review Mission, scheduled for
                         October, 2011. In the future, the Borrower may also consider additional finance from the Bank to cover financing gaps in the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         An action plan was agreed between the Borrower and the Bank to further improve project implementation. Project Restructuring is to be taken into consideration at the future Mid
                         Term Review, planned for October 3-7, 2011, including a revision of the financing structure of the project. In the meanwhile, the Bank agreed to finance up to 100% of some activities,
                         while the Borrower finances up to 100% of other activities, since the Borrower's financing will be at much higher level than initially required.
