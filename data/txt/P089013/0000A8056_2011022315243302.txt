                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project Implementation is moving slow. Although PMU is staffed and equipped and the management consulting firm is already hired, the Borrower needs to speed up procurement for
                         larger works and the selections of consultant services, as planned in the procurement plan. Although the first ICB process for works faced delays due to required adjustments in the
                         bidding documents and technical specification it is expected that works start by May, 2011. The Borrower plans to have the second largest ICB for works published by April, 2011.
