-g As Project implementation continues to make progress, the Bank team remains positive that the project development objectives and results can be achieved. Although disbursements
D- are still considered to be low, some improvement was noted, as the works for the "Construction of a New Park and for the Rehabilitation of Two Existing Parks" are well advanced.
Procurement for the "Road Systems A, B and C (including a Bridge crossing the Capibaribe River)" works is concluded, and procurement for two "Housing Development" Projects is

Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
Project restructuring was discussed during the Mid Term Review mission, held in November 2011, in order to make possible for the Client to further submit a request for Loan
Agreement amendment to the Federal Government and to the Bank. Such amendment will aim at performing general financial arrangements and scope adjustments to the Project.
Restructuring History
There has been no restructuring to date.
