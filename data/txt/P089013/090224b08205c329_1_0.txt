                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is Unsatisfactory. The loan will close on October 31, 2013, after a four month extension of the previous closing date of June 30, 2103. Project disbursements
                         have reached 59.85% of the total loan amount. Of the total amount disbursed from the loan, about US$3.5 million remain unpaid. Key works contracts will not be completed by
                         closing. The main works pending completion include: expansion and construction of three parks along the riverbank, rehabilitation of urban roads, construction of a bridge over the
                         Capibaribe river and fully counterpart financed rehabilitation of macro drainage canals. Although these works represent significant gains, costs escalations and overall implementation

                         delays have deterred project progress. The construction of houses to accommodate populations living in vulnerable areas around the bridge was contracted, but works were not
                         authorized to start as they extended beyond the closing date.

                         Important works that were to be fully financed by counterpart funds and with secured financing, particularly integrated sanitation in critical areas and related housing units for families

                         to be resettled under these works have not yet been procured. These works have an estimated duration of 40 months in order to be completed. There are additional works that have
                         not yet secured a source of financing (such as urban roads subsystems and integrated sanitation in non-vulnerable areas).

                         In September 2012 the Borrower and the Bank agreed on a project restructuring including an extension of the closing date by 22 months after the original closing date of June 30,
                         2013. That restructuring was endorsed by the Guarantor (Federal Government) in November, 2012. A new mayor was elected on October, 2012. The municipal administration that
                         started from January 1, 2013 asked the Bank to review the restructuring. From February to June, 2013 the Bank team and the Borrower discussed the revision of the restructuring. In
                         June 28, 2013 the closing date was partially extended by four months to October 31, 2013 to allow the Borrower to complete the revision of the project restructuring and to get the
                         required endorsement from the Guarantor. The endorsement of the Guarantor did not reach the Bank in a time that would allow processing and approval of the restructuring. As a
                         result, the Project will close on October 31, 2013.
