{"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated as satisfactory\n            and project sustainability is rated as likely. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            rated satisfactory, overall. Lessons learned can be grouped\n            into four categories and concerned policy reforms and the\n            lending instrument; the design of the major information\n            technology project component; the optimization of track\n            renewal sub-projects; and the relationships between project\n            components. Project design made the Bank a legitimate\n            partner of the Bulgarian State Railway (BDZ) and the\n            government in transforming the railway sector over the\n            project period and provided key targets on which the debate\n            could focus. This was reinforced from 1999 on by the\n            visibility given to railway reforms by the IMF stabilization\n            program as well as the Bank's own growing concern with\n            structural adjustment and initiation of a broad programmatic\n            adjustment lending approach. But the opportunity offered by\n            the stabilization and adjustment programs could not have\n            been taken, had a strong relationship not been established\n            between the Bank, BDZ, and the Government through investment\n            lending. The excruciating experience in implementing the\n            project component aimed at establishing new management\n            information systems and the eventual failure of this\n            component cast doubt on the approach adopted in its design.\n            The approach was to use international turnkey contractors to\n            put together and install major systems. The radical nature\n            of the changes, the lack of a trial and error process, the\n            speed of decision making made necessary by the contract\n            implementation process, the high stakes but also uncertain\n            basis on which to make decisions, and the differences\n            between the contractors and their supervisors within BDZ\n            were such that an adversarial relationship was almost\n            unavoidable and could not be mitigated by a strong common\n            agreement on the ultimate objectives to be achieved."}, "docdt": "2003-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
