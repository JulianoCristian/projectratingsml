        to increase the output and improve the quality of skilled\n            technical manpower by support for two cost-effective systems\n            of postsecondary education, the polytechnics and the\n            Television University (TVU) system.  The project would\n            pursue these objectives by providing facilities and\n            equipment for 17 polytechnics; for a production center,\n            laboratories and a printing house for the Central Radio and\n            Television University; for 28 production centers and 85\n            study centers for the provincial TVUs; and for nine\n            transmission stations.  The project would also provide a\n            program of fellowships, overseas study tours and expert\n            services to train academic, technical and administrative\n            staff of project institutions."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
