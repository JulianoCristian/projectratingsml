PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT. THIRD POWER PROJECT. AND POWER SUPPLEMENT
(Loan/(Credit) 1733/(935). 1§861(1052) and 1886-l-EGT)
PREFACE
This combined Project Completion Report (PCR) covers the Shoubrah El
Kheima Thermal Power Project (Second Power Project) supported bv
Loan/Credit 1733/935-EGT, and the Third Power Project supported by Loan/Credit
1886/1052-EGT which were approved by the Board in FY79 and FY80 respectively.
In Fn84 a supplemental loan (Loan 1886-1-EGT) for US$59.0 million was made to
the Egyptian Electricity Authority (ERA) to cover a shortfall in foreign cost
financing of both projects.
Under Loan/Credit 1733/935-EGT, the Loan (US$102 million) was made
to the EEA, and the IDA credit (US$37 million) was made to the Government of
Egypt and on lent to EEA. Similarly under Loan/Credit 1886/1052-EGT, the loan
(US$ 7 million) was made to the EEA, and the IDA Credit (US$ 120 million) to
the Governmsnt and on lent to EEA.  In addition, under the Shoubrah El Kheima
Thermal Power Project, IDA, as Administrator of the Special Action Account of
the European Economic Community, signed a credit agreement with the Government
for an amount of US$35 million to be on lent to EEA.
Loan/Credit 1733/935-EGT was closed on June 30, 1988 two years
behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on
January 24, 1989. The Closing Date (extended thrice) for Loan/Credit
1886/1052-EGT and Loan 1886-1-EGT is June 30, 1990. Credit 1052-EGT and
Loan 1886-EGT were fully disbursed by October 27, 1988 and October 25, 1989
respectively.  Loan 1886-1-EGT has been ex.ended, for the fourth time. by one
year and would now close on June 30, 1991.
Parts I and III of the combined PCR were prepared by the Industry
and Energy Division, Country Department III, EMENA. Part II inputs were
requested in October 1989, but none were received from the Borrower
(EEA) or the implementing agencies (Rural Electrification Authority - REA; and
Hydropower Plants Executive Authority - HPPEA).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the. Drojects in March 1989, and is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Reports, President's Reports, the Loan, Credit,
Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports; and correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower.

SECOND POWER PROJECT. THIlRD POWER PROJECT. AND POWER SUPPLEMEN
(Loan/(Credit) 1733/(935). 18861(1052) and 1886-1-EGT)
EVAUAION SUNMARY
Objectives: The Second and Third Power Projects were intended to: (i) assist
EEA to meet the 1985/86 load of EEA's interconnected system; (ii) strengthen
project management capabilities in EEA, HPPEA and REA; (iii) provide a
framework for the improvement of energy prices; and (iv) continue the
institutional improvement measures, initiated in the earlier loan (Ln. 1453-
EGT), in the areas of planning, operations and financial management (para
3.01). The components funded under the projects (para 3.02) included:
(i) three 300-MW generating units at the Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power
station and associated transmission facilities; (ii) four 67.5-MW generating
units at the Aswan II hydropower station; (iii) Regional Electrification
(Phase II); and (iv) technical assistance services.
Xmplementation Experience: The original schedule for commissioning of the
units at Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station was delayed by about eight
months during the appraisal of the Third Power Project due to initial delays
in finalizing procurement packages. Suitable procurement arrangements,
however, still made it possible to commission the power station at Shoubrah
three months ahead of schedule. Commissioning of the four units at Aswan II
hydropower station was delayed by about 16 months due to delays in completion
of civil works, and the Regional electrification component was also delayed,
due to a considerable increase in scope. (para 7.01).
Results: The Projects' main development objectives of assisting EEA to meet
the rapidly growing demand for power have been met. In addition, the
commissioning of Aswan II hydropower station assisted EEA in full utilization
of water, which earlier used to be discharged through the gates of the Aswan
dam without generating electricity. However, efforts to improve institutional
performance (paras 8.02-8.06) and financial performance (paras 8.10-8.15) have
been less successful.
Sustainability: The performance of the Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power
station and the Aswan II hydropower station has been satisfactory.
Sustainability is dependent on continued availability of adequately trained
and experienced staff (para 9.01).
Lessons Learred:
- While the project was successful in meeting the urgently needed power
requirements of Egypt, and therefore was tidely and justified, the financial



- iii -
results were significantly less than the economic benefits. This is due to
inadequate pricing policies. The Bank sought to address the pricing policy
reforms through annual consultationas with the Government during the course of
project implementation. However this approach was not effective, and has since
been changed under the Fourth Power Project whereby the Bank requires upfront
satisfactory progress in electricity tariff reforms prior to loan approval and
has agreed on multi-year pricing policy reforms (para 10.03).
- It is essential to firm up financing arrangements prior to Board approval,
rather thaii rely on Goverrment assurances to bridge financing gaps without
taking into account the country's foreign exchange availability (para 6.02).
- Targets for measuring financial performance should be derived from concepts
which are fully understood and accepted by both parties, and operational
methodologies for calculating these targets should be precisely defined during
negotiations.  This would avoid time consuming discussions during prcject
implementation whicd divert attention away from crucial problems facing the
institution. (para 8.13)
- Executing agencies should give more attention to the interaction between the
activities of the contractor and those of the agencies existing at the work
site especially when the contractor is required to utilize the existing
equipment of the other agencies at site for performance of critical activities
under the contract. This would avoid the kind of difficulties discussed in
para 7.02.

II. BACKGROUND
The Energy Sector
2.01      The main sources of primary commercial energy in Egypt during the
late seventies and early eighties were hydropower and petroleum. Coal
deposits had been discovered in the western desert and Sinai peninsula, and
were estimated at around 100 million tons. As in other developing economies,
non-commercial fuels in the form of crop residues and animal waste were in
extensive use and estimated to represent about one quarter of the total
commercial energy used.
2.02      The main issues facing the energy sector related to the pricing of
energy supplies and lack of adequate planning. The Government has
traditionally kept the overall price of energy low relative to the rest of the
domestic prices and to international prices to foster industrial growth
through pvblicly owned enterprises. In 1979/80 close to 581 of the petroleum
products wore consumed by industry and the power sector, and about 82X of the
electricity generated was consumed either by industry or Government-related
activities. The low prices for energy continued to hinder the ability of the
entities in the energy sector to generate sufficient revenues to finance the
capital investment necessary to meet future needs. An additional shortcoming



-2-
of the prevailing pricing structure was that the relative scarcity of the
various competing energ'r products was not reflected in the price system. This
led to the use of energy resources in a sub-optimal combination.
2.03      A joint assessment of Egypt's energy resources and needs up to the
year 2000 carried out by an Egypt/US team in March-July 1978, pointed out
serious gaps and inconsistencies in igypt's energy planning. The joint
assessment concluded by recommending continuing assistance to help Egypt
establish a comprehensive energy planning capability to prepare and implement
energy development plans effectively.
Power Subsector
2.04      The Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MEE) is in charge of public
electricity supply. Under dEE, the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) is
responsible for generation and bulk supply of electricity to the whole
country. Power distribution is carried out by seven distribution companies
which are subsidiaries of EEA.
2.05      Economic subsidies are considerable in the power subsector where
present tariffs are below the marginal cost of supply. Both the levels and
structure of electricity tariffs are inadequate, as indicated by the report
prepared by French consultants (SOFRELEC) financed by the Bank under the first
and second power projects.
2.06      In 1979 Egypt's total interconnected generating capability was 3404
MW in 17 generating srations. Of these, 1151 KW were ia steam electric
plants, 647 MW in combustion turbines and 1606 MW in hydro. The power system
comprised also a 500-kV interconnection between the hydro plants in the south
(Aswan) with the load centers and thermal plants in the Cairo region, a 220-
kV network served the Northern Egypt loads and a 132-kV system, generally
parallelling the 500-kV link, served the loads in the Nile Valley and nearby
oases. Utilization voltage is 380/220 volts and system frequency is 50 Hz.
2.07      Despite vigorous efforts to extend electric service throughout
Egypt, only 62 percent of the urban population and 19 percent of the rural
dwellers had access to electricity in 1976 when annual per capita consumption
was only about 289 kWh. Maximum demand rose from 987 MW in 1969 to 2,814 MW
in 1979 and sales from 5,580 GWh to 14,675 GWh during the same period. The
average growth rate for the whole ten year period concealed some very
divergent trends. Between 1969 and 1972 annual growth rates for sales
declined from 6.6 percent to -0.8 percent, and from 6.1 percent to 1.4 percent
for maximum demand. These low growth rates reflected the relatively
lackluster performance of the economy in these years, during which the growth
of GNP averaged only 3 percent per annum. Since 1972, there was a sharp
reversal of these trends, with economic growth of 7.8 percent per annum until
about the mid-80's and power demand growing at over 16 percent per annum on
average. The key factor behind the higher growth rate of the power market was
the demand of five major industrial consumers (three of which began operations
during this period>. Sales to these consumers grew at over 29 percent per



- 3 -
annum during 1974-1979. On the other hand, sales to other consumer categories
grew much less rapidly, ranging from 16 percent per arnum for
residential/commercial consumers to 0.4 percent per aninum for
irrigation/agriculture. As a result, the share of industry in total
electricity sales rose from 55 percent to 65 percent.
2.08      To meet the projected needs of the power subsector, EEA developed a
least-cost system expansion program with the help of consultants and up-to-
date system planning techniques. This program confirmed the need for early
commissioning of the available Nile hydropower at Aswan and three existing
barrages. Nuclear power stations were also optimistically scheduled for
combined operation with pumped storage starting in 1988/89. Earlier
scheduling was precluded due to the high costs involved and the estimated lead
time needed for planning and executing nuclear projects in Egypt (about 9-10
years). It was realized that for the near future, EEA would have to rely on
hydro and oil and gas fired thermal power stations to meet the load growth.
About 4,500 MW of additional generatinq capacity were planned between 1980 and
1987 (thus more than doubling the capacity existing at the end of 1979). Of
these, 600 MW of steam electric units were to be installed under the Second
Power Project (loan 1733-EGT) and 270 MW of hi - and 300 NW of thermal under
the Third Power Project (Ln. 1886-EGT'.
2.09       The total power subsector investment program for 1978-1986 amounted
to $10.( billion, of which the Shoubrah El Kheima Tf imal Power Project was
envisaged to make up about 5 percent of the total ce tal expenditure
requirements, and the program for 1980-1987 amounted ta. US$8.2 billion of
which the Third power project was expected to represent about 7 percent of the
total investment requirements. Prior to these two projects the Bank approved,
in FY77, a Regional Electrification Project (Loan 1453-EGT) which aimed to
improve and expand electric power distribution systems in secondary and urban
centers and rural zones in Upper and Lower Egypt as part of the National Rural
Electrification Plan and to assist in institution building in the 'ower
secctor through technical assistance to the two main operating agencies, EEA
and REA.
2.10      :t is against this background that the Shoubrah Thermal and Third
Power Projects were conceived.

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01      Project Objectives.  The Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal and Third Power
projects were intended to: (i) assist EEA to meet the 1985/86 load of EEA's
interconnected system; (ii) strengthen project management capabilities in EEA,
HPPEA and REA; (iii) provide a framework for the improvement of energy prices;
and (iv) continue the institutional improvement measures, initiated in the
earlier loan (Ln. 1453-EGT), In the areas of planning, operations and
t.nancial management.
3.02      Proiect Descriptlon.  The following were the project components as
originally appraised:
A. Loan/(Credit) 1733/(235)-ECT:
(a) a thermal power station (Shoubrah El Kheima) with two 300-MW,
oil/gas-fired units to be connected to EEA's interconmected
system as the first stage of a 900-MW plant (3x300 KW)
ultimately planned for this site;
(b) a loop of about 4 km of three double-circuit 220-kV overhead
and underground transmission lines connecting the full 900-NW
Shoubra% El Kheima capacity to the Cairo North-Cairo West
section of the Cairo 220-kV ring, plus reinforcing of about 5
km of the 220-kV ring and replacement of circuit breakers at
the Cairo North substation; anid
(c) about 240-man-months of technical assistance to carry out load
research and load management studies and feasibility studies
for generation and transmission expansion.
B. Loan/(Credit) 1886/(1052-EGT):
(a) a hydro power redevelopment (4x67.5 KW) in upper Egypt (Aswan
II);
(b) the third 300-MW steam electric generating unit to complete the
Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station; and
(c) rehabilitation and extension of distribution systems in urban,
suburban and rural areas outside Cairo and Alexandria (about
6,990 km of ll-kV and 380/220 volts lines and 250 NVA of
distribution transformer capacity.
C. Loan 1886-I-EGT:
Supplemental loan to meet the shortfall in foreign exchange for:
(a) 3 x 300-MW steam generating units at Shoubrah F1 Kheima Power



-5-
station;
(b) 4 x 67 5-MW Kaplan turbines at the old Aswan Barrage; and
(c) technical assistance to EEA.
IV. CHANGE IN PROJECT SCOPE
4.01      The major components of the Second and Third Power Projects have
changed since appraisal in the following ways:
(a) Shoubrah Transmibsion (Ln/Cr. 17331935-EGT). This component
was expanded greatly to cover major strengthening of the system
to enal e transmission of power from Shoubrah and other power
stations to the load centers in greater Cairo. Originally, the
StAR had envisaged installation of about 4 km of three double-
circuit 220-kV overhead and underground transmission lines,
reinforcement of about 5 km of the 220-kV existing transmission
lines and replacement of circuit breakers at Cairo North
substation. However the component as executed consisted of:
(a) 94 km of 220-kV overheid double-circuit transmission lines
and about 36 km circuit lengt2a of the 220-kV underground
transmission lines; (b) new 220-kV substation facilities .t
Bassous and additions/ modifications to nine existing 220-kV
substations; and (c) required relaying, microwave and
telecommunication facilities.   Project design was flexible
enough to allow for these changes, and the Bank agreed to
provide part funding for the 500/220-kV El Tebbin substation
(para 5.04) which was an essential part of the 500 kV
transmission system being built by EEA to evacuate power from
the enlarged Shoubrah El Kheima power station to meet the load
growthi in the Cairo region.
(b) Regional Electrification (Ln./Cr. 1886/1052)-EGT. This
component was significantly expanded without increasing the
amount of Bank participation mainly due to cost savings and
increased budget provisions. Two substations (Zarqa and
Zagazig II) and 10 km of 66 kV lines, not originally in the
project ecope, were added; 929 villages as against 798
estimated at the time of appraisal, were electrified;and
distribution transformer capacity was increased from 250 MVA
(appraisal estimate) to 380 MVA.



- 6 -
(c) Technical Assistance (Ln./Cr. 1733/935 and 1886-l-EGT)
The original foreign exchange funding for this component', was
mainly for the load research and load management study, and
feasibility studies for generation and transmission expansion.
Considering rapid expansion of EEA's operations this funding was
insufficient to meet EEA's requirements. Therefora, during project
implementation, the funding for technical assistance was increased
to provide assistance to EEA in manpower planning and training of
its staff and purchase of urgently needed equipment (paras 5.07 and
8.04).
1/ The technical assistance component did not include the engineering
consultancy services for the Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station, Aswan
II hydropower station and Regional Electrification components. The funding
for these services was included in the cost of these components.

V. PROJECT COSTS
5.01           Table A, below gives a comparison of the project cost at: (a)
appraisals of Loans/Credits 1733/935 and 1886/1C   ZGT; (b) appraisal of the
supplemental loan 1886-I-EGT in February 1984; a.. (c) the actual
(provisional) estimated by the PCR mission in October 1989. The SAR
estimated costs of v.z project components were derived by combining the SAR
costs of these ce ¢   .s under the Loans/Credits 1733/935 and 1886/1052-EGT.
The revised estiL t . ;.oan 1886-1-EGT) are costs of the project components as
revised by the aF  -:- al mission (February 1984) for the supplemental loan
1886-1-EGT. The aztual project cost is in fact provisional since the
arbitration tribunal has not given its final decisions on the three
arbitration proceedings filed by the civil works contractor of Aswan II
component and awards of contracts ( for Packages A and B ) for the El Tebbin
substation are yet to be finalized by EEA.

5.02      During the period 1979 through 1989, the Egyptian Pound has been devalued
substantially from LE 0.7 equal to one US$ to LE 2.58 to a US$. Therefore, for the
purposes of comparison of actual costs of individual project components to those at
appraisals, we compared local costs of the project components in the local currency
(LE) and the foreign costs of the components in US$. Thus, there was about 70% cost
increase in the local cost element of the total project cost compared to the SAR
estimates and about 9X increase in the local cost element compared to the revised
estimates (Ln 1886-1-EGT) at appraisal of the supplemental loen in February 1984.
Similarly, regarding the foreign cost element of the total project cost, there was a
reduction in cost of about 4% compared to the SAR cost estimates and an increase in
cost of about 1% compared to the revised cost estimates at appraisal of the
supplemental loan. The nominal increases in local and foreign cost elements of the
total project cost compared to the revised estimates in February 1984 does not
reflect the significent deviation in the local and foreign cost elements of some of
the individual project components. The following paragraphs discuss in detail the
reasons for such deviations.
5.03      Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station.  The 22.5X reduction in the
actual foreign cost of the component compared to the cost at appraisal was due to:
(a) selection of outdoor type design for the boilers and turbines compared to the
conventional approach of installing the boilers and turbines in a covered space as
envisaged at appraisal(about 1.5%); (b) revision of procurement packages based on
the components agains; the island type approach considered at appraisal wherein
similar equipment, such as piping, instrumentation, valves etc.. gets divided in
different contracts such as turbine or boiler islands (about 7.01); (c) shortening
of schedule for commercial operation of the three units at Shoubrah by about 12
months (about 6.5X); (d) stronger US dollar compared to other currencies, specially,
the Japanese yen and French franc (about 1.51); and (e) provision for physical and
price contingencies which remained unutilized on completion of the component (about
6%). The 12.7% increase in the local cost component was mainly due to increase in
the local cost element of the operating and miscellaneous buildings contract (about
5%); and about 10% increase in the local inflation rate compared to that assumed at
appraisal (about 7.7%).
5.04      Shoubrah - Transmission.  As mentioned in para. 4.01 (a), the component
was substantially changed by EEA. The 879.11 increase in the actual foreign cost of
the component compared to that at appraisal was due to: (i) the enlarged scope of
the component (about 679.1%); and (ii) the inclusion of the El Tebbin substation
(about 200%). Due to its importance, EEA requested and the Bank agreed in January
1987 to provide US$19.8 million (surplus funds from other categories) for the
substation. Later, by October 1989, this surplus was reduced to US$ 14.22 million
as EEA desired to have US$4.5 million for the preconstruction phase consultancy
services for the Fourth Power Project and about US$1 million additional spares for
the equipment at Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station. The increase in the
actual local cost of the component was mainly due to its enlarged scope.
5.05      Aswan II Hydropower Station.  As mentioned in para. 5.01, the actual local
and foreign costs for the component are tentative since the arbitration tribunal is
yet to give its decision on the three cases lodged by the civil works contractor



- 9 -
against HPPEA. The 71X increase in the actual local cost compared to that at
appraisal was the cumulative effect of: a) higher content of the local cost element
of the civil works (about 411) and mechanical and electrical equipment contracts
(about 15.51) compared to that assumed at appraisal; (b) extra payments to the civil
works contractor as agreed in July 1983 for delays beyond his control and due to the
payments likely to be made to him as a result of the arbitration awards (about
30.8X); and (c) a reduction in the local cost element of the engineering services
contract (about 16.3X). The 21.91 reduction in the foreign cost' of the component
compared to that at appraisal was the cumulative effect of: the lower content of
the foreign cost elements in the civil works (about 2.21), mechanical (turbines and
gates) equipment (about 12.51), and electrical (generators and switchyard) equipment
(about 121) contracts which was only partly offset by an increase (4.81) in the
foreign cost element of the engineoring services contract as a result of the delays
in finalization of the arbitration awards for the civil works contract.
5.06      Regional Electrification Phase II.  The increases of about 208.3% and
16.21 in the local and foreign cost elements of the component were mainly due to the
changes in the scope of the component by REA (para 4.01 b). The additional villages
have been electrified with locally manufactured materials and equipment giving a
higher percentage increase in the local cost element of the component compared to
the foreign cost element which mostly depended on bilateral credits.
5.07      Technical Assistance.   About US$2.5 million allocated under Loan/Credit
1733/935-EGT for the load research and load management study and for assisting EEA
in manpower planning proved inadequate to meet EEA's growing needs. It was
increased to about US$9.0 million in 1984 at appraisal of the supplemental loan
(1886-EGT-l), and later to US$13.5 million to enable EEA to cover the foreign cost
of the preconstruction phase engineering consultancy services for the Damietta
Coombined Cycle component of the Fourth Power Project. The actual (provisional)
expenditure against the technical assistance component was US$13.1 million.
/ The higher foreign cost for the Aswan II component may be partly due to
estimation of the base costs (local and foreign) in the local currency and
later converting these costs into US Dollars. The differential local and
foreign inflation rates assumed in tlhe SAR do not appear to have been effected
in the base exchange rate assumed ($1 - 0.7 LE for the life of the project).
Thus, the effective exchange rate for the component in the SAR at $1 - 0.7 LE
compares with the actual average rate of about $1 - 0.97 LE.

VI. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
6,01      Technical.   The Shoubrah El Kheima and the Third Power Projects
were designed to provide a balanced development (in generation, transmission
and distribution) and to help EEA meet the electricity demand forecast for
1985/1986. The project concept and design were appropriate and timely. In
1983, EEA's net installed generation capacity was roughly equal to the demand,
with insufficient spare capacity available to cover maintenance outages and
breakdowns. As a result, significant load shedding had to be resorted to in
order to regulate power demand. The additional generation from the Shoubrah
El Kheima and Aswan II power stations in 1985/1986 assisted EEA in reducing
the load shedding in those years and, as a consequence, in mitigating the
adverse impact on industrial and agricultural production in the subsequent
years. Table B below compares the actual maximum demands and electricity
sales for 1978 through 1988/1989 against the forecasts at appraisals of the
Shoubrah El Kheima and Third Power Projects. The comparison for 1978 and 1979
is based on the calendar years while that from 1980/81 onwards is based on the
fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending June 30 of the next calendar year. It
can be seen that the appraisal (Shoubrah El Kheima Project) forecast for the
period 1984/85 through 1986/87 is close to the actual while the forecast for
the period 1987/88 onward was higher than the actual due to the slowing down
of the economic activity in the country.

6.02      Financial Plan.  The design of the financing plan for the two
projects was complex.  In fact, the Third Power Project was considered to be
" three projects rolled into one" by the Bank.  In spite of the coordinated
efforts by the Bank and the Government, the financial plans for the foreign
exchange requirements for the projects were only about 80X complete at the
time of Board presentation of the Shoubrah El Kheima and Third Power Projects.
The foreign exchange gap was expected to be covered through export credits and
OPEC Special Fund. The Government assured the Bank that it would provide the



- 11 -
funds required to close the foreign exchange gap in case other sources did not
materialize. On the basis of this assurance, the projects were presented to
the Board for approval. During implementation, however, the anticipated
foreign exchange funding did not materialize, and the Government also found it
difficult to come up with the required funds. Therefore, the Government
requested the Bank to provide supplemental foreign exchange funding of US$59.0
million for timely completion of the project components.
6.03      Technical Assistance.  In retrospect, the design of the technical
assistance component was found to be inadequate to meet the project
objectives, and this led to a need to increase Bank funding (para 5.07).
6.04      Einancial.  The design of financial covenants (para 8.10) suffered
from two defects. First, decisions on financial targets were based on over-
optimistic assumptions about Egypt's ability to adjust to higher energy
prices. As a result of a lack of policy space, energy prices were adjusted at
a much slower rate and it was not possible for the power subsector to achieve
the covenanted financial targets (para 8.10). Second, the methodologies for
computing some of the targets (e.g. rate of return on revalued assets) were
not agreed between the Bank and the borrower before loan approval. This led
at times to difficulties in obtaining agreement between Bank supervision
missions and the borrower on the values of computed targets.
6.05      Organization.  The design of the organizational setup of the
borrower EEA (and the executing agencies - REA and HPPEA) for implementation
of the project components was satisfactory. However, the organizational setup
of EEA for distribution of electricity was not satisfactory and changed
considerably.   On March 6, 1978, the Government created seven electricity
distribution companies (EDCs) as subsidiaries of EEA.   This setup did not
function as desired because: (a) EEA was unable to provide guidance to the
EDCs or exercise proper control over these companies as EEA was busy with the
ever-increasing generation and transmission activities; and (b) dual
accountability of the five rural EDCs - to EEA for the distribution activities
and to REA for supervision of the construction activities. In 1980, the
Government decided to place the EDCs directly under MEE, and in 1983 created
the Electricity Distribution Authority (EDA) (para 8.03) to coordinate and
oversee the activities of these companies. The Fourth Power Project approved
by the Board in June 1989, stressed the need for implementing a proper
management information system for the power subsector.
VII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Proiect Schedule
7.01      Part III, Table 4 gives the scheduled and the actual completion
dates of the project components. The original schedule for commissioning of
the units at Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station was modified (delayed by
about eight months) during the appraisal of the Third Power Project due to the
initial delays in finalizing procurement packages suitable for the financing



- 12 -
arrangement for the project component. However, with the procurement
arrangement based on the component type packaging instead of the island type
packaging, and with the outdoor type of design for the boilers and turbines
(para. 5.03), it was possible to improve upon the commissioning of the three
units at Shoubrah so as to commission the power station three months ahead of
the original schedule drawn up during the appraisal of the Shoubrah El Kheima
Power Project (Ln./Cr. 1733/935). However, commissioning of the four units at
Aswan II hydropower station was delayed by about 16 months mainly due to
delays in completion of the civil works (para. 7.02). The scope of the
regional electrification component was considerably increased (paras. 4.01 (b)
and 5.06) and, therefore, the scheduled and the actual dates for completion of
the project component are not strictly comparable.
7.02      Procurement.  There were no major procurement problems except for
the civil works contract for the Aswan II hydropower station. At the time of
finalization of the contract award for the civil works in December 1980, the
Ministry of Irrigation informed the Bank thar according to the Egyptian law,
the ministry was solely responsible for any construction to bs carried out on
the two banks of the Nile river. Therefore, the staff from the ministry
should be assigned to the implementing agency, HPPEA for supervision of the
contracts for Aswan II. The MEE was however concerned that the proposal of
the Ministry of Irrigation could delay the startup of the civil works
contract. The issue was amicably settled and the arrangements for project
management as agreed by the Government with the Bank were continued. However,
other trouble arose in implementation of the contract. The contractor
complained about: (i) delays in handing over of the site by HPPEA; (ii)
changes in the design made by the engineering consultant (the Engineer); (iii'
the Engineer giving priority for utilizing the contractors equipment for works
other than those under the civil works contract; and (iv) delays in payment of
the contractor's invoices. The civil works contractor gave notice of
termination of the contract and stopped work on April 23, 1983. To resume the
work, the contractor requested additional payment of about LE20 million and
the extension of the contractual completion period by about 18 months. The
contractor resumed the work on July 17, 1983 after a compromise was reached
according to which HPPEA agreed to pay the contractor LE5.9 million to
compensate for the delay,, extended the time for completion of the works by
ten months and agreed to review and settle the contractors claims for the
extra works done due to the design changes. In addition, it was agreed by
HPPEA to indemnify other contractors for any eytra costs' incurred by them as
a result of the delay in completion of the civil works contract.   Even after
commencement of the works, the relations between the contractor and the
Engineer did not improve. The contractor disagreed with the Engineer's
decision on payments for the extra works and referred the dispute about
payments for the extra work, to arbitretion in June 1984. Till March 1990,
the arbitration tribunal had given partial awards in two of the three cases
lodged by the contractor.
I/ These extra costs, mainly due to storage of equipment and bank charges,
amounted to LE2.0 million and US$1.5 million.

7.03      Project Risks.  The project risks foreseen at appraisal were:
(a) delays in project implementation of the Shoubrah El Kheima
component due to limited local construction capability and
cumbersome administrative procedures;
(b) difficulties in the underwater excavation of foundations for
Aswan II hydropower station;
(c) inadequate performance of EEA under existing financial covenants
(1453 and 1733-EGT), and weakness of the borrower in financial
managemeilt.
(d) unsecured financing for the electrical and mechanical equipment
for the Shoubrah and Aswan II project components;
(e) delays in construction of fuel supply infrastructure for the
Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station; and
(f) recurring inefficient use of available manpower and difficulties
in cutting down overstaffing.
7.04      Risks (a) and (b) were covered by appointing engineering consultants
for supervision of the Shoubrah and Arwan II project components. Risk (c)
continues to persist. EEA could not achieve the covenanted rate of return on
revalued assets (para 8.11), and much remains to be done in the area of
financial management training. With regard to risk (d), the Bank's reliance on
Government assurance to bridge the financing gap proved unwise since
Government was unable to provide the required financing (para 6.02). Risk (e)
was averted, as Government made the fuel supply available to the power station
in August 1984. Risk (f) continues, as the problem of surplus staff remains
(para 8.02).
7.05      Disbursement.  Part III, Tables 3A and 3B show Cumulative Estimated
and Actual Disbursements. As of March 1, 1990 an amount of US$27.36 million
out of US$59.0 million remained undisbursed for Loan 1886-1-EGT. The closing
date for this loan was extended for the fourth time by one year to June 30,
1991 to allow for disbursement against the contract for package A of the 500
kV/220-kV El Tebbin substation. Part III, Table 3C gives the allocation of
funds by the project components and the status of disbursement against this
loan.
VIII. PROJECT RESULTS
8.01      The Project's main development objective of assisting EEA to meet
the rapidly growing demand for power has been met. Tn addition, commissioning
of Aswan II hydropower station assisted EEA in full utilization of water,
which earlier used to be discharged through the gates of the Aswan dam without
generating electricity. However efforts ta improve institutional (para 8.02)



- 14 -
and financial (paras 8.10-8.15) performance have not been equally successful.
Institutional Performance
8.02       EEA remains a highly centralized organization with cumtersome
administrative systems, little delegation of authority and little coordination
between technical and financial staff especially in planning matters.
However, it is rapidly being modernized, in particular, in planning and
setting up of a management information system. The staff strength of EEA is
characterized by shortage of qualified and experienced staff for certain
functions such as engineers, technicians and accountants and over-staffing in
clerical and semi-skilled functions. EEA however has been addressing these
problems over the years by intensifying its training program and providing
bonus to retain qualified staff and restricting the recruitment of staff for
activities which are already overmanned.
8.03      At the time of appraisal of Loans 1733 and 1886-EGT, a major problem
had been the lack of an adequate and coherent accounting and management
information system for the subsector as a whole. The problem worsened by the
fact that while EEA had the need and obligation to collect information from
the EDCs, it had no formal control over the companies. In November 1983 the
EDA was formed to act as a holding company with overall management and control
functions over the seven Distribution Companies. The EDA now provides a
formal channel through which EEA can assemble subsector data necessary for
management and planning decisions. Furthermore EEA has initiated actions to
analyze, redesign and better document its accounting and management
information systems as well as to train its accountants, commercial and
finance staff. These activities are being carried out as part of the UNDP's
Electricity and Energy Data Bank Project.
8.04      Under the Shoubrah El Kheima Project (Ln./Cr. 1733/935) the Bank
assisted EEA to continue the activity, started under the first power project
(Loan 1453-EGT), of formulating and implementing a five-year plan for Manpower
Development and Training. Based on this plan, the following areas of training
were undertaken under the projects:
(i) Overseas training of Finance staff in selected topics. About
US$0.5 million was provided under Loan 18d6-l-EGT to upgrade the skills of
EEA's finance and accounting staff through external training for its middle
and top management groups. A total of 41 staff consisting of 30 mid-level, 10
top-level managers and one financial trainer received training (about 128.5
manmonths) abroad from consultants. EEA was fully satisfied with the results
of this training. A contributing factor to this success was that the
consultants were part of a utility sim.lar to EEA, and this enabled them to
better understand the problems of the trainees and exchange views with them.
EEA is likely to continue the services of the consultants under the Fourth
Power Project.
(ii) Training of Technical Personnel.  About US$0.65 million was
provided under Loan 1886-I-EGT for -raining of EEA's staff in the areas of



- 15 -
.nstrumentation and controls for a total of about 180 manmonths. EEA found
this training to be satisfactory.
(iii) Plant-S2ecific Training of EEA's Personnel.  Due to the
critical shortage of experienced plant operators, plant-specific training of
EEA's personnel was carried out by the engine?ring consultant and suppliers of
plant and equipment. The first phase of the in-plant training for the Shoubrah
Station was completed in 1985 under Loan 1733-EGT and additional funding (US$2
million) was provided under the Supplemental Loan 1886-1-EGT for the second
phase of this training. In addition the contracts for supply and i.astallation
of equipment for the Shoubrah and Aswan II components had provided for
training of the borrower's staff.
8.05      A number of studies (Part III, Table 6C) were also carried out under
the various loans/credits. The studies suffered from implementation delays,
and not all recommendations were implemented by EEA, yet they were considered
useful to the extent that the Government/EEA has now a better understanding of
the issues handled in these studies.
8.06      Within the technical assistance component visual aids and word
processors for the training centers were procured and are being put to good
use. Further, to assist EEA in carrying out the Load Research and Load
Management Study, load recorders and data translation equipment were purchased
and were useful in compiling and analyzing the data required for the study.
Economic Rate of Return
8.07      The rate of :oeturn calculation for the Shoubrah plant was reassessed
in light of actual cosis, tariffs and plant output. If the benefits are
valued at the shadow price for electricity' the economic rate of return
becomes 16 in real terms, as compared to 7.8X appraisal estimate (using
benefits estimated at economic values). The reason for the large difference
is that the shadow price estimate for electricity was not available at the
time of appraisal and hence a proxy based on willingness-to-pay of alternate
fuels (a lower-bound) was used instead.
8.08      The financial rate of return (FIRR) of the project was calculated to
determine the incremental impact of the project on EEA's financial viability.
The FIRR is estimated to be about 5.2X in real terms, well above EEA's average
cost of capital'. Therefore, the incremental impact of this project on EEA is
to assist it to become profitable.
II"Shadow Prices for Trade Strategy and Investment Planning in Egypt", Staff
Working Paper No. 521, was used to determine the shadow price of electricity.
21 Much of EEA's debt contains an element of subsidy. Local debt is priced
below the inflation r&te and the subsidy element of some of the foreign debt
is passed on to ERA.



- 16 -
8.09      The ex poste rate of return for the Aswan II Hydro Project is about
101 in real terms based on current tariffs as a proxy for the value of
economic benefits. Valuing the benefits at their economic value using a
shadow price of 3.32 times the current market price, increases the project
returns to 28% in real terms. Clearly, the return on this project is quite
robust given its relatively high returns even with the persistertly low
tariffs that have characterized Egypt's power sector. The returns compare
favorablv with the appraisal estimate of the rate of return on the time slice
of 6.1% based on benefits valued at tariffs and 11.51 based on willingness to
pay.
Finar.ial Performance
Rate of Return
8.10      Under lx/Cr. 1733/935 EEA agreed to a financial covenant obliginag
the power subsector (EEA and EDCs) to achieve rates of return (on revalued
assets) of 51 in 1980, 61 in 1981, 81 in 1982 and 91 in 1983 and each of the
following years. During appraisal and negotiation of the Third Power Project
Ln/Cr 1886/1052) it had become apparent that these rates of return could not
be achieved without requiring substantially high l.vels of tariff increases.
Recognizing the preponderance of subsidies in the total economy, the
Government and the Bank agreed to reduce the rate of return target to 51 in
each year so that tariffs could be adjusted in a more gradual manner in line
with the expected adjustments in the rest of the economy. Both parties also
recognized that for the revised covenants to be complied with, it was
essential that EEA be permitted to adjust its tariffs regularly so as to meet
increases in costs arising from changes in prices of its inputs, primarily
changes in fuel prices. For this purpose a clause was Included in the
Gua.antee Agreement obliging the Government to allow EEA to increase its
tariffs automatically in response to changes in the prices of fuel products
used for power production. However, during implementation the Government
would not allow EEA to increase its tariffs adequately so as to match revenue
and rate of return requirements. Thus the subsector repeatedly failed to
achieve the covenanted rates of return. During the Fourth Power Project
(approved in 1989) the Bank decided to replace the rate of retu.n covenant
with a cash generation covenant which is free of the conceptual and
methodological problems encountered with the rate of return covenant, while at
the same time it is an equally good measure of financial viability.
8.11      The variations between appraisal estimates of the rate of return
from the actual achieved rates are shown in the table below. The table also
shows the principal variables, tariffs, investment expenditures, revenues, and
depreciation which explain the differences between the rates projected at
appraisal and those actually realized.
I/ The actual returns exceed, the appraisal estimate as a result of the
project's energy output being 171 greater than expected.

8.12      The statistics indicate a lack of substantive improvement in the
subsector's financial performance as reflected in the negative rates of return
up to 1982/83, 2.5X in 1983/84, 1.91 ir 1984/85, 2.51 in 1985/86, .67X in
1986/87, and 2.5X in 1987/88. The main cause of EEA's failure to comply with
the financial covenants was its inability to adjust tariffs adequately.
During 1981-1987 the average tariff increased by about 12.7X p.a. comipared to
about 14.91 p.a. projected at appraisal. In the same period fuel prices were
increased by about 18.71 p.a. compared to about 10.41 projected at appraisal.
In 1988/89 further electricity and petroleum product price increases were
implemented, raising their total average increases during 1981-1989 to 13.71
p.a. and 14.51 p.a. respectively. Thus, EEA's inability to raise tariffs to
match those projected at appraisal and to cever the higher fuel prices was
primarily responsible for the subsector's failure to achieve the covenanted
rate of return targets. A contributing factor was the higher depreciation
expenses than those forecast at appraisal. Despite lower investment
expenditures and lower asset base, depreciation expenses were higher than at
appraisal because a low average depreciation rate of 3X was used at appraisal
instead of about 4.7X based on EEA's estimates of useful lives of its assets,
and the depreciation of the Egyptian Pound from LE 1.00 - US$0.71 in 1980 to
LE 1.00 - US$2.40 it 1987/88 had the effect of increasing the depreciation
provision on about 701 of costs of the assets which are imported. At the
Government's request, EEA has recently revised its depreciation rates to a
weighted average of about 3.1X. Since the revised rates are not based on a
proper assessment of the estimated useful lives of the subsector's assets, the
higher average depreciation rate of about 4.71 has been retained for
evaluating past performance. The supervision missions for the Fourth Power
Project are discussing this issue with EEA.
8.13      During supervision missions, an inordinate amount of time was spent
in debating the merits of revalued versus historic cost of assets, feasibility
of technically defensible revaluations, and the need to incorporate exchange
rate variations in fixed asset revaluations. These discussions which featured
in practically every supervision mission, tended to divert attention away from
the essential question of EEA's weak financial position. Not on ! was the
methodology for revaluing fixed assets for rate of return calculation purposes
not fully accepted by the Egyptians, but even more importantly, the concept of
revaluation itself was not well appreciated as later emerged during the
project's implementation.
Accounts Receivable
8.14      Under the Loan Agreements, EEA and EDCs were required to maintain
their accounts receivable at no more than three months' sales, and the
Government was obliged to take all necessary action to ensure that EEA and the
EDCs comply with this requirement. Part III, Table SB, gives the status of
the power subsector's accounts receivable. This financial objective has not
been met mainly because some large industrial consumers and some public sector
and Governmental consumers were not able to pay their bills promptly. These
increasing arrears contributed to the subsector's liquidity problems and



- 19 -
reflected the impact of the larger tariff increases (July 1985 and May 1987)
on some of the largest consumers like the Kima Fertilizer Co. and the Aluminum
Co, and also earlier reluctance by some of the other large consumers to accept
the higher tariffs. With tne expectation of higher tariffs in future, the
ability of the subsector's customers to settle their bills within their credit
periods may be further eroded. Supervision missions have recommended that EEA
should try to obtain Government approval to charge interest on overdue
accounts in order to give consumers incentives to settle their bills on time.
This proposal is under Government consideration, but no decision has been
reached. However, starting in fiscal year 1989, the Government has started a
practice of setting aside a budgetary provision to enable the subsector to
recover directly from the Ministry of Finance those public sector balances
which have become non-current.
iiebt Service Coverage
8.15      Under both the Shoubrah El Kheima and Third Power Projects, the Bank
felt that a capital structure covenant was needed to ensure EEA's continued
solvency and financial viability by keeping under review its long-term
borrowing. It was therefore agreed that EEA would not incur any long-term
debt unless the power subsector's cash generation from internal sources in the
following year was at least 1.5 times its debt service. The actual debt
service coverage ratios (Part III, Table SB) remained below the target of 1.5
times throughout the project implementation period, and yet EEA continued to
contract new long-term debt without formal consultation with the Bank. The
subsector's failure to achieve the target debt service coverage ratios was
primarily due to low tariff levels, the preponderance of debt in EEA's capital
structure and a large investment program necessitating ever-increasing
borrowing. Partly as a result of the Bank's insistence in 1983, the
Government converted about LE 529 million of its loans to EEA into equity.
This measure helped to reverse the declining trend of the subsector's debt
service capacity. Recently a high level committee comprising of
representatives from EEA and the Ministry of Finance has finalized a proposal
to convert a further LE 1.34 billion of Government loans into equity. If
implemented this measure would enable EEA's debt service coverage ratio to
increase from about .09 estimated for 1988/89 to about 1.2 in 1989/90.
Emnironmental Aspects
8.16      Air Pollution.  The current Egyptian air pollution limitation
standards are more stringent than those recommended by the Bank or required by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA. The Government agreed during
negotiations to operate at least one of the three units at Shoubrah on gas
fuel to ensure compliance with the applicable Egyptian law (particularly with
respect to sulphur dioxide emissions and their ground level concentration).
Bank funding for the Shoubrah component provided for the mobile environmental
monitoring equipment to monitor the air quality around the power station.
After commissioning of the three units at Shoubrah, EEA submitted the annual
report concerning the background air quality data and associated air quality
impact assessment. The report was reviewed within the Bank and found to be



- 20 -
satisfactory. An area of concern, however, is that in the absence of any
zoning regulations, the Shoubrah site has gradually been surrounded by
residential housing.
8.17      Water Pollution.  All waste waters at Shoubrah El Kheima thermal
power station are treated to meet the effluent guidelines according to the
Egyptian law, prior to discharge to the Nile river.
8.18      Heat Discharge.  The primary use of water in Shoubrah is for
condenser cooling. The water while flowing through the condensers condenses
the exhaust steam from the turbines and is returned to the river at an outlet
temptrature about 10°C higher than the inlet temperature of the circulating
water at the condensers.  The circulating water system is designed to ensure
adequate dispersion of the thermal effects and to maintain the thermal
gradient outside the mixing zone in the river to a maximum of 50C. This
gradient is within the lim'ts stipulated under the applicable Egyptian law for
protection of aquatic life in the river.
IX. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
9.01      The performvance of the Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station and
the Aswan II hydropower station has been satisfactory. To maintain the plant
performance within the acceptable limits, it is essential to provide
adequately trained and experienced staff for operation and maintenance during
the life of the power stations. With the rapid expansion in EEA's generation
capacity, it is essential that EEA estimates its manpower requirements to
ensure continued availability of skilled staff to efficiently manage its
assets in future.
9.02      Even on the basis of existing tariffs the projects' incremental
financial rate of return exceeds EEA's average cost of capital thus indicating
its positive contribution to EEA's profitability. However, the sustainability
of individual projects is dependent on EEA's ability as an organization to
achieve and maintain a level of financial viability necessary to support its
operations.
X. BANK PERFORMANCE
10.01.    The Bank's performance during identtfication, preparation and
supervision of both projects vas satisfactory. Frequent dialogue between the
Bank, the Borrower and the Consultants took place during the various phases of
the project cycle, and snags and difficulties were openly discussed as they
arose. During project implementation, Bank supervision missions frequently
visited Cairo to help resolve implementation problems, with the longest period
between missions occuring from February 1985 to February 1986, when only one
mission took place.



- 21 -
10.02     One of the main factors contributing to the overall satisfactory
performance of the Bank on these projects, was that its knowledge of the power
subsector in Egypt was up-to-date and adequate, based on information and
contact with the borrower during the First Power Project (Loan 1453-EGT) and
during its role as executing agency for a UNDP-finanr d survey of the power
subsector carried out in 1976/1978 and for a follow-up UNDP project to
strengthen EEA's capabilities in combustion turbine and boiler technology,
operation and maintenance. In spite of EEA being in default of the financial
covenants under the two projects, the Bank continued its dialogue with the
borrower regarding the power subsector during project implementation and
supervision in the hope of resolving the energy pricing issue w,ith the
Government.
10.03     Despite constant efforts and escalating the energy pricing and
energy policy issues at the highest levels, the Bank was unable to reach
agreement with the Government on energy pricing issues. Even though the
Government realized the importance of the issue, it could not take adequate
steps to increase the energy prices due to the political and social
consequences of such measures. Further, increasing the energy prices to
international levels would have had an impact on other sectors and the
Government was hesitant to increase energy prices without studying the pros
and cons of such a step. Due to disagreements on the energy price increases
there was an interruption in Bank lending to this important sector from 1984
to 1989. In 1989, however, an agreement was reached on acceptable energy
price increases and on a goal of raising the domestic energy prices to
international levels by June 1995. The Bank then approved the Fourth Power
Project, Loan 3103-EGT, on June 28, 1989.
XI. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
11.01     Initially, EEA had difficulty in deployment of adequate staff for
supervision of the project related activities. Lack of a^equate project staff
resulted in initial delays in project implementation. This deficiency was
removed in the latter half of the project implementation period. This
especially was the case with the Load Research and Load Management Study and
with training of EEA's staff in operation and maintenance of the Shoubrah El
Kheima thermal power station. However, from the beginning, EEA deployed
adequate consultant resources on the project.
XII. PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTANTS AND CONTRACTORS
Consultants
12.01     The services of three engineering consultants were utilized for the
engineering design, preparation of bidding documents and specifications, and
management and supervision during corstruction and commissioning of the three
major project components--Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power station, Aswan II



- 22 -
hydropower station and Regional Electrification.  The performance of all three
consultants was satisfactory.
12.02     Under the technical assistance component, EEA appointed five
consultants for: (i) Load Research and Load Management Study; (ii) manpower
planning and training in instrumentation and controls; (iii) training of
finance and accounts staff; (iv) feasibility study for Aswan (Phase I); and
(v) preconstruction phase engineering consultancy services for the Damietta
Combined Cycle component of the Fourth Power Project. The performance of all
five consultants was satisfactory.
Contractors
12.03     Overall performance of the contractors was satisfactory.  The
difficulties experienced during implementation of the civil works contract for
the Aswan II component have been discussed in para. 7.02. The tribunal
hearings for all claims under the first case (No. 5029) is scheduled for
completion by June 1990 and the final award is expected to be given by the
tribunal soon thereafter. A partial arbitral award for the second case (No.
5448) was granted in September 1989 and the implications of the award are
being studied by HPPEA. The tribunal hearings for the third case (No. 5821)
are scheduled to be started in 1990 and the final arbitral award is likely to
be given by June 1991. The contractual relationship between the executing
agency (HPPEA) and its Engineer on the one hand, and the civil works
contractor on the other, were not cordial. However, it is difficult to put
the blame on any one party to the contract.
XIII. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
13.01     Bank supervision reports were complete and well prepared.  Relevant
problems were highlighted and changes in project costs carefully tracked.
13.02     EEA and the implementing agencies (REA, HPPEA) were informed of the
Bank's reporting requirements immediately after loan signing. In general,
regorting on the physical progress of the Project was satisfactory, and both
REA and its consultants were actively involved in the preparation of the
Project progress reports.  Financial reporting however, was less satisfactory.
Audited consolidated accounts of the power subsector, though comprehensive and
thorough, were almost always late in reaching the Bank (reports were more than
six months late). This is mainly due to accounting problems in EDCs, the
consolidation process of EEA and EDCs' accounts, and reluctance by auditors to
issue an audit report on consolidated accounts, as under EZyptian law the
auditors are required to audit the accounts of EEA and of the EDCs and to
issue separate audit reports. Delays in submitting audited consolidated
accounts should be reduced substantially when the actions to improve the MIS
are taken.

Iden      A_pr,  & Neg      The main issues raised during the various stages of the project cycle were related to
(i) project costs; (ii) project finamncig plan; (iii) enyironmental concerns; (iv) economic rate of return
of the project; (v) financial performance under the Regional Electrification project; and (vi) arrangement
for fuel and its pricing.
1/ Delays in Effectiveness: First extension from Jan 1/80 to April 1, 80. Govt. requested Bank to extend by
90 days in order to satisfy the remaining conditions of loan effectiveness. Mainly engaging consultant
for engineering services and the timing to achieve a minimum 5SZ rate of return on EEA's revalued net
fixed assets in operation in 1980.
2/ Closing: By June 30, 1986 the original closing date, Cr:$.04 mill. & Ln. $8.5 mill. Bank/IDA agreed to
extend closing date to allow balance of funds to be disbursed (mainly for spare parts and technical
assistance). A second extension was requested and agreed to in December '87. At that time $84.9 remained
undisbursed out of Loan 1733-UT. It was agreed that 84.5 million of this anount could go towards the
funding requirements of the pre-construction phase of consultancy services for the Fourth Power Project
which was delayed.

Issues raised during each phase of the project cycle:
Id/Fra:  (i) Comosition of the Project: Project is really three projects rolled into one therefore need
to get management approval for increased manpower requirements for appraisal; (ii) Co-Finamna: Large
amount of co-financing required would require a major effort under uncertain availability of participants;
Mii) Economlc Justification To be presented for each component separately and for project as a whole;
(iv) tlreement on training program; (vi) EeA's financial performanee.
Annraisal: (i) Tariffs: Need for improved tariffs for electricity in line with the rate of return covenant
in Loan 1733-DGT; (ii) Tax on Electricity Consumntion: Government should be urged to consider foregoin8 tax
in faor of EEa as a possible  easure for raising EeA's revenues.
1/ Effectiveness - 1888/1052-EGT. EA requested a 60 day extension to finish ratification procedures.
However given, that EA was likely to be in default of the ROR covenant under both (1733-EGT) loan and
(1888) loan Bank wanted to ensure that the Govt. had in fact taken some measures regarding the increase
in energy prices. Since there were indications that no energy price increases will likely to be
effective prior to the new budget i.e. July 1. 198, Bank proposed a 90 day extension to July 7, 1981.
Effectiveness - 1886-1-KG?. To allow time for completion of formalities.
v Closing Date lat Extension: EA requested extension of the closing date by one year to allow completion
of aetivities related to the operating building at Shoubrab and the El-Tebbin substation, which is
essential for reliabl evacuation of Shoubrah generation.
2rd Extension: To allow EKA to implement the procurement of additional spare parts and equipment for the
El-Tebbin station; to incorporate modifications of the wate water sytem and complete the construction
of the Shoubrah Operation building.
3rd Extesion: To enable funds to be fully disbursed against the El-Tebbin substation, the Shoubrah
operations buildWing and the TAS cmponents.
4th Extenion for 1886-1-EGT only: for completing disbursements against package A of the El-Tebbin
substation, and the civil works contract for Awan II after the awards are finalized by the arbitrator.
Note: Since 1888-1-EKG  ws provided in the form of an mendment to the loan agreement for 1886-EGT (of
which credit 1052-EGT forms a part) extension of the Loan/Credit 1886/1052-KGT was also necessary.
3/ Hot yet completed due to delay in commissioning of the El-Tebbin substation.

Load Reseatch and Manasement Studies Loan 17331(935) & 1886-1-EGT
Purpose
The studies would review energy usage and survey consumers and system load eharacteristics to identify ond
evaluate measures for conserving and controlling the use of electrical energy through social progras and
techrical means. The results of the study are intended to influence electricity consumption pattens in a
manner which will result in an economically optimu utilization of plants and fuels available to EEA. The
study will require a duration of 3 years and about 300 manmouths of professional services. Preliminary
phase of the load Research and Mnagement Report issued 04/30/84.
Status
A number of studies have been completed end received by the Bank. Further work in load research and load
management is being carried out by the consultant and is expected to be completed by end December 1990.
Irnact
One of the reports -eceived concerns the cement industry which could reduce its marxi-m demand without
affecting cement production, if ERA offers tariff incentives to the cement industry. The reduction in
maximu demand of the cement industry would release a portion of ERA's installed genarating to meet
electricity demand of other consumers. However. the recoendations have not been implemented partly
because the eriating tariffs are onUly about 25-30X of the economic cost of supply.
rainin  and Manuower Study:
Purcose;.
D?he main objectives of this study were to quantify the skilled manpower requirements and shortfalls over the
?:le-year period (1982-87). in order to proivde a basis for a five year Recruitment and Training Plan; and
to highlight the major issues which have an effect on the recruitment, retention and mobility of staff, for
tlF purpose of promoting positive reactions and policy decisions, to help alleviate the cause a of the
craent deteriorating situation. The first report concentra'eed on the area of greatest concern, namely
Power Station staffing, and a second report focused on the three areas of Transmission; the Central and Zone
Dispatab'ng Centres; and the EA and Zone Headquarters.
status:
Power Station Report issued in September 1982.
Transmission, Dispatching Centres and Headquarters Report issued in December 1982.
Imact:
Based on the fitdings of this study several areas of training were undertaken under the project (see para
8.04).
