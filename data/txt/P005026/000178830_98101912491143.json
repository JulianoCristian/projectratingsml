{"cdata!": "The objective of the Third Power Project\n            is to help meet the electricity load forecast through 1986.\n            The project will consist of three different components: (i)\n            an extension of the old Aswan hydropower station; (ii) the\n            completion of the Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station,\n            north of Cairo; and (iii) the rehabilitation and extension\n            of distribution facilities in urban, suburban and rural\n            areas outside Cairo and Alexandria. Specifically the project\n            will comprise: (i) four 67.5 MW Kaplan turbines; (ii) a 300\n            MW steam electric generating unit; and (iii) about 7,000kms\n            of 11-kv and 380/220 volts lines and 250 MW of distribution\n            transformer capacity. The Qattara Hydropower and Renewable\n            Energy Resources Project Authority will be responsible for\n            the construction of the hydropower component, the Egyptian\n            Electricity Authority for the thermal power unit and the\n            Rural Electricification Authority for the regional\n            electrification component. The project will meet primarily\n            industrial needs and also supply growing urban and rural\n            demands. Physical risks of the project are those related to\n            difficult underwater excavations for the hydropower\n            component. Also, there are certain risks related to\n            EEA's financial performance."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
