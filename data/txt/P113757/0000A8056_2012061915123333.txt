                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the program (APL) is to support decentralized delivery of basic services in Sierra Leone. The development objective of Phase I of the program is:
                         (a) to strengthen Government capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability of Local Councils' funding; and (c) to
                         strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project objectives, design, and implementation were intrinsically linked with the country context, building upon gains accomplished under Bank and partner projects addressing
                         the delivery of basic service sectors, public sector management and decentralization and supporting policy of dialogue on local governance. The project design was cognizant of the
                         country’s ongoing development objectives and challenges as outlined by the Government of Sierra Leone's Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Assistance Strategy objectives
                         of protecting basic services and improving human development outcomes by improving the predictability for LC funding and providing capacity development support to Local

                         objectives addressed major reforms needed to: (a) strengthen the Recipient’s capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) improve the availability and predictability of funding for
                         Local Councils; and (c) strengthen the Recipient's intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.

                         With regard to objective (a), it is also important to note that project management improved over the implementation period and promoted an inclusive approach to improved decision
                         making and strategic planning. The transparent approach used by councils in comparison to Ministries have allowed for an effective citizen feedback loop. The PEFA assessment
                         carried out by the World Bank found that the local councils had better financial management and procurement capacity than line Ministries which had originally handled service
                         delivery -in fact local councils received the highest PEFA rating. The target to have the number of local councils meeting their 75% of their output targets has reached 11 councils but
                         the target was 15. The gap is due to the fact that many councils developed overambitious programs which could not be implemented within the the annual envelope and stretched
                         out implementation over a couple of years. But most of the intermediate indicators were achieved en-route to achieving these PDO outcomes. With regard to (b) and (c) the project
                         kept up with its goal to improve Government transfers to local councils are predictable as all quarterly transfers out of the national budget have been effected according to an agreed
                         schedule and in full (with the exception of weak reporting on the part of the local council) - in fact Government transfers reached councils quicker each quarter than project transfers
                         which were also on time and the share of government revenues going to local transfers rose to 34% end of project against the target of 30%. What is even more important is the
                         Government’s own transfers were timely and transparent. The transfer amounts were publicized nationally and at council level. The Local Councils also put in place notice boards
                         showing budgets and expenditures to inform citizens. The target to reduce the number of grants from 9 to 4 (which was designed to increase the flexibility of councils has been
                         reached in spirit because it became impossible to reduce the target below 6 because of the need to separate primary and secondary in both health and education (this was reported
                         to the Board when the second phase of the APL was approved).

                         The breakdown by component for the ratings is as follows: (i) component 1: Local council grants; satisfactory; (ii) component 2-capacity development; satisfactory; (iii) component 3-
                         program management; satisfactory. These objectives were achieved. The procurement delays for the community score cards resulted in a delayed start and the results from the pilot
                         will be available during the next phase which has been approved by IDA's board. These findings were meant to inform decision making during the second phase in any case and will
                         continue to enhance transparency and accountability under the program.

                         The Bank’s continued engagement with the country facilitated and promoted the coordination of existing operatio ns in alignment with the proposed intervention. In addition, the
                         convening power of the Bank was leveraged to promote the ‘umbrella’ concept, helping the Government to coordinate existing work and to attract additional support during the
                         second phase of the APL. The European Union has already signed on the co-financing agreement and DFID is considering adding funds.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission held extensive discussions on the implementation of the program and reached the following key decisions:

                         1. With the finalization of the Environmental Social Safeguards Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), the lacuna in the safeguards area have been
                         addressed.
                         2. The issue of mainstreaming the decentralization secretariat (DecSec) into the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLGRD) has been pending for a long time
                         and as fulfillment of the effectiveness conditions for the second phase, the Government has sent a time bound action plan.
                         3. All triggers for the second phase of the APL met with the exception of trigger no. iii (reducing the number of government grants to LCs to fund education, health and sanitation,
                         rural water, solid waste management services and social assistance services from nine to six by FY12). The original target was unrealistic because of the need to separate education
                         and health grants between primary and secondary. The revised target was approved by the World Bank Board as part of the Phase II approval package.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
