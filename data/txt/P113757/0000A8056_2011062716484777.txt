                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the program (APL) is to support decentralized delivery of basic services in Sierra Leone. The development objective of Phase I of the
                         program is: (a) to strengthen Government capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability of Local Councils'
                         funding; and (c) to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR follows the Mid-term review. The project is largely on track and implementation progress is now being upgraded from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory as there have
                         been no further delays in the disbursement of component 2 which was the original reason for the lower rating. The breakdown by component for the ratings is as follows: (i)
                         component 1: Local council grants; satisfactory; (ii) component 2-capacity development; satisfactory; (iii) component 3-program management; satisfactory. The moderately
                         satisfactory rating on component 1 during the previous ISR was due to delays experienced in the disbursement of the local council grants. The reasons for the delay have been

                         addressed and there have been no further delays. It is also important to note that project management has improved over the implementation period and that the project has kept up
                         with its goal to improve Government transfers to local councils predictable as all quarterly transfers out of the national budget have been effected according to an agreed schedule

                         Contracting the community monitoring pilot NGOs has taken longer than expected and the project will need at least a six month extension to allow the full year pilot to be completed.

                         The mission held extensive discussions on the implementation of the program and reached the following key decisions:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         1. The MTR found several problems which were affecting full performance of the first phase. The MTR Aide Memoire and management letter which is attached discusses all of them
                         and the agreements reached going forward. One area of concern is the lack of technical support for local councils which was to be provided by the line Ministries and for which
                         funding had been made available in the project from a demand driven window but which was never requested by the line Ministries. The mission has requested the decentralization
                         Secretariat to proceed with supply driven technical support for line Ministries to help and guide local councils using results based agreements.
                         2. The mission underlined that World Bank rules do not permit new construction in the absence of a Resettlement Policy Framework which has been widely disseminated in the
                         country.
                         3. The issue of mainstreaming the decentralization secretariat into the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLGRD) has been pending for a long time. There is a
                         problem of absorbing the current personnel into MoLGRD given existing civil service pay structure but the mission reminded the goverernment that issue of mainstreaming of the
                         functions of the decentralization secretariat into organigram of MoLGRD is essential even while work is being done in the interim by project financed specialists.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
