                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the program (APL) is to support decentralized delivery of basic services in Sierra Leone. The development objective of Phase I of the
                         program is: (a) to strengthen Government capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability of Local Councils'
                         funding; and (c) to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is largely on track and implementation progress is rated moderately satisfactory largely due to the delays in the disbursement of component 2, which constitutes 80
                         percent of total project funds, and lag in key related indicators. The breakdown by component for the ratings is as follows: (i) component 1--local council grants; moderately
                         satisfactory; (ii) component 2-capacity development; satisfactory; (iii) component 3-program management; satisfactory. The moderately satisfactory rating on component 1 is due to
                         delays experienced in the disbursement of the local council grants. Therefore, the project has not been able to meet its target to make timely quarterly transfers to local councils.

                         This is due to initial delays with effectiveness followed by serious delays (about six months) caused by a glitch which resulted in the inability of the World Bank disbursement
                         department to give electronic access to the IPAU to submit withdrawal applications. It is also important to note that project management has improved over the implementation period

                         and that the project has kept up with its goal to improve Government transfers to local councils predictable as all quarterly transfers out of the national budget have been effected
                         according to an agreed schedule and in full (except in cases of inadequate reporting on the part of the local council.)
