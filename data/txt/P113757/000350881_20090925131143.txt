1.        Following a brutal, decade-long civil war that killed 20,000 people and displaced half
the population, Sierra Leone has been on a path of reconciliation, reconstruction, and
stabilization of its economy and governance systems. Since the end of the civil war, the country
has held parliamentary, presidential and local elections that have all been deemed free and fair.
Recovery continued for a ninth unbroken year in 2008 with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth estimated at a yearly average of 5.5 percent despite rising food and fuel prices.

2.        Nevertheless, the challenge to sustain political stability continues. There is a particular
need to strengthen the national and sub-national democratic institutions and translate the gains of
economic growth into improvements in poor people's lives. In 2008, Sierra Leone ranked last
out of 179 countries on the UNDP Human Development Index. The gaps in delivering basic
services remain substantial.

3.        The Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) embarked on a decentralization program in
2004 with a view to defuse the political tensions, improve the governance environment, and
establish an equitable and transparent resource transfer system from the center to local levels to
reduce the resource gaps and income inequalities among regions. The program has attracted
support from development partners, particularly on public financial management reforms and
Local Council (LC) capacity development. Financing of functions devolved to Local Councils
remains a Government priority and an important element of the peace building process.
Nevertheless, the initial stage of the devolution process is expected to be slow given the long
legacy of centralized power in Sierra Leone.

4.        With the onset of the global economic slowdown, Sierra Leone's real growth rates and
domestic revenue collection are expected to decrease. In turn, this could pose a risk to the
implementation of the GoSL decentralization program and in the absence of international
support, could threaten to force expenditure cuts to key basic services and LC transfers.

Trends in Human Development

5.       Pro-poor program spending has recovered in 2008 to its levels in 2002-3. During the
same period, poverty-targeted expenditures1 increased 140 percent in real terms and from 32
percent to 75 percent as a share of discretionary spending.2 Despite these positive expenditure
trends, human development and service delivery outcomes have shown only modest
improvements.3 In all three sectors which are of particular concern vis-à-vis human development

1
     As defined by annual budget speeches, poverty targeted expenditures include: health (incl. HIV/AIDS), education,
     social assistance, agriculture, marine resources, police, water supply, and power supply expenditures excluding
     salaries.
2
     Discretionary spending equals total spending minus wages, interest, statutory transfer to the National Revenue
     Agency (NRA), statutory transfers to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) and project financing.

6.        Despite recent improvements in access, availability of services, and beneficiary
satisfaction4, service quality remains constrained by problems such as the availability of essential
drugs, teaching and learning materials, staff absenteeism, and weak technical support and
guidance from the center to rural areas.

Framework for Decentralized Delivery of Basic Services

7.        The Local Government Act of 2004. To address the shortfalls in service delivery and
poor human development outcomes, the Parliament passed the Local Government Act (LGA)
and its attendant Statutory Instrument in 2004, effectively launching a program of
decentralization. The legislation provided for a phased transfer of service delivery functions
from 17 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the 19 newly-established Councils
during a transition period that extended to 2008. After that initial phase, the devolution process
was to be completed, including thorough revisions to the legal, institutional, and administrative
structures and systems in place. The first election of Councilors was held in May 2004, with a
second election in July 2008.

8.        Under the current system, LCs have the responsibility for the delivery of primary and
junior secondary education, primary and secondary health care, rural water supply, sanitation,
waste management, agriculture, youth services, social assistance, and firefighting services.
Central ministries and agencies retain the responsibility for strategic planning, setting of
standards, quality control, and monitoring. Central government also retains the responsibility for
salary payments and human resource management of sector staff seconded to LCs and facility-
level staff, as well as procurement of certain priority commodities such as textbooks and drugs.

9.        Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfer System. Under the law, three sources of financing
exist for local government services in Sierra Leone: (i) central government transfers for
devolved functions and administrative expenses; (ii) LCs' own revenues from taxes, fees,
royalties, etc.; and (iii) loans and grants from other sources. Currently, the vast majority of LCs'
funding comes from central Government transfers, in the form of grants tied to specific
expenditures (see Annex 1 for details). These expenditures are detailed in the Statutory
Instrument. The LGA specifies that these transfers are to be sufficient to allow for the continued
operation and maintenance of the devolved functions at their pre-devolution level.5 The Act also
specifies that there will be transfers tied to administrative expenses, allocated on the basis of
Councils' revenue generation capacity and expenditure needs. The vertical allocation (total
funds flowing to LCs) and horizontal distribution arrangements are to reflect capacity
considerations, especially during the transition period.

10.       The total vertical allocation is not defined a priori; rather, it represents the sum of all
sector specific vertical allocations for devolved functions. Each sector allocation has been
determined through negotiations between Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) and
each line Ministry. Once the size of the vertical envelope for each sector is established, the
horizontal distribution (between LCs) is done on the basis of formulae that take into account
equity, simplicity, transparency, stability, and budget autonomy considerations6.

11.       Future Directions. Efforts are ongoing to improve both the implementation of the
existing decentralization framework, as well as to revise key aspects of the decentralization law.
The GoSL is in the process of preparing a comprehensive decentralization policy that will inform
the revision of the Local Government Act7. The Policy, amongst other issues, will focus on (i)
improvements to the determination of the vertical allocation and the horizontal distribution of
resources amongst LCs; (ii) LC revenue mobilization mechanisms; (iii) rationalization of the
grant system and determination of the vertical allocation in a more systematic and non-
discretionary manner; and (iv) revision of the horizontal distribution formulae to better capture
relative needs. The Act is expected to be amended in mid-2010 with the improvements to the
inter-governmental fiscal transfer system to be adopted in a phased manner.

12.       Cross-cutting constraints. Beyond the work on the legal framework and the inter-
governmental fiscal transfer system, much work is needed on the other key elements which make
up the service delivery value chain, such as HR management, development planning, budgeting,
financial management and procurement, monitoring of service delivery results, and strengthening
citizen involvement in the service delivery cycle. The Government has recognized that these
constraints are present across all sectors, and therefore is committed to addressing them through
a multi-sectoral effort that aims to strengthen the entire value chain of service delivery.



5
    According to the LGA, this should apply only for the transition period. In 2009, funding was to be sufficient to
    allow for service delivery at an `acceptable' standard. However, this change has not yet been applied.
6
    These formulae are reviewed every year and published in the Government Gazette and the Local Government
    Finance Department quarterly and annual reports.
7
    Draft Policy is expected to be ready by September 30, 2009.

Trends and Progress To-Date

13.      The inter-governmental fiscal transfer arrangements now constitute a practiced system
built around the equitable distribution of 30 sectoral, sub-sectoral, administrative and
development grants allocated through transparent and objective formulae. Increasingly, the
Councils see themselves as exercising direct influence on development planning and the delivery
of services, and are continuing to take steps to engage their communities in the planning and
monitoring processes. In accordance with the Regulations, responsibility for most basic social
services has now been devolved to the Councils. Ten percent of all educational expenditures are
now assigned to Local Councils, along with complete responsibility for all primary school
programs. Progress in the health sector has been faster still, with almost 33 percent of all
spending now assigned to the LCs.

14.       Devolution of basic services and transfer of increased resources to LCs, in particular, in
health, education and water, have yielded promising results with respect to improvements in
infrastructure, availability of materials, service coverage and access.8 Success has varied in
different sectors due to a combination of institutional, legal, administrative, and financial
constraints.

15.      Considerable steps still need to be taken in order to solidify the processes of
decentralization to overcome these constraints. Notably, the planned devolution of functions is
not yet complete. There have been significant lags in the timetable for the devolution of some
functions (such as feeder roads, for example), and staffing and salaries for the devolved functions
remain centrally managed9. Despite recent announcements with respect to devolution, little real
progress is discernible on the ground (roads) or conflicting mandates confuse local execution
(water).

16.       Furthermore, LCs are not yet receiving timely or sufficient transfers. Though the share
of LC transfers as a percentage of actual discretionary central budgets increased from 6.8 percent
in 2005 to 12.3 percent in 200810, actual transfers consistently fell short of the budgeted amounts
(see Table 2). Similarly, though LC transfers as share of domestic revenues increased from 3.9
percent in 2005 to 6.9 percent in 2008, these ratios remain low compared to developing country
expenditures, where transfers to sub-national governments are about 24 percent of the total taxes
collected.11 Total transfers in Sierra Leone represent only 0.7 percent of GDP, as compared to
developing country averages of 2 percent of GDP12.

8
   Most recently, the GoSL has transferred the responsibility to procure teaching and learning materials to LCs in the
   2010 budget year while maintaining central procurement of essential drugs, equipment and textbooks to take
   advantage of economies of scale.
9
   The World Bank was informed in July 2009 that the Government will begin the transfer of part of local staff
   payroll (covering approximately 2,000 staff) to LCs gradually starting in October/November. This will entail
   central government sending rosters of staff to be paid first to LCs and LCs sending the authorization to pay to the
   banks.

    These comparisons with other developing countries may be skewed due to differences in size of devolved
   functions and how the payment of salaries for devolved functions is organized.

17.       Preliminary analysis of the cost burden of LC functions for service provision suggests
that these transfers are insufficient. As an example, the 2007 budgeted allocation for Local
Council education services was $9.7m. This comprises only one quarter of the resources needed
annually to provide education to the standard required to satisfy the Sierra Leone Poverty
Reduction Strategy (SLPRS) and MDGs, estimated to be roughly US$36.6m per annum13.
Furthermore, late or partial payment of all grants is highly problematic in terms of maintaining
service delivery. Although the GoSL has tried to protect the Local Council transfers, revenue
shortfalls and unpredictable budget support in-flows have constrained the Government's ability
to provide predictable financing. Actual transfers have never met the budgeted amounts: grants
for recurrent expenditures, including LC salaries, were only 41 percent of budgeted totals in
2007 and 75 percent in 2008. Timeliness of the transfers has also been a serious issue. In the
case of quarter four of 2008, no transfers were made, amounting to a shortfall of 6 billion Leones
(US$2.0m). Councils cannot operate efficiently or effectively without predictability in terms of
the amount and timing of their receipts from grants.

18.       Finally, certain areas of capacity and policy development will require increased support
in the coming years. Capacity development has received consistent attention since the beginning
of the decentralization program, and the significant investments in staff and elected officials'
development, in particular, have upgraded skills and fostered positive attitudes between actors.
In parallel, work has been ongoing in improving the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system and
the legal and institutional processes. Nonetheless, capacity gaps remain at the local level, and
progress has been insufficient in a number of policy and legal areas. Specific actions required to
improve decentralized service delivery include: (i) the harmonization of conflicting sectoral
legislation; (ii) the streamlining and procedural reinforcement of the grants system; (iii)
improving the planning of service delivery, including enlisting community participation; (iv)
significant expansion in local revenue collection; (v) upgrading the capacity of MDAs in their
standard-setting and monitoring roles; (vi) the identification of strategies for the attraction and
retention of the required staff for local government service; (vii) increased citizen involvement in
accountability mechanisms for Local Council programs and actions; and (viii) transferring
human resource management functions to Local Councils.

19.      The World Bank and other donors are working with the GoSL to address the above
decentralized service delivery issues through a variety of instruments.

   ·   The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Program (IRCBP) is funded by a multi-
       donor trust fund that was until recently co-financed by IDA. IRCBP provides training
       and technical assistance to LCs, helping them to better understand and perform their new
       roles. IRCBP is also supporting the dialogue with Government and providing technical
       assistance on several key issues related to the legal and policy framework for
       decentralization: (i) the revision of the LGA; (ii) the resolution of conflicts between the
       LGA and existing sectoral legislation; (iii) the completion of the devolution process; (iv)
       the clarification of relative roles and responsibilities of chiefdoms and councils; (v)
       devolution of HR management to LCs and (vi) rationalization of the grants system.
       IRCBP will close in February 2011.
   ·   Several sector investment programs provide institutional support, staff technical training,
       and financing for infrastructure development in specific sectors. Some sector programs
       are also experimenting with establishing incentive systems to retain qualified staff.
       These operations include the multi-donor Reproductive and Child Health Project
       (RCHP), the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund Grant, and
       the IDA-financed Power and Water project. All of these operations undertake activities
       at the district-level, and all work with and/or through LCs to some extent.
   ·   General Budget Support (GBS), though primarily focused on the overall macroeconomic
       framework, includes a performance trigger on the amount of transfers to LCs.

B. Rationale for World Bank Involvement

20.      Given the context described above (poor HD outcomes, a Government commitment to
moving forward with decentralized service delivery, and a series of ongoing interventions in
support of that commitment), the rationale of the proposed program is based on: (a) the need to
address gaps in the existing instruments as they relate to identified actions to improve
decentralized service delivery; and (b) the advantages of shifting to an `umbrella' program of
support for basic services which will gradually unify donor and World Bank interventions. An
"umbrella" program for basic service delivery will have the flexibility to address a variety of
constraints (including capacity development, HR issues, public financial management,
transparency and social accountability, and local governance) related to decentralized service
delivery over a 10-year period. Multiple phases will allow focus on different thematic areas.
The program will also allow a transition from vertical donor programs into a single financing
instrument supported by Government and multiple donors and consolidation of financial flows to
Local Councils, initially into earmarked sector grants, and eventually into more discretionary
block grants.

21.      Gaps in existing instruments. Though successful in increasing LCs' ability to
undertake core functions (such as procurement and FM), IRCBP does not have sufficient funds
to cover all initially planned activities. LCs still require substantial assistance, notably in the
areas of development planning, linking budgets to desired results, monitoring service delivery,
and promoting social accountability. Furthermore, IRCBP has not had adequate resources to
provide support to the MDAs. The proposed program will provide support to enhance (a) the
capacity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development
(MoIALGRD) to take the lead in championing and carrying forward the technical and political
aspects of the decentralization reform agenda, and (b) the capacity of sector line ministries to


                                                6
take on a new role in service delivery that includes the establishment of technical/quality
standards, supervision of service delivery, and monitoring of service delivery outcomes. It will
also include devolved sector staff in LC-targeted training; currently, this is being done only
partially.

22.       IRCBP has also been central to the policy dialogue between Government and donors,
particularly as concerns the legal and institutional framework, and fiscal decentralization, namely
harmonizing conflicting sectoral legislation, improving the grants system, improving local
revenue collection, and identifying appropriate HR management strategies for local cadres. To
date, however, that dialogue has not covered a number of key issues, including the fiscal transfer
system (size, distribution, timeliness, and number of grants to LCs), the institutional
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation of service delivery and to some extent social
accountability issues. The proposed operation would provide both a context for the expansion of
the policy dialogue by testing and adoption of new practices with respect to the grants system,
and for increased citizen involvement in development and monitoring of LC programs and
actions, and a platform for the continuation of that dialogue once IRCBP closes. In addition, as
the dialogue on HR management strategies for local cadres matures and HR management
functions devolve to LCs over time, in its later phases, the Decentralized Service Delivery
Program (DSDP) support would include wage payments incorporated into the grants system.

23.       Sector programs have made steady progress in reducing social infrastructure gaps and
improving access to services. Nonetheless, results in terms of quality of services and human
development indicators have lagged behind. The reasons underpinning these poor results are
myriad, complex, and interdependent, but the following all play a role: (a) inadequate staffing
(including under/un-trained staff), equipment and materials at local service delivery points; (b)
inadequate supervision and monitoring of services; and (c) low capacity for planning and
budgeting at central and local levels. Though sector programs invest in staff training, purchase
equipment and materials, and provide technical assistance for monitoring, planning, and
budgeting, these activities are usually coordinated at the central level, and confined to the sector
concerned. The proposed DSDP will complement sector programs by enhancing the capacity of
LCs to serve as cross-cutting service delivery units, able to manage investments in equipment,
training, and monitoring across all sectors. This will involve supporting capacity-building in
areas that are not particular to a given sector, but rather linked to managing a range of services.
In addition, the proposed program will work with central ministries to upgrade their capacity in
standard setting and monitoring another area that has been identified as a gap in decentralized
service delivery.

24.      GBS has proved successful in supporting macroeconomic stability, fostering public
financial management reform, and increasing funding for poverty-related expenditures.
However, the direct link between GBS and social outcomes is somewhat difficult to establish in
a decentralized system of government. In part, this is due to the fact that transmission
mechanisms between inputs in the public system and outcomes are still rudimentary ­ the
budgeting system is only slowly improving, and civil service reform remains at its initial steps.
Furthermore, fiduciary concerns have in the past meant that GBS could not be delivered in a
predictable manner, causing fiscal uncertainty and hampering the planning needed to deliver
basic services effectively. This calls for a supplementary intervention that "shortens" the



                                                 7
transmission mechanism and provides consistent financing for service delivery ­ while
continuing the building of systems through general budget support.

25.        Given the fact that unpredictable and inadequate financing remains a major impediment
to improved service delivery at the district level, perhaps the biggest gap in the coverage of
existing operations is that there is currently no intervention that supports regular financial flows
(in particular to cover expenditures costs) directly to LCs.14 As discussed above, this leaves LCs
underfunded and subject to unpredictable transfers from the central Government. The proposed
operation would therefore focus on improving the predictability, both in terms of timeliness and
size, of transfers to LCs.

26.       Moving toward an `umbrella' program of support for basic services. As Sierra Leone's
system of decentralized service delivery matures, the country's development partners will
increasingly need to adjust the modality of their support. Inter-partner coordination is already
strong in the country, as evidenced by such programs as the IRCBP, Education for All Fast Track
Initiative (EFA-FTI) and Reproductive and Child Health (RCH); nonetheless, there is significant
room to improve harmonization of interventions at the LC level. This harmonization would take
three forms: (a) the coordination (and phased consolidation) of various sector-specific programs
(World Bank and other donors) within each LC in line with LC development plans and budgets;
(b) capacity development support for LCs to manage and integrate all the technical activities
sponsored by the sector programs; and (c) common disbursement procedures and channels for
funding flows to LCs towards earmarked sector block grants, to minimize the administrative
burden they face. This approach can be considered a `third generation' of support for human
development in the country. In the immediate post-war years, the focus was on stabilization and
reestablishment of services; since that time, projects have invested in infrastructure and capacity
for particular MDAs and sectors. At present, there is scope to move toward a broader approach
that invests in all aspects of service delivery with emphasis on cross-sector needs (such as
budgeting, planning, monitoring and social accountability). Such an approach offers the
additional advantage of providing an `open mechanism' that Government can use to attract new
or additional funding to Sierra Leone. To this end, the World Bank has started working with
several donors, in particular, DFID and the EC towards developing a multi-partner MOU for
financing the program. The GoSL is setting up a PCU within Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED) which will act as an inter-ministerial coordinating body for the proposed
program among other World Bank and multi-donor programs.

27.       The breadth of the World Bank's engagement makes it the appropriate institution to
launch a multi-sector project with a focus on service delivery at the local level. Because the
World Bank manages the IRCBP, major sector investment programs, and the GBS, it has
firsthand knowledge of the strengths and limitations of those programs, and the areas in which
they could be supplemented by the proposed operation. Furthermore, the World Bank's heavy
engagement with the country renders it well-placed to promote and ensure the coordination of
existing operations with the proposed intervention. Finally, the convening power of the World
Bank can be leveraged to promote the `umbrella' concept, helping the Government to coordinate
existing work and to attract additional support.

14
     IRCBP provides small `Local Government Development Grants' to LCs, but these are limited to capital
     investments and subject to a lengthy approval process.


                                                    8
 28.       In addition to its strategic placement vis-à-vis other interventions, this program is also
 timely. Given the global financial crisis and decrease in commodity prices, the GoSL is likely to
 face budget shortfalls in the coming years and will be forced to make expenditure decisions.
 Under these circumstances, it is important to provide the GoSL with additional funds to improve
 the predictability and timeliness of the LC transfers, and to protect delivery of basic services in
 the face of budgetary pressures.

 C. Higher-Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

 29.       The draft Government of Sierra Leone Poverty Reduction Strategy (SLPRS) (2008-
 2012) - Agenda for Change - has four priorities: (i) providing reliable power supply; (ii) raising
 quantity and value-added productivity in agriculture and fisheries; (iii) developing a national
 transportation network to facilitate increased investment and economic activity; and (iv) ensuring
 sustainable human development through the provision of improved social services. During the
 PRS implementation period, the Government has committed to continue with the implementation
 of its local governance reform and decentralization program, aiming to improve service delivery
 and support development in Sierra Leone. The GoSL, as part of its PRS, intends to ensure full
 devolution of service functions and requisite financial and human resources to Local Councils.

 30.      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for WB FY06-09 was aligned with the
 four strategic pillars of the Government's SLPRS (2005-2008). To facilitate effective
 partnership with Government, the World Bank aligned its strategy with other development
 partners and concentrated on addressing the overriding challenge of extreme poverty,
 accentuated by high unemployment, food insecurity, and poor social indicators. The World
 Bank's support for SLPRS has been selective and builds on existing programs in economic
 reform, decentralization, infrastructure development, and the social sectors. The CAS did
 foresee a follow-up education/health operation in WB FY09, but management in consultation
 with the GoSL has decided to utilize the available IDA resources for the proposed Program
 which remains consistent with the objective of the CAS of WB FY06-09.

 31.       The proposed multi-sectoral project will complement ongoing World Bank and other
 partner projects in the basic service sectors, and on public sector management and
 decentralization. It will reinforce the direction of the policy dialogue on local governance, and
 contribute to the development of the inter-governmental fiscal transfer system. More
 specifically, the program will directly contribute to the GoSL PRS and CAS objectives of
 protecting basic services and improving human development outcomes by improving the
 predictability for LC funding and providing capacity development support to Local Councils. In
 addition, the program will provide an initial step towards utilization of earmarked sectoral grants
 and a platform for the potential future consolidation of all financial flows to LCs.

II.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 A. Lending Instrument

 32.     The World Bank will use an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument to provide an
 IDA credit of US$20.0 million for the first phase. The first phase of the program is expected to


                                                  9
become effective before the end of the calendar year 2009 with a closing date of December 31,
2011. The first phase of the program is envisioned as two years to: (i) allow synchronization of
the follow-on phases with potential donors' budgeting cycles and closure of the ongoing sector
interventions; and (ii) comply with Government's request to frontload the first phase of the
program. The second phase of the program will cover the 2012-2015 period with a potential
four-year third phase. Initially, the World Bank will use a direct transfer mechanism to LCs and
allow pooling of funds at the local level, using existing administrative and monitoring
mechanisms. The proposed program will increasingly use country systems with regards to
pooled financing, implementation and monitoring, and donor coordination and harmonization.

33.      The APL is an appropriate instrument for World Bank support in light of the proposed
"umbrella" program approach to support local service delivery. The approach and the instrument
will allow sustained support for improved service delivery on different thematic areas around
public sector reform, fiscal transfers, social accountability and processes surrounding local
service delivery.

B. Program Objective and Phases

34.       The overall objective of the program is to support decentralized delivery of basic
services in Sierra Leone. In addition to providing Councils with substantially more funding for
basic service delivery, Phase I of the program will focus on strengthening Government
institutional and organizational capacity at the central and local level to enable LCs to fulfill their
core devolved functions and launching an "umbrella" platform to consolidate all financial flows
to Local Councils. The focus will be on strengthening key processes in the service delivery
value chain that will reinforce efficient use of existing and additional resources: namely,
development planning, budgeting, and expenditure monitoring, monitoring of service delivery
results, and strengthening citizen involvement in the service delivery cycle. In Phase II, the
program will focus more explicitly on translating that institutional and organizational capacity
into better service outcomes with continued focus on refining the grants system and cross-cutting
constraints. In Phase III, the program will be expected to focus on addressing sector-specific
gaps in service delivery.

35.       There will be a specific focus on social accountability throughout the program which
will be scaled up over the implementation period. The program will work with stakeholders at
central and local levels to improve communication, information dissemination, and performance
monitoring which is expected to enhance quality of service delivery.

Design Principles

36.      Key design principles for Phase I of the APL include:

 (i)   a system of predictable financing to LCs to increase the resources they have at their
       disposal to fulfill their devolved functions;




                                                  10
 (ii)   a program of targeted capacity development support to LCs and MDAs to enable them to
        better plan, budget, and monitor service delivery in key sectors, with an emphasis on
        systems development and accountability;

 (iii) coordination with and complementarity to selected projects supporting decentralization
       and/or delivery of devolved services, including the IRCBP, the RCH, the EFA-FTI, the
       Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP), and other donor-
       supported sector programs channeling resources to LCs;

 (iv)   a phased transition over the course of the APL to full reliance on country systems for
        fiscal transfers, internal controls, and audit. Under phase I, transfers of IDA funds to
        LCs will be effected separately from Government funds, and only commingled at the LC
        level. At the end of Phase I, if the central budgeting, disbursement and other controls are
        deemed satisfactory, the program would adopt full pooling of IDA funds at both the
        central and local levels in Phase II. Starting with Phase I, the project will rely on
        existing Government expenditure monitoring systems, but will provide support to
        MOFED to improve timeliness and effectiveness.

 (v)    emphasis on timely and regular local-level fiduciary controls including annual external
        audit of a sample of LCs and spot audits on an ongoing basis.

 (vi) minimization of transaction costs at both the central and local levels, to be achieved in
      part by consolidating the number of grants to LCs and oversight mechanisms with those
      of existing programs; and

 (vii) incorporation of input from other donor partners into project design to ensure that in
       Phase II, the program will become an umbrella program and be able to absorb resources
       from other donors.

37.       In Phase II, it is expected that the program will mobilize resources from other donors,
and move to an integrated and consolidated programmatic approach for World Bank and other
interventions in Sierra Leone, replacing a sector-silo approach. In this Phase, there will be
continued focus on improving the grants system. In addition, in Phase II, the program is
expected to disburse directly into the Government's Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) to
transfer resources to LCs, moving towards full utilization of country systems for fiscal transfers,
internal controls, and audit. The APL will continue to provide resources and capacity
development support to both LCs and MDAs over a sustained period, and will provide a platform
for the continuation of the decentralization policy dialogue with Government. Phase III of the
program is expected to continue to complement Government transfers to Local Councils and
focus on sector-specific needs and results.

38.      The proposed triggers for moving from Phase I to II are as follows:

 (i)    In FY10 and FY11, at least 30 percent of domestic revenues (less wages, interest
        obligations, statutory transfers to NRA, and the Road Fund) are transferred to LCs on an
        annual basis;



                                                11
     (ii)   GoSL transfers to LCs in FY10 and FY11 adhere to the quarterly disbursement schedule
            published in the beginning of each fiscal year. In the case of a revenue shortfall, GOSL
            transfers to LCs would be expected to decrease by an equal or lesser proportion;

     (iii) A reduction in the number of Government grants to Councils to fund education, health
           and sanitation, solid waste management and water expenditures from nine to four by
           FY12;

     (iv) In FY10 and FY2011, (a) variance between available resources and executed LC budgets
          should not be more than 10 percent; and (b) at least 9 LCs in FY10 and 15 LCs in FY11
          should meet at least 75 percent of their LC-specific service output targets (as per LC
          Subsidiary Agreements); and

     (v)    A policy developed on the assignment procedures and "terms of secondment" for sector
            staff at LCs.

C. Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

39.       The development objective of Phase I of the program is: (a) to strengthen Government
capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability of
Local Councils' funding; and (c) to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. The
first phase of the program will be assessed through the following outcome indicators: (a) number
of grants for expenditures (excluding wages and interest obligations) in education, health and
sanitation, water, and solid waste management sectors; (b) percentage of domestic revenues
(excluding wages, interest obligations, and statutory transfers to Recipient's National Revenue
Agency and Road Fund) transferred to Local Councils on an annual basis (excluding DSDP
funds), excluding DSDP funds; (c) transfer of funds to Local Councils as a percentage of total
GoSL expenditures; and (d) number of Local Councils meeting at least 75 percent of targets
specified in their respective Subsidiary Agreement.

D. Project Components

Component 1: Grants to Local Councils (US$16 million)

40.      The majority of program funds will be used to supplement the transfers that Local
Councils receive from the central budget. These funds are currently programmed and utilized
towards expenditures15 for devolved functions16 based on LC annual development plans and
budgets. IDA funds will be allocated and disbursed to LCs for use, as they see fit, within the
functions devolved to them in the education, health and sanitation, solid waste management, and
water sectors. By focusing on the four sectors that Government has given priority, the proposed

15
   All wages of technical staff who are "seconded" to LCs and facility level staff such as teachers, nurses, etc are
   paid by central government.
16
   Devolved functions include delivery of primary and junior secondary education, primary and secondary health
   care, rural water supply, sanitation, waste management, agriculture, youth services, social assistance, and
   firefighting services.


                                                        12
operation is more likely to add value, allowing LCs to achieve real results in the areas receiving
support. The distribution of IDA funds between these four sectors will be based on the relative
priority the Government's 2010 budget gives to each (see Annex 1 for details). Within the
sectors, the distribution between Councils will follow the distribution of the GoSL formula-based
grants17 to Councils, which the Local Government Finance Committee (LGFC) recommends and
publishes before the start of the fiscal year18. The first IDA transfers will be made to Councils in
2010.

41.       Transfer of funds to LCs. Program funds will flow from a MoFED-designated account
into LC accounts. The designated account will be replenished periodically based on aggregate
expenditure returns received from LCs. To improve the predictability of LC funding flows, the
MoFED will disburse DSDP funds by the 15th of the first month of each quarter. The funds will
be distributed to each LC in accordance with the pre-determined and formula-based quarterly
allocations.

42.       Currently, the Government mandates that LCs operate separate accounts for each
devolved function (health, education, water, etc), allowing the Government to deposit its grants
directly into the relevant accounts. The DSDP will adhere to this system.

43.       Use of funds. Because DSDP funds will be mingled with Government resources in LC
accounts, there will be no differentiation between program funds and the Government grant
receipts, in terms of use or eligibility of expenditures. Under the current system, each grant to
LCs is tied to a specific function or activity (see Annex 1). LCs are instructed not to spend more
than 10 percent of funds from non-administrative grants on administration purposes, and all
spending must relate to items appearing in LCs' annually-approved budgets, which should also
be (a) reflected in their local development plans, and (b) consistent with national sector
strategies. It is of note that because IDA-funds will be sector-specific but not function-specific,
councils will have the flexibility to meet their own priorities in spending IDA funds for any
function related to the relevant sector.

44.      Given this arrangement, the expenditures will be defined in the annual work plans and
budgets, which in turn will be based on LCs' existing development plans and budgets, and
national strategies/plans. In addition, all of the activities will relate to expenditures defined
under the Local Government Act and that are not centrally procured or executed. An indicative
picture of the activities that are likely to be funded in the sectors supported can be found in
Annex 4.

45.       Ensuring predictability and additionality. It is important to ensure that program funds
are additional to Government funds, and do not substitute for them. As such, GoSL transfers to
LCs will be monitored in the first phase of the program to assess Government performance on
the timeliness and magnitude of its transfers. Funding for the second phase of the program will
be contingent upon satisfactory performance on program triggers relating to the protection of

17
   For each sector, there is a distribution formula established taking into account equity, simplicity, transparency,
   and stability and budget autonomy considerations for each LC.
18
   These formulae are reviewed each year and are required under the LGA 2004 to be refocused towards more
   accurate measurement of need and the inclusion of revenue capacity measures.


                                                        13
financing of local service delivery at satisfactory levels (see paragraph 38 - Program Triggers).
If the program triggers are successfully met, the World Bank will negotiate funding
commitments for Local Council transfers for subsequent budget cycles following the Phase I of
the program. In parallel, the World Bank will continue the policy dialogue on the robustness of
the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system under the IRCBP and necessary measures to ensure
sustainability of the fiscal transfers to LCs.

Note: GoSL is currently revising its 2010-12 MTEF and budget projections; the Government revenues (A) and (B)
and LC transfers (C) will be updated accordingly. However, GOSL has committed to maintaining (D) at 30 percent
for the two year period.

Component 2: Capacity Development (CD) and Technical Assistance (TA) (US$3.0 million)

46.       This component will strengthen LCs' capacity to perform their core functions and
MDA capacity to provide adequate strategic guidance and oversight to LCs. The CD and TA
support under this program will complement ongoing work under the IRCBP and various sector
programs. To date, LCs have received basic training on LC core functions, including
procurement, financial management, and general administration, with progress tracked through
annual Comprehensive Local Government Performance Assessments (CLOGPAS). The
CLOGPAS assessments continue to reveal certain capacity gaps at the council level, notably in
development planning, budgeting, financial management and M&E. This is in part due to
turnover in the membership of councils, resulting from either elections or better opportunities
elsewhere and newly hired staff who need induction training.19 It also reflects the fact that
training programs, organized primarily by the Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec) which has
the mandate to facilitate and coordinate the devolution process and support LCs and MDAs, have
been generic in nature, and have tended to target LC core staff, rather than offering combined
training for core staff and devolved MDA staff.


19
     The turnover rate of councilors in the 2008 local elections was above 85 percent.


                                                           14
47.       Some capacity-development needs are applicable to all Local Councils and devolved
MDAs, while others are Council or MDA specific. To accommodate this diversity, the program
will offer two channels of assistance: (a) centrally-organized support for all Local Councils and
relevant MDAs20 in specific areas to strengthen core functions; and (b) demand-driven assistance
for individual and/or groups of LCs and MDAs. As this component will be implemented by
DecSec, all of its activities will be defined in DecSec's annual work plans, which will be
submitted for IDA approval at the beginning of each year.

Sub-Component A: Centrally-organized support for all Local Councils and MDAs (US$2.0
million)

48.       There are a number of capacity needs common to all LCs (including devolved sector
staff) and MDAs, often reflecting themes that DecSec planned to address, but for which it lacks
funding. Three areas have been identified by both DecSec and the councils and MDAs
themselves as meriting particular attention: (i) development planning and budgeting; (ii)
monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) social accountability (see Annex IV for more details).

49.      In providing the support, DecSec will build on capacity-development delivery
modalities established under IRCBP. Importantly, the capacity support will be comprehensive in
the sense that each activity will include relevant LC core staff, devolved sector staff, and central
MDA staff. This approach reflects the importance of improved collaboration between those
three groups, which currently operate independently of one another at times.

50.       Development planning and budgeting. As part of the support to development planning,
the program will provide for the accompaniment of LCs in their 2010 planning and budgeting
process. Specifically, DecSec and the externally-recruited consultant will help LCs to facilitate
planning sessions and stakeholder consultations, and provide them with on-site assistance as and
when needed, in order to ensure the existing development plans are updated reflecting realistic
sector targets in line with key sector plans. This activity will focus particularly on the
development of service output targets in key basic service sectors. These targets will be LC-
specific, and refer to activities identified in each LCs' budget. (See Annex 4 for more details).

51.       Monitoring and Evaluation. The sub-component will improve coordination of
devolved service delivery monitoring by central ministries and LCs. The program will provide
technical assistance and ongoing support to central ministries and LCs to strengthen data
collection, data sharing, and use of information to enhance planning and implementation of
decentralized services.

52.      Social accountability. With respect to social accountability, the sub-component will
support: (i) operationalization of all ward committees such that they take part in planning,
budgeting and active results monitoring; (ii) sensitization of chiefdom councils such that they
understand their roles in a decentralized system and take part in ward committees; and (iii)
community/civil society service delivery monitoring pilots around health, education and water

20
     Relevant MDAs are taken to mean MDAs in sectors (a) that have devolved in line with the statutory instrument,
     and (b) for which LCs are receiving funding. Currently, those sectors are: Health, Education, Energy and Water
     Resources, Social Assistance, Youth and Employment, and Agriculture.


                                                         15
facilities; the pilot will work with community groups to establish a periodic monitoring and a
recourse mechanism in cases where service delivery is noted to be failing. The program will
continue to monitor and reinforce LC information disclosure practices, such as posting of annual
budgets and workplans and periodic council meetings that have been mandated by law and
supported under the IRCBP.

Sub-Component B: Demand-Driven Support for Local Councils and Relevant MDAs (US$1.0
million)

53.       The training provided under IRCBP thus far has been essentially supply-driven and
generic. However, not all capacity-development needs are common across all Councils or all
MDAs. This component will support a demand-driven capacity development window and grants
to LCs and MDAs. To preserve the flexibility of this sub-component and promote context-
specific solutions, DecSec will work closely with Councils and MDAs in identifying capacity-
development needs and discussing options for addressing them. LCs and MDAs will submit
proposals (based on their capacity development plans) to a committee chaired by DecSec and
composed of the MoFED, the MoIALGRD, LGSC, and relevant donor partners where necessary.
The eligibility criteria, eligible expenditures, grant ceilings and other guidelines will be outlined
in the program operational manual (see Annex IV for more details). Potential interventions
include short-term and long-term technical assistance and contractual services (e.g., the hiring of
a local engineer to support civil works procurement), equipment, study trips, and knowledge
exchange visits.

Component 3: Program Management (US$1.0 million)

54.      The objective of this component is to ensure timely implementation and satisfactory
monitoring of the program. The component will finance administrative costs related to the
implementation of the grants and capacity development components (Components 1 and 2).
Areas of support are outlined below.

Sub-Component A: Program Coordination (US$400,000)

55.      This sub-component will finance specific operational costs of the MoFED joint PCU;
DecSec, LGFD, and other organizations. It will support capacity building to strengthen such
areas as fiduciary management, intergovernmental coordination, monitoring, administration,
supervision and auditing (see Annex 4 for complete list of covered costs).

Sub-Component B: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$600,000)

56.        This component will emphasize strengthening the M&E system to monitor local and
central government performance on delivery of services. Building on ongoing impact evaluation
work under the IRCBP, a specialized external institution (e.g., a University or a research
institute) will be recruited to provide technical assistance to strengthen the M&E systems at the
local and central level to collect and disseminate timely and reliable data on service delivery




                                                 16
results and continue to coordinate the National Public Services Surveys21. An important element
of the program's social accountability focus, the annual surveys will provide information on
beneficiary satisfaction on access to and quality of decentralized basic services that will be
disseminated through annual workshops and discussed at the bi-annual program review
meetings. The external institution will primarily support DecSec efforts in coordinating M&E
activities. In order to maximize the benefit of this arrangement, the terms of reference of the
institution conducting the work will include knowledge and capacity transfer. In coordination
with the entity hired, the component will also provide the logistical and technical support
necessary to facilitate joint MDA-LC-DecSec monitoring missions and the production of bi-
annual LC work plan implementation reports (see Annex 3).

E. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

57.          Lessons from IDA projects:

       ·   Volatility of Budget Support. The provision of traditional budget support has proven to
           be an imperfect instrument for the purposes of increasing and smoothing expenditures on
           basic services because budget support tends to be volatile and unpredictable. Also, the
           degree of volatility tends to rise with the degree of aid dependency. The volatility and
           unpredictability make it difficult for governments to ensure the steady flow of resources
           needed for the effective provision of basic services. The proposed DSDP will partially
           mitigate this problem by providing a predictable stream of quarterly disbursements to
           Councils.

       ·   Local Council Capacity. The five-year experience of the IDA funding of the IRCBP,
           which concluded with an overall satisfactory rating against initial objectives,
           demonstrated that even Councils with no prior experience can quickly become
           instrumental in their constituencies' development. It also appears that though LCs have
           some capacity to perform procurement, financial management, administration, and
           planning and monitoring functions, they will continue to require extensive capacity
           building and facilitation support over the coming years. This is due in part to high
           turnover of staff, as well as the election of a new cadre of Councilors in 2008. DSDP will
           adopt a partial learning-by-doing/demand-driven capacity development approach to
           respond to the specific needs of individual Councils.

       ·   Local Development Planning. Considering the relatively recent inception and low level
           of experience of the Councils, their Development Plans and the linking of their MTEF
           Budgets to those plans is commendable. However, there is a need to maintain the level of
           support to ensure that all stakeholders understand their role in assembling the
           Development Plan, and in setting the priorities that will become the basis of the
           development budget.

       ·   LC Transfer System and Local Government Development Grants (LGDG). A key input
           required by the Councils is adequate and timely financial support. The IRCBP
21
     A series of National Public Service Surveys has been conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2008 under the leadership of
     MIT Poverty Action Lab.

          experience has shown that funds can be spent effectively by the Councils and that grants
          can be managed very well through a centrally controlled grants system. LCs are able to
          respond to incentives in the form of increased resources and technical support. The Local
          Government Finance Committee has been applying principles rather than politics in the
          allocation of funding, and the LGFD is performing well as the secretariat to that
          Committee. Experience to date suggests that these mechanisms can be extended to
          manage an increased flow of grants to Councils.

      ·   Participation and Accountability. The National Social Action Project (NSAP) and
          GoBifo have demonstrated that increased communication between LCs and citizens
          improves the quality and impact of local development activities. GoBifo District Open
          Days have enabled interactive learning among multiple stakeholders ­ national and local
          government, Local Councils and wards, and local civil society ­ on the topics of local
          planning, budgets, and project performance. These events have been a critical instrument
          for social accountability. Since GoBifo ward and village development plans are designed
          to complement Councils' overall development plans, local government and GoBifo
          communities are working together to advance the development process. Stronger links
          between citizens and Local Councils have increased citizens' participation in local
          governance, improved the Local Councils' capacity to respond to their constituents'
          inputs, and enhanced coordination.

      ·   MDA Role in Decentralized Service Delivery. A major limitation in the development of
          decentralized governance thus far has been the capacity of the MDAs to monitor
          conditions attached to grants and the benefits of the spending in terms of meeting MDGs
          and Government's PRSP objectives. The MDAs have felt largely isolated from the
          decentralization process and currently see little role for them in decentralized governance.
          The monitoring and capacity development components of the proposed Program are
          aimed in part at addressing these limitations by supporting MDAs.

      ·   Lessons from the CAS FY06-09. The lessons from the ongoing review of the current CAS
          (FY06-09) show that progress has been made in strengthening and empowering
          communities and local government through community development initiatives. In a
          post-conflict environment, a community-based approach to identifying and addressing the
          gaps of access to social infrastructure services was the right choice. The World Bank's
          involvement provided momentum to capacity building and the decentralization process
          within the local government sector, and strengthened public financial management. In
          future interventions, the World Bank will focus on continuing to engage communities in
          the local development process and institutionalizing community participation in planning,
          implementing, and monitoring local development interventions.

58.        Lessons from International Experience:

      ·   Protecting Basic Services. Experience highlights the importance of protecting the
          services aiding the poor, particularly in countries facing macro and fiscal volatility, so as
          not to exacerbate declines in social indicators. The Ethiopia Protection of Basic Services
          Program has been successful in supplementing the Government's system of fiscal


                                                   18
           transfers to sub-national governments and contributing to improvements in service
           delivery outcomes.

       ·   Increasing the Vertical Allocation to Sub-National Governments. In a number of
           countries which have adopted local service delivery models (Brazil, Uganda, India,
           Indonesia, the Philippines), experiences indicate that improved funding to LCs coupled
           with adequate accountability mechanisms results in better planning and management of
           resources.

       ·   Linking performance to fiscal transfers. Data from grant systems that link local
           government performance to the size of grants suggests that incentives can lead to
           significant improvements in the quality of local government processes.22

F. Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

Choice of Instrument

59.       The team considered and rejected Development Policy Lending (DPL) which would
have provided an opportunity to supplement an existing Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)
framework supported by the World Bank, EC, the AfDB and DFID. The current MDBS
mechanism tends to result in disbursements that fall within the third or fourth quarter of the
budget year rather than on the 15th of the first month of each quarter. Moreover, MDBS
disbursements often come late, or are reduced, due to problems experienced by the GoSL in
meeting various donor benchmarks. In addition, the adaptable program loan that is proposed is
deemed the appropriate instrument to protect the financing and delivery of basic services,
particularly in the face of possible future budget shortfalls, and the provision of support to enable
the central and local institutions to track expenditures and outcomes more closely.

60.        A specific investment loan was also considered and rejected over an adaptable program
loan. An APL provides a framework for longer-term support to leverage policy changes, and
flexibility to pursue a phased approach to address human resource, institutional, and fiscal
constraints of the decentralization/devolution process sequentially.

Additional Financing to an Ongoing Sector Operation

61.        The team considered and rejected supplementing an ongoing social sector operation ­
namely, the IRCBP. An APL focused on strengthening local service delivery and continued
support to different facets of the GoSL decentralization program will enhance the
institutionalization of local planning, budgeting, and development processes. It will also pave
the way for possible future consolidation of all resources (under one World Bank/donor
supported program) channeled to LCs as sector-specific grants and/or recurrent and capital grants
to be utilized across sectors and expenditure categories.

III.       IMPLEMENTATION

A. Partnership Arrangements

62.       The DSDP has the flexibility to allow financing from other World Bank projects and
other donors to come into the program at the beginning of each fiscal year. EU and DFID have
already expressed interest in financing the program and have participated in its design. World
Bank, EC and DFID have started working towards an MOU which can serve as a platform to
establish a multi-partner financing facility for an umbrella service delivery support program.
During program implementation, the MoFED will invite the major development partners
supporting the GoSL decentralization program and channeling resources through LCs to attend
the bi-annual program oversight committee meetings as observers. In addition, the World Bank
and the MoFED will chair bi-annual implementation review meetings during program
implementation support missions. All quarterly and bi-annual progress reports will be shared
with the key development partners. The mission timing will be coordinated with that of the
IRCBP-MDTF, IPFMRP and MDBS programs.

63.    Currently, EU, DFID, and IDA are providing financing for the decentralization and
PFM programs which the DSDP will complement.

B. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

64.       The DSDP will maximize the use of existing or proposed Government structures,
particularly the existing Inter-governmental Fiscal Transfer System (IFTS) and the
implementation arrangements set up by the IRCBP23 to support capacity development of Local
Councils.

65.      The IFTS derives from the Local Government Act of 2004 (LGA 2004). It regulates
financing of local level development activities by the central government with a view to bringing
services closer to the people, reducing gaps in service delivery, and geographic inequalities
between different regions of the country. It includes a vertical envelope earmarked for Local
Council grants which are shared among the 19 Local Councils based on sector distribution
formulae.

66.      In the implementation of the DSDP the IRCBP Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU)
within MoFED will play a similar role to that which it plays for the IRCBP -- overall
administration, monitoring, and evaluation responsibility for the program. The joint PCU will
also coordinate cross-cutting governance issues and dialogue between the GoSL and donors.

67.      The MoFED will be responsible for the DSDP as a whole; in particular, a joint program
coordination unit (PCU) which will administer a number of programs housed in the MoFED will
have overall responsibility for the administration, coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of
project activities. The joint PCU will absorb the IRCBP-PCU and IPFMRP-PAU already

23
     These include support for DecSec, LGFD, and the small coordination unit within MoFED which is responsible for
     program management, including financial reporting, and monitoring and evaluation.


                                                         20
established within the MoFED; two additional staff (program manager and accountant) will be
hired to compliment already existing capacity24.

       ·   Component 1 will be implemented by the Budget Bureau-MoFED, with support from its
           Local Government Finance Department (LGFD), the MoFED-PCU and the proposed
           program oversight committee.

       ·   Component 2 will be implemented by the Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec) in the
           Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development (MoIALGRD).

       ·   Component 3 will be implemented by the MoFED-PCU.

68.       Local Councils will be the primary beneficiaries of the program and will be responsible
for the satisfactory utilization of the grants towards devolved functions in line with their annual
development plans and budgets. They will also be responsible for reporting on their
expenditures and agreed targets. Their relationship with MoFED and MoIALGRD will be
governed by the Local Council Subsidiary Agreements and Operational Manual (which will
incorporate by reference the already published LGFD documents on grants distribution formulae,
conditions, and other) and annual development plans.

69.      The program will be overseen by the National Joint Coordinating and Monitoring
Committee ("program oversight committee") established under the grant agreement of the
Integrated PFM Reform Project (see Annex 6 for details).

70.       Key Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) will provide guidance and/or
technical assistance to support the effective planning, management and delivery of basic
services.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

71.       MoFED will have overall responsibility for program monitoring and evaluation. For
the most part, this will not require the Ministry to undertake any new activities, as the majority of
program monitoring and reporting will rely on existing systems and processes. As the program
involves pooling funds with Government, M&E arrangements will take all Local Council
spending into account (rather than focusing exclusively on a donor-financed sub-set of
activities). This approach emphasizes the development of strong country systems that include
comprehensive monitoring at the local level linked with improved supervision from the center,
and achievement of results. The financial monitoring system is well-established and sufficient to
meet the requirements of the program. However, arrangements for the monitoring of LC service-
delivery activities are relatively weak, and not well coordinated between sector MDA staff, the
LC core staff, and the MoIALGRD. As such, an external institution (e.g., a University or a
research institute) will be recruited to provide technical assistance in strengthening M&E
arrangements for the local level.



24
     Recruitment process for additional staff is expected to be completed by end September 2009.


                                                          21
72.       With respect to Component 1, there will be three focus areas for program monitoring:
financial flows; use of funds; and Local Council Subsidiary Agreement results.

   ·   Financial flows. The program will collect data on flows at two levels. At the central
       level, the Budget Bureau, with support from LGFD, will continue to monitor and report
       on transfers made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Councils. This information
       will be used in determining the level of IDA disbursement and in assessing Government's
       performance vis-à-vis triggers for the APL's second phase (see Annex 7). At the LC
       level, Council accountants will continue to prepare quarterly returns and submit them to
       LGFD for consolidation and verification. These returns will account for all spending at
       the Council level, including resources from central Government.
   ·   Use of funds. Arrangements will be put in place for rigorous monitoring of Councils'
       budget execution, with support from the externally-recruited consultant. Specifically,
       core Council staff, MDA representatives (both devolved staff and centrally-based M&E
       staff), and DecSec will perform joint monitoring missions to review Councils' AWP
       implementation progress. On a biannual basis, Councils' M&E units will take the lead in
       producing AWP progress reports (mid-term and/or end-of-year). These reports will
       incorporate the results of the monitoring missions, any regularly-collected sector-specific
       data, and budget execution information.
   ·   Local Council Subsidiary Agreement results. The information related to the LC
       Subsidiary Agreement targets will be collected through the joint monitoring (between
       MDAs, DecSec, LGFD, LCs and external consultant) mentioned above on a bi-annual
       basis.

73.      Component 2 will be monitored by DecSec and LGFD. Arrangements will be exactly
the same as under the existing IRCBP, with DecSec and the PCU providing information
regarding the implementation of DecSec's AWP, spending under the component (see Annex 7),
and results achieved.

74.        Program indicators, including outcomes, will be monitored by MoFED and DecSec-
MoIALGRD with support from the externally-recruited consultant on indicators related to LC
activities (see Table 3.1 in Annex III).

D. Sustainability

75.       The GoSL has been committed to achieving improvements in human development
indicators through decentralized service delivery since the enactment of the Local Government
Act and the accompanying Statutory Instrument in 2004. Despite some delays, the devolution
process outlined in the Statutory Instrument has largely been implemented. The responsibility
for delivering a wide range of services in primary and secondary health care, primary and junior
secondary education, rural water supply, sanitation, youth services, social assistance, agriculture,
waste management, and firefighting has been devolved to the LCs. The functional devolution
has been accompanied by fiscal decentralization and the transfer of increased resources to LCs
through tied grants.




                                                22
76.       There are three concerns with respect to program sustainability: (i) GoSL ability to
sustain even current levels of funding to LCs in a timely and predictable manner; (ii) LC capacity
to control availability and quality of services due to human resource and financial constraints;
and (iii) MDA capacity to provide adequate policy guidance and service delivery oversight.

77.        The sustainability of DSDP and the achievement of the Project objectives involve:

      ·   the sustainability of local government management systems and capacity to deliver basic
          services;
      ·   the improvement and sustainability of the Councils' human resources management
          capacity developed by MoIALGRD through the Decentralization Secretariat component
          of IRCBP;
      ·   the sustainability of the inter-government fiscal transfer system developed within the
          MoFED (LGFC and LGFD) under IRCBP;
      ·   the sustainability of the payment processes of the MoFED's Budget Bureau to ensure
          predictable funds flows to Councils; and
      ·   improvements to and sustainability of the management capacity of relevant MDAs to
          play their roles in the provision of decentralized services at appropriate standards.

78.      As the Councils are still relatively young and have experienced substantial personnel
turnover at both political and executive leadership levels, much more effort is needed to make
their management systems robust. Councils and their staff (including those linked to MDAs)
will benefit from constant support for general management, development planning, budgeting,
and budget implementation. The DSDP implementation emphasizes the development of LCs'
human resource and organizational capacity. Councilors will benefit from development training
in general governance to support them as the policy makers and drivers of development in their
communities. In addition, the IRCBP will continue to provide technical assistance to the GoSL
on transfer of HR management responsibilities and functions to LCs which will be essential to
improve LC control over the quality and quantity of services delivered.

79.       The administration of the supplemental LC grants financed through this program will
add to the workload of the implementing agencies ­ LGFD and the multi donors, the Budget
Bureau and the IPFMRP PAU ­ in both quantity and complexity. They will need support to
sustain their work. In light of these constraints, the DSDP emphasizes reinforcing the existing
inter-governmental fiscal transfer system. The World Bank-supported Integrated Public
Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP) and the IRCBP will continue to provide
technical assistance and resources to the GoSL to improve transparency and timeliness of budget
execution and expenditure controls, and strengthen the inter-governmental fiscal transfer system.

80.      Engaging the MDAs substantively in decentralized service provision is essential for the
sustainability of the Councils and decentralized governance. The Program will support capacity
development of the MDAs to ensure they understand and fulfill their roles. It will also put in
place improved expenditure control and monitoring mechanisms for the local transfers, providing
capacity development support to the LGFD, Budget Bureau, DecSec, and other MDAs.




                                                23
81.       There is a risk that the GoSL will not be able to sustain adequate levels of funding to
LCs during and after the APL period. The program will encourage the GoSL to increase its
annual level of support to LCs to 30 percent of domestic revenues (less wages, interest
obligations and statutory obligations to NRA and the Road Fund) in the first phase. The
minimum level of funding to LCs will be discussed and re-negotiated with the GoSL for
subsequent budget cycles and phases of the APL. The program will provide a vehicle to assess
Government performance for each budget cycle and continue to dialogue on how best to
minimize volatility and discretionary reductions to LC transfers. Government's Letter of Sector
Policy also indicates that it is committed to instituting a more permanent mechanism to secure a
minimum transfer requirement to LCs (see Annex 11). During the period of the APL, the GoSL
and development partners will continue to support the LCs in improving their revenue generation
and collection mechanisms through the IRCBP. As the global economy recovers, Sierra Leone is
expected to improve its revenue base through increased production in agriculture and commodity
exports. This should enable the country to resume the economic growth rates of 7-8 percent it
has experienced in earlier times and maintain its financial commitments for Local Council
transfers. Nevertheless, the country will need continued assistance over the long term.

IV.            APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 A. Economic and Financial analyses

 85.      Given the nature of the LC transfers, it is not possible to know a priori precisely how
 the resources will be allocated by Councils. The transfers are to be utilized across a range of
 devolved functions but the precise activities in these sectors are not predetermined, nor are they
 expected to be the same for all Councils. Standard ex ante economic analysis is not possible in
 this context. Instead, the economic analysis here appraises the mechanism for delivering the
 outputs rather than specific investments. This is due to the "framework" nature of the project, in
 which most of the major investments cannot be identified or designed in detail before loan/credit
 effectiveness.

 86.     The Councils' development plans and annual budget processes that will be used to
 determine the activities to be financed under both Components 1 and 2 exist and are found to be
 moderately satisfactory. The program will be supporting the institutions overseeing these
 components in order to strengthen the identified weak areas.

 87.       Below is a summary of the economic impact of the range of possible expenditures in
 the priority sectors of health, education, and water and sanitation.

 Average Returns to Spending

 88.       The project will support expenditures in key sectors. As such, the incremental
 expenditures represent direct investments in human capital. The economic literature clearly
 states that such investments can have high rates of returns.

        ·      Health: Cross-country regressions included in a report on how to meet the Millennium
               Development Goals for health suggest that increased public spending on health services
               can have a positive impact. For example, a 10 percent increase in the share of GDP spent
               on health could reduce maternal mortality by approximately 5 percent. Studies also show
               that the impact of public expenditures (e.g., the elasticity of health indicators to spending
               as a share of GDP) is far more positive for those countries with higher scores for the
               quality of governance.25
        ·      Education: Cross-country regressions on the impact of public spending suggest that
               increased public spending on primary education can reduce the failure rate of students,
               e.g., can increase the probability that more students will go on to secondary school. For
               example, a 10 percent increase in the share of GDP spent on education could reduce the
               failure rate by approximately 4 percent. Cross-country data also suggests that the impact
               of public expenditures (e.g., the elasticity of the failure rate to spending as a share of

         GDP) is more positive for those countries with higher scores for the quality of
         governance.26
     ·   Water and sanitation: A detailed cost-benefit analysis of water and sanitation
         interventions around the world was conducted recently by the WHO. Several types of
         interventions similar to those pursued in Sierra Leone were evaluated including: (1)
         improvements required to meet the MDG for water supply (halving by 2015 the
         proportion of those without access to safe drinking water); (2) meeting the water MDG
         plus halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to adequate sanitation; and
         (3) increasing access to improved water and sanitation for everyone. A detailed model
         was developed to estimate these costs and benefits. Results are not available for Sierra
         Leone alone, but they are for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. The estimated cost-benefit
         ratios for each option are fairly high, in the range of 12 percent.27

B. Technical

89.       The involvement of sector ministries and existing sector working groups in the
implementation of the capacity development component and monitoring of Council expenditures
will ensure that appropriate standards, technical norms, and sectoral targets and policies are
adhered to. In addition, the activities supported under the grants component will be in line with
sector plans and Local Council development plans.

C. Fiduciary

90.      The overall assessment of fiduciary risks is high as at the local level IDA funds will be
co-mingled with Local Council transfers from central government and own resources. An
Operational Manual will summarize financial management and procurement guidelines to be
used by all implementing agencies.

91.      Procurement: It is proposed that project administration and fiduciary functions will be
the responsibility of the Local Councils under the supervision of DecSec, Budget Bureau, LGFD
and the MoFED PCU. The Procurement Officers of the beneficiary MDAs and Councils, and
the Council Procurement Committees will have the responsibility of ensuring that agreed-upon
procedures are followed and requisite reports submitted on time.

92. Financial Management: The program will be administered by the MoFED joint PCU.
Component 1 of the program will be administered through the established mechanisms already in
place and used for the GoSL Local Council transfers. These implementation arrangements were
assessed and found adequate for the purpose of Component 1 of DSDP. This will also include
the financial management procedures28 used to approve and allocate resources to the Local
Councils. The participation of LCs under Component 1 will be subject to the LCs meeting

   Matter," Journal of Development Economics.

   The advantages for this option include: i) the use of GoSL systems; ii) opportunity to build the Local Council
   systems; iii) collaboration and use of established systems of other Bank-funded projects (IRCBP and IPFMRP);
   iv) the avoidance of duplication of systems; and v) help in the decentralization process by assisting the Local

performance criteria with respect to timely and full accounting of expenditures, use of funds and
being current on past audit backlog which the Audit Service Commission (ASC) is required to
clear as a disbursement condition. The financial management arrangements for the program
recognize the high risk nature of the project in view of capacity challenges at institutional and
human levels. To this end, annual external audits which will include audit of a sample of LCs
will be conducted. Detailed risk mitigation measures have been provided in the "Risk
Assessment - Table 7.1" in the Annex 7. All other financial management arrangements for the
program are also laid out in Annex 7 along with the recommended time bound action plan to be
implemented by the various entities as identified in the Annex.

93.      The program will support training in fiduciary areas for LCs that have weaker capacity,
as well as support for LGFD, the Audit Review Commission and the MoFED Internal Audit
Department where necessary.




   Councils implement devolved services. The disadvantages will include: i) expected delays in the implementation
   process, as it involves Local Councils with weak capacities; and ii) the flow of funds will include the MoFED
   signing of withdrawal applications with the current associated delays.
29
   Percentage will be determined based on annual work plans and budgets on a yearly basis. For the first year the
   ratio is agreed as 1:2 (IDA:GoSL)


                                                       29
D. Social

94.      By providing Local Councils with greater, more consistent resources with which to
deliver key services, the project will seek to further the aim of the Local Government Act of
2004: to re-establish and strengthen local governments. Effective local institutions are an
important layer in any system of governance; in Sierra Leone they are also a corrective to the
longstanding division between city and countryside. The project's focus on ward committees
and community-based monitoring of service providers will strengthen governance at lower levels
than the Councils, which in themselves are still quite distant from the lives of the majority of
Sierra Leoneans. In addition, the program is expected to contribute to improvements in social
indicators on health, education and water in particular.

E. Environment

95.      Although the project does not anticipate significant environmental impact, Component
1 may have some environmental impact as it provides grants to LCs that will be used for
expenditures associated with supervision, maintenance, materials, and equipment. Maintenance
may include repairs and rehabilitation of schools, health facilities, piped water systems,
boreholes, drainage pipes, etc. The exact nature of the investments cannot be foreseen at this
time, as they will be identified and managed by local governments through a planning and
budgeting process. The potential environmental and social effects of these investments are
unlikely to be significant. Activities involving involuntary land acquisition will not be eligible
under the program.

96.      An existing Environmental and Social Management Framework is adapted to reflect the
needs of this program and was disclosed on July 6, 2009. An LC training will be rolled out in
September/October 2009.

                   Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background

Introduction

1.      Following a brutal, decade-long civil war which killed 20,000 people and displaced half
of the population, Sierra Leone has been on a path to stabilize its economy and governance
systems. Since 2002, the country has held parliamentary, presidential, and local elections in
2002 and 2007, which have all been deemed free and fair. Notably, the 2007 elections brought
about a transfer of power to the opposition, a good indicator of transition to a multi-party
democracy. Sierra Leone's strong recovery, which began in 2000, continued for a ninth unbroken
year in 2008 with a real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated at 5.5 percent despite
rising food and fuel prices.

2.      Nevertheless, the challenge to sustain political stability continues. There is a particular
need to strengthen the national and sub-national democratic institutions and translate the gains of
economic growth into improvements in poor people's lives. Sierra Leone continues to be ranked
second to last in the UNDP Human Development Index. The gaps in basic service delivery, in
particular, with regards to basic health, primary education, and water and sanitation remain
substantial.

3.      In 2004, the GoSL embarked on a decentralization program with the aim of (a)
addressing some of the root causes of the civil war, particularly the overall deficit in the policy
decision-making process, and (b) improving the delivery of basic services. The Local
Government Act 2004 (LGA) has established a legal framework for the devolution of selected
functions to 19 elected Local Councils (LCs) and their respective ward committees. The LGA
has also introduced an equitable and transparent resource transfer system from the center to LCs
to reduce the resource gaps and income inequalities among regions. The decentralization agenda
has attracted support from development partners, particularly in the areas of public financial
management reform and LC capacity development. Financing of LC devolved functions through
transfers remains a Government priority and an important element of the peace building process.
However, the initial stage of the devolution process is expected to be slow given the long legacy
of centralized power in Sierra Leone.

4.      However, with the onset of the global economic slowdown, Sierra Leone is also expected
to be negatively impacted with reduced real growth rates and revenues. This prospect is a threat
to the implementation of the GoSL decentralization program as it could force expenditure cuts in
priority expenditures for key basic services.

Macroeconomic context

5.      Sierra Leone has registered strong economic growth over the last eight years, with real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2007 despite high fuel
prices. Much of this growth was concentrated in the informal agricultural, fishing, mining, and
service sectors that make up the bulk of the economy. Formal economic activity is confined
primarily to large-scale mining, construction, retail services, tourism, and government
employment.


                                                32
6.     Sierra Leone has broadened its export base from an almost exclusive concentration on
diamonds to include rutile, bauxite, and a moderate but growing number of agricultural products.
Though estimated export growth was positive for all products in 2007, it has slowed relative to
previous years, both in absolute terms and as compared to GDP.

7.      In recent years, the fiscal balance (after grants) has also consistently moved in a positive
direction. However, revenues declined as a share of GDP in 2007 and fell short of ambitious
program targets, and weak expenditure commitment controls led to a substantial accumulation of
domestic arrears in 2007. This was compounded by delays in donor support, on account of
fiduciary concerns.

8.      Global trends suggest that Sierra Leone will probably continue to face high fuel and food
prices and deteriorating terms of trade over the next few years. Moreover, the ongoing global
financial crisis poses serious potential risks to future growth. These potential risks include a
decline in Official Development Assistance and of Foreign Direct Investments, a decrease in the
demand for SL exports with a likely fall in the prices of these exports, and a reduction of
remittances from the diaspora. The original medium-term macroeconomic framework for 2008-
10 assumes 6 percent annual growth in real output through 2010. The Government budget for
FY2009 confirms this projection, although within a range of 5.5-6 percent. These rates are lower
than what Sierra Leone experienced in the 2005-07 period, when average growth was 7 percent.
The predicted decrease reflects two assumptions: a return to a sustainable growth rate following
the immediate post-conflict reconstruction boom; and turbulence created by higher food and fuel
prices and by the medium-term impact of the ongoing global financial crisis. The driving forces
behind the projected 5.5-6 percent annual growth include an increasing rate of private savings
and higher public investment ­ initially in the greater availability of electricity in Freetown,
followed by improved water supplies and road access ­ which are expected to help reduce
business costs.

9.      The food and fuel price crisis has had a negative fiscal impact, as the Government has
recently reduced tariffs on fuel and rice imports without introducing other taxes to compensate.
This policy, combined with a decline in real GDP growth, will make it difficult to maintain
public service delivery at planned levels. There is an additional risk that inflationary pressures,
which continue to remain as high as 18 percent, could fuel a demand for higher civil service
wages in 2009.

Trends in Human Development

10.     Pro-poor program spending as a share of GDP has averaged 4.9 percent during the period
2001-2008 with a significant increase in 2008 (see Table 1.1 on Total Poverty-Targeted
Expenditures). During the same period, pro-poor program spending has increased 140 percent in
real terms, and from 32 percent to 75 percent as a share of discretionary spending.30 Despite
spending trends, human development indicators and service delivery outcomes have shown

modest improvements.31 Three sectors are of particular concern to improving these indicators:
health, education, and water and sanitation.

11.      Health: Sierra Leone has some of the worst health indicators in the world, with a life
expectancy of 42 years, an infant mortality rate of 170 per 1000 live births, and a maternal
mortality ratio of 857 per 100 000 live births.32 Each year, about 11 percent of children die
before celebrating their first birthday, and 1 of every 8 children dies before reaching his or her
fifth birthday; up to 40 percent of these deaths occur in the first month of life. The constraints to
good health can be broadly categorized as limited availability and accessibility to health services,
overall poor quality of service, and limited demand for high impact interventions. More
specifically, the sector faces the following constraints: inadequate supervision at the local level;
weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity at the central level; large numbers of volunteer
workers; and inadequate infrastructure.

12.     The GoSL recently prepared a new National Health Policy (2008) that provides the
framework for the strategic delivery of health services while recognizing the effects of other
sectors, such as housing, food security, water and sanitation, on health. It focuses on the
development of preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services, and the establishment of health
manpower training institutions and strategies to provide a constant supply and retention of all
categories of human resources needed to deliver quality health care to all Sierra Leoneans.
Sector needs are roughly estimated at US$90.0 million per annum (for the next three years), out
of which about US$50.0 million is expected to be financed by donor resources (including World
Bank, DFID, Irish Aid, UNICEF and others) and about US$15.0 million by budget resources.
These resources are available for capital investments, recurrent expenditures, and training, and
will largely flow directly to Local Councils.

13.     Education: Access to formal education improved considerably between 2003-2007, with
gains made in primary school enrollment due to abolition of school fees and construction, and
rehabilitation of significant numbers of schools following the end of the war. Net enrollment
(2005) is currently at 87 percent; however, 30 percent of primary school-going age children are

still out of school. Primary completion rate is at 73 percent, with that of girls at 69 percent.
Challenges remain in attracting and keeping children ­ particularly girls ­ in school. These
include improving the quality and relevance of basic education and enhancing the education
system's capacity to monitor outcomes. Contributing to these shortcomings are a number of
constraints to better delivery of education services: (i) inadequate school supervision by
LCs/devolved education staff; (ii) lack of M&E capacity at central and local levels; (iii) lack of
strategic planning capacity at the central level, resulting in poor guidance to LCs and poor
oversight of sector priorities; (iv) inadequacy in the quality and quantity of education
infrastructure; (v) inefficient teacher deployment; (vi) large numbers of unqualified and
untrained (UU) teachers as part of the cadre; and (vii) inadequate provision of teaching and
learning materials to students.

14.    The GoSL has prepared an Education Sector Plan (ESP 2007-2015) which lays the
foundation for achievement of universal basic education and expansion of post-basic secondary
education. The annual cost of the plan is about US$50 million. Based on a three-year funding
gap US$19 million, Sierra Leone applied for a grant from the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (CF). In
April 2007, the country was allocated a US$13.9 million CF grant for activities towards
achieving universal basic education.

15.     Water: Little progress has been made in the area of water supply and sanitation since the
end of the war. Coverage remains at 47 percent for water and 30 percent for sanitation. The
situation is worse in rural areas as compared to urban communities: 32 percent of rural
communities have access to clean water compared to 84 percent of urban communities.
Similarly, sanitation coverage in rural areas is 17 percent as compared to 64 percent for urban
communities. Access to water and sanitation facilities vary considerably between the richest and
poorest segments of society; water access for the poorest is 11 percent compared to 91 percent
for the richest. Access to sanitation also shows similar trends: 1 percent versus 79 percent for
the poorest and richest respectively. A new water sector strategy has been developed and calls
for a redefinition of the roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources,
the Sierra Leone Water Company (SALWACO), LCs, and communities. The strategy aims to
expand access to clean water and sanitation to reach the MDGs. The needs assessed to reach
MDGs in provision of water supply; sanitation, waste water treatment, and hygiene education are
about US$50.0 million annually until 2015.

16.    In all three sectors, Sierra Leone falls significantly short of the MDGs as illustrated in
Table 1.2 below.

The LGA 2004, the Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfer System, and Expenditure Patterns for
Selected Basic Services

17.      In part as a means of addressing the shortfalls in service delivery and poor human
development outcomes, the Parliament passed the Local Government Act and its attendant
Statutory Instrument in 2004, effectively launching a program of decentralization. The
legislation provided for a phased transfer of service delivery functions from 17 MDAs to the 19
newly-established Councils during a transition period that extended to 2008. After that initial
phase, the devolution process was to be completed, including thorough revisions to the legal,
institutional, and administrative structures and systems in place. The first election of Councilors
was held in May 2004 with a second one in July 2008.

18.    Under the law, three sources of financing exist for local government services in Sierra
Leone:

      ·   central government transfers for devolved functions and for administrative expenses;
      ·   local council own revenue from taxes, fees, royalties, etc.; and
      ·   loans and grants from other sources.

19.     Currently, the vast majority of LCs' funding comes from central Government transfers, in
the form of grants tied to specific expenditure assignments (see Table 1.3). These expenditures
are defined by the devolved functions that are specified in the LGA, and further detailed in the
Statutory Instrument. The LGA specifies that these transfers are to be sufficient to allow for the
continued operation and maintenance of the devolved functions at their pre-devolution level.33
The Act also specifies that there will be transfers tied to administrative expenses, allocated on the
basis of Councils' revenue generation capacity and expenditure needs. Each of the grants to LCs
has written conditions attached to it. The more relevant ones for the sectors to be subject to this
Program are as follows:

20.       Health
      ·   DMOs are signatories to the health accounts of Councils
      ·   Detailed plan of activities, with costings, submitted to the MoFED/MoIALGRD
      ·   Provision of data on key health indicators as specified by MoHS/LGFD
      ·   Posting on Council notice board which drugs have been received and provided to
          hospitals and PCUs.


33
  According to the LGA, this should apply only to the first phase. In 2009, funding was to be sufficient to allow for
service delivery at an `acceptable' standard. However, this change has not yet been applied.


                                                         36
21.       Education
      ·   Detailed plan of activities, with costings, supplied to MoFED
      ·   Provision of data on key education indicators, such as enrollments at each level, number
          of teachers, number of schools, etc., as specified by MEST/LGFD.

22.       Rural Water
      ·   Detailed plan of activities, with costings, submitted
      ·   Councils design rural water service improvement strategy.

23.    The extent to which these conditions are being re-assessed annually and monitored either
by the MoFED, LGFD or the relevant MDA is in doubt.

24.     The vertical allocation (total funds flowing to LCs) and horizontal distribution
arrangements are to reflect capacity considerations, especially during the transition period. The
total vertical allocation is not defined a priori, but rather represents the sum of all sector-specific
vertical allocations for devolved functions. Each sector allocation is determined through
negotiations between LGFD and each line Ministry. Once the size of the vertical envelope for
each sector is established, the horizontal distribution (between LCs) is done on the basis of
formulas that take into account equity, simplicity, transparency, stability, and budget autonomy
considerations.

Trends and Progress to date

25.     The inter-governmental fiscal transfer arrangements now constitute a practiced system
built around the equitable distribution of close to 30 sectoral, sub-sectoral, administrative and
development grants allocated through transparent and objective formulae. Increasingly, the
Councils see themselves as exercising direct influence on development planning and the delivery
of services, and are continuing to take steps to engage their communities in the planning and
monitoring processes. In accordance with the Regulations, responsibility for most basic human
services has now been handed to the Councils, including primary health, primary and junior-
secondary education, agriculture services, and water supply in rural areas. As Table 1.4 shows,
10 percent of all educational expenditures are now assigned to Local Councils with complete



                                                 38
responsibility for all primary school programs. Progress in the health sector has been faster still,
with almost 33 percent of all spending now assigned to the LCs.

26.   Regarding the health, education, and water sectors, which are of particular importance for
HD indicators, the situation is as follows.

       ·   Health. The health sector has progressed farthest on devolution and local delivery of
           services, with promising results: 2005-2007 saw improvements in immunization
           coverage,34 usage of bed nets, malaria treatment, and HIV/AIDS response. The Ministry
           of Health recently completed a bottom-up planning and budgeting process which
           identifies the priorities, gaps, and financing needs, and resulted in specific health plans
           for each district.

       ·   Education. Education was devolved to LCs only in 2007 - later than mandated in the
           LGA Statutory Instrument. Thirty-one percent of the 2007 non-salary national education
           budget is supposed to be under the control of LCs, including funds for school fee
           subsidies, examination fees, teaching and learning materials, and textbooks. In practice,
           however, payments for all of these are made centrally on LCs' behalf, leaving them with
           direct control of only 5 percent of the education budget. The majority of LCs' activities
           in education are related to school supervision or to the distribution of centrally-purchased
           teaching and learning materials and textbooks. Some LCs have also constructed schools,
           using funds from Local Council Development Grants and the Education Development
           Grants.

34
     Current immunization rates are 7-19 percent above regional norms.


                                                              39
       ·   Water. The responsibility for the provision of rural water supply was devolved to Local
           Councils in 2006. Under the current institutional/administrative regime, however, the
           LCs, the water services division (WSD) of the Ministry of Energy and Power, and the
           Sierra Leone Water Company (SALWACO) have overlapping roles and an unclear
           division of responsibility with respect to maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction.
           Partly as a result of this situation, even though the water sector transfers account for only
           two percent of all devolved funds (about US$260,000 ­ on average about US$15,000 per
           Council per year), a number of Local Councils have not been able to utilize these funds.
           In addition to lacking a clear institutional, legal, and regulatory framework, the sector ­
           including LCs, WSD and SALWACO ­ suffers from weak institutional capacity to plan
           and implement activities.

27.     Despite the progress mentioned above, considerable steps remain to be taken to solidify
the processes of decentralization. Notably, the planned devolution of functions is not yet
complete. There have been significant lags in the timetable for the devolution of some functions
(land administration and primary teacher recruitment, for example). Furthermore, reluctance to
devolve can still be detected on the part of some MDAs and in the case of particular
responsibilities, little real progress is discernible (roads), or conflicting mandates confuse local
execution (water). Additionally, the prior determination of some financing flows (e.g., for drugs)
or their continuing direct central provision (e.g., for textbooks and school fees subsidies) means
that the exercise of Council discretion in the sizeable service areas is narrowed down.

28.     Furthermore, LCs are not yet receiving timely or sufficient transfers. Though the share of
LC transfers as a percent of actual discretionary budget increased from 6.2 percent in 2005 to
12.1 percent in 2008, transfers consistently fell short of the targets. Similarly, while LC transfers
as a share of domestic revenue increased from 3.4 percent in 2005 to 6.1 percent in 2008, these
ratios remain low compared to developing country expenditures, where transfers to sub-national
governments are about 24 percent of the total taxes collected.35 Total transfers in Sierra Leone
represent only 0.7 percent of GDP, as compared to developing country averages of 2 percent of
GDP.

29.     Preliminary analysis of the cost burden of LC functions for service provision suggests
that even if LCs were receiving their full budgeted allocation, these transfers would be
insufficient. As an example, the 2007 budgeted provision for Local Council education services
was $9.7m. This provides only one quarter of the estimated resources required annually to
provide education to the standard required by the sector, estimated to be roughly $36.6m per
annum. Furthermore, late or partial payment of all grants is highly problematic in terms of
maintaining service delivery. As Table 1.5 shows, actual transfers have never met the budgeted
amounts: grants for recurrent expenditures, including LC core staff salaries, were only 41 percent
of budgeted totals in 2007 and 75 percent in 2008. In the case of quarter four of 2008, none of
the direct transfers were made, amounting to a shortfall of 6 billion Leones equivalent to US$2

30.     Finally, certain areas of capacity and policy development will require increased support
in the coming years. Capacity development has received consistent attention since the beginning
of the decentralization program, and the significant investments in staff and elected officials'
development, in particular, have upgraded skills and fostered positive attitudes between actors.
Nonetheless, capacity gaps remain at the local level, and progress has been insufficient in a
number of policy and legal areas. Specific actions to be taken include: the harmonization of
conflicting sectoral legislation; the streamlining and procedural bolstering of the grants transfer
system; improving the planning of service delivery, including enlisting community participation;
significant expansion in local revenue collection; upgrading the capacity of MDAs in their
standard setting and monitoring roles; the identification of strategies for the attraction and
retention of the required staff for local government service linked to building the robustness of
the HR management system; increased citizen involvement in accountability mechanisms for
Local Council programs and actions; and transferring human resource management functions to
Local Councils.

31.     The World Bank and other donors are working with the GoSL to address these issues,
most notably through the Institutional Reconstruction and Capacity Building Program (IRCBP),
a World Bank-managed multi-donor trust fund that was until recently co-financed by IDA.
Specifically, over the next two years, the IRCBP will lead the dialogue with Government on
several key issues related to the legal and policy framework: the revision of the LGA; the
resolution of conflicts between the LGA and existing sectoral legislation; the completion of the
devolution process, with specific focus on lagging sectors; the clarification of relative roles and
responsibilities of chiefdoms and Councils; and the grants system.

Arrangements for results monitoring

1.      MoFED will have overall responsibility for program monitoring and evaluation. The
proposed project will not require the Ministry to undertake any new activities, as the majority of
program monitoring and reporting will rely on existing systems and processes. As the program
involves pooling funds with Government, M&E arrangements will take all Local Council
spending into account (rather than focusing exclusively on a donor-financed sub-set of
activities). This approach emphasizes the development of strong country systems that include
comprehensive monitoring at the local level linked with improved supervision from the center,
and achievement of results.

2.      The financial monitoring system is well-established and sufficient to meet the
requirements of the program. However, arrangements for the monitoring of LC service-delivery
activities are relatively weak, and not well coordinated between sector MDA staff, the LC core
staff, and the MoIALGRD. As such, an external institution (e.g., a University) will be recruited
to provide technical assistance in strengthening the M&E arrangements for the local level. In
order to maximize the benefit of this arrangement, the terms of reference of the institution
conducting the work will include knowledge and capacity transfer. With support from the
contracted entity, the component will also provide the logistical and technical support necessary
to facilitate joint MDA-LC-DecSec monitoring missions and the production of bi-annual LC
work plan progress reports.

3.       It is of note that the IRCBP is currently supporting an evaluation unit (staffed by the
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab-JPAL MIT) responsible for carrying out service delivery
surveys in the districts. Surveys were conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2008. JPAL's contract has
finished in June 2009, after which time IRCBP plans to either strengthen the monitoring unit
under DecSec to carry the function currently being done by the evaluation unit or recruit an
institution or firm to continue with the current evaluation activity under the project. The DSDP
will closely coordinate its recruitment of the consultant with IRCBP's work in this area.

4.     With respect to Component 1, there will be three focus areas for program monitoring:
financial flows; use of funds; and Local Council Agreement results.

       Financial flows. The program will collect data on flows at two levels. At the central
       level, the Budget Bureau, with support from LGFD, will continue to monitor and report
       on transfers made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Councils. This
       information will be used in determining the level of IDA disbursement and in assessing
       Government's performance vis-à-vis triggers for the APL's second phase (see Annex 7).
       At the Council level, Council accountants will continue to prepare quarterly returns and
       submit them to LGFD for consolidation and verification. These returns will account for
       all spending at the Council level, including resources from central Government.

       Use of funds. Existing arrangements for monitoring the use of funds (i.e., activities
       implemented) at the Council level vary from sector to sector, but are generally weak.
       Most monitoring of service delivery at the district level is undertaken by devolved sector
       staff, in keeping with the LGA's stipulation that ministries are responsible for monitoring



                                               47
      relevant Council activities. The information collected is usually transmitted to MDA
      central offices, with little data processing and analysis taking place at the district level.
      LCs have M&E officers, but with few resources and limited training. Furthermore, LCs
      do not currently report on overall AWP implementation progress. Over the past few
      years, DecSec has done a limited amount of monitoring of Local Council activities, but
      this has primarily been focused on the IRCBP-financed local government development
      grant projects.

      Building on IRCBP's ongoing work in M&E, the DSDP will help to address some of
      these constraints with its capacity-development component (see Annex 4). In addition,
      arrangements will be put in place for rigorous monitoring of Councils' AWP
      implementation, with support from the externally-recruited consultant. Specifically, core
      Council staff, MDA representatives (both devolved staff and centrally-based M&E staff),
      LGFD and DecSec will perform joint monitoring missions to review Councils' AWP
      implementation progress. On a biannual or annual basis, Councils' M&E units will take
      the lead in producing AWP progress reports (mid-term and/or end-of-year). These
      reports will incorporate the results of the monitoring missions, any regularly-collected
      sector-specific data, and budget execution information. The program will provide the
      logistical and technical support necessary to (a) facilitate the monitoring missions and the
      production of the reports, and (b) ensure the institutionalization and sustainability of the
      improved monitoring arrangements. The consultant will be integral in helping DecSec to
      define and establish these systems.

      Local Council Subsidiary Agreement results. The information related to the LCA targets
      will be collected through the joint monitoring mentioned above.

5.     Component 2 will be monitored by DecSec and LGFD Arrangements will be exactly the
same as under the existing IRCBP, with DecSec and the PCU providing information regarding
the implementation of DecSec's AWP, spending under the component (see Annex 7), and results
achieved.

6.      Program indicators, including outcomes, will be monitored by MoFED and DecSec-
MoIALGRD, with support from the externally-recruited consultant on indicators related to LC
activities. This is described in the following table.

                                 Annex 4: Detailed Project Description

1.    The Decentralized Service Delivery Program will have three components: (1) grants to
Local Councils; (2) capacity development and technical assistance; and (3) program
management.

Component 1: Grants to Local Councils (US$16 million)

2.      The majority of program funds will be used to supplement the transfers that Local
Councils receive from the central budget. On an annual basis, IDA funds will provide an
additional 50 percent to existing Local Council transfers. Along with existing Local Council
transfers, these grants will constitute between 50-90 percent of LC annual recurrent budgets.
The funds will be allocated and disbursed to LCs for use, as they see fit, within the functions
devolved to them in the education, health and sanitation, solid waste management, and water
sectors. The decision to restrict the scope of IDA transfers was made in line with Government
preferences and in order to focus the program resources in those sectors with direct impact on
human development indicators. Government's concern to minimize transaction costs was also a
factor in restricting the number of sector areas/grants. By focusing on the four sectors that
Government has prioritized, the proposed operation is more likely to add value, allowing LCs to
achieve real results in the areas receiving support. The distribution of IDA funds between these
four sectors will be based on the relative priority the Government's 2010 budget gives to each,
resulting in the following proportional distribution:

               Table 4.1: Proportional Distribution of IDA Resources among Sectors

                Sector Grant                            Proportional Distribution (%)

                Health (including sanitation)                         25
                Solid Waste Management                                15
                Water                                                 40
                Source: MOFED.

3.      Within the sectors, the distribution between Councils will follow the distribution of the
GoSL formula-based grants to Councils, which the Local Government Finance Committee
(LGFC) recommends and publishes before the start of the fiscal year47. The first IDA transfers
will be made to Councils in 2010.

4.      Transfer of funds to LCs. Program funds will flow from a MoFED-designated account
into LC accounts. They will supplement the funds the Government makes available but will not
necessarily be transferred at the same time as GoSL funds. As mentioned, the Government has
had great difficulty in providing LC grants in a timely manner. To improve the predictability of
LC funding flows, the MoFED will disburse DSDP funds by the 15th of first month of each
quarter. This disbursement will be made in accordance with the pre-determined and formula-
based quarterly allocations.

47
     These formulae are reviewed each year and are required under the LGA 2004 to be refocused towards more
     accurate measurement of need and the inclusion of revenue capacity measures.


                                                     53
5.      Currently, the Government mandates that LCs operate separate accounts for each
devolved function (health, education, water, etc), allowing the Government to deposit its grants
directly into the relevant accounts. The DSDP will adhere to this system, and provide LCs with
quarterly transfers in the form of four sector-specific block grants, deposited into the
corresponding LC accounts. This use of sector-specific block grants is notable because it
represents an advance on current practice. At present, Councils receive multiple tied grants in
the health and sanitation, agriculture, and education sectors. Thus, the shift to block grants is in
keeping with the general policy push toward greater spending autonomy at the Council level.

6.      Use of funds. Because DSDP funds will be mingled with Government resources in LC
accounts, there will be no differentiation between program funds and the Government grant
receipts, in terms of use or eligibility of expenditures. Under the current system, each grant to
LCs is tied to a specific function or activity. These functions are defined by the LGA, and
described in greater detail by the Statutory Instrument No 13 of 11 November 2004: The Local
Government (Assumption of Functions) Regulations 2004. The Statutory Instrument was
prepared to specify the activities that each devolved function entails. LCs are also instructed not
to spend more than 10 percent of funds from non-administrative grants on administration
purposes. Finally, all spending must relate to items appearing in LCs' annually-approved
budgets, which should also be (a) reflected in their local development plans, and (b) consistent
with national sector strategies. As such, IDA funds transferred to LCs will finance activities in
the four targeted sectors that are in line with the criteria for eligibility defined above. It is of note
that because IDA-funds will be sector-specific but not function-specific, Councils will have the
flexibility to meet their own priorities in spending IDA funds for any function related to the
relevant sector.

7.      Given this arrangement, the program cannot define expenditures in advance. However,
based on LCs' existing development plans and budgets, and national strategies/plans, the
majority of the activities will relate to expenditures that are not centrally procured or executed.
The following provides an indicative picture of the activities that are likely to be funded in the
sectors supported.

    ·   Health and Sanitation. Annual activities to be undertaken by the LCs in health are
        detailed in a District Health Plan which is approved by both the LC and the MoHS. LCs
        are responsible for both primary and secondary health care. Most plans include purchase
        and distribution of essential commodities and services such as drugs, medical equipment,
        training, civil works (especially for staff housing) and operating costs.

    ·   Education. Annual activities to be undertaken by LCs are outlined in the Education
        Sector Plan. LCs are responsible for delivery of basic education which includes primary
        and junior secondary education. Activities that will likely be undertaken by LCs include
        the following: distribution of all textbooks, and purchase of teaching and learning
        supplies; supervision of schools, including preparation and completion of school
        supervision forms; school-based training for heads of schools and teachers; training in the
        collection and use of Education Management Information System (EMIS) data; and
        support to school committees.


                                                   54
       ·   Solid Waste. Annual activities to be undertaken by LCs are outlined in annual plans.
           LCs are responsible for garbage collection and disposal. It is expected that the LCs will
           use the funds to: (a) conduct sensitization campaigns on solid waste management and
           disposal; (b) purchase and maintain small motorized vehicles/push-carts to collect
           garbage; (c) do general cleaning; (d) pay daily allowances for personnel; (d) purchase
           fuel and other equipment and (e) clean and repair of drainages.

       ·   Water. Annual activities to be undertaken by LCs are outlined in their development
           plans. LCs are responsible for rehabilitation and maintenance of rural water supply,
           which includes water supply systems, hand-dug wells, boreholes, and water pumps, and
           entails sensitization and training of water user and maintenance committees as well as
           supervision. Specifically, it is expected that LCs will use funds to undertake community
           outreach by (a) establishing and training community-level water and sanitation
           committees (WSCs) where none exist, (b) arranging for community-based education
           regarding hygiene and effective water usage, and (c) providing WSCs with the capacity
           to perform minor pump repairs. It is also likely that LCs will work with SALWACO and
           Rural Water Departments to arrange for the rehabilitation of existing wells.

8.      Ensuring predictability and additionality. It is important to ensure that program funds
are additional to Government funds, and do not substitute for them. As such, GoSL transfers to
LCs will be monitored in the first phase of the program to assess Government performance on
the timeliness and magnitude of its transfers. Funding for the second phase of the program will
be contingent upon satisfactory performance on program triggers relating to the protection of
financing of local service delivery at satisfactory levels (see paragraph 38). If the program
triggers are successfully met, the World Bank will negotiate funding commitments for Local
Council transfers for subsequent budget cycles following Phase I of the program. In parallel, the
World Bank will continue the policy dialogue on the robustness of the intergovernmental fiscal
transfer system under the IRCBP and necessary measures to ensure sustainability of the fiscal
transfers to LCs.

Component 2: Capacity Development (CD) and Technical Assistance (TA) (US$3.0 million)

9.      This component will strengthen LCs capacity to perform their core functions and MDA
capacity to provide adequate strategic guidance and oversight to LCs. The CD and TA support
under this program will complement ongoing work under the IRCBP and various sector
programs. To date, LCs have received basic training on LC core functions, including
procurement, financial management, and general administration, with progress tracked through
annual Comprehensive Local Government Performance Assessments (CLOGPAS) assessments.
The CLOGPAS assessments continue to reveal certain capacity gaps at the Council level,
notably in development planning and budgeting, financial management and M&E. This is in part
due to incoming new staff and staff turnover in the Councils, resulting from either elections or
better opportunities elsewhere.48 It may also reflect the fact that training programs, organized
primarily by the Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec), have been generic in nature, and have
tended to target LC core staff, rather than offering combined training for core staff and devolved
48
     The turnover rate of councilors in the 2008 local elections was above 85 percent.


                                                           55
MDA staff. Furthermore, DecSec has so far been unable to offer support to the MDAs to orient
them towards the new roles entailed by devolution. In the absence of additional support,
financial constraints will limit the extent to which DecSec can address these gaps in the coming
years.

10.     Some capacity-development needs are applicable to all Local Councils and devolved
MDAs, while others are Council- or MDA-specific. To accommodate this diversity, the program
will offer two channels of assistance: (a) centrally-organized support for all Local Councils and
relevant MDAs49 in specific areas; and (b) demand-driven assistance for individual and/or groups
of LCs and MDAs. As this component will be implemented by DecSec, all of its activities will
be defined in DecSec's annual work plans, which will be submitted for IDA approval at the
beginning of each year.

Sub-Component A: Centrally-organized support for all Local Councils and MDAs (US$2.0
million)

11.     There are a number of capacity needs common to all LCs (including devolved sector
staff) and MDAs, often reflecting themes that DecSec planned to address, but for which it lacks
funding. Three areas have been identified by both DecSec and the Councils and MDAs
themselves as meriting particular attention: (i) development planning and budgeting; (ii)
monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) social accountability. Social accountability interventions
will be emphasized and supported via institutional Council and Sub-Council structures and civil
society- and community-based groups. The program will ensure that the annual development
plans and budgets are updated each year incorporating sector strategic plans, and a systematic
monitoring mechanism is established to assess the implementation progress of the annual plans
and identified service delivery targets.

12.     With respect to social accountability, the program will support: (i) operationalization of
all ward committees such that they take part in planning, budgeting and active results
monitoring; (ii) sensitization of chiefdom councils such that they understand their roles in a
decentralized system and take part in ward committees; and (iii) community/civil society service
delivery monitoring pilots around health, education and water facilities. As a first priority, this
component will focus on those three areas; however, it will also maintain the flexibility to
address other needs that are common to all Councils identified by the CLOGPAS and DecSec.
As such, in the second year of the project, DecSec will be able to propose additional areas of
focus, building them into its annual work plans as appropriate.

13.     In providing the support, DecSec will build on capacity-development delivery modalities
established under IRCBP. For the most part, this will involve providing training, technical
assistance (coaches and other means), logistical support (office equipment, mobility), and
opportunities for experience-sharing (with other LCs, and abroad). In general, the aim will be to
move away from workshop-based training in favor of a more hands-on, on-site, learning-by-
doing approach. Importantly, the capacity support will be comprehensive in the sense that each

49
     `Relevant' MDAs are taken to mean MDAs in sectors (a) that have devolved in line with the statutory instrument,
     and (b) for which LCs are receiving funding. Currently, those sectors are: Health, Education, Energy and Water
     Resources, Social Assistance, Youth and Employment, and Agriculture.


                                                         56
activity will include relevant LC core staff, devolved sector staff, and central MDA staff. This
approach reflects the importance of improved collaboration between those three groups, which
are currently operating almost independently of one another at times. To this end, sub-
component A will focus support in the following areas:

 i.        Local development planning and budgeting. Currently, all 19 Councils have three-year
           local development plans, which identify and prioritize activities in all areas under
           Council responsibility, and form the basis of Councils' annual budgets and work plans.
           These plans are updated each year using a participative approach involving ward
           committees, core Council staff, and devolved MDA staff. In practice, this process is
           heavily supported by LGFD, and would benefit from support in several areas. First,
           Local Councils have recruited development planners (to be in place by July/August
           2009); however, no Local Council has a development planning unit, and there is no
           provision in DecSec's budget to provide more than a minimal amount of training to the
           new development planners. Second, as devolved MDA staff are crucial to the planning
           process, they should also benefit from training in this area. This also relates to the fact
           that the Health and Education Ministries have recently led district planning processes,
           resulting in district-level health and education plans. As these plans were devised
           separately from the local development plans, some work will be required in integrating
           them. Third, there is a need to strengthen the involvement of the ward committees in the
           planning exercise. Finally, it would be useful for LCs to be able to take local partners'
           activities into account in preparing their plans; this is particularly the case with regard to
           international NGOs.

           The program will provide the basic logistics support required to establish development
           planning units in each of the Local Councils, and support integrated training for (a) the
           new development planners, (b) the Councils' development planning committees, (c)
           devolved sector staff, and (d) relevant MDA staff50 . To provide practical experience for
           the development planning units as quickly as possible, and to address the needs described
           above, the program will also support the Councils' 2010 planning and budgeting exercise.
           Specifically, DecSec and the externally-recruited consultant will help LCs to facilitate
           planning sessions and stakeholder consultations, and provide them with on-site assistance
           as and when needed, in order to ensure the existing development plans are updated
           reflecting realistic sector targets in line with key sector plans. This activity will focus
           particularly on the development of service output indicators and targets in line with
           national plans (see below), the inclusion of NGO-run activities into local development
           plans, and better involvement of the ward committees in the planning and budgeting
           process. The exercise will provide an opportunity to solidify the cross-sectoral local
           development planning process, improve coordination between LC core staff, devolved
           MDA staff, and central MDA staff, and strengthen the linkages with communities.

           As part of this annual updating process, and building on the identification of service
           output targets, this component will support the establishment of Local Council Subsidiary

50
     This would include MDA staff directly involved in the planning process (e.g., from ministries' planning units).
     Multiple trainings will be held at the regional or council level (to ensure full geographical coverage); obviously,
     central MDA staff would only be expected to attend one of the trainings.


                                                           57
       Agreements, to be signed between each LC and MoFED. The service delivery targets
       contained in the Subsidiary Agreements will cover the four priority devolved sectors
       (health and sanitation, education, water supply and solid waste management). Though
       the targets will be LC-specific, the indicators will be drawn from national sector plans.


 ii.   Monitoring and evaluation. The coordination of devolved service delivery monitoring
       has been particularly weak to date. MDAs have retained monitoring responsibility, and
       in practice, what monitoring exists at the local level is performed by devolved sector
       staff. These staff transmit their reports and data directly to central MDAs, leaving core
       LC staff (including M&E officers) sidelined. As in the case of development planning,
       there is a need to ensure better coordination between LC core staff (particularly M&E
       officers and Chief Administrators) and devolved sector staff. The system would benefit
       from the following improvements: (a) some involvement of LC M&E officers in the
       monitoring activities currently being led by devolved sector staff; (b) the transmission of
       monitoring reports and data to LC M&E officers (not just to MDAs) to allow for data
       analysis at a local level; (c) the establishment of a link between the data being collected,
       including information pertaining to results, and the planning process; and (d) the
       development of a system in which LCs undertake regular and comprehensive monitoring
       of the implementation of their annual work plans (progress made, results achieved, etc).

       IRCBP has already provided LC M&E officers with basic training, but the proposed
       operation will go further: rather than offering standard training and capacity-building,
       the DSDP will attempt to lay the foundations for an effective monitoring system at the
       local level. Due to the complexity of this task, the project will fund technical assistance
       for DecSec by a specialized institution. This TA will be brought on board as soon as
       possible after effectiveness, in order to ensure adequate time for planning. Broadly,
       DecSec and the TA will focus on: (a) improving the skills of M&E officers to facilitate
       data analysis at the local level; (b) ensuring that data collected by and for the MDAs is
       transmitted to LC M&E officers, and used by LCs in the planning process; (c) helping
       LCs to disseminate collected data to ward committees; (d) establishing the practice of
       work plan implementation monitoring, and supporting LCs in producing simple
       implementation progress reports; and (e) amending CLOGPAS in light of current needs,
       and running it annually.

iii.   Social accountability. While some Local Councils have taken steps toward improving
       downward accountability ­ for example, by posting budgets on public notice boards ­
       there is a need to strengthen and expand these efforts to facilitate citizen participation and
       monitoring of local development activities. The program will continue to monitor and
       reinforce LC information disclosure practices, such as posting of annual budgets and
       workplans and periodic council meetings that have been mandated by law and supported
       under the IRCBP. Although a number of donor partners and NGOs in Sierra Leone are
       focusing on the demand side of accountability by working directly with communities and
       civil society organizations, these interventions focus on expenditure tracking and some
       work through ward committees. This being the case, the DSDP will complement the
       demand side interventions: improving Councils' performance in the manner they



                                                58
       communicate and exchange information with the citizens in particular through ward
       committees, but also complement demand side activities with pilot community
       monitoring efforts. DSDP will put emphasis on encouraging maximum information
       exchange between local and central stakeholders via regular monitoring, public forums,
       and meetings.

       Ward Committees. A key element of this work will be the provision of support to ward
       committees to fulfill the functions vested in them by the Local Government Act. Ward
       Committees are the intermediary bodies between Councils, and communities are a crucial
       channel through which citizens can both participate in development planning and provide
       feedback on existing Council activities. DecSec trained ward committees of 10 Councils
       prior to the 2008 local elections. However, there was a large turnover of ward committee
       members in the last election, and so many of those who received training are no longer in
       office. DecSec has plans to train ward committees of six Councils and partners are
       planning to do the same for the other 13. The DSDP will support DecSec to train the
       remainder of ward committees, and also to provide support for: (i) spot-monitoring of
       ward committee performance, (ii) support for ward committee meetings, (iii) support for
       ward committee monitoring of service delivery, (iv) highlighting of successful
       committees, (v) creating opportunities for sharing and learning across Councils, and (vi)
       more specialized, "demand-driven" trainings for ward committees.

       Chiefdom Councils. The DSDP will also play a role in strengthening the chiefdom
       Councils by providing basic training on transparency and accountability in governance.
       The chiefdom Councils will also be encouraged to be part of the monitoring process of
       ward committees.

       District Budget Oversight Committee. Another area of focus will be the District Budget
       Oversight Committees (DBOCs). DBOCs are civil society institutions with legislative
       backing from the Government Budgeting and Accountability Act (GBAA) 2005, and they
       are charged with: (a) assisting in the formulation and monitoring of all poverty-related
       activities within the district; (b) serving as focal points at the community level for
       discussion and consideration of the medium-term expenditure framework budget and the
       public expenditure tracking surveys; (c) monitoring the expenditure of central
       government allocations to all LCs in the district and coordinating them for maximum
       effectiveness; (d) reporting to the Budget Bureau every four months on the progress of
       the execution of budget programs in the district, and (e) generally, serving as
       intermediaries between the Government and the people concerning all budgetary
       allocations for their districts. EU funding to strengthen these institutions ended in 2008,
       so the program will provide training and logistical support to make these bodies fully
       operational.

14.     Community-based monitoring of service delivery at the facility level. This component
will also provide support to pilot community-based monitoring of frontline service provision.
The premise of this intervention is that the degree of effort or performance on the part of
frontline service providers is a significant determinant of service delivery. A few key NGOs will
be contracted to facilitate and monitor the pilot. DecSec and the Justice for the Poor team of the



                                               59
World Bank will work with the NGOs to implement this pilot, as it requires intensive community
facilitation. They will be responsible for training community groups in the respective pilot areas.
The pilot areas will include a total of six rural and peri-urban sites to be selected in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces and in the Western Area rural areas, and will be around health, education
and water facilities. The selection of pilot sites in the three geographical regions will take note
of the following: local political stability, availability of facilities, underserved communities,
remoteness, and active NGOs or CSOs working in the district or chiefdom. A community under
the pilot will be defined as the community in the catchment area of health, education and water
facilities. The final selection process will be done in consultation with partners.

15.      Under the pilot, civil society organizations and ward members will be enabled to
facilitate community monitoring of service provision at a facility level. The monitoring process
will begin by presenting to the community both objective data on facility performance--for a
peripheral health center, for example, this data could include nurse absentee rates, patient wait
times, prices charged for medicines, etc. ­ and information on the way facilities should function
according to state policy. Reflection on these often contrasting pictures will lead to a
"community contract" between the community and service providers (e.g., teachers, nurses) on
more policy-compliant performance going forward. The community will then monitor
performance against this contract, raising problems and discussing progress at periodic
community meetings. In cases of service delivery failures, the pilot will work with community
groups to establish a recourse mechanism in collaboration with the in-country paralegal network.
This relatively simple process has proven strikingly effective at improving service delivery in
other countries, notably in Uganda.

16.    A number of partners are involved in supporting efforts that ensure transparency and
accountability in governance. These efforts have largely focused on finance and budget tracking
with promising results. Community monitoring of service delivery will use a different approach
to complement these efforts by focusing on building the capacity of the end users to monitor
service delivery in their communities. This work on community-based monitoring will avoid
duplicating existing efforts by involving the coordination body on demand for governance that
DFID has convened in the planning and designing stage of the pilot.


Sub-Component B: Demand-Driven Support for Local Councils and relevant MDAs (US$1.0
million)

17.     The training provided under IRCBP thus far has been essentially supply-driven and
generic. However, not all capacity-development needs are common across all Councils or all
MDAs. This component will support a demand-driven capacity development window. Each LC
and MDA will have a notional allocation that they could draw down on during program period to
address specific capacity gaps. These amounts will be announced at the start of the program.
Based on a composite index from CLOGPASS, the LCs will be classified into three groups: A, B
and C (Group A comprising of LCs with highest capacity). Group A would receive a base
allocation of $30,000. Groups B and C would receive 30 and 50 percent more than the base
allocation respectively. Proposals will be reviewed and grants will be awarded by a committee
chaired by DecSec including MoFED, MoIALGRD, LGSC and donor partners where necessary.



                                                 60
The proposals are expected to be based on MDA and LC capacity development plans and annual
work plans. To avoid duplication with other ongoing efforts, proposals will have to be endorsed
by relevant stakeholders, including any MDA concerned and/or sector steering committees, as
applicable.

18.      To preserve the flexibility of this sub-component and promote context-specific solutions,
DecSec will work closely with LCs and MDAs in identifying capacity-development needs and
discussing options for addressing them. LCs and MDAs will then develop capacity-development
plans, whose activities will be eligible for funding. Potential interventions include short and
long-term contractual services and/or technical assistance (e.g., the hiring of a local engineer to
support civil works procurement), equipment, study trips, and knowledge exchange visits. To
facilitate requests for training or, as is more likely, longer-term technical assistance, DecSec will
draw on its existing network of firms, agencies, and individuals capable of providing such
support. DecSec will also work to establish partnerships with the country's tertiary training
institutions. Experience-sharing will be critical to the success of this activity, and the program
will provide regular opportunities for Councils and MDAs to discuss their use(s) of the demand-
driven funds with one another.

Component 3: Program Management (US$1.0 million)

19.    The objective of this component is to ensure timely implementation and satisfactory
monitoring of the program. The component will finance administrative costs related to the
implementation of the capacity development and grants components. Areas of support are
outlined below.

Sub-Component A: Program Coordination (US$400,000)

20.       This component will finance operational costs as follows:
      ·   Operational costs of the MoFED joint PCU will be supported partially in conjunction
          with other programs.
      ·   Additional operational costs of the proposed MoFED joint PCU to strengthen its
          fiduciary management capacity.
      ·   Operational costs of the program steering committee to be established to provide
          oversight for Local Council grant implementation.
      ·   Operational costs, where necessary, of the Audit Services Commission and the Internal
          Audit Directorate of the MoFED who will be responsible for regular audits and ongoing
          spot audits.
      ·   Additional operational costs of DecSec, LGFD, and Budget Bureau related to program
          monitoring and administration. Support will be provided to boost capacity of these
          institutions where necessary.
      ·   Inter-governmental coordination between key ministries and agencies. Costs associated
          with joint program supervision, bi-annual program reviews, and dissemination of results
          will be supported.
      ·   Donor coordination, including costs associated with bi-annual implementation progress
          reviews and dissemination of results to key donors financing part of the decentralization
          program will be supported.


                                                 61
   ·   External auditing of the financial statements for the Program and spot-checks of Council
       activities.

Sub-Component B: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$600,000)

21.     This component will also finance program monitoring and evaluation. The program will
emphasize strengthening the M&E system to monitor local and central government performance
on delivery of services in particular establishing strong links between MDAs and LCs to collect,
share, and use basic data. The monitoring will track financial flows to LCs, use of grant funds
by LCs, implementation progress on LC annual plans/budgets and service delivery targets and
LC capacity to fulfill its core functions. Building on ongoing impact evaluation work, an
external institution (e.g., a University) will be recruited to provide technical assistance in
strengthening M&E arrangements for the local level (see above).

22.      In order to maximize the benefit of this arrangement, the terms of reference of the entity
conducting the work will include knowledge and capacity transfer. In coordination with the
entity hired, the component will also provide the logistical and technical support necessary to
facilitate joint MDA-LC-DecSec monitoring missions and the production of bi-annual LC
workplan progress reports on the execution of the annual plans and budgets specifically with
respect to service delivery targets and other process indicators (as indicated in the results
framework). DecSec will ensure that the collected data is shared at the LC level and ward
committees and compiled and disseminated to sector ministries and the program steering
committee (see Annex 3 for details). Civil society and NGOs will be directly involved in
monitoring of service delivery results as explained under Component 2 (a).

                            Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements

The Decentralized Service Delivery Program (DSDP) is being designed as an operation to ensure
that Local Councils have predictable and increased financial public resources, and that they carry
out their devolved functions with the aim of improving the availability of basic services. DSDP
will be prepared as an APL with a Sector Wide Program Approach implemented over two
Phases. The first phase of the APL is this project, while World Bank support for the second
phase will become effective subject to the achievement of agreed targets. The DSDP will use, as
much as possible, existing Government structures, in particular the existing Inter-governmental
Fiscal Transfer System and the implementation arrangements set up by the IRCBP and the
IPFMRP.

I.       Background

The Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfer System

1.      The DSDP will use the existing Inter-governmental Fiscal Transfer System, which
derives from the Local Government Act of 2004 (LGA2004) and the Statutory Instrument of
November 2004. The Inter-governmental Fiscal Transfer System (IFTS) regulates funding to
local level development activities by the central government with the aim of bringing services
closer to the people, reducing gaps in service delivery, and equalizing geographic inequalities
between different regions of the country. The design principles and features of the IFTS are as
follows:

a) Principles. The following principles guide the system:

     ·   Equity ­ to ensure that Councils are appropriately and equitably funded to perform
         devolved functions;
     ·   Simplicity ­ to ensure that the formula of grant allocations is as simple as possible, so
         that the system is manageable, understood, and supported;
     ·   Transparency ­ to ensure that the system is understood and that public participation
         exerts additional control on transfers execution;
     ·   Flexibility and adaptability ­ to respond to changing economic, financial, social, and
         implementation circumstances;
     ·   Stability ­ to guarantee predictability of resources and avoid major gaps in financial
         transfers;
     ·   Demand-driven ­ to respond to the financial needs of local communities;
     ·   Autonomy ­ to maintain local level budget autonomy within the national budgetary
         framework; and
     ·   Incentive-based ­ to ensure proper incentives especially with respect to efficiency in
         expenditure.

b) Specific design features include: i) vertical transfers; ii) horizontal transfers; and iii) the
implementation mechanism. In particular:




                                                64
       i.      Vertical transfers. Vertical transfers are related to sector expenditures devolved
               to Councils, as established by the LGA of 2004. Most vertical allocations are for
               non-salary components and include recurrent administrative costs, recurrent costs
               of devolved functions, and selected grants to finance local development projects.
               Grants also cover the salaries of Councils' core staff and "salary-like payments"
               to Councilors. Vertical allocations are determined for each grant type through
               annual budget negotiations which involve the Ministry of Finance and Economic
               Development (MoFED) LGFD, sector ministries, and the Parliament.
       ii.     Horizontal transfers. Once vertical transfers have been determined in their total
               amounts, a horizontal distribution formula among the Local Councils is then used.
               The horizontal formula is based on various indicators including: population,
               number of health and education infrastructures, school enrollment, revenue
               capacity, area under cultivation, and other criteria depending on the type and
               sector of expenditure (see Annex 4).
       iii.    Implementation mechanism. Transfers to finance administrative expenses of
               Councils and devolved functions required by the LGA 2004 to be made on a
               monthly basis, but are more frequently made on a quarterly basis and directly in
               the bank accounts of the Local Councils, service delivery agent providing the
               service or goods, or to schools' accounts for school fees subsidies for primary
               schools (if they have an account). Payments are made on the basis of quarterly
               reports prepared by the Local Councils and on the basis of payment schedules
               with amounts to be paid.

2.      On balance, the IFTS has worked well. A set of fair, equitable and transparent grants
distribution formula has been established and used to transfer grants to local governments. There
has been little or no objection from stakeholders on the formula and there is consensus that the
system is an established functioning mechanism in the Sierra Leone public finances and
decentralization landscape. As prescribed by the Local Government Act (2004) the formula
system will be reviewed and adjusted to reflect the changing needs and reality of Local Councils.
The basic principles of the IFTS will be preserved, and current discussions about changes
revolve around: simplifying the formula system; consolidating the number of grants; ensuring
predictability and timeliness of transfers; and clarifying the role of chiefdoms in exercising their
expenditure and revenue collection authority.

Implementation Arrangements of IRCBP and under IPFMR

3.      Even though the IDA portion of the IRCBP closed on March 31, 2009, the program
continues with support from an EC- and DFID-financed multi-donor trust fund. The program
will be effective until March 2011 and has the following components: 1) Decentralization and
Capacity Building; 2) Public Financial Management Reform (PFMR); 3) Development Learning
Center (dropped at MTR) and; 4) IRCBP Coordination. In June 2008, the IRCBP had already
fully disbursed on Component 1. The IRCBP has been managed as follows: Component 1, by
the Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec) within what is now the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
Local Government and Rural Development (MoIALGRD) and LGFD; and Component 2 by the
PFMR Implementation Unit of what is now the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MoFED). Component 4 was financing management costs of the implementation units. The



                                                65
implementation units of the IRCBP have operated with support from, and under the coordination
of, the IRCBP Coordinating Unit (PCU), which also had the overall financial management and
disbursement responsibility for the Project.

4.      A new Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP) is scheduled
to become effective early in FY10. The IPFMRP will support GoSL in sustainably improving
the credibility, control and transparency in fiscal and budget management, and will develop and
extend some of the activities previously supported by the IRCBP under component 2. The PCU,
DecSec, LGFD, and the PFMR Implementation Unit (renamed as PAU) will retain their
implementation responsibilities, although with a stronger mandate in Project monitoring and
evaluation. A review of the current skills and levels of staff is underway, with the aim to
rationalize the existing structures, to make them more efficient, and in the medium-run to
mainstream them in their respective ministries. Overall, the performance of these units has been
either moderately satisfactory or satisfactory, although in recent times there has been a
worsening of implementation progress indicators (from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory),
to which the GoSL, with support from development partners and the World Bank, has reacted by
proposing changes in staff assignments and their tasks.

II.       Implementation arrangements of the DSDP

5.        The main institutions in charge of the implementation of the DSDP are discussed below.

Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED)

6.      The MoFED will be responsible for the DSDP as a whole; in particular MoFED will have
overall responsibility for the administration, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation of
project activities.

7.     A joint PCU which will absorb the IRCBP and IPFMRP coordination units will be
housed in MoFED and will provide the financial management, procurement and program
monitoring and administration support to the executing agencies, the Local Government Finance
Department (LGFD) and Budget Bureau for Component 1 and DecSec for Component 2. Two
additional staff (program manager and accountant) will be hired to compliment already existing
capacity. Under the World Bank-financed IRCBP, the LGFD and DecSec received significant
capacity building and technical assistance support. In parallel, the Integrated Public Financial
Management Reform Project (IPFMRP), will continue to provide support to the MoFED in the
areas of financial management, budget preparation, and increased transparency of public
finances.

8.     In the context of the DSDP, the MoFED's role, particularly that of the PCU with support
from the LGFD and Budget Bureau, will include:

      ·   Co-sign the Local Council Subsidiary Agreement between MoFED, MoIALGRD, and
          LCs based on development plans and Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF)
          prepared by LCs;




                                                66
   ·   Oversee the notional allocation of the grants and ensuring that fiscal transfers under
       DSPS are consistent with existing fiscal transfer formulae;
   ·   Liaise with key Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and with DPs on issues
       related to project implementation;
   ·   Under Component 1, ensure timeliness of the quarterly disbursements based on quarterly
       returns prepared by Local Councils;
   ·   Ensure the timely execution of all audits;
   ·   Ensure compliance of the DSDP implementation with fiduciary safeguards and other
       safeguards;
   ·   Monitor expenditures and achievements of all DSDP Components;
   ·   With the support of DecSec, prepare the annual reports on activities completed and plans
       for the next fiscal year on all Components;
   ·   Act as the Secretariat of the National Joint Monitoring and Coordinating Committee; and
   ·   Manage the Designated Account.

Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development (MoIALGRD)

9.      Through its Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec), the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local
Government and Rural Development (MoIALGRD) will be the executing agency of Component
2 of the DSDP. DecSec was established to implement the IRCBP and has accumulated
significant experience in the area of capacity building of Local Councils.

10.    In the context of the DSDP the role of the MoIALGRD, and in particular that of DecSec,
with assistance from the PCU which will retain all fiduciary responsibilities for this component
(Financial management, Processing of Withdrawal applications, Procurement, etc.) will include:

   ·   Co-sign the annual Local Council Subsidiary Agreement between MoFED, MoIALGRD
       and LCs based on District development plans and Medium Term Expenditure
       Frameworks (MTEF) prepared by LCs;
   ·   Ensure coordination between component 2 and IRCBP activities now financed by the
       MDTF, and supporting capacity building and technical assistance of Local Councils;
   ·   Support LCs in the procurement of goods, works, and services required by Component 2;
   ·   Liaise with MDAs and with DPs on issues related to project implementation, limited to

Local Councils

11.    There are 19 Local Councils established by the LGA2004, of which 13 are rural districts
and 6 are town Councils. Members of Local Councils and their chairpersons were first elected in
2004 and then in 2008. In the context of the SL-DSDP, the responsibilities of LCs include:

       constituencies through town hall meetings and other means to increase transparency and
       accountability at the local level; and
   ·   Participate in an annual assessment of agreed indicators as per the LC Subsidiary
       Agreement.

Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)

12.     Key Ministries, Departments and Agencies will provide guidance and/or technical
assistance to support the effective planning, management, and delivery of basic services. For the
purposes of this Project, key MDAs include the Ministries of Education, Youth, and Sport;
Health and Sanitation; Agriculture; Housing and Infrastructure Development; Social Welfare,
Gender and Children's Affairs; Lands, Country Planning, and Environment. All these ministries,
in addition to all Local Councils, the SALWACO and SLRA, are eligible to apply to the
Capacity Development and Technical Assistance special financing facility established as part of
Component 2 of the SL-DSDP.

III. Oversight arrangements under DSDP

13.     The National Joint Coordinating and Monitoring Committee, established by MOFED in
collaboration with the MoIALGRD will oversee and monitor overall progress with donor and
government funded programs executed by local councils, including the DSDP and component 1
in particular. The National Joint Coordinating and Monitoring Committee will meet quarterly, or
more frequently if required. Its mandate will include the following functions:

           a. Provide strategic and policy direction and review progress and impact of DSDP
              and in achieving the Policy reform triggers.
           b. Assess needs to strengthen implementation.
           c. Discuss and approve the annual work plans and budgets for Component 1.
           d. Review the relevance and effectiveness of the capacity development support (to
              LCs and MDAs).
           e. Support supervision mission and implementation support mission.
           f. Coordinate the end of Phase 1 review of the DSDP.
           g. Recommend actions for improving LCs performance.
           h. Discuss and recommend specific actions to improve coordination with donors.


                                               68
14.     The National Joint Coordinating and Monitoring Committee membership will consist of
the Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Development, MoFED, Deputy Ministers
MoIALGRD, Commissioner-General of National Commission for Social Action (NACSA),
Executive Director, National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA), Director-General, Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS), Director-General, Sierra Leone Water
Company (SALWACO), Director, Development and Aid Coordinating Office (DACO),
Director, Dec­Sec, Director, LGFD, a Deputy Financial Secretary of MoFED Director, Local
Government, MoIALG&RD, the Professional Head, Ministry of Works, Housing and the
Infrastructure, the Chief Engineer, Water Division, Ministry of Energy and Water Resources,
the Director of Planning (MoFED), Chief Education Officer, Ministry of Education Youth and
Sports (MEYS), Chief Medical Officer, Ministry of Health and Sanitation(MOHS), Chairman,
Local Government Finance Committee (LGFC). Representation from other MDAs will be
brought in as and when necessary. The Committee will be co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of
Finance and Economic Development and a Deputy Minister nominated by the Minister of
Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development.

IV.    Specific arrangements

Council Development Plans

15.     Council development plans are the outcome of a relatively complex process of
consultations with citizens, social and economic groups operating in the district or town, national
and international development partners, local representatives of line ministries, and central
government. Development plans aim at providing a general framework for socio-economic
development in the Council areas by addressing some of the most urgent needs of the population
and prioritizing them. They serve as a basis for Government financial support and for donor
financed interventions. Up to now, the quality of such plans has been good, although issues of
implementation have emerged because of lack of resources at the Local Council levels (reduced
transfers from the GoSL and from DPs, very limited revenue capacity, etc.).

Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)

16.    MTEF is a medium-term (three-year) budgeting instrument based on the development
plans prepared by each Council. 2007-2009 plans and budgets have been prepared by all 19
Councils and approved by the Government.

DSDP Annual Local Council Subsidiary Agreements

17.    The DSDP will retain the current system of District development plans, and MTEF (three
year budgets) are retained as the basis for all activities in support of Local Councils financed by
the DSDP. This approach will bring homogeneity and consistency to the financial planning
exercise and to priority setting. Each Local Council will prepare a draft annual LCA based on its
annual District development plan and budget, and specific targets in the areas of primary
education, primary and secondary health, and rural water supply and sanitation. Other
considerations, such as the LC performance on budget execution, magnitude of fiscal transfers



                                                69
by MoFED, and revenue collection, will be taken into account in preparing the draft annual LC
Subsidiary Agreement which will become the main institutional and contractual instrument to
ensure the timely and efficient execution of activities financed by the DSDP. The annual LC
Subsidiary Agreement will be prepared on the basis of a form, included in the Operational
Manual, which will include a set of performance targets on budget execution and service
delivery output goals.

18.     Once the annual LC Subsidiary Agreements are approved by the oversight Committee,
they will be co-signed by the LCs, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and the
Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development. The signature process
will be completed before the end of the calendar year preceding the year to which the agreement
applies.

Operational Manual

19.     The implementation and monitoring arrangements for the DSDP will be detailed in an
Operational Manual (OM). The manual will describe the overall organization of the project and
will spell out the procedures that the Local Councils will follow in preparing, submitting, and
implementing their plans. The OM will also indicate the arrangements for monitoring and
evaluation, procurement, accounting, and audit. As a general rule, on the basis of recent
procurement assessments, the procurement for goods, of a value up to US$500,000 will follow
the existing country system. In fact, Sierra Leone's Public Procurement Act (PPA) has been
recently enhanced with new regulations and Manuals, which are generally compatible with
World Bank procedures. The Manual will incorporate approaches and procedures to be followed
by Local Councils and other DSDP funded entities. Moreover, the OM will deal with eligible
expenditures based on sector specific priorities. In order to minimize overall transaction costs,
the IRCBP manual and other existing manuals will be used to prepare the OM of the DSDP,
which will be developed around the following structure:

   ·   Section 1 ­ Project rationale, institutional arrangements, mandates and responsibilities;
   ·   Section 2 ­ Component 1 ­ Grants to Local Councils;
   ·   Section 3 ­ Component 2 - Capacity Development and Technical Assistance;
   ·   Section 4 ­ Component 3 ­ Program management;
   ·   Annexes
          o Forms (including the Quarterly reports and the Annual tripartite agreement)
          o Other annexes.

Donor Coordination

20.     As the DSDP is designed around GoSL decentralization and local service delivery
strengthening strategy, it has the flexibility to allow donor financing to come into the program at
any point during program implementation. Major development partners such as the DFID and
EC have participated in the preparation of the program with a view to take part in the program in
Phase II.




                                                70
21.    In the interim, the MoFED will invite the major development partners supporting parts of
the GoSL decentralization program and channeling resources through LCs as observers to bi-
annual Steering Committee meetings. In addition, the World Bank and the MoFED will chair bi-
annual implementation review meetings within the context of the program implementation
support missions. All quarterly and bi-annual progress reports will be shared with the key group
of development partners. The mission timing will be coordinated with that of the IRCBP-
MDTF, PFM, and MDBS programs.

                 Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements


Introduction

1.      The financial management assessment was carried out in accordance with the Financial
Management Practice Manual, issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on 3
November 2005. The objective of the assessment was to determine whether the implementing
entity has acceptable financial management arrangements, which will ensure that: (1) the project
funds are used only for the intended purposes in an efficient and economical way, (2) accurate,
reliable and timely periodic financial reports are prepared, and (3) the entities' assets are
safeguarded.

Implementation Arrangements

2.       This program's overall objective is to support decentralized delivery of basic services in
Sierra Leone. The program will also provide Local Councils (LCs) with substantial additional
funding to GoSL's own budgetary allocation that is generally released to the LCs on a quarterly
basis albeit with delays in some cases. Phase I of the program will focus on strengthening
institutional and organizational capacity at the central and local level to enable LCs to fulfill their
core devolved functions. In Phase II, the program will focus more explicitly on translating the
institutional and organizational capacity into better service outcomes. In Phase III, the program
will be expected to focus on addressing sector-specific gaps in service delivery

3. The program is financing the following three components:

     (i)     Grants to Local Councils ­ funds to supplement the quarterly local council transfers
             currently being administered by the MoFED via the Local Government Finance
             Department (LGFD).

     (ii)    Capacity Development and Technical Assistance ­ this will fill identified gaps in the
             ongoing IRCBP capacity development and TA initiatives for the LCs and MDAs.

     (iii)   Program management ­ will finance operational costs related with the coordination of
             the program and monitoring and evaluation.

4.      The MoFED will have overall oversight role for the program. The program will be
directly administered by a joint PCU to be housed in MOFED which will incorporate the current
IRCBP51 PCU and the IPFMRP PAU. Component 1 will be implemented by the LGFD and the
Budget Bureau using existing GoSL LC transfer mechanisms; i.e., they will be responsible for
grants allocations to LCs based on pre-determined formulae and expenditure monitoring.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local Government and Rural Development
(MoIALGRD) will implement Component 2 through its Decentralization Secretariat.

51
     The IDA credit has closed in March 2009 but a Multi-Donor Trust Fund administered by the World Bank
     continues to support the program.


                                                        72
5.      The joint PCU under the MoFED will oversee all expenditures and be responsible for the
accounting function for the project, including overseeing the arrangements for audits, in
accordance with financial procedures manual for the project that is acceptable to IDA. The
financial management environment will be robust and strengthened by water tight internal
control arrangements that will be under regular review by the internal audit unit of the MoFED.

Country Issues

6.      Sierra Leone has made substantial progress in a number of areas of governance, although
the overall ranking in the Transparency International tables has deteriorated from 150 in 2007 to
158 in 2008 out of 179 and 180 respectively. The peaceful transfer of power from one elected
national government to another in September 2007 is a notable achievement in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and even more so in a post-conflict situation.

7.      PFM has improved significantly over the years as the MTEF budget process has been
strengthened. All MDAs now prepare strategic plans that are aligned to the PRSP objectives.
An Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) has been installed and
implemented in key MDAs. Internal Audit Units have been established in 14 MDAs. The
Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) and related Public Perception Surveys are regularly
conducted and plans of actions developed and implemented based on the recommendations from
PETS.

8.      The GoSL has made substantive progress in strengthening its public financial
management framework and systems, as evidenced in the 2007 PEFA, which showed that more
than 80% of the 2002 CFAA recommendations had been implemented. Major achievements
include establishment of the legal and regulatory framework for budgeting, accountability and
procurement, implementation of an IFMIS in the Accountant General's Department in 2005 and
rolled out to six MDAs in 2007. The substantial backlog of audited annual accounts has been
cleared and the government is now current on its reporting.

9.      On decentralization, implementation of the devolution plan is on-going. A Chiefdom
Governance Act has been developed and approved by Parliament. Local Councils were elected
in 2004, following the enactment of the Local Government Act 2004, and are managing grants,
undertaking participatory planning, and have established basic budgeting, procurement and
accounting procedures. Out of 34 functions of the central government, 19 of these have been
devolved to local councils and 14 out of the 19 elected councils have satisfactorily met the
transparency and financial management accountability requirements in support of delivery of
basic services.

10.    Government is still faced with paucity of required capacity in the all MDAs.
Management and Functional Reviews were conducted for several Ministries, Departments, and
Agencies (MDAs) but the recommendations were not implemented. A Senior Executive Service
(SES) program was initiated and developed with the Bank's assistance but the operating
arrangements and cost structure for the program were never finalized. Comprehensive civil



                                               73
service reform remains a prerequisite and critical for the successful implementation, monitoring
and evaluation of all development programs.

11.     Although a number of relevant pieces of legislation have been passed to ensure better
fiduciary standards, successful implementation typically takes more time, and requires strong
and committed leadership; which is lacking in this environment.

12.    The summary risk analysis is based on the assessment of financial management arrangements
proposed for this program.

13.    In view of the above risk assessment and mitigating measures, the overall financial
management gross risk for the project is rated High and the residual FM risk, is also rated
High, in view of the fact that most of the suggested mitigating measures are to be implemented
during program implementation.

Strengths and Weaknesses

Strength

14.    The implementing agencies are already benefiting from the LGDG and other Bank
interventions, such as the institutional and human capacity of IRCBP that is familiar with the
Bank's procedures.

Weakness

15.    Lack of familiarity with Bank funded projects and requirements in the Local Councils as
well as the likely failure on the part of some Local Councils to submit their expenditure returns
on time could potentially stall operations. This could seriously impact on the timely submission
of the quarterly consolidated IFRs, thereby delaying subsequent releases of funds to the
Designated Account that could result in a cash flow crisis.

16.     Simplified of the procedures used in the transfer mechanism for the GoSL funds to the LCs
through the Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) will be needed to improve its efficiency.

      provided for in the Laws of Sierra Leone
      and that of the Bank.


Staffing

17.   FM capacity varies from one LC to the other, but invariably each LC, with the exception
of Bo City Council, has a Finance Officer recruited through the Local Government Service
Commission (LGSC) and is being mentored by Financial Management Specialists in the
PFMRU.

18.    At the central government level, there is adequate capacity that meets the minimum FM
requirements of the Bank.

Budgeting

19.     Local Council budgeting is based on MTEF, which is work plan driven, and fully
integrated into the central Government's planning process. These budgets contain details of
objectives, expected outcomes, and performance indicators. It is expected that each year LCs
will present annual work plans and budget estimates based on their three year forward
development plans. The program funds will be utilized towards implementation of part of the
annual work plans and budgets. Implementation will be monitored closely via quarterly reports
and expenditure returns submitted to LGFD. Hence budgeting and budget execution will follow
the government system. However, it is important to recognize the challenges being faced in this
area impacting on budget credibility up front which has affected intergovernmental fiscal
transfers from the national budget. Declining tax revenues arising from the global economic
downturn's impact on businesses, liquidity crunch in the banking sector and SL's energy crisis
that has limited level or productivity in formal and informal sectors.

20.     The capacity development activities will be captured in the Annual Work Plans (AWP)
and budget of the Decentralization Secretariat, and will be monitored by the PCU in the MoFED.
Monitoring of budget implementation will be the responsibility of the LGFD. The program
AWP, which will include capacity development and grants to Local Councils, is expected to be
finalized prior to effectiveness.

Accounting

21.     Currently, GoSL accounting transactions are captured on the government IFMIS, while a
selection of four (4) LCs are currently using the PETRA Accounting system on a `proof of
concept' basis. If successful, PETRA will be rolled out to the rest of the LCs over time.

22.     Effort will be made to utilize the existing systems to the extent which it meets the Bank's
reporting requirements.



                                                  78
Internal Control

23.     The approval process and segregation of duties for this program will be integrated into
the existing MoFED processes, and the MoFED Accounting Procedures Manual will be adopted
with minor customization for any new elements covered by the project prior to effectiveness.
The Internal Auditors to be recruited for each LC will regularly review the systems and ensure
the continued adequacy of internal controls at the LCs. This will be complimented by spot audits
undertaken by the MoFED Internal Audit Unit on a sample of LCs throughout the year to ensure
expenditure compliance with grant conditions and annual work plans and there is adequate
transparency and accountability for use of program funds. It is recognized that irregular payment
of salaries to public servants and LC staff pose a GAC risk of potential malpractices by public
servants involved in the project at various levels.
Reporting and Monitoring

24.     Each LC will be required to submit simplified quarterly financial reports to MoFED for
replenishment purposes and program monitoring. The project PCU in MoFED will consolidate
these reports and prepare quarterly unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), using a format
agreed upon at negotiations. The consolidated quarterly unaudited IFRs must be submitted
within 45 days following the end of each reporting calendar quarter.

25.     An LC that fails to submit monthly/quarterly reports within the agreed time will not be
replenished with additional funding until it is in full compliance. Thus, the frequency of LC
transfers will depend on the timely submission of reports by each LC.52

26.    Annually, the program will produce financial statements, to be audited and submitted to
the IDA within six months of the end of the financial year reported on. The financial statements
will be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards that have
adopted to be the national standards in SL by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sierra
Leone.

External Audit

27.      The Audit Service Commission (ASC) of Sierra Leone is by law responsible for the audit
of all government finances and projects. However, in view of the prevailing capacity constraints,
it is likely that ASC will either audit the project jointly with an audit firm acceptable to the IDA, or
outsource such service to a firm of auditors with qualifications and experience acceptable to the IDA,
subject to the IDA/IBRD procurement guidelines for the selection of consultants as revised in
October 2006. The TOR for the auditor that is satisfactory to IDA will detail the scope of work
and form the basis for the engagement of the auditor. The TOR will be prepared by PCU in
consultation with MoFED to be discussed and agreed with IDA within the first quarter within the
first quarter of effectiveness.



52
     Currently, some of the Local Councils have not submitted reports on time. These should not `hold up' transfers to
     other LCs, nor should they be part of transfers made to complying LCs. Compliance with this condition will be
     monitored by the Audit Service Commission.


                                                          79
28.      The appointment of the auditors should be finalized not later than four months of
effectiveness in order to comply with the Financial Covenants and ensure timely audit of
program activities and financial statements. In the case of this program, the audit planning will
need to ensure comprehensive coverage of the use of program funds at each of the 19 LCs, and
shall include an assessment of the level of compliance with internal controls and the expenditure
eligibility framework.

29.    As a Financial Covenant, the audit report must be submitted to the Bank within six
months following the end of each financial year, together with the auditor's management letter
highlighting any deficiencies in financial management systems and the control framework.

30.    Conditionality

Effectiveness condition

  ·   No FM related effectiveness condition is anticipated.

Disbursement condition

  ·   The Audit Service Commission to clear backlog audit reports for the Local Councils before
      disbursement under Component 1 can commence. Transfer of program proceeds to each
      specific Local Council will be subject to the council's audit reports being current. The
      PCU in MoFED, the LGFD and the Budget Bureau will monitor this condition and advise
      IDA for the TTL's no objection to commence transfer of program funds to qualified LCs.

31.    Financial covenants

  ·   Quarterly IFRs will be prepared and sent to the Bank no later than 45 days from the end of
      the quarter. In order to smoothen this process, LCs are advised to submit their expenditure
      returns on a month by month basis to the LGFD and PCU who will review and process
      consolidate these reports into quarterly IFRs.
  ·   Annual audit reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank within six months of the
      end of the financial year under review. The fiscal year in GoSL will be adopted for this
      program, that is, January to December hence the audit due date will be June 30 of each
      year.

32.    Supervision plan. Supervision strategy in the region with regard to project financial
management arrangements is risk based. Accordingly, in view of the High overall financial
management residual risk rating, the supervision plan (by the FM team for Sierra Leone) will
comprise of at least two on-site visits (supervision missions) that will involve visits to all the LCs
or to a representative sample of LCs and other project activities in a year. This will be
complemented by a desk review of the consolidated IFRs submitted to IDA at the end of each
calendar quarter. In addition, the FM team will annually review the audited project annual
financial statements and the auditor's report and management letter thereon.

33.      Flow of Funds, Disbursement and the Designated Account. A single USD
Designated Account (DA) will be opened with a bank acceptable to the IDA. The bank account
will be managed by the PCU in the MoFED. The funds in the DA will be used to fund all
components of this program. The DA will be advanced with Grant proceeds withdrawn from the
Grant account maintained by IDA, based on project needs from time to time. In addition, a
drawdown current account in SL Leones will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA
into which withdrawals from the DA will be deposited. The authorized amount for the
Designated Account will be determined on the basis of the projected expenditure for six months
period and the account will be replenished quarterly on submission of acceptable withdrawal
applications supported by IFRs. The DA will be replenished based on proportional financing
from the Association and the Recipient for expenditures pertaining to Component 1 of the
program. For FY 2010, the agreed ratio to be used for replenishments will be 1(IDA):2 (GoSL).
The ratio will be reviewed through the year based on actual expenditures as reported in the IFRs
and may be revised after the first year of the program implementation in consultation with the
GoSL and with the approval of the TTL. Expenditures pertaining to the Components 2 and 3 of
the program will be financed 100 percent. For Component 1, the existing GoSL MOFED
channels will be used for the transfer of the funds from the draw down Leones account into the
LC accounts. For Component 2 and 3, funds will be channeled by the Joint PCU to
Decentralization Secretariat for the implementation of program activities. Additional details and
instructions will be advised in the Disbursement Letter to be discussed and agreed at
negotiations. The Joint PCU under the MOFED will be responsible for expenditures and
financial reporting.

34.     The MoFED on basis of quarterly monitoring reports provided by the PCU will transfer
funds from the Designated Account periodically (quarterly) as illustrated in the diagram above
through the LGFD to the LCs' dedicated bank account to be utilized to fund project activities in
accordance with an Operational Manual and the Financial Procedures Manual. The operation of
the bank account at the LC level will follow the same arrangement that is being used for GoSL's
fiscal transfers at the Local Councils. The Manual will detail the minimum performance
requirements for the councils to be able to access the Decentralized Service Delivery Grant
subject to meeting the disbursement condition to be reflected in the Financing Agreement.

35.   Activities within Component 2 will be paid for directly from the DA upon submission by
Decentralization Secretariat of appropriate supporting documents to MoFED.

Disbursement Arrangements

36.     The program will use the report based disbursement procedure using the quarterly IFRs
to determine the amounts to be advanced in the first release and in the subsequent quarterly
replenishments. All the various disbursement methods will be applicable, i.e., Advances to the
DA, Reimbursement for expenditures that have been pre-financed by GoSL, Direct Payments to
suppliers of goods and services and Special Commitment to foreign suppliers of goods backed by
irrevocable Letters of Credit opened by the PCU/MoFED with commercial banks in Sierra
Leone. However, the bulk of the IDA Credit proceeds will be disbursed through the advances
method under Component 1 (LC grants component). Quarterly direct transfer as indicated above
will be effected in Leones by MoFED supported by the PCU through the LGFD.

37.     Local Councils will receive the LC Grant funds and the GoSL fiscal transfers from the
MoFED and deposit both these funds into `pooled' bank accounts at the LC level. The GoSL
and IDA will agree on the annual budgets and work plans for all the subprograms for each of the
19 LCs to be spent under the sectors already identified and agreed. The initial definitive
proportion of financing between IDA and GoSL has been agreed at negotiations, while
subsequent proportions will be determined by IDA and GoSL and adjusted on the basis of the
actual ratio of funds received by the LCs for the previous calendar quarter. This information will
be in the supporting schedules to the IFRs for the quarter ended. In essence, the LCs would be
expected to submit monthly expenditure reports to the PCU in MoFED through the LGFD on the
use of funds in order to receive additional funding to replenish the project account.
Replenishments to LCs will be based on full compliance with the reporting requirements. This
will be monitored by the Bank during implementation supervision visits. This principle will be
reviewed and modified as necessary at mid-term review stage. The allocation of funding to
project expenditure categories is shown in the following Table.

GAC Red Flag

38.     Untimely and infrequent Local Council transfers by GoSL means key Local Council
staffs sometimes endure without salaries for periods ranging between 3 to 6 months. There is a
high risk that such situations could entice the affected persons to engage in fraudulent or rent-
seeking behavior and other malpractices. IDA Credit proceeds may not be immune /protected
from this behavior. However, every effort will be put in place to mitigate this risk by advocating
for good governance, close monitoring, and spot checks by the internal audit unit and enhanced
social responsibility by GoSL to government and project staff, e.g., timely payment of salaries,
and participation of civil society in monitoring government's delivery of basic services.


Conclusions of the FM Assessments

39.    The proposed FM arrangement for the Decentralized Service Delivery Project to be
administered by the PCU under the oversight and guidance of MoFED meets the minimum
requirements for a robust and sound financial management with well recognized and adequately
mitigated High FM residual risks as required under OP/BP 10.02.

                           Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
A. General

1.      Sierra Leone Procurement Environment: The Government has introduced a number
of reforms in public financial management (PFM), including public procurement reforms meant
to reduce the opportunities for corruption. The implementation of the public procurement law
enacted in 2004 is part of the PFM reforms component of the World Bank-financed Institutional
Reforms and Capacity Building (IRCB) Project that is being implemented by the MoFED.

2.      The Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2004 is comprehensive and covers all procurement in
the public sector (Central Management Agencies; Ministries, Departments and Agencies
(MDAs); Metropolitan, Municipal and District Councils; parastatal organizations; and State-
Owned Enterprises). The PPA created the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA), an
autonomous regulator empowered to set rules and oversee public procurement practices by all
public sector bodies. In turn, the NPPA has issued standard bidding documents and regulations
to ensure open, competitive procurement across government. Dissemination of regulations has
been carried out and procurement plans of many MDAs are tied into the budgeting process.
Capacity building, development of a procurement cadre within the public sector, and auditing of
entities are the current challenges being tackled. Progress is being monitored under the MDBs
Budget support for Sierra Leone.

3.     Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 revised
October 2006; "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004 revised October 2006; and the provisions stipulated in the Legal
Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general
below. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the different procurement methods or
consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and the time frame must be agreed upon between the Borrower and the World
Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

4.      Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project would include: minor
rehabilitation and maintenance of water systems, schools, and clinics. The procurement will be
done using the World Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD
agreed-upon or satisfactory to the World Bank.

5.      Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: equipment
and materials related to the health and sanitation, education, water and solid waste management
sectors such as machine parts, drugs, etc. The procurement will be done using the World Bank's
SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed upon or satisfactory to the World Bank.

6.    Procurement of non-consulting services: The program is expected to fund training,
workshops and exchange visits under the capacity development component. Some of these



                                              84
services will be provided directly by DecSec.              The exchange visits will be identified in
consultation with IDA.

7.     Selection of Consultants: The program will support hiring experts/specialists to provide
technical assistance for short periods under Component 2 and 3. Short lists of consultants for
services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely
of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines. An internationally renowned research institute will be contracted to provide
monitoring and evaluation services.

8.    Operating Costs: The program will finance payments of salaries of PCU staff, office
equipment and supplies, office space, utilities, and travel costs as needed.

9.    The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well
as model contracts for works and goods procured, will be presented in the program Operational
Manual.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

10.     It is envisaged that most procurement activities will be carried out by the Local Councils.
The LCs are staffed by Mayor/Council Chair, Chief Administrators, and their deputies, Financial
Controllers, Accountants, and Procurement Officers. The procurement officers have received
training in World Bank and GoSL procurement.

11.     An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project was carried out by Tsri Apronti in July 2009. The assessment reviewed
the organizational structure for implementing the project, the interaction between staff
responsible for procurement, and the Ministry's relevant central unit for administration and
finance. Plans to enhance the procurement capacity of the Councils have been ongoing.
Procurement Officers who assumed positions in November 2007 received advanced training in
2008, and have been exposed to the procurement function over the years through their
involvement in the IDA-financed RCHP and IRCBP.

12.     The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have
been identified. Both these and the corrective measures which have been agreed upon are
detailed below:

13.     The overall project risk for procurement is HIGH.

C. Procurement Plan

14.      The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed upon between
the Borrower and the Project Team on August 27, 2009 and is available at the Joint PCU offices.
It will also be available in the project's database and in the World Bank's external website. The
Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

        15.    In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from World Bank offices, the
        capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended bi-annual supervision
        missions to visit the field and carry out post review of procurement actions.

        E. Details of the Procurement Arrangements

        16.    A list of contract packages for initial 12 months; these have been discussed and agreed on
        during appraisal. The exact dates for the indicated contracts will be demand-driven and will
        depend on pace of implementation of the capacity development grants. Technical assistance for
        monitoring and evaluation and development planning and budgeting will be procured on an
        ongoing basis. LC transfers will be made quarterly as described in the main text and Annex 4.

                          Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Introduction

1.      The proposed DSDP project is an investment operation aimed at protecting delivery of
basic services by providing incremental financing over and above government allocations for LC
activities. As established in Annex 1, resources made available to the LCs are not adequate to
allow LCs to maximize the delivery of public services given existing sector investments. This
project is therefore intended to help fill the gap between reasonable needs and prevailing
available resources to operate and maintain existing infrastructure.

2.      Given the demand-driven nature of the LC transfers, it is not possible to know a priori
precisely how the resources will be allocated. The transfers are to be utilized across a range of
devolved activities in health, education, water and sanitation and solid waste management
sectors. Nevertheless, the precise activities in these sectors are not predetermined, nor will they
be the same for all Councils. Standard ex ante economic analysis is not possible in this context.
Instead, the economic analysis here appraises the mechanism for delivering the outputs rather
than specific investments due to the "framework" nature of the project, in which most of the
major investments are not identified or designed in detail before loan/credit effectiveness. This
section therefore reviews: i) the mechanism that will be used for screening the activities to be
undertaken to ensure that they are economically justified, ii) the criteria that will be applied to
different kinds of activities, and iii) the adequacy of the institutional and budgetary arrangements
and skills for doing this. The annex concludes with a review of the fiscal impact of the project
on the government budget.

B. Economic Analysis

3.      Screening mechanism: For Component 1, LCs will be expected to utilize program
funds for a set of agreed activities contained in their annual local development work plans and
sector plans. These activities will be directly linked to the desired MDG outcomes and sector
priorities. The annual work plans are screened by the Local Government Finance Department.
When a work plan is judged inadequate, the LGFD will work with the responsible LC to bring
the plan up to acceptable standards. Special emphasis will be placed on screening out activities
that are unlikely to be economically justified. Table 1.3 in Annex 1 outlines the distribution
formulae for each of the grants for sector specific activities and administrative expenditures.

4.     There will be a feed-back loop via monitoring and evaluation. Even though the LCs will
use the supplement across the range of devolved functions, the program will emphasize and
monitor a set of agreed results in health, education, and water and sanitation. The LCs, MoFED,
and MoIALGRD will enter into annual subsidiary agreements around an agreed set of
performance targets on planning and budget execution and service delivery improvements. The
LCs' performance will be assessed annually during the program.

5.     A large portion of the support under Component 2 will be demand driven and accessible
by both LCs and MDAs via submission of proposals for specific needs. Each LC will have the
option to submit an annual plan outlining their capacity development needs in order to achieve


                                                90
the agreed annual results/targets. The capacity development plan will need to be closely linked
to the performance targets to which each LC has committed. There will be a notional allocation
per LC and MDA (see Annex 4). To ensure coordination with TA and training provided by other
partners, each proposal will be signed off by all stakeholders: Ministry, relevant sector steering
committees, and LGFD. The plans will be reviewed by DecSec and LGFD.

6.     Activity screening criteria: Expenditures eligible for program financing for Component
1 will be in line with the existing devolved function grants in the four priority sectors.
Expenditures will be screened against LC annual development plans/budgets and Subsidiary
Agreements.

7.      For Component 2, the expenditures are targeted towards capacity development activities
in basic PFM functions, planning, M&E, social accountability, and other LC- and MDA-specific
needs (demand-driven) not covered by the IRCBP and IPFMRP. Within these, expenditures
must be limited to training, hiring contractual staff for priority LC and MDA functions,
equipment, study visits, and other.

8.      Average Returns to Spending: The project supports decentralized spending on health,
education, and water supply and sanitation. As such, the incremental expenditures represent
direct investments in human capital. The economic literature is clear that such investments can
have high rates of returns.

   ·   Education: Cross-country regressions on the impact of public spending suggest that
       increased public spending on primary education can reduce the failure rate of students,
       e.g., can increase the probability that more students will go on to secondary school. For
       example, a 10 percent increase in the GDP share of spending on education could reduce
       the failure rate by approximately 4 percent. The study also shows that the impact of
       public expenditures (e.g., elasticity of the failure rate to spending as a share of GDP) is
       more positive for those countries with higher scores for the quality of governance. For
       more on this subject, please see Rajkumar and Swaroop, 2002, "Public Spending and
       Outcomes: Does Governance Matter?" Journal of Development Economics.
   ·   Health: Cross-country regressions included in a report on how to meet the Millennium
       Development Goals for Health suggest that increased public spending on health services
       can have a positive impact. For example, a 10 percent increase in the GDP share of
       spending on health could reduce maternal mortality by approximately 5 percent. The
       study also shows that the impact of public expenditures (e.g., elasticity of health
       indicators to spending as a share of GDP) is far more positive for those countries with
       higher scores for the quality of governance. For more on this subject, see Wagstaff and
       Claeson, 2004, "The MDGs for Health: Rising to the Challenges," The World Bank.
   ·   Water and sanitation: A detailed benefit-cost analysis of water and sanitation
       interventions around the world was conducted recently by a WHO report. Several types
       of interventions similar to those pursued in Sierra Leone were evaluated including: (1)
       improvements required to meet the MDG for water supply (halving by 2015 the
       proportion of those without access to safe drinking water); (2) meeting the water MDG
       plus halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to adequate sanitation; and
       (3) increasing access to improved water and sanitation for everyone. A detailed model


                                               91
       was developed to estimate these costs and benefits. Results are not available for Sierra
       Leone alone, but they are for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. The estimated benefit-cost
       ratios for each option are fairly high, in the range of 12 percent. For more information,
       please see Hutton and Haller, 2004, "Evaluation of the Costs and Benefits of Water and
       Sanitation Improvements at the Global Level," WHO.

9.      Adequacy of the institutional and budgetary arrangements: The capacity of LGFD to
screen and monitor proposed activities is fair. LGFD issues guidelines on the use of the funds
and assists LCs with their annual development planning and budgeting. LGFD is also
responsible for collecting the returns on the expenditures. This system has not functioned
perfectly, particularly with delays on expenditure returns and compilation of data by LGFD.
IRCBP will supplement LGFD capacity with additional accounting staff to assist with
expenditure monitoring and reporting. In addition, the new accounting system being rolled out
to LCs will also greatly facilitate capturing of expenditures and reporting to LGFD.

C. Financial Analysis

10.   As outlined above, resources made available to the LCs are not adequate to allow LCs to
maximize the delivery of public services. This project is therefore intended to help fill the gap
between reasonable needs and prevailing available resources. Thus, by design, any increase in
LC expenditures resulting from the project will be fully financed from the project.

11.    The proposed project will not have an adverse impact on the budgets of the central or
local governments. Program funding will complement existing budgetary allocations for Local
Council transfers. No counterpart funds are required, but GoSL will need to continue to effect
Local Council transfers on a quarterly basis and do so as per the stipulated budget allocations.
The project will not require new taxes or new subsidies. The project does not include physical
investments in schools, health facilities, or water works, and therefore it will not result in new,
incremental operations and maintenance costs.




                                                92
                               Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues

1.    Although the project does not anticipate any significant environmental impact, Component
1 may have some environmental impact. Component 1 provides grants to LCs that will be used
for expenditures associated with supervision, maintenance, materials, and equipment.
Maintenance may include repairs and minor rehabilitation of schools, health facilities, piped
water systems, boreholes, drainage pipes, etc. The exact nature of the investments cannot be
foreseen at this time, as they will be identified and managed by Local Councils through a
planning and budgetary process during project execution. The potential environmental and
social effects of these investments are unlikely to be significant. No activities involving
involuntary land acquisition will be eligible under the program.

2.     To address any potential environmental and social impacts, the borrower has in place a
system of environmental screening and impact mitigation mechanism at the local council level.
An environmental and social impact checklist is used to screen all activities included in the Local
Development Plans whether they involve construction, maintenance and operation. This system
was established by the IDA financed Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project
(IRCBP). The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the IRCBP has
been adapted for the DSDP (only very minor changes were required) and was re-disclosed. The
disclosure of safeguard policies is being done at several instances: (i) prior to appraisal, to ensure
that the documents are accessible to the public, including communities at the LC level and NGOs
and other stakeholders; (ii) during the project launch as part of the training on the Operational
Manual and (iii) as part of individual training for Local Councils. All Local Councils have
already received training of environmental management within the framework of IRCBP.

 WASHINGTON DC 20431

 Dear President Zoelick

        Sector Policy Letter for the Decentralized Basic Service Delivery Programme

 Introduction

 As you know, the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) re-introduced decentralized
 governance in 2004' following the enachnent of the Local Government Act 20042 (LGA-
 04) and the Local Government Assumption of Functions 2004 (Statutory Instrument No.
 l3 of LGA 2004). The LGA-04 introduced an equitable and transparent
 intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, from the center to the local level, so as to reduce
 the resource gaps and income inequalities among regions.

 The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) funded initially by the
 World Bank and now funded tmder a multi-donor trust fund arrangement involving the
 World Bank~ European Commission (EC) and the Department for lnternational
 Development (DflD). It was designed as a major instrument which the Bank. supp::>rts
 the landmark institutional transformation envisaged in the Local Government Act,
 2004 to assist(i) Government of Sierra Leone design and implement a sustainable fiscal
 decentralization strategy; (ii) help newly elected local governments acquire the
 management skills necessary to translate resources into service delivery improvements
 on the groWld; and (iii) help establish a culture of transparency and accountability in
 local government. Since 2004, tremendous progress has been achieved in the
 decentralization programme in this respect including significant improvements in service
 delivery.

 Progress so far on the Decentralization Program

 To enhance informed local level decision-making. a framework fo r Monitoring and
 Evaluation for Local Councils was designed and is being implemented in all the J9 Local
 Councils. In addition, a Comprehensive Local Government Performance Assessment
 System (CLoGPAS) is being implemented annually. The results of the annual CLoGPAS
 are used, inter alia, for capacity building programme support.

 I   The first Local Government elections were held in May 2004, and the second in Ju1y 2008.
 1   The LGA·04 created 19 Local Councils: the Freetown City Counc il; 5 urban and 13 rural councils
     respectively.




                                                      94
Supporting local level inclusion, planning and budgeting has been a priority focus area of
the decentralization program. In this regard, Ward Committees Elections were
successfully conducted in 2004 and 200& in line with the relevant provisions of the LOA-
04. To date, 394 Ward Committees have been constituted and are receiving support from
central goverrunent to meet the cost of basic administrative activities.

In addition to facilitating and supporting the establishment of key structures and
institutions in furtherance of the nationa1 decentralization programme, capacity building
during the transition period focused on (i) provision of logistics, equipment and office
complexes for Local Councils; (ii) training of Local Council/devolved MDA staff, Civil
Society and Ward Committees; and (iii) . strengthening the fntergovemmental Fiscal
Transfer systems.

By end of 2008, responsibilities for substantial basic social services had been transferred
to the Councils. These services include primary and secondary health (including the
procurement of drugs for both Peripheral Health Units and District Hospitals), primary
and junior-secondary education (including the payment of school fees subsidies,
distribution of text books and, teaching and learning materials) agriculture extension
services, rural water supply and solid waste management.

Grants transferred from Central Government to Local Councils currently account for
more than 75 percent of the resources available to Local Councils for service delivery.
These transfers are categorised as pro-poor poverty expendirure and as such, arc fully
protected. With effect from September 2009, all salaries of staff carrying out devolved
functions in Local Councils will be directly transferred to the bank accounts of the Local
Councils for onward payment to these staff. The objective is to ensure proper
accountability and effective oversight of the devolved staff by the Local Council
Administration.

Second Generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper: The Agenda for Change

The Government's new Poverty Reduction Strategy and Agenda for Change-PRSP II
outlines new priorities to improve service delivery and reduce poverty. Most of the
programmes under the strategies have clear links to the functions devolved to Local
Councils. Hence, the role of Local Councils in the successful implementation of the
Agenda for Change is critical.

The Agenda for Change re-emphasizes the importance of strengthening decentralized
service delivery in order to record tangible achievements, especially in human
development. With a view to achieving better results, the Government, in particular: (i)
intends to introduce and adopt refmement to the intergovernmental fiscal transfer !iystem
with respect to the determination of the total vertical envelope and horizontal distribution
of resources across Local Councils; (ii) amend the LGA and any other legislation to
improve the institutional framewo rk for decenttalized service delivery; (iii) full
devolution of all staff - such as staff working in junior and secondary schools and
primary and secondary health facilities - including payment of salaries; and (iv) ensure
that Ward committees are operational and take active part in the planning and budgeting
process of each Local Council.

To this end. the preparation of a comprehensive det:entralization policy is far advanced.
and this which will address issues of conflict and non-clarity of roles and responsibilities




                                              95
among stakeholders involved in the Decentralization process. Additionally, the review of
the Local Government Act, 2004 and other related regulations will commence as soon as
the policy is completed.

Timeliqess or Resource Flows

Reforms have been instiruted at the National Revenue Authority (NRA) to ensure
maximum efforts in mobilizing domestic revenue. The Goods and Service Tax will
become operational in 2009 as well as the computerization of the Customs Department
Additionally, various consultations have been held with our Development Partners to
improve on the timeliness of disbursement of budget support.

In the light of the above, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in 2010
and beyond would inform all Local Councils at least month in advance of the
programmed transfers for the subsequent quarter to enable them effectively p lan their
activities in advance.

Monitoring and Evaluation

A National Joint Coordinating and Monitoring Committee has been established to
provide effective oversight that will ensure timely implementation of quality projects by
Local Councils in accordance with their development plans. Its membership comprises of
officials of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs. Local Government and Rural Development and other Ministries, Departments
and Agencies including Sierra Leone Water Company. National Public Procurement ·
Authority (NPPA), National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) and the Water
Division of the . Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. The Committee is co-chaired
by the Deputy Ministers of Finance and Economic Development, and Internal Affairs,
Local Government and Rural Development.

Condwion

Despite the enormous progress made tOYf'8l'ds the effective implementation of the
decentralization programme, critical challenges that may impact negatively on effective
delivery of services by the Local Councils require our attention. The proposed
Decentralized Service Delivery Programme will, therefore, complement the
Government' s efforts in improving public sector management and address critical issues
relating to imprOVed service delivery in local communities.

In particular, by injecting predictable and additional resources into Local Councils, it will
provide an opportunity to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system and
local development planning processes. Furthermore, with the flexibility to address
capacity-development needs, the program will enhance local development planning and
budgeting, monitoring systems and functions of both Local Councils and MDAs. Above
all, over the long run, the programme will provide a platfonn for better consolidalion and
effective utilization of donor resources flowing to Councils for improved service
delivery. In this vein, government is committed to increase the transfers to Local
Councils in the short to long run as our fiscal situation improves, resources become more
predictable and the absorptive capacity of the Councils improved upon. Consistent with
the LOA 2004, government would continue to ensure that these transfers are increased on
a gradual basis each year.
