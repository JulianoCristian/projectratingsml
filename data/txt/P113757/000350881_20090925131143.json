Decentralized\n            Service Delivery Program Project for Sierra Leone is to\n            support decentralized delivery of basic services: (a) to\n            strengthen Government capacity to manage decentralized\n            services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability\n            of Local Councils' (LCs) funding; and (c) to strengthen\n            the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. The project\n            has three components: (1) grants to LCs\u0092 to supplement the\n            central budget transfers to LCs; (2) capacity development\n            and technical assistance to strengthen LCs' capacity to\n            perform their core functions and central government capacity\n            to provide adequate strategic guidance and oversight to LCs;\n            and (3) program management component. The emphasis will be\n            on improved planning, budgeting, monitoring and\n            accountability mechanisms with civil society and citizen participation."}, "docdt": "2009-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
