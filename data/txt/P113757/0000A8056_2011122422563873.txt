                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the program (APL) is to support decentralized delivery of basic services in Sierra Leone. The development objective of Phase I of the
                         program is: (a) to strengthen Government capacity to manage decentralized services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability of Local Councils'
                         funding; and (c) to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is largely on track and implementation progress is satisfactory. The breakdown by component for the ratings is as follows: (i) component 1: Local council grants;
                         satisfactory; (ii) component 2-capacity development; satisfactory; (iii) component 3-program management; satisfactory. It is also important to note that project management has
                         improved over the implementation period and that the project has kept up with its goal to improve Government transfers to local councils are predictable as all quarterly transfers out
                         of the national budget have been effected according to an agreed schedule and in full (except in cases of inadequate reporting on the part of the local council.)

                         Contracting the community monitoring pilot by NGOs has taken longer than expected and the project will need at least a six month extension to allow the full year pilot to be
                         completed. The work is further delayed because the baseline information from INSPS 2010 is yet to be tabulated. It has been agreed to roll this activity over to the second Phase of
                         the project which is expected to be effective by the middle of calendar year 2012 before the first phase closes.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission held extensive discussions on the implementation of the program and reached the following key decisions:

                         1. With the finalization of the Environmental Social Safeguards Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), the lacuna in the safeguards area have been
                         addressed.
                         2. The issue of mainstreaming the decentralization secretariat (DecSec) into the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLGRD) has been pending for a long time
                         and during the negotiations for the second phase of DSDP-2, it was agreed that the mainstreaming would be an effectiveness condition for the second phase.
                         3. All triggers have been met with the exception of trigger no. iii (reducing the number of government grants to LCs to fund education, health and sanitation, rural water, solid waste
                         management services and social assistance services from nine to six by FY12). Delays in meeting the requirements for trigger iii were the result of differences in the institutional and
                         accounting capacities in the education and health sectors. Remedial actions were discussed and include ongoing institutional and capacity strengthening activities as well as the
                         implementation of the Local Council Subsidiary Agreements which include performance based contracts.
