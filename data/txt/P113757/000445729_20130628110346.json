Service\n            Delivery Program Project for Sierra Leone were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            confirms the effectiveness of phased, long-term support to\n            Government reform processes; the mainstreaming of\n            specialized units for technical support and/or project\n            implementation needs to be carefully detailed with\n            time-bound action plans developed during project\n            preparation; the appropriate sequencing of activities,\n            particularly regarding capacity building, is critical to\n            successful implementation; with adequate investment, regular\n            and comprehensive surveys are possible in low-capacity\n            contexts and can serve as useful learning tools; and with\n            some adjustments, the adoption of the subsidiary agreements\n            as part of the standard Local Council (LC) operating\n            procedures could provide an effective benchmarking tool to\n            measure service delivery at the local level."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
