There are three project components. The first\n            component, strengthening hospital management and improving\n            service quality, will strengthen hospital strategic planning\n            capacity and introducing organizational and management\n            tools, procedures, and information systems needed for\n            decision-making and resource allocation processes. It will\n            also establish quality control mechanisms, implement\n            staffing norms, and provide training. The second component,\n            improving health sector financing, will develop and\n            introduce a health insurance scheme with mandatory\n            enrollment for public and formal private sector employees,\n            and develop and test financing mechanisms which ensure\n            access to health care for the poor.
