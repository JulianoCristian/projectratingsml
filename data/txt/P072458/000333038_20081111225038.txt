1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

When the project was prepared and appraised, Algeria was barely emerging from a decade of
terrorism and from many years of severe economic crises, during which the country's critical
hydrocarbon revenues had plummeted. The tragic period of the 1990s had major costs: (i) in
human terms, as shown by a high number of casualties, disruption of social life, emigration of
large numbers of educated people, deterioration of the education system, and isolation of the
country from the outside world; and (ii) in economic terms with a continuous drop of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita from 1990 to 1997, significant destruction of assets, a
general deterioration of infrastructure, and severe fiscal and current account deficits. In the
midst of this economic backsliding, the country had also started a difficult transition from a
centrally planned economy to a market-driven economy, together with a fundamental opening of
the political process with the end of the one-party era.

Stabilization and adjustment programs started around 1994 and some initial success in structural
reforms and higher oil prices created the basis for growth recovery, with GDP increases
averaging 3.4 percent between 1998 and 2002. Still, Algeria started the new millennium with a
huge backlog in infrastructure, largely unmet expectations of the population in terms of public
services, and significant foreign debt service obligations. The Government of Algeria (GoA) and
the Bank engaged in the preparation of a number of technical assistance projects in support of
initial reforms in various sectors and fields: the financial sector, postal and telecommunications
services, energy and mining, budgetary systems and restructuring/privatization of the country's
large number of State-owned Enterprises (SOEs). Key drivers of the reform program were
liberalization, opening to the private sector and private sector development, and initiation of
privatization of SOEs, the latter supported by a Bank Privatization Technical Assistance
Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) approved in 2000.

In this same vein, the GoA and the World Bank undertook the preparation of a technical
assistance project for the transport sector, with the same thrust for important sector reforms and
broadly similar objectives of liberalization, privatization and participation of the private sector
through Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs), a major innovation in Algeria. Given Algeria's
huge infrastructure modernization and expansion needs and the Government's budgetary
constraints, the PPP schemes seemed to be a promising alternative, whereby private partners -
particularly international operators - would contribute financially and bear financial risks in
addition to providing management and expertise. Reform-minded members of the Algerian
Government promoted policies favoring privatization and private sector development to redirect
Algeria's transition from the centrally planned economic approach followed during the previous
25 years. Prospects appeared good that resistance to change from entrenched interests benefiting
from the planned economy could be overcome. Also, a key underlying assumption was that with
the volatility of oil prices, Algeria would continue to face financial constraints in its
development, as it had often experienced in the past when oil exports were down or at least not
commensurate with its investment needs. In transport, as in other sectors, it was widely believed
that due to persistent financing constraints, the prospects of private financial contributions

Transport Technical Assistance Project                                                                 June 2008


through PPPs and financial support from the Bank and other development partners1 would be
strong incentives to engage reforms. Similarly, it was anticipated that most stakeholders would
support reforms, including development of PPPs, with the expectation that PPPs would bring
about efficiency gains and contribute significantly in meeting the population's expectations for
better public service delivery. This was critical, particularly as long as financial resource
limitations would constrain major expansions of infrastructure. This context reinforced over-
optimistic expectations - frequently encountered with Bank staff - that deep reforms could thus
be swiftly implemented.

The Bank has had a long involvement in Algeria's transport sector, with six highway projects
and three port projects. The third port project (closed in 19982) and the sixth highway (closed in
December 20023) were mostly investment-oriented. The Transport Sector Strategy Note of 1999
underpinned the dialogue between GoA and the Bank, and identified critical issues for the
liberalization and modernization of the transport sector. It also paved the way for this Transport
Technical Assistance (TTA) Project. Preparatory work for the new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) of June 2003 started at the time of the TTA project approval. This CAS laid out a
strategy with a number of objectives consistent with the Transport Sector Strategy Note and the
TTA project, i.e.: removing constraints to private sector growth, inter alia through better
infrastructure development and better service delivery in transport, and promoting private sector
development in key sectors including transport.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Following the 1999 Transport Sector Strategy Note, the GoA acknowledged the pressing need to
modernize and expand its transport services and systems, and to improve the integration of
transport modes, and requested Bank support for the required institutional reforms. The Project
Development Objectives were to: (a) set up a policy and institutional framework encouraging
competition and private participation in infrastructure; (b) demonstrate the viability of
mainstreaming transport concessions through the successful launching of two schemes, one as a
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) for the Algiers subway, the other as a concession to operate part
of the port of Djendjen; (c) strengthen GoA's capacity to manage and regulate the transport
sector; and (d) rehabilitate the railways to ensure improved and more efficient transport of people
and freight nationwide. The project was not intended to cover the road sector and the Sixth
Highways Project was still under execution at the time of appraisal.

Key performance indicators were as follows: (see Datasheet)
·   Transport services liberalized by 2005.
·   New port and airport PPI schemes launched by 2005 covering, respectively, at least 1 million
    tons of general cargo and transporting over 500,000 passengers.
·   Urban bus transport provided under competitively awarded concession contracts by 2005.
·   Combined rail traffic of over 4,500 million units by 2005.



1The Bank's involvement in a number of sectors was paving the way for renewed support from partners such as the
EU, EIB and AFD.
2The ICR assessed it as satisfactory and concluded that is was meeting its development objectives
3The ICR rated its outcome as unsatisfactory: the main physical objectives were achieved but modernization of the
Ministry of Public Works and sustainability of road maintenance were assessed as uncertain.

1.3 Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


The PDOs were not revised, even after the mid-term review when the project was slightly
modified4 and the closing date extended by two years.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The population at large was expected to benefit from reforms implemented under the project.
Taxpayers should eventually bear lower transport subsidies when the project's new policies were
implemented. More broadly, the benefits generated by the project should help to improve
Algeria's overall economic system.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

There were six components as follows:

Component 1: Ports (Total cost: US$2.4 million)

The port component was to: (i) implement an institutional framework for better public planning,
land management and regulation of Algeria's ports, while opening the delivery of services to
private sector participation under competitive conditions; and (ii) support concessioning of
international transshipment activities within the port of Djendjen.

Component 2: Airports (Total cost: US$0.4 million)

The airport component was designed to: (i) adapt the national airport policy framework to create
conditions of financial sustainability and allow new airport concessioning; (ii) ensure a
harmonious integration of Algiers airport into the new framework; and (iii) develop regulatory
capacities.

Component 3: Air transport (Total cost: US$0.6 million)

The air transport component was to: (i) update Algeria's air transport strategy to liberalize
international transport and assist the Directorate for Civil Aviation in negotiations of air transport
treaties with other nations; (ii) develop a regulatory framework consistent with the strategy; and
(iii) strengthen the regulatory capacity.

Component 4: Railways (Total cost: US$ 3.7 million)

The railways rehabilitation component was designed to: (i) restructure the Société Nationale de
Transport Ferroviaire (SNTF), the national railway company, to make it more competitive and
financially sustainable; (ii) improve SNTF staff skills particularly in areas of finance and
marketing; and (iii) prepare a core investment program in support of the rehabilitation strategy.

Component 5: Urban transport (Total cost: US$3.8 million)


4Changes agreed with GoA did not require a full-fledged restructuring, as explained in section 1.6

The urban transport component was to: (i) set up an autonomous management and regulatory
authority for the Greater Algiers region and create conditions for harmonious development and
adequate funding of public transport, including the future subway system; and (ii) support
concessioning of this subway system.

Component 6: Project financial management (Total cost: US$0.05 million)

This component was to ensure that the Project would have a Financial Management System
complying with the Bank's requirements for administration, reporting and transaction recording.

1.6 Revised Components

After the 2005 Mid-Term Review, the initial project objectives remained valid and the
components were essentially not revised. The policy options of the new Roadmap for Reforms
prepared in 2004 (see Section 1.7) remained consistent with the project DOs and the studies was
partly refocused to fully support implementation of the Roadmap.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

After delayed Project implementation, (effectiveness took place about one year after Board
approval) and subsequent slow progress, the Mid-Term Review initially scheduled for January
2003 was delayed and eventually took place in January 2005. During the first two years of
implementation, there were two Government reshuffles during which the Minister of Transport,
the key Bank counterpart, was replaced. This factor, together with the 2003 presidential election
period, created a degree of uncertainty and questions were raised as to the GoA's commitment to
the original project objectives. During this time, with the unexpected steady increase of oil
prices, Algeria began to benefit from substantially higher fiscal revenues. A first attempt to
identify a partner for the concession of Algiers airport failed. After this setback and the scandal
surrounding the bankruptcy of the large local private bank Kalifa5, the failure of the associated
Kalifa Airways (the first private Algerian airline), and the disappointing progress of the
Government's overall privatization program, doubts rose concerning the popular and political
support for reforms implying a substantially greater role for the private sector, national as well as
a foreign. The option to cancel the TTA project all together was not excluded by the Bank team,
until the new Minister of Transport reconfirmed at the end of 2004 his intent to pursue the
project with basically the same objectives. The Minister requested Bank support in drafting a
detailed Roadmap for the reforms planned for the transport sector that would be submitted to the
new Government to get its full support. The Bank team prepared with consultant support the
draft Roadmap as agreed with the Minister, on the basis of which it was decided to revisit the
project implementation program, still with the original objectives. At the January 2005 mid-term
review, it was agreed to extend the closing date by two years with the aim to start and hopefully
complete most of the remaining originally planned actions. The project components were



5The failure of Bank Kalifa, compounded with costs to the Algerian economy exceeding US$1 billion, exposed
weaknesses in the regulatory system and seriously affected public confidence in private investors and private sector
development efforts. Similarly, the failure of Kalifa Airlines was a major setback for liberalization of air transport,
particularly for the domestic networks.

basically not changed although some studies and other activities were cancelled or partly
modified.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project design was based on a sound dialogue supported by the 1999 Transport Sector
Strategy Note and drew on lessons learned from the Sixth Highway project, the previous port
project and an earlier railways project (particularly in terms of the complex railways
restructuring challenge). Regarding liberalization and participation of the private sector, the
project design benefited from lessons learned through the preparation and implementation of the
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) of 1998 and the other technical assistance projects, such as
the Privatization LIL, the Energy and Mining Technical Assistance Loan (EMTAL) and the
Telecom & Postal Technical Assistance Project, which were launched prior to or in conjunction
with the TTA project. The Bank was also engaging at that time in a broad dialogue with GoA on
PPPs and partial guarantee schemes for infrastructure and public services at large.

With extensive prior Bank experience in the transport sector in Algeria and GoA's clear intention
to obtain Bank support to initiate the needed reforms in a number of sectors including transport,
the rationale for Bank intervention was strong. The GoA did not favor a sectoral adjustment
loan. The need for a dedicated TA project for the transport sector was clear.

Overall, risks were generally well identified. While resistance to change was assessed as
substantial, the risk of a reduced Government commitment to sustained and rapid reforms was
underestimated, given the assumption that budgetary constraints with limited oil revenues would
steadily encourage Algeria to increase efficiency and competitiveness of the transport system
through important reforms, instead of major public investment programs. The lack of capacity on
the part of the administration to implement complex reforms had been correctly identified, with
the assumption that substantial input from consultants closely monitored by Bank missions
would adequately address those problems. In retrospect, the overall moderate risk rating (also
given in other Bank TA projects in Algeria) was overly optimistic, considering that Algeria was
still in a post-conflict phase and transitioning away from a centrally planned economy.
While the project design was generally sound, quality at entry is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory because of the over-optimism of the Bank team and overly ambitious project
objectives, as detailed in Section 3.1, and the weakness of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
framework as explained in Section 2.3.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation was delayed and started slowly. The Loan only became effective in August
2003 (about one year after project approval6) after the Council of Ministers' belated approval.
Steps to be taken by GoA to fulfill conditions of effectiveness were delayed since the Ministry of
Transport (MoT) was assessing whether a management contract with a foreign partner should be

disbursement for the urban transport component were also fulfilled with considerable delay since
the task force needed to create the Urban Transport Management Authority for greater Algiers
was only fully established at the end of 2004. Procurement progress for consulting contracts of
the first 11 key studies was disappointing, primarily because of the limited capacity of the
Project Management Unit (PMU) and cumbersome domestic procurement procedures, as well as
the perception of a precarious security situation8. Efforts by MoT to launch the bidding process
for a BOT concession to complete the new Algiers airport terminal works and manage it9 failed
to attract valid proposals from credible partners. MoT's limited resources were heavily engaged
in this effort. Its failure was a significant setback for Algeria's first PPP endeavors and
undermined the authorities' interest in PPPs.

Opposition, mainly from unions, to the overdue creation of the new port authorities, a key step
foreseen in the existing legislation, effectively hampered progress of port reforms. Part of the
work aimed at air transport was also delayed. While physical works on the Algiers subway
construction resumed through Government funding, the authorities were uncertain on how to set
up the concession and the corresponding studies were delayed. More broadly, after one year of
disappointing implementation progress, the limited capacity of MoT and weakness of the PMU
were clearly significant constraints and the project DO rating was barely maintained as
satisfactory10.      By mid-2003, only one-third of the first set of studies was ready for
implementation. This limited progress eventually led to downgrading both the DOs and IPs two
years after Board approval, and the option to suspend disbursements was considered. Bank
management recommended an early loan cancellation, barring tangible progress and
reconfirmation of Government commitment to the project11 by the time of the originally planned
Mid-Term Review.

By the end of 2004, the newly appointed Minister of Transport gave new impetus to the project
through the preparation of a sector Roadmap with Bank assistance, designed to outline policy
priorities, and an updated sector reform action plan for the new Government. Policy discussions
improved during the preparation of the Roadmap and the Bank helped MoT organize a seminar
on models for private sector involvement in subway operations in March 2005. The Government
decided to enter into management contracts with private operators for the Algiers subway and for
the future Algiers suburban railway and tramway systems. The strengthening of the PMU and
progress in launching the first 11 studies indicated possible project improvement, but port
reforms remained stalled and the core airport study was postponed. The Mid-Term Review in
January 2005 was to have helped reassess the authorities' commitment and either terminate or
revisit the project on the basis of the Roadmap.

An agreement was then reached to pursue the project and extend the closing date by two years to
help the project support implementation of the priority Roadmap actions. Renewed progress in

7 Subsequently, the newly appointed Minister of Transport did not adopt this proposal and maintained the railway
component in its original form.

  Algeria has continued until now to suffer from sporadic terrorist attacks, some of which targeted foreigners.
9The Bank offered to support the concession scheme with a partial risk guarantee.
10The Bank team on the fourth supervision mission considered downgrading the rating; given the uncertainty
(particularly on the general political climate) the S rating was maintained.
11Until a new government emerged after the spring 2004 presidential elections, it was difficult to gauge if Algeria
would pursue reforms in the transport sector.

urban transport, railways and port sector studies led to upgrading these three components to
satisfactory12. Based on project studies, the Minister of Transport proposed a new institutional
arrangement for the port and maritime transport sectors through the establishment of a new
central Maritime and Ports Authority and the transformation of the old public port enterprises
Entreprises Portuaires (EPs) into landlord ports, including the transfer of their commercial and
service activities to the private sector under concessions. Similarly, the Minister proposed the
establishment of a new Civil Aviation Authority. The urban transport component would maintain
its focus on the detailed studies supporting the establishment of the Greater Algiers Urban
Transport Organization Authority. In particular, the project was to support the drafting of a
number of proposed laws and regulations for the above institutional changes.

By mid-2005 and following the steep increase in oil prices, Algeria decided to use this
unexpected oil windfall to reimburse its foreign debt and to stop borrowing, and to launch a
massive public investment program in infrastructure, including railways and highways. The
preparation and rapid implementation of these huge investment programs became the top priority
of technical ministries such as MoT. The counterpart team for the project's railways component
became involved in the preparation of the US$6.6 billion SNTF investment program to be
executed in 2005-09. The Government announced it would prepay previous Bank loans and
cancelled its most recent Bank loans ­ except for a few technical assistance projects such as the
TTA ­ and would stop all borrowing from the World Bank13. The European Union (EU) also
announced that it would earmark a Euro 20 million to finance a grant supporting the transport
sector reform in Algeria and to follow up on the Bank TTA project. The startup of the huge
public investment program in addition to the preparation of the EU project drew heavily on the
limited capacity of MoT, and the PMU in particular. In order to strengthen that capacity, it was
agreed to finance individual sector experts under the project, in particular to support the PMU in
monitoring studies and legal framework drafting for each component. This was particularly
critical since limited time remained to launch the second series of studies for completion by
project closing.

An interdepartmental group which was created at the end of 2005 raised objections14 when MoT
presented its drafts laws for institutional changes to the Government council. Despite a number
of subsequent revisions, the proposed legislative changes in the port and aviation sectors
remained deadlocked. After this setback, and despite some progress in the preparation of the
second series of studies under the project15, early termination of the project was again considered
an option by the Bank team and project ratings were downgraded from Moderately Satisfactory
(MS) to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU). Delays in preparatory steps for the establishment of
the Greater Algiers Urban Transport Organization Authority were of even more concern given
the approach of completion dates and start of operations of the Algiers subway system. During




12  The ratings of air transport and airport components, for which no activities had been launched, were left as
unsatisfactory.
13The few investment projects were cancelled and several technical assistance loans were reduced. Bank activities
in Algeria would henceforth be limited to Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and fee-based services (Reimbursable
Technical Assistance) such as for the new Caisse Nationale d'Equipement pour le Développement.
14Opposition focused on the ad hoc legal status proposed by MoT for the local port and airport authorities.
15Project management improved after the 2nd replacement of the PMU head.

the same period, local port enterprises EP Algiers and Oran were already researching                       16  the
possibility of recruiting a private partner to operate their container terminals.

One year prior to project completion, the preparation of a second series of 16 studies had
progressed reasonably well, and prospects for their timely completion were good. However, a
number of other studies were not launched, particularly in the port, airport, and air transport
sectors since MoT's proposals for the key laws required for institutional reforms were not yet
accepted by other ministries17. In order to continue advancing towards reform, the Bank team
recommended the creation of dedicated port authorities18 for each port as an intermediate step
which was feasible under the current legislative framework.

Six months before project closure, 11 projects and TA activities under the second series of
studies were launched. At the time of project completion, reform progress was still limited, and
included the following developments: (i) as a result of the authorities' search to identify a private
operator for the Algiers container terminal (together with the Djendjen port as suggested by Bank
studies under the project) a proposal was received from a reputable international port operator19;
(ii) the tender for the Algiers subway operating contract20 had been completed and a subway
operator selected; (iii) limited legislative amendments to the land transport law were ready, that
would facilitate the creation of the urban transport authorities, as a first step, starting with
Greater Algiers; (iv) with the assistance of Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the
authorities were taking steps to identify a technical partner to operate the Algiers suburban
railway; (v) AFD was also supporting SNTF in the possibility of creating joint venture with
FERPHOS (SOE mining company) and MITTAL STEEL (private steelworks) to operate the
eastern Djebel-Onk to Annaba mining line; and (vi) the new agency ANESRIF had been
effectively established and was taking over the investment program of the railways network from
SNTF to allow the latter to focus on railway operations. Preparation of various operating
agreements21 for the above activities was underway based on project activities or studies already
completed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Given the specific Technical Assistance nature of the project, no specific M&E arrangements
had been foreseen at appraisal, except for the preparation of the mid-term report. At appraisal,
most attention was primarily devoted to agreeing with the GoA on the nature and scope of the
reforms to be supported by the project and on project implementation. However, little time was



16 Stemming from the confusing Algerian legislation on privatization that gives all SOEs, such as the port
enterprises, much leeway in preparing their own privatization plans with the assistance of the Ministry of (State)
Participations. Under the Privatization TA LIL, the Bank had recommended clarifying and correcting this matter.
17Ministry of Public Works (regarding construction of marine works), Ministry of Defense (regarding the role of the
Coast Guard) and Ministry of Information Technology (regarding radio signaling) ­ but the main opposition
remained with the unions.
18Which would not be in charge of commercial activities as the existing EPs still are.
19At the beginning of 2008, negotiations were underway with Dubai ports. It is hard to predict whether this will
come to closure soon, considering the demands of Algiers EP and the unions, and the complex decision and
approval arrangements currently applied under the present Algeria privatization legislation.

ready to carry the financial/construction nor the commercial risks of public service operations.

available to build consensus among numerous stakeholders on Key Performance Indicators22
(KPI).      Eventually, many KPIs were difficult to measure and the Bank team relied on
information provided by the Borrower. No new M&E arrangements were introduced, either
during project implementation or when the loan extension was agreed upon after the Mid- Term
Review.

The mid-term report was submitted by the borrower in February 2005, in accordance with the
revised timing for the Mid-Term Review.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

None of the safeguard policies were applicable in this technical assistance project. A simple
environmental management plan was prepared at appraisal.

Whereas the PMU23 was established after Board approval in August 2001, the Financial
Management System only became effective in mid-2003 and the first Project Monitoring Report
(PMR) was received in August 2003. The Financial Management (FM) rating was temporarily
downgraded to U because of delays in submission of the 2004 audit report24. PMRs were
submitted regularly, often with delays and inconsistencies. The initial PMR software was later
replaced by a more efficient, user-friendly application.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

A number of studies launched during the second series were not completed prior to project
closure. Other studies originally planned under the second series were not launched because of
the limited project implementation time remaining. MoT planned to carry out most of these
studies, mainly based on Terms of Reference (TOR) prepared with the Bank, during 2008-2009,
either through its own financing or under the follow-up EU project. This project financed by a
Euro 20 million grant and covering basically all transport modes, was essentially designed to
provide technical assistance for implementation of the reforms launched under the Bank TTA
project. Its implementation25 is expected to start during 2008.

In light of the considerable new EU assistance to the transport sector, it is unlikely that the
Algerian authorities would be interested in significant World Bank technical support in the near
future, if the Government pursues its policy of not borrowing abroad. MoT has indicated,
however, that it would not exclude a fee-based services approach with the Bank for technical
assistance on specific topics not adequately covered under the EU project.

It is still not clear to what extent private sector participation in the transport sector will increase
in the near future, given the uncertain stance on the part of the Algerian political system vis-à-vis
the private sector and the huge oil windfall accruing now to the State. On the positive side,


22
   At that time the M&E topic was new to the borrower and elicited limited interest from his part.
23
   The PMU was established as a small ad hoc new entity within the MoT, headed by an advisor to the Minister.
Project implementation was to rely extensively on the staff of MoT's existing directorates in charge of the different
transport modes, as well as on SNTF.
24Audit reports were thereafter submitted regularly.
25Its start was delayed for reasons similar to those of the slow start of the Bank project 6 years before.

however, the project helped in providing a better assessment of the type and scope of activities
and risks which international operators would accept and which are essentially commercial, such
as container terminal operations. Ultimately, the final scheme adopted for the Algiers subway
presented the optimum risk splitting scenario between the State and private operators.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

As indicated in Sections 1.1 and 1.2, the project was in line with the following Government
objectives: (i) to modernize the economy through liberalization; (ii) to provide access to the
private sector and private sector development; and (iii) to meet the population's expectations for
improved public services, in particular through more efficient transport services based on a
modern and expanded infrastructure. These objectives were also in line with the goals of the
Bank's 2003-2006 Country Assistance Strategy for Algeria. The project design was based on the
Transport Sector Strategy Note of 1999 and Government's request at that time to provide
technical assistance to various sectors, including transport, aimed at liberalization and private
sector participation. In spite of its complexity, this design is considered to be sound overall. The
depth and pace of reforms planned during the project implementation period were essentially in
line with the Government's commitment at the time of appraisal.

Since Algeria was still facing severe budget constraints at appraisal, it was reasonable to
emphasize the following: (i) establishment of PPPs through concessions to ensure that part of the
financing burden be borne by the private sector; and (ii) the restructuring of the national railway
company SNTF for improved competitiveness and financial sustainability, thereby decreasing its
burden on the State budget. When Algeria started to benefit unexpectedly from a huge oil
windfall, these two considerations became less pressing for the authorities and part of the
population. Moreover, the potential financial contribution of the private sector became much
less attractive to Algerian entities who do not traditionally support the private sector.                   In
retrospect, the original objective of setting up a concession for the Algiers subway rather than a
PPP scheme involving less risk for the private partner was not realistic.
Overall, the depth and pace of planned reforms to be carried out during project implementation
were too ambitious. This reflected the prevailing over-optimism at appraisal when Algeria was
successfully emerging from the first phase of structural adjustment and most GoA members were
strongly committed to ambitious reform goals26. However, since no dedicated sectoral
adjustment programs were envisaged at that time by GoA, the tendency was to incorporate into
TA projects development objectives and expected results that were clearly beyond the scope of
these TA projects. In fact, prospects for achieving those ambitious objectives depended on
important external factors beyond the scope of specific TTAs.

A detailed program of studies and agreed technical assistance measures were incorporated into
the original project design. This advanced stage of project preparation and the use of qualified
consultants and consulting firms closely supervised by Bank missions were expected to address
the capacity issues in MoT and SNTF to prepare and carry out the required reforms.


26There was a disconnect between the Bank team and the Borrower on specific objectives. While setting ambitious
goals to create a momentum for reforms, the Borrower would eventually accept the achievement of only partial
results over the originally agreed timeline.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The ambitious and complex PDOs were as follows: (i) to set up a policy and institutional
framework to stimulate competition and private sector participation in infrastructure; (ii) to
demonstrate the viability of mainstreaming transport concessions through the successful
launching of two schemes, i.e., a BOT for the Algiers subway and a concession to operate part of
the port of Djendjen; (iii) to strengthen GoA's capacity to manage and regulate the transport
sector; and (iv) to rehabilitate the railways for improved efficiency in the transport of people and
freight nationwide.

At project completion, few objectives had effectively been achieved in terms of implementing
the planned reforms. Through a number of studies, the project had prepared the liberalization
and participation of the private sector in the transport sector and had contributed to a certain
momentum for partial reform. Still, apart from ANESRIF, none of the new agencies/authorities
had been effectively established for any of the transport modes, as the adoption of the necessary
legislation did not occur despite significant studies and other preparatory work undertaken under
the project and the advice from the Bank team. MoT eventually launched a step-by-step
approach requiring limited legislative changes. However, no major sub-sector strategy was ever
developed and officially adopted by the Government before the closing date, although a PPP was
effectively under implementation for the Algeria subway system with solid prospects for PPPs
under the Algiers suburban railroad and tramway systems.

Overall, 11 studies were carried out under the first series and 10 others were later completed
under the second series of studies (detailed in Annex 2: Outputs by Component). The best
results were observed in urban transport and railways, while only average in the ports sector and
quite limited in airport and aviation.       Based on detailed studies and analyses, the project
contributed significantly to paving the way for reforms in all transport modes to be implemented
under the EU project, but it is difficult to predict how far and how fast reforms will effectively be
carried out in the near future.

As regards the port sector, MoT's proposed legislative changes were not accepted and reforms
could not proceed under a new institutional set-up. Only limited steps could be taken for PPPs in
compliance with the existing legislation. Thus, private partners launched a joint venture with the
port enterprise of Bejaia, while a similar joint venture was expected to be finalized in 2008 for
the Algiers container terminal and Djendjen port. MoT used the national port strategy prepared
under the project to prepare its sectoral development plan, which is part of the Schéma National
d'Aménagement du Territoire, the multi-sectoral master plan underpinning Algeria's space
planning by 2025.

Concerning the airport sector, the only tangible change was the short-term management contract
signed with the Paris Airport for operation of the new Algiers terminal. In civil aviation, the
number of foreign carriers operating international routes has however significantly increased.
While legal restrictions to liberalization have been lifted, there are no new private carriers
operating regular services on domestic routes since the demise of the local Kalifa Airways.

The restructuring of the railways has shown little progress, with only limited institutional
changes effectively underway at project completion. ANESRIF was established to take over
construction of railway infrastructure from SNTF which is now mandated to handle railway

operations under the umbrella of concession and public service agreements. SNTF had launched
actions recommended by the various studies carried out to improve its efficiency. Still, the
objective to drastically restructure the railways and ensure SNTF's financial sustainability was
far from completion. The outdated and ineffective financial relations between the State and
SNTF were neither revisited nor clarified27. Since 2005, the capacity of MoT and SNTF has
been heavily burdened by the preparation and implementation of the ambitious new railway
infrastructure construction program and rolling stock purchase to be executed under the massive
2005-2009 Plan Complémentaire de Soutien à la Croissance Economique (PCSCE) public
investment program.

Regarding the new institutional set-up in urban transport, at project completion the law
establishing the urban transport organization authority for the Greater Algiers was being drafted
in conjunction with other initial preparatory steps for the establishment of the authority. Finally,
the contract for a subway operator was finalized, the bidding process for a suburban railroad
operator was well underway, and contracting out the Algiers tramway operations was under
consideration.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

After the Mid-Term Review and given the support of the newly appointed Minister of Transport,
the PDO rating was revised to satisfactory, while implementation ratings for the various
components were either unsatisfactory (airport, aviation) or moderately satisfactory in relation
with the state of studies. The IP rating for all components and PDO ratings were changed to
moderately unsatisfactory one year before project completion due to the little progress of second
wave studies. At closure, the IP ratings for the urban transport and railways component were
maintained as MU, but the port, airport and aviation components were unsatisfactory. As
explained in the sections above, there was some ­ albeit still disappointing - progress under the
first two components, but little was effectively achieved under the port, airport and aviation
components.

The PDO rating at project closure is unsatisfactory28. Key reforms showed little progress and
important legal measures were not enacted prior to project completion.                            The new legal
framework for the various sub-sectors was yet to be approved and the railways' difficult
financial situation could not be addressed without fundamental restructuring.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Project contributions are as follows: (i) familiarizing MoT and SNTF with liberalization and
PPPs, innovations in the Algerian context; (ii) strengthening MoT and SNTF in the areas of
policy and strategy formulation, and the use of consultants, although not to the extent planned at
appraisal; and (iii) strengthening SNTF in track maintenance and rolling stock management.

27
   This needed a detailed concession agreement. Such agreement was drafted under the project, but it has not yet
been reviewed nor discussed with all parties involved (particularly the Ministry of Finance).
28
   It can be argued that if the PDO had been set more realistically at appraisal ­ particularly better taking into
account the Algerian context - the rating at closure would be higher and at least moderately unsatisfactory. The same
can said about two of the three other TA projects implemented in Algeria during the same period.

Considering Algeria's isolation during the tragic decade, cross-fertilization of their management
and staff with best practices and experiences from other countries was a significant project
achievement.      ANESRIF was effectively established, and, as indicated above, the new
concession agreement for SNTF, which was to have established new relations between the State
and SNTF, was drafted but never finalized.

The new operational partnership structure adopted for the Algiers subway with Bank assistance
is an important institutional innovation which may pave the way for future operations in Algeria.

Since new authorities initially planned for implementation were not yet established by the end of
the project, MoT did not have the opportunity to transfer part of its traditional mandate to new
agencies, as was the case for telecommunications and energy29. However, no significant training
activities were eventually undertaken since certain actions planned under the second series of
studies could not be launched prior to project completion.

The initial ratings for seven of the nine criteria have not changed, and two have been
downgraded. The fourth criterion relates to the most critical assumption and should have been
more broadly worded as commitment of Government to rapidly carry out substantial reforms.
The risk is now assessed as high: commitment has decreased significantly as the Government has
faced a strong resistance to change ­ rightly assessed as a substantial risk at appraisal ­ plus a
change in Government priorities to rapidly implement massive public investment programs due
to the unexpected oil bonanza. The seventh criteria relating to consulting services has also
received a higher rating. The perception among foreign consulting firms that security conditions
have not drastically improved and that working in the Algerian context may be more difficult
than in other countries still negatively affects the consultant recruitment process and could result
in lower quality services than anticipated in 2000-2001.

Based on the above, the overall risk rating has been changed from Moderate to Substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Project preparation was carried out on the basis of the 1999 Transport Sector Strategy Note. This
note identified key issues in the transport sector and generated a positive response from the
Government, i.e., a request for a Bank TA project to address issues raised in the Note. In parallel
and since the 1996 SAL, the Bank had engaged in a dialogue with Government on privatization
and private sector development, underpinned by the Privatization Technical Assistance LIL and
a note on private sector development.                The PPP concept was widely discussed with the
Government, focusing on a possible application strategy for a number of sectors, i.e., telecoms,
energy, and water resources). This dialogue on PPP's took place in the context of preparation of
parallel technical assistance projects in several sectors and accompanied by presentations and
proposals by the Bank to support PPPs through partial guarantees (mainly for the Algiers airport
and proposed subway concession). During that critical starting phase of transition to a market
economy, the Government appeared strongly committed to liberalization and other institutional
reforms, including PPPs and private sector development at large30. This essentially explains how
unrealistic development objectives were determined at appraisal.

The Bank team was aware of MoT's and SNTF's limited available capacities, including staffing
constraints.    It was anticipated that with the assistance of qualified consultants and close
supervision by the Bank, this capacity issue would be properly addressed. The railways expert in

  This was also driven by a desire to attract Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) to further break free from the isolation
facing Algeria during the decade of terrorism.

the Bank team had been associated with SNTF during a significant part of his career. Based on
his knowledge of the railway enterprise, its strengths, weaknesses, and staff, the proposed
railway restructuring program was prepared in great detail and carefully developed through a
participatory approach with railway counterparts.

A project launch workshop was organized with representatives from all involved entities in
November 2001 to present the project's organization and objectives, to familiarize borrower staff
with Bank procurement procedures, to fine-tune terms of reference for upcoming studies and to
update the relevant timetables. The far-reaching option of a management contract for the
railways was not planned at appraisal. In fact, it was proposed by MoT shortly after Board
approval. However, this option was subsequently discarded by the new Minister of Transport in
2004, just as the Bank was preparing a positive response to the previous Minister's request.

Overall and due to the unrealistic Development Objectives, the weak M&E arrangements and
underestimation of risks, the Bank's performance at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


During six and a half years of project implementation, the Bank conducted 15 regular
supervision missions. These included specific technical missions for railways, urban transport
systems, subways and ports, during which Bank experts went to great lengths to provide detailed
technical advice to their counterparts, often beyond the scope of basic project supervision31.

While effectiveness was delayed at the request of the Ministry of Transport to include a TA
management contract for railways, the Bank team endeavored to accommodate this new request.
Early missions already highlighted the PMU's capacity constraints and those of the counterpart
team responsible for the urban transport component, and underscored the delay in setting up the
key working group responsible for the greater Algiers Transport Organization Authority. The
missions noted32 the potential risk to project implementation if MoT staff assigned to the project
were given other additional responsibilities. Moreover, after the PPP setback of the Algiers
airport, Government's decision to complete and fund both the airport terminal and subway
construction, compounded by the unsuccessful discussions with unions on port reform, the Bank
alerted the Government to the high risk of incurring project delays and not achieving the reform
objectives. In an effort to restore Government's interest in PPPs, the Bank organized in 2004 a
high level seminar on organizational and contractual models involving the private sector in
operations.     This seminar and the missions' persistent advocacy work, coupled with
recommendations from other donors such as AFD, eventually led to Government's selection of a
private operator for the Algiers subway, the suburban railways and tramway, and a management
contract for the Algiers airport terminal.

In 2004, the newly appointed Minister of Transport requested Bank assistance to prepare the new
sector Roadmap. The Bank team was very responsive and produced a comprehensive piece of


31Due to the isolation Algeria faced during the decade of terrorism, demands for assistance from the Bank's
counterparts were considerable.

Advisory and Analytical Activity (AAA). In 2006, the QAG review of overall Bank AAA work
in Algeria during 2000-2005 gave it a satisfactory rating33. On the basis of this work, it was
agreed to extend the project by two years to achieve the objectives as expressed by the Minister.
When MoT and, subsequently, the proposed reforms experienced another setback (since
Government rejected MoT's draft port and airport authority laws, hindering progress of the
creation of the Algiers urban transport authority) the Bank team responded by preparing a phased
approach proposal which would still allow reforms to proceed within the existing set of
legislative constraints. The Bank team was also instrumental in the selecting and developing
operation arrangements for the Algiers subway.

The Bank team repeatedly warned the authorities of possible implementation capacity problems
and the risk of delayed reforms. The option to prematurely phase out the project was considered
several times, but the Bank team eventually recommended going forward on the assumption that
Bank support was essential for preserving the reform movement, albeit at a slow pace. During
the entire project implementation, the team demonstrated a strong responsiveness to the client's
needs.

The question concerning the candidness of supervision ratings, particularly since the Mid-Term
Review, is justified.         In retrospect, the revision of PDO rating to satisfactory (and of the
implementation ratings for the port, urban transport and railways components to moderately
satisfactory) after extension of the closing date, based on the informal approval of the Roadmap
by the Prime Minister, is questionable. The supervision team was overly optimistic about the
Minister of Transport's ability to overcome political and administrative hurdles to PPIs and
continued to overestimate the PMU's ability to efficiently manage studies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: The overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on Government's commitment during project preparation and MoT's strong support for
reforms, Government's performance at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.

During project implementation, three successive ministers headed MoT who all supported the
project objectives and promoted reforms in the transport sector. The process came to a standstill,
however, mainly due to a lack of consensus inside Government, and thus no agreement was
reached prior to project completion. Starting in 2005 Government was heavily invested in the
preparation and implementation of the substantial PCSCE public investment program. Given
MoT's limited, investment was the Ministry's primary priority and emphasis on construction was



33Geared to the specific needs of the Minister, the AAA omitted certain key aspects of the transport sector which
were not under of his mandate, such as the highway sector. The QAG assessed this AAA as moderately satisfactory
overall, and satisfactory also for strategic relevance and internal quality.

made at the expense, in terms of staff time allocation, of implementation of "soft" reforms.
Overall, the borrower did not allocate sufficient resources to the PMU.

The limited degree of commitment expressed, outside MoT and certain other ministries, in favor
of a strong private sector participation, and union hostility demonstrated the following: (i) the
lack of broad-based popular and political support for privatization as a key pillar of Algeria's
transition to a market economy; and (ii) the incomplete Governmental process to achieve full
consensus on the pace and scope of reforms.

On this basis, the Borrower's performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory during
implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The PMU was headed by an advisor to the Minister of Transport. Three such successive
advisors headed the PMU during project implementation. Throughout the life of the project, the
PMU experienced difficulties in maintaining the planned procurement schedule, which in several
instances was affected by cumbersome domestic procedures. The PMU performance suffered
from staffing constraints34 and from parallel responsibilities external to the project. Several
sector departments of MoT have also been affected by capacity constraints. Out of the four sector
experts requested by MoT to strengthen the PMU and sector departments during the last phase of
the project, only one was recruited in time to provide significant support.

On the urban transport front, the working group for Greater Algiers comprising staff from MoT,
the Algiers Wilaya and the Ministry of Finance, was created with some delay but functioned
efficiently. In the railway sector, allocation of responsibilities between SNTF and the PMU
caused delays in procurement of studies, in addition to the limited capacity of these entities.
SNTF demonstrated better ability, which led the Bank team to recommend that all procurement
activities for railway- related studies be delegated entirely to SNTF.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Based on the above, the Borrower's overall rating is assessed as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

It is important to note that while the overall project outcome is unsatisfactory, the project was
implemented under difficult conditions when Algeria was undergoing significant and complex
transformation. After three decades of centralized administration and ten years of conflict,
Algeria had just entered a complex transition phase to a market economy. The modernization of
the Algerian administration has barely been launched and many stakeholders were, and still are,
not fully convinced of the benefits of liberalization and private sector-driven growth:
entrenched parties who benefited greatly from the previous system are indeed still powerful.

Given the strong resistance to change, it was difficult to implement reforms at a sustained pace.
However, the project, and more broadly the efforts on the part of the borrower and the Bank
team, paved the way for reforms that can be expected to continue, albeit a slower pace than
anticipated35.



6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned under this project are similar to those drawn from other Bank projects and
reform programs in Algeria during the same period. The post conflict situation of Algeria36 and
the complex and difficult transition from a centrally planned system to market economy created
an environment in which reforms are difficult to implement unless there is wide consensus and
strong popular backing, an unwavering political commitment and a modern, highly efficient
administration capable of executing the complex reforms at a sustained pace. The resistance to
change can be particularly strong in former centrally planned economies where the traditional
role of the state is about to substantially change and the private sector becomes an important
player (especially with foreign operators playing an increasingly important role even though they
were absent from the Algerian context for more than two decades, except in the oil and gas
sector). The slow pace of Algeria's overall privatization program and the limited progress of
banking sector reforms (more than 90% of total assets are still controlled by traditional state-
owned banks) reflect the obstacles facing reforms in such a challenging environment. Under
such circumstances, reforms can only be implemented if significant assistance is forthcoming
and fully utilized by a national system with sufficient absorptive capacity, including modern
executing agencies as positive agents of change. As shown by the unsatisfactory Privatization
Technical Assistance LIL which closed prematurely in 2003, these conditions for success were
far from being achieved in Algeria.

Given the difficulties to rapidly implement substantial reforms, the first and most important
lesson learned is the need for a realistic and less ambitious approach in circumstances
encountered in Algeria. Less optimistic development objectives should have been targeted and
focusing directly on project activity outcomes.

The second lesson is the requirement to invest more in consensus-building among stakeholders
during such ambitious reform processes. The borrower underscores this point in his contribution
to the ICR summarized below.

A third lesson relates to changing priorities, such as a sudden oil-generated financial bonanza,
and the ensuing massive level of investments. This heavily taxes the country's absorptive
capacity, particularly at the administrative level. Unless this overall capacity is drastically
expanded, and commensurate means and explicit instructions handed down to steadily develop
"soft" reforms, investments will take priority and reforms ultimately become secondary.


35 If the Bank were not actively promoting and supporting reforms under such circumstances, it is unlikely that
reforms would have actually progressed at the same pace. The pioneering work done by the Bank in the field of
transport sector reform (similar to privatization, banking sector reforms, and environmental protection in Algeria)
has paved the way for follow-up programs financed by the Government or EU grants, with similar objectives but a
longer implementation period.
36The challenge of attracting qualified consultants willing to operate under difficult circumstances, particularly in a
post-conflict environment, is often underestimated.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower (MoT) acknowledged the slow overall pace of project execution and agrees that
project implementation should continue although it was not completed with the Bank. The
Borrower noted that stakeholder consensus should have been achieved beforehand given the
complexity of the reform program.              The Borrower particularly highlights the lower than
anticipated completion rate for studies, primarily due to complex procurement procedures, both
at the Bank and Algerian levels37. Still, the Borrower believes that the transport sector has
definitely benefited from the studies, particularly in urban transport (institutions and tariffs),
railway infrastructure, locomotive maintenance, railway organization, and air transport strategy.
Regarding supervision, the Borrower rates both his and the Bank's performance as adequate and
stressed the high quality and value of the Bank team's recommendations and overall advice.




37
  Like in other Bank projects in Algeria, the PMU and MoT staff at large tended to be confused by the difference
between Bank procurement rules and those of the Algerian Administration they are familiar with.

Annex 2. Output by Component

In terms of studies and technical assistance delivered and training activities undertaken and
completed, actual achievements at project closure were to a certain extent lower (and for some
components significantly lower) than planned at appraisal. The breakdown below by component
lists only those activities actually launched and completed at the time the project was closed.
The scope of some studies was changed and a number of activities were dropped in the course of
project implementation. The quality of a number of studies was disappointing and may be an
illustration of the difficulty of attracting high quality international consultants in the context
prevailing in Algeria during most of the project implementation period. A number of key studies
were not carried out, partly because of significant delays in the procurement process38 that would
have prevented their completion before project closure and partly because of hesitations by MoT
whether these activities were still needed or not.39 In other cases, the authorities decided to
finance the studies or similar studies with Government funds or grants from other donors became
available for those purposes. When it became clear that a number of activities could reasonably
not be implemented in time - actually less than a year before closing date - the GoA requested
the cancellation of US$1.8 million of the loan. In addition to the work done by consultants
financed by the loan, there were significant contributions by Bank staff who provided advice
much beyond the normal supervision work carried out by Bank team. The extent of their work
was particularly important in railways and urban transport (for example commenting many
documents and providing detailed guidance for legal drafting) and is highlighted in the
Borrower's comments.

Component 1: Ports

This component was to: (i) fine tune the port institutional framework; (ii) formulate a strategy for
private participation in commercial activities with competition in or for the market;
(iii) formulate a national port development strategy; (iv) promote a concession for the Djendjen
port; and (v) implement trade facilitation procedures. The originally planned activities to be
financed by the loan consisted of six studies and specialized consulting services packages: (i) a
study on the legal and regulatory framework; (ii) a study on private sector participation; (iii) a
study on the Port Development Strategic Plan; (iv) consulting services to MoT and regional
authorities and training; (v) consulting services for the concessioning of Djendjen; and
(vi) consulting services in trade facilitation. After partial changes to the work program, only four
activities were actually implemented: (i) the study on the legal and regulatory framework; (ii) a
study on private sector participation and opening of competition in the commercial operations in
ports; (iii) preparation of a strategy of port development; and (iv) the study on the value of and
advice on the concessioning of part of the port of Djendjen. Trade facilitation work was dropped
(following the GoA opinion that this was mainly related to the customs that are under the
purview of the Ministry of Finance40). No training took place. No activities41 finally took place


38 11 studies were completed under the 1st wave; out of the 21 planned under the 2nd wave, eventually only 13 were
carried out.
39
   In some cases (such as the air transport and airports strategies) MoT decide first to drop the study but
subsequently reversed its decision, which resulted in unnecessary delays.
40A grant was also made available by the European Union for similar purposes.
41The planned recruitment of an individual advisor could not be done in time.

under the second series of studies, contrary to the other components and despite the fact that the
program prepared to support the implementation of the transport Roadmap included initiatives to
assist the institutional reforms that were then planned.

Component 2: Airports

This component was to help the GoA formulate a new airport strategy by: (i) evaluating the
existing airport system and its development prospects; (ii) developing and evaluating options for
private participation; (iii) finalizing a PPI strategy for airports; and (iv) building associated
regulatory capacities. The corresponding activities to be financed by the loan consisted of
studies and a specialized consulting services package, as follows: (i) study for defining the
national airport strategy and identification of concessions; and (ii) advisory services and training.
The following was actually achieved under the second series of activities: (i) technical assistance
by one individual expert to help define a new institutional set-up for airports and air transport;
and (ii) a study on a national airport strategy and evaluation of the potential private sector
participation in it. As for the port component, the list of additional activities selected based on
the Roadmap included assistance to the implementation of then considered institutional reforms.

Component 3: Air Transport

This component was to help the GoA in formulating a new air transport strategy and developing
its regulatory capacity by: (i) assisting in developing an air transport strategy and in its
implementation mainly in the renegotiations of bilateral and multilateral treaties; and (ii)
developing and developing a regulatory framework and training staff to implement it. The
corresponding activities to be financed by the loan consisted of: (i) a sector strategy study; (ii)
advisory services; and (iii) training. Air transport was the component for which the least work
was undertaken under the project. Only two activities were carried out: (i) technical assistance to
help define a new institutional set-up of air transport by the same individual expert who assisted
in defining the new institutional set-up for airports; and (ii) study on a strategy for air transport
and on specific measures to promote it.

Component 4: Railways Rehabilitation

This component was to: (i) refocus the economic role of the railways in a market economy;
(ii) transform the railways institutional framework; (iii) restructure SNTF to make it more
competitive and make it operate in a more commercially-oriented manner; and (iv) prepare a
medium term investment plan. The planned corresponding activities to be financed by the loan
consisted of a number of studies and specialized consulting services packages, as follows:
(i) studies to deepen and complement the general blueprint of the railways strategy and on how
to adjust the institutional framework; (ii) procurement of railways costing software; (iii) a study
on intercity passenger and freight traffic competitiveness; (iv) a feasibility study of containerized
traffic development and of the supporting commercial policy; (v) assistance for setting up
marketing structures and related training; (vi) transport technical organization scheme; (vii) a
track maintenance strategy; (viii) a rolling stock maintenance strategy; (ix) a telecommunications
and radio-block development master plan; (x) modernization of financial management and
accounting systems; (xi) a human resources management strategy; (xii) training in economic and
financial evaluation; (xiii) assistance to concessioning of electrification of Algiers suburban

railway; (xiv) support in the Algiers Agha station and business center project under a BOT;
(xv) assistance to the privatization of SNTF's contracting and service subsidiaries; and
(xvi) identification and selection of priority investments.

Four of the above were carried out under the 1st series of studies: (i) the blueprint of the
telecommunications and radio-block development master plan; (ii) the track maintenance
strategy; (iii) the rolling stock maintenance strategy; (iv) procurement and installation of a
railways costing software. A fifth study, on intercity passenger traffic competitiveness, was
carried out but its quality was inadequate42. Under the 2nd wave of studies and other activities,
the following was carried out: (i) a blueprint for the technical organization of railway transport;
(ii) a study on the centralized management of the locomotive fleet; (iii) preparation of a
preliminary proposal for a training program of junior high level staff; and (iv) a study on the
medium term prospects of the internal organization of the various enterprises/entities of the
railway group. The critical studies on the general blueprint for the railways strategy and the
changing of the institutional framework were unfortunately not executed.

Component 5: Urban Transport

This component was to: (i) reform the institutional and financial framework of urban transport in
Algiers and establish an urban transport authority for greater Algiers; (ii) prepare the
concessioning of the subway (line 1); (iii) plan the reorganization of existing transport modes
within the greater Algiers area and integrate transport better in urban planning; and (iv) insert
private supply of public transportation in a competitive framework ensuring better coverage of
urban mobility needs. The originally planned activities to be financed by the loan consisted of a
number of studies and specialized consulting services packages, as follows: (i) completion of
Greater Algiers Institutional Reorganization study; (ii) a tariff and funding study; (iii) assistance
to institutional reorganization; (iv) a household survey; (v) a transport, traffic and parking plan
study for the Algiers Wilaya (province); (vi) a study of transport impact on air quality; (vi) a
study on bus service consolidation and service concessioning; (vii) an environmental study of the
subway; (viii) a geotechnical survey for the subway construction; (ix) an evaluation of already
completed civil works of the subway; and (x) assistance to the selection of a concessionaire for
the subway.

Under the first series of activities, two studies were completed; (i) the transport, traffic and
parking plan study of the Algiers Wilaya; and (ii) the tariff and funding study. The household
survey was also carried out, but not financed by the Bank loan. Under the 2nd series, six
activities were carried out: (i) the Greater Algiers Institutional Reorganization study, defining
mainly the mandate of the new regulatory authority Autorité organisatrice des transports urbains
AOTU; (ii) consulting services from one expert for assistance to the institutional reorganization;
(iii) a ticketing study for the Algiers public transport; (iv) a business plan of the public bus
company ETUSA and drafting of public services operating agreement with the future AOTU;
and (v) preparation of the business plan, public services operating contract and program
agreement with the State, of the Algiers subway and tramway enterprises. The complementary
studies for the subway - (vii), (viii), and (ix) above -were not carried out when it was decided

42
   It was agreed to cancel that the contract with the original consultant but the work could not be restarted in time
with a newly selected consultant ahead of project closure.

that the completion of subway would be financed directly by the State Budget. The study related
to air quality was dropped as the Ministry of Environment was already deploying an air quality
measuring system.

III/ BILAN D'EXECUTION DU PROGRAMME.

La mise en oeuvre de ce programme s'est déroulée en deux étapes :
-la première étape avait concerné le lancement et la réalisation de onze (11) études, couvrant les
sous-secteurs, portuaire, ferroviaire et le sous urbain,
- ainsi que la négociation de quatre projets de contrats pour le recrutement d'experts chargés
d'assister l'Administration des transports dans la mise en oeuvre des réformes engagées.

La deuxième étape avait concerné un programme d'études complémentaires pour les sous-
secteurs déjà cités ainsi que le secteur aéroportuaire, lancées durant l'exercice 2007.

Au 31 décembre 2007, le bilan de la mise en oeuvre de ce programme se présente comme suit
pour la première phase:

    ·    Sous-secteur ferroviaire

Il a été réalisé dans ce sous-secteur quatre études dans une première phase :

- Voyage d'étude en Amérique du nord pour les hauts responsables de SNTF. Les aspects à
examiner concernent essentiellement les méthodes de gestion et les méthodes d'action
commerciale en matière de trafic marchandises, les systèmes de cantonnement et de
télécommunication utilisée sur les lignes à faible trafic, les systèmes de gestion informatisés du
matériel moteur et remorqué, l'organisation technique et commerciale des trafics intermodaux.
Ce projet n'a pas été réalisé et ce compte tenu des délais limités pour la clôture du prêt alors
que la préparation de ce voyage d'étude nécessite un peu plus de temps

- Etudes d'approfondissement et de complément à la définition de la stratégie du secteur
ferroviaire et la refonte du cadre institutionnel :
Cette étude, destinée à prendre en charge des interventions ponctuelles d'expert dans les
domaines, technique, juridique et comptable, dans les domaines liés à l'appui à la préparation
d'un protocole d'accord ANESRIF/SNTF, avis juridique sur le projet de convention de
concession de l'exploitation ferroviaire ETAT/SNTF, n'a pas été réalisée.

Remarque : le projet d'assistance à la Direction de la stratégie de la SNTF n'a pu être défini.
Son contenu devait dépendre pour partie du partage des taches entre ANESRIF et SNTF.

    ·   Etudes pour le sous-secteur urbain

Les activités maintenues pour le transport urbain se présentent comme suit :

- Assistance technique à la mise en place de l'organisation institutionnelle Ce projet concerne le
recrutement d'un expert en transport urbain. L'opération est achevée.

- Etude billettique de transport en commun d'Alger : Cette étude a débouché sur la définition
des étapes de mise en place d'une billettique adaptée aux objectifs d'inter modalité du réseau
d'Alger pour les dix années à venir.

- Etude de l'organisation institutionnelle des transports de voyageur à Alger dont l'objectif était
de définir les missions de l'autorité organisatrice des transports urbains d'Alger a été achevée.

- Etude de regroupement des opérateurs privés de bus pour la réorganisation du réseau de
transports collectifs d'Alger, n'a pas été réalisée et ce compte tenu du délai limité pour la clôture

étrangère. La ville de BOGOTA a été retenue pour ce voyage. Cependant pour des raisons de
contraintes de temps ce voyage n'a pas eu lieu.

- Assistance à la mise en délégation des réseaux de bus d'Alger : il s'agit d'une provision pour
études ponctuelles et services et conseils en complément des études relatives à la réorganisation
des réseaux privés de bus et au plan d'entreprise de l'ETUSA (opération non réalisée.)

    ·   Etudes pour le sous-secteur aéroportuaire et aérien :

Trois études sont retenues dans ce domaine :
1/ Assistance technique à la mise en oeuvre de la nouvelle architecture institutionnelle dans les
secteurs aériens et aéroportuaires (intervention d'un expert du transport aérien).

2/ Etude de la stratégie aéroportuaire nationale et de développement du secteur privé dans le
secteur (étude achevée).

3/ Etude de la stratégie et des mesures de promotion du transport aérien (étude achevée).

    ·   Etudes pour le sous-secteur portuaire : Il est prévu le recrutement d'un consultant.
        Cette opération n'a pas été réalisée.



IV/ PRINCIPAUX FACTEURS AFFECTANT LA MISE EN OEUVRE                                             DU
PROGRAMME

La mise en oeuvre du programme d'assistance technique de la banque mondiale au secteur des
Transports a été quelque peu perturbée a la fois par des facteurs endogènes et exogènes
(problèmes liés à l'obligation du respect des procédures en vigueur à la banque mondiale et celle
du code des marchés publics algérien, qui font que le projet de marché nécessite beaucoup plus
de temps pour sa finalisation), ainsi que le retard mis au départ dans la préparation du projet dans
sa globalité.

Concernant la performance de la Banque et de l'emprunteur, nous considérons que les deux
parties avaient pleinement assurée la supervision du projet (la banque avait fait plusieurs
missions d'évaluation dont les conseils et recommandations prodigués sont de très haut niveau,
l'emprunteur de son coté a pris toutes les mesures nécessaires pour faire aboutir le projet).

Il est à noter que même si le bilan physique laisse apparaître, des insuffisances en termes de
nombre d'études réalisées par rapport au programme initial, il n'en demeure pas moins que le
secteur des transports a pu tirer profit de cette expérience.

En effet, nous pouvons considérer qu'à l'issue de l'exécution de ce programme, nous avons une
visibilité plus claire en ce qui concerne :

- La réorganisation du transport urbain en matière de tarification intermodale, de l'autorité
organisatrice.

- La gestion de l'entretient des infrastructures ferroviaires, de la gestion centralisée des
locomotives.
- La stratégie de l'organisation du groupe ferroviaire.
- La stratégie du transport aérien.

Toutefois, il faut reconnaître que ce projet, présente une certaine complexité, étant donné qu'il
induit des changements structurels pouvant avoir un impact sur les différents acteurs du secteur
dans leur globalité. Ceci aurait pu être précédé d'un consensus de l'ensemble des acteurs pour
que chacun se sente responsable et adhère pleinement au projet de réforme du secteur des
transports, car le changement ne doit pas se limiter seulement aux projets initiés par les pouvoir
publics. Aux termes de l'expérience tirée de ce projet, on pourrait certainement mieux faire dans
les futurs projets grâce l'expérience acquise durant l'exécution de ce projet.

L'apport et la disponibilité des experts de la Banque nous a rassuré pendant la durée du projet
par leurs précieux conseils et orientations.

En conclusion, on peut dire que le projet n'est pas terminé, car non seulement il faut assurer la
mise en oeuvre des résultats des études réalisées, mais également aller de l'avant car de
nombreux domaines sont à améliorer, mieux cerner.
