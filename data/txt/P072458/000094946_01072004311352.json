Assistance\n            Project aims at facilitating private participation in\n            infrastructure, at demonstrating the viability of\n            mainstreaming transport concessions, and at strengthening\n            the Government's capacity to manage, and regulate the\n            transport sector. The project components will provide: 1)\n            technical assistance (TA) for the ports reform, by\n            implementing an institutional framework for better public\n            planning, land management, and regulation, while opening the\n            delivery of services to private sector participation, under\n            competitive conditions. Support will be provided regarding\n            concession practices on international trans-shipment\n            activities within the port of Djendjen; 2) TA for the\n            airports reform, intended to adapt the national airport\n            policy framework, create conditions of financial\n            sustainability, and allow new airport concessions.\n            Regulatory capacity will be developed to ensure the\n            appropriate integration of the Algiers airport within the\n            new framework; 3) TA for air transport, to update the\n            national strategy to liberalize international air transport,\n            and assist the Direction de l'Aviation Civile (DAC) in\n            upcoming international negotiations for air transport\n            treaties. A regulatory framework consistent with the\n            strategy will be developed, and strengthened through\n            training provision; 4) TA for railways rehabilitation, to\n            restructure the National Railway Transports Society,\n            providing capacity building, particularly in the areas of\n            finance, and marketing, and, a core investment program\n            supporting the rehabilitation strategy, will be prepared; 5)\n            TA for urban transport, will establish an autonomous\n            management, and regulatory authority in the Greater Algiers,\n            to develop adequate funding for public transportation, e.g.,\n            future subway system, and potential concession practices;\n            and, 6) project financial management to ensure compliance\n            with Bank requirements for administration, reporting, and disbursements."}, "docdt": "2001-07-13T00:00:00Z"}
