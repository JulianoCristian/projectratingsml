Transport Technical\n            Assistance Project for Algeria were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the first and most important lesson learned is the need for\n            a realistic and less ambitious approach in circumstances\n            encountered in Algeria. Less optimistic development\n            objectives should have been targeted and focusing directly\n            on project activity outcomes. The second lesson is the\n            requirement to invest more in consensus-building among\n            stakeholders during such ambitious reform processes. A third\n            lesson relates to changing priorities, such as a sudden\n            oil-generated financial bonanza, and the ensuing massive\n            level of investments. This heavily taxes the country's\n            absorptive capacity, particularly at the administrative\n            level. Unless this overall capacity is drastically expanded,\n            and commensurate means and explicit instructions handed down\n            to steadily develop 'soft' reforms, investments\n            will take priority and reforms ultimately become secondary."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
