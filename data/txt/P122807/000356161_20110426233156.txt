                                                                                    61384
                         The Republic of Guinea: Interim Strategy Note
                                               and
                 The Republic of Guinea: Reengagement and Reform Support Grant

                                     Meeting of Executive Directors

                                              April 21, 2011

                                       Chairman’s Summing Up*

       The Executive Directors discussed the joint IDA/IFC/MIGA Interim Strategy Note for the
Republic of Guinea for FY11-12(IDA/R2011-0102[IFC/R2011-0060; MIGA/R2011-0023]).
        Directors commended Guinea on its recent presidential elections, and noted that it was an
important step towards an effective democracy and civilian rule. They also acknowledged the country’s
reform measures, especially in the mining sector, and the commitment to strengthen public financial
management, improve accountability, transparency and the rule of law in the public sector. In this
connection, Directors stressed the need for the prompt reestablishment of Government-wide internal
controls for public finance. With regard to external debt, Directors highlighted the need to work closely
with the Government to reach the HIPC Completion Point.
         Directors were broadly supportive of the Bank’s reengagement strategy in Guinea and noted its
alignment with the Africa Strategy and the recommendations of the World Development Report 2011.
They appreciated the flexible and realistic approach taken, especially in light of the serious capacity
constraints in Guinea. While cognizant of the risks in reengaging, Directors agreed that inaction poses a
greater risk in fragile and conflict countries. Nevertheless, some of them urged the Bank to proceed with
caution. Directors also noted that arrears clearance would permit disbursements under the Bank’s
existing portfolio and would allow attainment of visible and early wins in key service delivery sectors.
         With regard to the security sector, Directors concurred that reforms in this sector will be critical
in supporting democratic rule, and in creating the enabling environment for economic development.
Directors also noted that private sector support would unlock the country’s potential and improve
employment opportunities. They urged IFC and MIGA to assume greater roles in this area. Several
Directors also emphasized the importance of putting gender front and center in the strategy. The need to
pay appropriate attention to the regional context of the strategy was stressed, as this will have major
stabilizing effect for the region that is prone to volatility.
        Finally, Directors stressed the need to step up donor coordination and urged the Bank to take the
lead in this effort, particularly with the IMF, the African Development Bank and other development
partners. They look forward to a full-fledged CAS.


                                        Summary of Discussion*

         With respect to the Reengagement and Reform Support Grant, Executive Directors approved the
Grant in the amount of SDR 49.6 million (US$ 78 million equivalent) on the terms and conditions set out
in the President’s Memorandum (IDA/R2011-0096).
        Directors expressed support for the project’s objectives and steps taken to address the enormous
challenges faced by the country. While focusing on the immediate needs of reengagement and getting
early wins, Directors stressed the importance of putting the right medium term development framework in
place, through the initiation of a wide range of institutional reforms. They also agreed that effective
partnership, coordinated risk management, and reasonable expectations will be crucial in putting the
country on the path to recovery.
