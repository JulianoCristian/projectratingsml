Following a break in relations during the period of military rule, the IMF resumed official
relations with Guinea in January 2011. The new government that took office in January has
inherited a very difficult macroeconomic and financial situation. In consultation with Fund
staff, the government has adopted a short-term stabilization program aimed at restoring the
fiscal position and reducing inflation. This program will be presented to the Fund's
Executive Board as the basis for providing financial support to Guinea under the Rapid
Credit Facility (RCF), covering the period January­June 2011. Board consideration of the
RCF request is scheduled for June 1, 2011.

1.      Guinea's economy developed serious macroeconomic imbalances during
2009­10, reflecting a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit financed largely by domestic
bank credit and external arrears. Following a coup d'état in December 2008, the military
regime abandoned fiscal control. The fiscal deficit averaged about 1 percent of GDP per
month during 2009­10, financed in large part by advances from the central bank (BCRG)
(Table 1). Broad money doubled, creating a large liquidity overhang and contributing to an
increase in inflation to 21 percent by end-2010; and to significant depreciation of the Guinea
franc. Foreign reserves were largely eroded by end-2010 while the government accumulated
arrears on its external debt service obligations.

2.      Following presidential elections, the new government has taken important steps
to address the imbalances. Fiscal control has been restored, including by executing public
expenditure on a cash basis, re-enforcing procurement regulations--including withdrawing
the military's exemption from competitive bidding processes--and by freezing most new
hiring in the civil service and eliminating ad-hoc customs exemptions. A World Bank-
financed review of large public procurement contracts awarded in 2009­10 pointed to
widespread irregularities; the government has suspended project implementation and the
making of any payments until thorough audits can be completed. Legislation has been passed
to bring all state funds under the control of the Treasury, with a view to ensuring tight central
control over public sector financial flows.

3.      The BCRG has moved to tighten monetary policy. The discount rate was increased
from 16.5 percent to 22 percent on March 23, while simultaneously the reserve requirement
was raised from 9.5 percent to 17 percent. The BCRG sees these moves as an initial measure
to contain inflation, and stands ready to tighten further, including through open market
operations, if warranted by monetary developments.

4.      Following initial actions to support the exchange rate by administrative
controls, the BCRG is now moving towards management of the exchange rate by
(indirect) market measures. Following the closure of foreign exchange bureaus in
early-March, the BCRG has issued new regulations to ensure the prudent operation of such

bureaus and some have already been relicensed and reopened. The authorities have indicated
their commitment to allow market determination of the exchange rate, supported by limited
intervention consistent with program reserve targets; the official exchange rate, affecting
government foreign exchange transactions, is to be set as the weighted average of
commercial bank rates.

5.       Guinea's external debt position is unsustainable Expectations that Guinea would
reach the completion point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative by mid-2009 were dashed by the occurrence of the military coup. With previous
rescheduling agreements coming to an end, external debt service falling due is set to rise to
4.3 percent of GDP in 2011, while existing arrears on payment obligations amounted to some
8 percent of GDP as of end-2010.

6.     The authorities' initial administrative and policy reform agenda focuses on
measures to improve public financial management and enhance revenue collection. A
key priority is governance reform in the mining sector, which they expect could yield
considerable additional revenue (not yet factored into the budget) later in 2011.

7.       In consultation with the staff of the IMF, the government has formulated a
short-term stabilization program for which it is requesting financial support under the
IMF's RCF. The key element of the program, which aims at reversing the rising trend in
inflation and on reducing the pressure on the exchange rate, is to restore fiscal sustainability
through substantive spending cuts, buttressed by a tightening of monetary policy. The budget
deficit (as a share of GDP and excluding grants) is set to decline from some 15 percent in
2010 to 6 percent in 2011, with an equally sharp decline in domestic bank financing; the
latter would be back-loaded to the second half of the year to limit the budgetary burden on
the central bank as it seeks to contain inflation. Expenditure cuts are focused on areas where
outlays increased sharply in 2009­10--notably military-related outlays--while some new
allocations are being made available for the administration's Emergency Action Plan,
focused in the main on improving critical infrastructure and education and health services.

8.      Given external debt service requirements, along with the need to supplement
domestically-generated resources to finance the sharply reduced fiscal deficit, the 2011
budget currently has a sizeable financing gap of about 11 percent of GDP
($500 million). In light of the country's fragile financial and debt position, coordinated donor
support, including from the African Development Bank, the European Commission, the
World Bank, and others, will be critical to the program's success. Such support would need
to include program and project financing on highly concessional terms, preferably grants.
The draft budget provides for the clearance of arrears to multilateral creditors, notably the
World Bank, along with the resumption of debt service payments to these creditors. With
respect to other external creditors, the authorities plan to initiate discussions on the
modalities that could be used to clear existing arrears and defer debt service pending formal
resolution in the context of the HIPC Initiative.

9.      The authorities' plans to restore macroeconomic stability are soundly based, but
significant risks remain to achieving program objectives. The fiscal adjustment is
ambitious, and requires significant spending cuts along with adjustments in domestic fuel
                                            3


prices against the backdrop of a still-fragile socio-political environment. Financing of the
budget depends to a large extent on the provision of new external financial support, along
with the cooperation of external creditors in finding temporary solutions to contain debt
service payments until the debt burden can be addressed more decisively in the context of the
HIPC Initiative. Reducing inflation will rely to a significant extent on achieving exchange
rate stability, which in turn will require the rebuilding of domestic confidence in the
economic and political outlook; separately, further increases in world food and fuel prices
would threaten both living standards and the inflation outlook. Finally, there is a need for
urgent improvement in the authorities' policy coordination to avoid counterproductive ad hoc
measures. However, the authorities' strong commitment, as demonstrated by the significant
supporting measures already implemented, augurs well for the success of the program.

10.     The IMF's Executive Board is expected to consider Guinea's request for
financial support under the RCF on June 1, 2011. Possible additional support to Guinea
during the second half of the year could include a second disbursement under the RCF, to
support policy implementation during the second semester of the year, or, and depending on
the strength of the policy framework and track record, the initiation of a multi-year
macroeconomic and structural reform program that would be supported under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF).
