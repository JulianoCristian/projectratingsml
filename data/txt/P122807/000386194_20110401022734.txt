              REENGAGEMENT AND REFORM SUPPORT GRANT


Borrower                    Republic of Guinea
Implementing Agency         Ministry of Finance
Financing Data              SDR49.6 million (US$78 million equivalent), IDA grant
Operation Type              Stand alone, single tranche
Main Policy Areas           The main policy areas of this operation are: (i) public financial
                            management, including procurement; (ii) public sector efficiency
                            and accountability, focusing on core personnel management systems
                            and (iii) transparency in the mining sector.
Key Outcome Indicators       Key outcome indicators of this operation would be: (i) Proportion of
                            all signed public contracts that are single source; (ii) Aggregate
                            expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budge; (iii)
                            Number of bank accounts of public entities in commercial banks;
                            (iv) Gross hiring into the civil service; (v) Duplicate payroll entries
                            from individuals claiming multiple civil service salaries removed
                            from payroll; (vi) Civil servants over 65 years of age removed from
                            payroll; (vii) Updated and coherent Mining Code including
                            international best practice drafted.
Program Development         The proposed grant will facilitate the clearance of Guinea`s arrears
Objective(s) and            to IDA, which is required in order to restore normal relations
Contribution to ISN         between Guinea and the World Bank. The grant`s program
                            development objective is to strengthen financial management,
                            efficiency and accountability in the public sector and to increase
                            transparency in the mining sector.

                            This operation would contribute to one of the two objectives of the
                            ISN, namely the consolidation of national reconciliation through
                            building state capacity and increasing accountability. It will be
                            complemented with a parallel technical assistance operation, the
                            Guinea Economic Recovery Technical Assistance operation, under
                            preparation.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The proposed operation comprises high interrelated risks, most of
                            which cannot be fully mitigated, namely:
                                 Macroeconomic risks. The prospects of a deterioration of
                                    Guinea`s macroeconomic performance, stemming from a
                                    deterioration in the external environment (increased fuel,
                                    food, and petroleum prices, against a stagnation of mining
                                    prices) or /and the materialization of important contingent
                                    fiscal liabilities, represent a significant risk, particularly if
                                    this causes a delay in the HIPC process. This
                                    macroeconomic risk would be mitigated by close monitoring
                                    of the macroeconomic framework elaborated by the
                                    Government jointly with the IMF and the World Bank, and
                                    an acceleration of the HIPC timetable, provided that overall


                                                vi
Risks and Risk Mitigation      performance is fully satisfactory on the part of the
(continued)                    Government. There is also a risk of falling back into
                               arrears with creditors, given the scale of the outstanding
                               debt. This risk is mitigated by the provision of IDA budget
                               support through the proposed operation, which, combined
                               with the IMF RCF, will serve as a catalyst for external
                               support from other Development Partners.
                               Security risks stemming from (i) insufficient progress in
                               security sector reform; (ii) spillover effects from the ongoing
                               crisis in Cote d`Ivoire (refugee flows); (iii) arms and drug
                               trafficking; and (iv) conflicts over the allocation of
                               extractive industries revenues. The mitigation of this risk
                               requires a continued commitment of the UN and the
                               international community to support the Government of
                               Guinea in maintaining security. In collaboration with other
                               Development Partners (United Nations and ECOWAS in
                               particular, given their foreseen leadership in his area), the
                               World Bank Economic Governance technical assistance
                               project in preparation will contribute to integrate the reform
                               of security services in the broader medium term fiscal
                               framework, while improving public financial management
                               practices in the military for greater reform effectiveness and
                               efficiency.
                               Fiduciary risks. Under this operation, most of the resources
                               will be used to clear IDA arrears. Thus, government
                               fiduciary risk is ­ de facto- very limited. An audit of the
                               flow of funds from IDA to the Treasury, via a dedicated
                               account at the Central Bank will be requested in order to
                               mitigate risks associated with the weak safeguards
                               environment at the Central Bank. However, there is a
                               broader fiduciary risk from failure of the Government to
                               make efficient use of the fiscal space made available by
                               arrears clearance and budget support. This fiduciary risk
                               stems from a poorly performing public financial
                               management system; weak procurement practices and;
                               multiple vested interests. The authorities` commitment to a
                               credible program of PFM reform and evidence that
                               improvements are occurring in a timely manner will be
                               critical to mitigate fiduciary risks. The new government`s
                               emerging track record in the first months of 2011 is
                               encouraging, with the reinstatement of a Treasury committee
                               chaired by the Prime Minister and full cooperation with
                               World Bank financed auditors in charge of auditing the
                               single source contracts committed to in 2009 and 2010. The
                               prior actions supported by this operation will also contribute
                               to strengthen basic fiduciary controls in the critical areas of
                               budget execution, cash management and public
                               procurement. However, a residual fiduciary risk is related to
                               the continued presence of vested interests and the time
                               needed to entrench PFM reforms.



                                         vii
Risks and Risk Mitigation           Implementation risks stemming from poor capacity and
(continued)                         coordination within the Government, which could stall
                                    progress in the reform agenda. The focus and limited
                                    ambition of the proposed operation on a limited set of key
                                    reforms/institutions will mitigate this risk, and will be
                                    complemented with direct technical assistance in similar
                                    fields (public financial management, public sector reform,
                                    and mining sector). The degree of coordination between
                                    Guinean institutions will also be improved by the
                                    demonstrated strong ownership of the reform agenda by the
                                    President. Revived coordination between Development
                                    Partners will also facilitate the overall implementation of the
                                    reform agenda, the action plan in particular. The ownership
                                    of the reform agenda within the Government is strong,
                                    which could help mitigate the resistance to change of vested
                                    interests, including the security forces.
                                 Political economy risks stemming from insufficient results
                                    (against high expectations), deterioration of the security
                                    situation, and perception of corruption, which would all

                                    already started, through regional and national consultations,

                         IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
                        REENGAGEMENT AND REFORM SUPPORT GRANT
                               TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA


                                             1.       INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Support Grant
(RRSG) for the Republic of Guinea, for an amount of SDR49.6 million (US$78 million
equivalent). This single tranche, stand alone Development Policy Operation aims to support
Authorities` efforts to consolidate recent democratic gains, and engage decisively on a reform
program that would enhance macro-economic stability and mark a clean break with the past on
executive accountability and transparency. While the grant would primarily translate into
facilitating arrears clearance to IDA to allow resumption of Bank`s disbursement in support of
the Transitional Poverty Reduction Strategy, particular attention is given to policy actions aimed
at (i) improving public financial management; (ii) strengthening public sector efficiency and
accountability focusing on core personnel management systems and (iii) fostering transparency
in the mining sector. The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Bank`s Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for Guinea for the period 2011-12,1 and with the World Bank`s Africa Action Plan.
Given the quick response needed to an emergency situation, the proposed operation does not
fully address certain design considerations, per OP 8.60.
2.       Emerging from an authoritarian military regime through free and fair elections,
Guinea's prospects for economic development and poverty reduction have greatly
improved. After years of dictatorship and instability since independence, Guinea`s first
democratically elected president assumed power in December 2010. President Condé was elected
on a platform aimed at reaping and sharing the benefits of its very rich agricultural and
geological endowment. Guinea has a strong agricultural potential, thanks to its tropical climate,
fertile soils and abundant water resources. It also has the world`s biggest reserves of bauxite, as
well as very significant deposits of iron, gold, diamonds, and other minerals and good potential
for oil off-shore reserves. And prospects for massive debt relief through the HIPC and MDRI
initiatives should provide the fiscal space needed to improve service delivery and finance key
structural reforms. In the past, Guinea`s poor governance and instability have prevented it from
unlocking its growth potential: Guinea`s United Nations Development Programme human
development index ranked 156 out of 169 countries in 2010.

3.      However, in order to realize this potential, the country needs to overcome a very
challenging macroeconomic situation. By end 2010, the budget deficit was estimated at 14 per
cent of GDP, the result of large expenditure slippages in the form of substantial wage increases,
patronage civil service appointments, and large investment expenditure (most of which for the
military) contracted on a single source basis and bypassing normal procurement and budgetary
procedures. In contrast, resource mobilization performance was weak, in the mining sector in
particular, and through ad-hoc multiple tax exemption, widespread corruption, and poor tax
administration. The consequence of uncontrolled expenditures in a context of flat revenues and
insignificant donor financing was a sharp increase in Central Bank advances and external arrears

    This ISN is presented to the Board at the same time as the present operation.
(vis-à-vis IDA notably), leading to accelerated inflation, rapid currency depreciation and the
depletion of foreign currency reserves. And substantial contingent liabilities threaten to worsen
an already challenging fiscal outlook for 2011-13.

4.     The Government is committed to frontally tackle its macro-economic challenges
while addressing emergency needs. The Government strategy comprises immediate actions to
regain control of public expenditure, improve resource mobilization, fulfill its past and present
financial obligations to Development Partners, and pave the way for structural reforms to sustain
progress over time. At the same time, the Government is keen to rapidly improve service
delivery in key sectors (electricity, water, safety nets), through the implementation of an action
plan in 2011, to improve people`s living conditions following two years of negative per capita
GDP growth in 2009 and 2010. The rapid reform of security services is also considered by the
Government as a critical element of continued political stability.
5.      But these relevant objectives of the Government cannot be achieved without strong
and immediate external support. Given its large statutory obligations (wage bill, debt service)
and poor resource mobilization with modest economic recovery, substantial external support is
needed to finance the action plan and avoid large central bank financing. This can be achieved by
(i) substantial budget support in 2011 to facilitate arrears clearance and debt service to IDA and
allow (ii) the rapid re-activation of existing World Bank portfolio (US$170 million of
undisbursed commitments) in support of the action plan. Combined with a parallel African
Development Bank budget support (US$30 million) and IMF Rapid Credit Facility (US$25
million), both to be approved in April 2011, the use of remaining IDA15 resource, possibly
followed up later on in 2011 with IDA16 resource for a second development policy operation,
would pave the way to meet the HIPC completion point in 2012. The World Bank re-engagement
would also serve as a catalyst for other Development Partners to follow suit in 2012.
6.      While the proposed operation comprises many risks, the cost of non -action is likely
to be much higher. Security (domestic and regional), political economy, macroeconomic (with
worsening terms of trade prospects) and implementation risks under the proposed operation
cannot be underestimated, given Guinea`s past difficulties in sustaining consistent
implementation of a long term development strategy. Nevertheless, without material World Bank
financial support, the financing of the deficit from the central bank will ultimately foster price
inflation and currency depreciation, stall growth and adjourn prospects for debt relief. Opaque
natural resource predation could provide an alternative source of short term fiscal financing, but
would likely involve discounts on the value of the minerals sold and carry heavy long term
governance costs. With macroeconomic instability and Government`s inability to deliver on its
promises, risks of social instability and military dissatisfaction will mount (as already observed
over the period 2007-9), threatening to reverse the democratic gains achieved in 2010.
7.     The proposed operation is part of a broader World Bank re-engagement strategy.
While the proposed operation will open the door for project disbursement, it will also benefit
from it, as efforts will be pursued to restructure the existing portfolio in support of the
Government`s action plan. The RRSG will also be complemented with new technical assistance
in support of public financial management (in civilian and military sectors), public sector reform,
the mining sector, safety nets and the design and participation process around the Transitional
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The World Bank group, including the International Finance

Corporation is also planning to rapidly provide technical assistance to strengthen public private
dialogue and the business environment, as well as capacity for public private partnerships.

                  2.      RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

                       A. R ECENT P OLITICAL AND E CONOMIC D EVELOPMENTS

8.      After years of military dictatorship and instability, Guinea's first democratically
elected president assumed power in December 2010. Since it gained independence in 1958,
Guinea has lived under a succession of autocratic regimes, civilian or military. After a first long
period of central planning, a new regime started a broad range of market oriented reforms in the
late 1980s. Following initial stabilization gains (until mid-90s), macroeconomic performance
weakened, structural reforms were halted ­ as confronting solid vested interests, and the
repression of civil and political liberties, combined with widespread corruption, resulted in
disastrous development outcomes and frequent urban social unrest. In late 2008, a military junta
seized power with a coup, which prompted the international community and the World Bank,
under OP 7.30, on Dealing with de facto governments`, to stop formal relationship with (and
suspend disbursements to) Guinea. In 2009, the deadly repression of a mass opposition rally
prompted the United Nations to investigate responsibilities with threats of prosecution through
the international criminal court. Growing tension within the junta eventually led to its implosion
and acceptance to renounce power in favor of civilians, against the promise of security services
reform, as per the Ouagadougou Accord of January 15, 2010. A transition process (led by the
National Transition Council) was organized and led to the successful election and investiture,
through a fair and transparent process, of President Condé in December 2010. Legislative
elections are scheduled for mid 2011.

9.      There is presently a historical window of opportunity to create the kind of
governance structure that can put Guinea on a fast growth and development path. The
window is the result of a confluence of several forces: the rise in the voice of civil society,
reflecting the population`s unhappiness with the old model of Governance; the weakening of the
traditional elites, including in the top echelon of the military, reflected in the first ever
democratic election of a President; and the coming together of mining potential in the form of
active involvement by some of the world`s top mining companies with specific investment plans
that can transform the national economy. The key challenges that remain, to make good on the
promise, are: the completion of the reform of the security forces, the initiation of a national
reconciliation process, the holding of the Parliamentary elections, and the completion of the
review of the existing mining contracts.

10.      Understanding the underlying drivers of reform in a country like Guinea, which has
been led by autocratic rule for over five decades and presents a complex pattern of social
and ethnic allegiance is a challenging undertaking. However, a simple stakeholder analysis
can help shed light on some of the reasons for the relative failure of past attempts at reform of
the public sector, in the early 2000s and again during the Kouyaté government of 2007 -2008.
Under Sékou Touré and Lansana Conté, the Guinean State did not really function as an
institution aiming to define public policies and deliver public services. Instead, it became
primarily a source of patronage and private gain. The key stakeholders who benefited from this
state of affairs were the President`s clan, as well as the security forces, and in particular top


                                               -3-
echelons of the armed forces. They resisted reforms throughout the past decade, until popular
pressure, led by the trade union and civil society organizations, resulted in the appointment of a
reform Government` under Prime Minister Kouyaté in 2007, and in 2010, in forcing the holding
of the first ever competitive election for the Presidency.

11.     The main challenge for the new Government will be to use the window of
opportunity created by the presidential elections in order to transform the perception of
the State, from a purveyor of private benefits to be shared between social and ethnic groups, to
an organization working for the benefit of the nation as a whole, with a well functioning public
sector that can deliver programs and projects in the name of the national interest. To achieve this
transition, the new Government has to capitalize on its recent successes, and find ways to
complete the governance reform agenda rapidly. Its hand is strengthened by the discredit of the
notion that the military can govern the state effectively, following the events of September 2009
and the intervention of the International Criminal Court, as well as the financial mismanagement
observed during their rule. The new Government also benefits so far from the support of a
relatively wide coalition of civil society organizations and ethnic groups, but this support is
conditional on the holding of Parliamentary elections in the near future, and the initiation of a
national reconciliation process, which are necessary conditions to reduce the ethnic tensions
brought about by a very competitive Presidential election. To prevent nepotism, and guard
against accusations of favoritism, deliberate efforts at greater transparency and communication
will be necessary, including on the causes of past failures.

12.     Since 2008, economic growth strongly decelerated, to become negative in per capita
terms. Deficiencies in economic data due to the deterioration of statistical systems and the
impact of the political instability make it difficult to present a reliable analysis of the recent
economic developments in Guinea as well medium-term prospects. However, it is clear that
since 2008, economic performance in Guinea has deteriorated significantly. Cumulatively, GDP
per capita declined by 4.6 percent between 2008 and 2010. While agriculture continued to grow
modestly, the mining sector - historically a major driver of growth contracted in real terms by 6
percent between 2008 and 2010 in spite of rising world prices. The regulatory business
environment worsened with the cancellations of contracts in the mining sector, changes of
license terms and conditions in the telecommunications sector, and more generally, uncertain
political situation in the context of deteriorated security. In contrast, construction and
administration sectors benefited from the large fiscal expansion recorded in 2009-10, see below.

13.     The basic fiscal balance, which excludes grants, interest payments on foreign debt
and foreign financed capital expenditures, deteriorated sharply both in 2009 and in 2010.
From a positive 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008, the basic fiscal balance dropped to a negative 5.7
percent of GDP in 2009 and 12.8 percent in 2010. The fiscal deterioration stemmed mostly from
increased primary spending (excluding interest payments and foreign-financed capital
expenditure), which grew from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 27.0 percent in 2010. Increased
military spending (wages, investment, subsidies), as well as a surge in the civil service wage bill
(large hiring and substantial pay rises) mostly contributed to the growth in public spending.
Competitive procurement procedures were circumvented and data from audits performed as a
prior action for the proposed operation indicate that the commitments under multi-annual
contracts signed in 2009 and 2010 amounted to US$2.2 billion, or 50 percent of GDP, thus



                                               -4-
creating a large expenditure overhang2. The fiscal deficit was mostly financed by advances from
the Central Bank (BCRG) and by running up external arrears.

14.    Consumer price inflation accelerated, although at a lower pace than expected.
Consumer prices grew by 8 and 20.8 percent in 2009 and 2010 (or 30 percent in cumulative
terms), while broad money more than doubled over the same period of time. It is believed
though, that the inflationary impact of the large expansion in money supply was not fully felt in
2010, given the rise in precautionary savings (as suggested by the significant drop in money
velocity). Meanwhile, the Guinean Franc depreciated by 12 percent against the Euro between
2008 and 2010, and foreign currency reserves fell to US$87 million by end 2010, or 0.5 months
of imports.

15.    Faced with multiple pressures on the budget and foreign currency reserves, the
authorities suspended payments to IDA in 2009. By end 2010, Guinea`s cumulated arrears to
IDA stood at US$60 million. Overall, authorities reported external arrears of US$321 million by
end-2010 (7.1 percent of GDP), comprised of US$96 million multilateral creditors, World Bank
and European Investment Bank in particular, US$110 million to Paris Club bilateral creditors
and US$115 million to other creditors. Guinea did not accumulate arrears vis-à-vis the IMF or
the AfDB. Indications from the Government are that domestic arrears are not substantial.

  In addition, the military junta also drafted about US$ 3.6 billion in single source procurement contracts that the
Minister of Finance refused to approve. Although these do not represent legally valid commitments, in some cases
the affected line ministries may have ordered the suppliers to start the works or the delivery of goods and services.
The issue of the possible contingent liability created by this scenario is dealt wit h in section G below.

16.     The macroeconomic framework for 2011 and beyond remains very challenging. The
population`s expectations are high following the first free elections since independence and the
political and security environment will remain fragile pending reform of the powerful army.
Economic activity is expected to rebound after the uncertain election period in 2010. However, it
will be difficult to quickly turn around the fiscal situation; with anticipated modest economic

capacity, government capacity to generate additional revenue will remain limited. On the
expenditure side, the wage bill will rise further through the full-year effect of 2010 pay increases,
and the debt service, interest and principal repayments, will represent a large burden on the
budget, as Guinea is no longer eligible to interim debt relief under HIPC and intends to clear its
arrears vis-à-vis Development Partners. Furthermore, improving service delivery is a critical
priority of the authorities` action plan, as is security sector reform and the organization of
legislative elections, in order to consolidate democratic and security gains achieved in 2010.

17.     Against this challenging background, the authorities worked with the Bank and the
Fund to identify a credible medium term macroeconomic framework consistent with their
financial re-engagement. Key to a robust medium term macro-economic framework is the
identification and costing of early reforms to (i) reduce Government financing needs while (ii)
strengthening Guinea`s likelihood to reach the HPIC completion point in 2012. Measures
retained by the authorities include in particular the (i) re-instatement of the Treasury Committee
(chaired by the Prime Minister) for more effective cash management, (ii) aggressive tax controls
against past frauds and evasion, (iii) the transfer to Treasury of dividends and fees collected by
autonomous public agencies and enterprises, (iv) increased customs duties through broadened
pre-shipment inspections and the removal of ad-hoc temporary tariff exemptions, (v) the
progressive alignment of petroleum prices to global levels, (vi) cuts on goods and services, (vii)
a net hiring freeze in the public sector (to the exception of health, education and justice, see
Section IV), and (viii) the cancellation and/or postponement of illegal investment contracts
signed under the military junta regime in 2009-10. Under this budget, to be approved by the
National Transition Council before end-March 2011, the basic fiscal deficit is projected to reach
two percent of GDP in 2011.

18.     The Government program will be supported by an IMF rapid credit facility. The
IMF staff will monitor with Authorities the evolution of the situation on a monthly basis, budget
cash management in particular. On the monetary front, the regular auction of treasury bills to be
placed in banks will be promoted to sterilize excessive liquidities and cover domestic financing
needs. Foreign currency proceeds, in particular from the mining sector, will also be sterilized,
with a view to raise Central Bank foreign reserves to 1.5 months of imports by end-2011.

19.     Substantial external financing in 2011 will be critical to macroeconomic stabilization
and to pave the way towards HIPC completion point. Given identified financing needs to
cover current debt service and arrears clearance to multilaterals, substantial financial support will
be critical to limit resort to central bank financing and rebuild foreign currency reserves, thus
providing sufficient buffer against potential external shocks and the resum ption of arrears.
Following the proposed operation (allowing the resumption of disbursements on World Bank
projects) and forbearance from Paris Club creditors, a second World Bank development policy
operation of US$35 million equivalent, combined with a parallel operation from the AfDB of
US$30 million equivalent could provide the financing needed in 2011. Such additional support in
2011 would be conditioned by a satisfactory performance under the Rapid Credit Facility, paving
the way for a successor IMF Extended Credit Facility. Under this plausible scenario, the
consumer price inflation, after peaking to 24 percent by mid-2011, would decelerate to around 17

percent by end year,3 and foreign currency reserves, also benefiting from SDR allocation
(US$130 million) and the resumption of foreign-financed investment projects, would reach the
equivalent of 1.5 months of imports by end 2011.4 Indeed, Government contribution to foreign
currency reserves accumulation (excluding transfers from donors financed investment projects,
likely to exceed imports from Government financed investment projects) would be positive,
around US$143 million in 2011 limiting the risks of new arrears accumulation (see Table 2.2
below).

20.     Under this central scenario, the HIPC completion point could be met in 2012. Along
with meeting structural HIPC triggers (see Table 2.3), most of which have already been met, a
satisfactory performance under the Extended Credit Facility ­ likely synonym of contained basic
fiscal deficit - would allow reaching the completion point in 2012. This, in turn, would reduce
the debt service and help containing the overall deficit, in spite of lower overall external
assistance (given the anticipated total IDA16 envelope, of approximately US$120 million for
FY12-14).

21.     The Government's macroeconomic strategy is not immune of risks. Beyond risks
external to budget execution (political, security, implementation, fiduciary, see risks section), a
satisfactory execution of the macro-economic program will depend heavily on Government`s
ability to avoid the realization of material contingent liabilities. In particular, the large
expenditure overhang created by the signing and/or commitment (to be regularized) of large
contracts in 2009 and 2010 will need to be frontally addressed to avoid expenditure slippage.




3
  The containment of public financing needs will be complemented by a monetary policy aimed at sterilizing excess
liquidity, through higher reserves requirements and the issuance of non tradable Treasury Bills.
4
  In order to deepen the foreign exchange market and reduce exchange rate volatility, the Government intends to
reinstate the daily automatic adjustment of the official exchange rate to the commercial rate, and enforce regulations
for exchange bureaus as first steps to the integration of the official, commercial and parallel markets.

Following the receipt of an audit report on the 2009 and 2010 contracts5 (a prior action to the
proposed operation), the Government plans to impose a moratorium on contracts signed in 2009
and 2010, and audit each of them in detail with the support of professional international
government auditors. Government`s political ability to contain the budgetary impact of rising
global commodity prices (rice and petroleum in particular6) and domestic inflation ­ mostly
affecting urban households, on public expenditure (subsidies, wage bill) will also be key.

22.     Unsurprisingly, the Debt Sustainability Analysis conducted for the proposed
operation suggests that reaching HIPC completion point will be decisive to reduce Guinea's
level of debt distress, currently high. At end-2010, the stock of public and publicly guaranteed
debt of Guinea amounted to US$3,102 million, or 69 percent of GDP.

23.     Guinea's macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purposes of the
proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 budget, the decisive
nature and pace of actions immediately taken by the new Government to regain control of the
fiscal situation and put it on a sustainable path, as well as the complementary financial and
technical assistance from Development Partners and the IMF provide a sufficient basis for the
proposed operation to meet its objectives, in spite of the high risks attached to it (see Section
5E).

24.     The last household survey undertaken in 2007 suggested that more than half ­ 53
percent ­ of the population was living below the poverty line, up from 49 percent in 2002,
reflecting a negative per capita economic growth during the period. The survey nonetheless
indicated favorable trends in a number of key social indicators, such as the gross and net
enrollment ratio both in primary and secondary schools, the rate of accessibility to health center,
the share of women having used prenatal care, and the share of assisted birth. On the contrary
however, the percentage of children suffering from chronic malnutrition was increasing, from 33
to 36 percent. In 2007, the proportion of the rural population living below the poverty line was
63 percent, against 31 percent for the urban population.

25.     Given macroeconomic developments since 2007, it is likely that poverty further
increased. In the absence of a new household survey, likely to be conducted in 2012, it is
difficult to ascertain poverty trends. However, there is little doubt that poverty further increased
since 2007, with an estimated cumulative decline in average per capita private consumption of
6.4 percent. Assuming that this decline affected all households in similar proportion would entail
a poverty rate of 58 percent of the population in 2010. While this is uncertain, it is possible that
the high inflation in 2009-10 could have increased the poverty rate, as disproportionally affecting
poor and vulnerable households unable to protect themselves against it.

26.      With high prevalence of poverty, household vulnerability to negative shocks is also
high, to food price shocks in particular. The consumption of essential food items (rice, maize,
oil, fish, meat and vegetables) in total consumption is high and very similar across households (at
about 45 percent), to the exception of the richest quintile (37 percent). As such, increases in the


                                                         - 11 -
relative price of essential food commodities ­ the result of global commodities prices increases,
would significantly affect poor and near poor, as observed in 2008. This is the case for imported
rice, which under current projections, could see its price on the domestic market go up by 45
percent in nominal terms, and entail ­ through first order partial equilibrium effects ­ a decline
of about 2 percent in poor`s purchasing power (against 1.6 percent for non poor). The difference
between poor and non poor would be more pronounced when measuring the relative impact
relative to total monetized consumption, given the higher proportion of auto-consumption in
poor households than in non poor households. In response, the Government intends to raise
strategic reserves of essential food commodities, encourage agricultural supply, and increase
competition among importers via the delivery of new licenses. The removal of ad-hoc temporary
tariff exemptions, ineffective to stabilize market prices during the dry season given monopolistic
practices, will contribute to finance these objectives.

27.     In contrast, the consumption of petroleum products (for lightning and
transportation, public and private) is strongly differentiated between poor (2.5 percent of
their total consumption) and non poor (5.7 percent of their total consumption). Thus, a 30
percent increase in petroleum prices and transports7 (the consequence of restored petroleum
taxation at regional levels) would entail ­ through first order partial equilibrium effects - a
decline of about 1.3 percent in poor households` purchasing power, against 2.9 percent for non
poor. The impact would also be significantly differentiated between rural and urban areas, 1.5
against 3.7 percent (4.4 percent for Conakry alone). But the direct impact on inflation (through
primary and secondary effects), the uncertainty of short term oil price projections, and the
practical difficulty to rapidly implement offsetting measures for affected households, are all
considered by authorities as important elements calling for a progressive adjustment of domestic
prices to world prices trends given the fragility of the political situation. Over the medium term,
the Government also intends to develop a public transportation system, currently inexistent, to
reduce urban congestion and households` transport costs.

  Evidence of the last increase in petroleum prices in December 2010 suggests a full pass-through of petroleum
prices to transport prices.

   3.           THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

28.    The Transitional Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (TPRSP) provides a clear
statement of the government's commitment to poverty reduction. The TPRSP, an extension
of the full PRSP formulated in 2007, provides the framework for a ction towards poverty
reduction in 2011-2012. During this transitional period, the planning, analytical work, and
consultations for a full PRSP will be carried out, with the aim to have a full PRSP in place by
mid-2013. The preparation of the TPRSP involved broad consultations with stakeholders and
members of the Development Community present in Guinea. A consultative group meeting is
scheduled for June 2011.

29.     The poverty reduction strategy is based on three main pillars: (i) to sustain faster
economic growth and create income-earning and employment opportunities, particularly for the
rural poor; (ii) to improve and extend access to basic services; and (iii) to improve governance
and strengthen institutional and human capacity. Thematic groups working under the National
Secretariat for Poverty Reduction identified sources of and obstacles to private sector led growth,
constraints to service delivery, equity and gender, and practical approaches of stakeholder`s
participation in governance improvement and capacity strengthening.

30.     Agriculture and mining are expected to provide the key source of growth. In
agriculture the objectives are to make better use of the large potential in expanding rice
production, enhance food security through diversification and better extension services for small
holders, and foster agro-business that can transform and also exports non-traditional export. In
mining the objective is to bring to completion the large projects that are already under


                                                      - 13 -
preparation, including new alumina processing plants, expansion of bauxite mines, bringing at
the stage of production the huge iron mines for which concessions have been granted in recent
years. The national authorities are also seeking to improve the regulatory framework for public
utilities and promote private sector participation in developing these sectors.

31.     In addressing short term needs, and to kick-start the implementation of the TPRSP,
the authorities have prepared a priority action plan for 2011 which aims at quickly
improving basic service and infrastructure. This plan amounts to about US$170 million, of
which 40 percent is for priority infrastructure, in electricity, water, transport, 30 percent to
support agriculture, 10 percent to improve governance and 20 percent for social services. Its first
part focuses on the first hundred days` of the administration and includes emergency power
repairs, road works, agricultural inputs and maternal health supplies provision, as well as a
census of civilian and military personnel. The second part, covering the rest of the year focuses
on good governance, poverty reduction (including building-up food stocks),

32.     Sustained growth will require achieving macroeconomic stability, including a
sustainable budget with limited recourse to bank financing, low inflation, a sustainable balance
of payment and debt position with adequate international reserves to provide a buffer against
external shocks. Key measures on public finance and civil service include implementation of a
comprehensive action plan for public financial management, including tight expenditure
procedures, better auditing and controls, stricter and more transparent procurement rules,
rigorous cash management, enhanced tax administration, tighter management of the civil service,
and streamlining of security expenditures. Monetary management will be facilitated by a tighter
budget which will not require access to bank financing, thus providing room for credit expansion
to the private sector. The balance of payments position is expected to improve through debt
reduction with achievement of the HIPC completion point, and the expansion of mining exports
when the large new project come into operation, starting in 2013 with bauxite and in later years
for iron. Placing the debt on a sustainable path is predicated on the achievement of the HIPC
completion point, which in turn requires good performance under the proposed expected IMF
arrangement to be put in place in the second half of 2011.

33.     The government's poverty reduction strategy emphasizes the importance of greater
efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the provision of basic public services. The focus is on
bringing services closer to the beneficiaries through decentralization, on greater community
participation, and on the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework. The
government's poverty reduction strategy also stresses governance, improving public resource
allocation and management, and strengthening judicial capacity.

34.     Security sector reform is also considered critical to provide the enabling security
environment for economic development, but its contours still need to be specified. Per the
Ouagadougou accord of January 2010, the Government committed to reform the security
services. In May 2010, the results of a joint evaluation conducted by ECOWAS, the African
Union, and the United Nations were submitted to Authorities, and should serve as a basis for
reform design and implementation. However, fiscal and human resource implications of the
reform plan still need to be integrated with the overall TPRSP, and it is not clear that Guinea`s
civilian and military authorities share the same concept of SSR and its desired outcome. For the
Government and Development Partners, SSR seeks to re-adapt the size and role of the security


                                              - 14 -
forces in relation to the actual defense and security needs of the country. In addition, it seeks to
increase the overall performance of the military, gendarmerie and police by clarifying their roles
and responsibilities, as well as re-organizing their human resources and financial management.
In such a re-organization, the myriad of benefits and privileges that the security forces have
bestowed themselves over time will likely come under increasing civilian scrutiny. In addition,
the significant reduction of security personnel number is likely a key feature of the civilian
concept of SSR. In contrast, the military top brass likely see SSR as an opportunity to attract
donor funds for improving infrastructure, equipment as well as terms and conditions. In the
lower ranks, SSR will likely be seen as an opportunity for promotion, redressing grievances, and
improving their terms and conditions. As a first step, the Government, with the supp ort of
ECOWAS and the UN, will hold a seminar in the first half of 2011 to establish a common
approach to SSR.

35.     The PRSP secretariat carried out consultations with key stakeholders in recent
months in the regions (Kindia and Kankan), and in Conakry, including with members of the
legislature (National Transition Council), civil society, and development partners, with wide
dissemination though the media to promote social accountability and demand side governance.
This process will be supported by the World Bank Economic Governance Technical Assistance
project, under preparation. The proposed DPO was also discussed with development partners and
the legislature (National Transition Council) along with the transition PRSP. This consultation
process will be continued to support the preparation of a full PRSP that is supposed to start with
2013.

            4.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                            A. L INK TO THE INTERIM S TRATEGY N OTE

36.    The upcoming ISN, which will be based on the Transitional Poverty Reduction
Strategy, will provide a more comprehensive background for the design of follow-up operations.
The latter would constitute the main instrument through which IDA will gradually broaden its
intervention in support of policy measures drawn from the PRSP agenda to accelerate grow th,
improve service delivery, and strengthen governance. Follow-up policy-based lending will
continue to focus on public sector management that takes several years to make tangible
progress. It will co-exist with a limited number of consolidated projects providing investment
resources and capacity building in key sectors as defined by the PRSP.

37.     The proposed grant supports full normalization of relations between IDA and
Guinea and is thus a critical element of the ISN. It would facilitate the clearance of Guinea`s
arrears to IDA, create needed fiscal space during the period leading to the HIPC Completion
Point, and provide support to Government owned reforms in the area of public financial
management, including procurement, as well as public sector efficiency and effectiveness and
transparency in the mining sector.

                    B.   C OLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND O THER D ONORS

38.  This operation is being prepared in close collaboration and coordination with the
IMF and other donors, notably the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union



                                               - 15 -
(EU), and the Government of France--which together account for approximately 80 percent of
total donor support to Guinea. The IMF and World Bank teams collaborated closely, through
several joint missions (to which AfDB and EU staff also participated), to the design and launch
of the RRSG and RCF. Following the agreed institutional division of labor between the Bank and
the IMF, there is a common understanding of the macro and debt sustainability situation and the
World Bank is taking the lead in the areas of public sector reform and mining. The IMF and
World Bank teams are also closely collaborating on issues of public financial management with a
clear division of labor on the policy actions identified, as reflected in the complementarity
between prior actions and triggers in the proposed operation with performance criteria and
structural benchmarks in the RCF. Exchange of information and consultations with Development
partners was also frequent during the preparation of the proposed operation.

39.    The African Development Bank is developing a parallel Development Policy
Operation, to be disbursed in 2011. The design of the AfDB DPO relies on similar diagnostic
and joint dialogue with authorities and retains the same prior actions as that of the proposed
operation. The AfDB is planning to submit the operation to its Board of Executive Directors in
April 2011, for an equivalent amount ofUS$30 million, to be disbursed in two tranches within
2011, of respectively US$22.5 million and US$ 7.5 million.

40.     Following consultations held in February 2011, it is estimated that about US$660
million worth of new and already existing investment projects could be disbursed in 2011-
12 by Development Partners (including the World Bank) in support of the TPRSP. All
Development Partners present Guinea have expressed interest in having a good coordination
structure at the Government level to complement the donor structures (organized by sectors) and
many have requested that the coordination unit at Ministry of Finance be revived. By February
2011, Development Partners also started, under World Bank leadership, to explore ways to
simplify transactions costs to project disbursement through greater harmonization. This came in
response to a Government demand for technical assistance from the World Bank to establish a
methodology for harmonization in key sectors, including on financing mechanisms, and
developing plans for the future. A consultative Group meeting is scheduled in this regard for
June 2011.

                       C.    R ELATIONSHIP TO O THER B ANK O PERATIONS

41.      The reactivation of the Bank's portfolio is conditional upon the clearance of
Guinea's arrears to IDA, which will be facilitated by the present operation. Disbursement
on the Bank`s portfolio of eight operations, representing nearly US$170 million was stopped
following the December 2008 coup and the triggering of OP 7.30, on Dealing with de facto
Governments`. Disbursements were then formally suspended in November 2009, when Guinea
fell into arrears with IDA, as per OP 13.00, on Disbursements`. Although OP 7.30 was formally
lifted in January 2010, disbursements under IDA operations cannot resume until Guinea has
cleared its arrears vis-à-vis IDA and its suspension is lifted.

42.     In return, the reactivation of the Bank's portfolio of projects will lift some of the
pressure on the 2011 budget by financing part of the Government's action plan. In
preparation for the re-activation of investment projects, the World Bank worked to re-program its
existing portfolio in support of Government immediate priorities, with a view in particular to


                                             - 16 -
finance the action plan and strengthen safety nets. This includes investment projects in health,
urban and rural communities` development, electrification and transport, for a total of US$89
million, part of which ­ possibly US$30 million, could be disbursed in 2011 and the remainder in
2012. Furthermore, from the remaining US$80 million under the EFA -FTI project, US$21
million could be disbursed in 2011 and the remainder in 2012.

43.     This operation is closely related to an Economic Governance Technical Assistance
(EGTA) project, which is under preparation. This project will help to strengthen the
government`s personnel and financial management systems and improve the transparency and
accountability of government civil and military operations. It will also support critical reforms
in the area of mining. It is anticipated that this project will be presented to the Board in the first
quarter of FY12.

44.     Private Sector Development. The new Government has inherited one of the toughest
climates for business in the world: huge deficits exist in both the quantity and quality of
economic infrastructure; the legal enabling environment for business is one of the weakest
anywhere (Guinea ranks 179 th in the 2011 Doing Business Report); access to finance is severely
constrained; and a history of poor governance, erratic policy, and inconsistent regulatory
enforcement has seriously undermined investor confidence in Guinea`s institutions. Given this
background, the World Bank Group (IDA, IFC and MIGA) plans to rapidly provide technical
assistance to strengthen public private dialogue and the business environment, as well as capacity
for public private partnerships. Access to finance is extremely challenging, particularly for
SMEs. On the basis of further analytical and diagnostic work (including an Investment Climate
Survey and a Financial Sector Assessment), it is also foreseeable that instruments related to trade
financing, Partial Credit Guarantees, leasing facilities, etc. could be developed to support SMEs
and financial intermediaries, with World Bank Group assistance.

45.     This operation builds on lessons emerging from DPOs in fragile environments.8
Following the typology for fragile states, Guinea can be considered as a political transition
country, where a change in regime leads to a shift in policy direction, with significant
improvements in the prospects for reform. In this context, this operation focuses on politically-
feasible reforms that can build momentum for future changes, with a particular emphasis on
restoring and strengthening basic state functions--notably with respect to public expenditure
management, including procurement, civil service management and transparency in the mining
sector.

46.     Previous experience with DPOs in fragile states has also shown that the presence of
external partners signals that the international community has scrutinized the
Government's reform agenda and is willing to provide support. External funding in support
of the reform agenda enables the Government to carry out reforms without reducing resource

flows to other critical areas of the economy. The assistance provided by external partners needs
to be well-coordinated and efforts made to ensure that the proposed reforms do not exceed the
Government`s limited capacity. In the case of Guinea, the team has endeavored to strike an
appropriate balance between the ambition of reforms needed to break with the country`s poor
governance track record, and the constraints brought about by limited implementation capacity
and urgent financing needs.

47.     In striking the appropriate balance between ambition and realism, the team was
mindful of the importance of strengthening the budget process, another key lesson from
DPOs in fragile states. Experience has shown that fragile states often have weak or non-existent
budget structures, leading to poor or fragmented allocation of resources. Successful DPOs in
fragile states have helped governments consolidate their budget systems and processes. This
allows for better aggregate fiscal control, improved strategic allocation of scarce resources and,
eventually, more efficient service delivery. In the case of Guinea, this is a top priority, in light of
the recent collapse in fiscal discipline, skewed allocation of resources in favor of the security
sector and very poor service delivery.

48.     Guinea specific lessons on past fiscal adjustments also underline the great
difficulties to maintain efforts and results over a sustained period of time. While external
shocks (terms of trade, regional conflicts) and poor implementation capacity contributed to the
weak macroeconomic performance in the past, the IMF ex-post assessment of its programs run
over the period 1997-2004 also underlines the criticality of ownership at the highest level of
Government, strong focus on corruption and governance, realism of growth projections and
expenditure cuts for sustainability, and ex-ante contingency plans.

49.     The present operation should be considered as a key element of a coordinated aid
and reform package, rather than simply a transfer of financial resources. During the
preparation of this operation, the World Bank provided support to the authorities to assist in the
rapid assessment and management of the contingent liabilities associated with the single-source
contracts entered into in 2009 and 2010. The team that was mobilized for this purpose also
provided technical assistance and capacity building to the internal oversight bodies (Inspection
Générale d'Etat and Inspection Générale des Finances) whose staff took part in the audit. The
evidence provided by the audit team was used as the basis for policy decisions, including the
cancellation of most single source contracts and the initiation of a negotiation process with
suppliers benefiting from these contracts. The World Bank and IMF also provided assistance to
the authorities in the identification of contingent liabilities, as well as potential sources of fiscal
revenue associated with autonomous public bodies and public enterprises. As a result of the
evidence of gross mismanagement of public resources uncovered during the mission, the
authorities decided to crack down on the financial autonomy of some public entities and to
oblige them to hold their liquidities at the Treasury. The upcoming Guinea Recovery Technical
Assistance Project will continue financing critical analytical work, capacity building and
technical assistance in the area of public financial management and procurement, civil service
reform and the mining sector.

50.     Given World Bank disengagement in 2009-10 and in line with OP 8.60's provisions
on budget support in emergency situations, the design of the proposed operation draws on
a limited series of economic and social analyses. It draws in particular on:
       The PEFA report (2007) and a draft policy note on public financial management (March
       2010) which identify priority areas for improvement. The operation also benefited an
       IMF Fiscal Affairs Department report on public financial management (2007. These
       reports informed the design of the Government comprehensive PFM reform strategy,
       approved in 2008 with Fund and Bank support. Several World Bank technical assistance
       missions held before, during and after the political crisis (in October to Decembe r 2008,
       May, August and December 2010) have helped the authorities and the team identify a
       sub-set of priority actions that should become immediate PFM priorities. The most
       critical of these activities were further selected to be supported by the present operation.
       The PFM chapter of the forthcoming World Bank World Development Report (2011) on
       conflict and fragile states also informed the design of this operation. It encouraged the
       team focus on selectivity, sequencing and harmonization of development partners active
       in the area of PFM, through the PFM working group chaired by the Bank.
       Internal policy notes on service delivery, mining, rural development, and public
       expenditure (2010) informed the design of the operation, particularly on PFM and the
       mining sector. The policy note on mining highlighted the limited Government take in the
       mining sector, thus providing the rationale for a review of big mining contracts. The
       analysis contained in the Bank`s EITI++ scoping mission report (2008) informed the
       authorities` decision to take a holistic approach to reforming the mining sector, in order
       to balance private sector investor needs, local and national development objectives,
       infrastructure constraints, as well as social and environmental considerations. This was
       reflected in the mining transparency road map supported by the present operation;
       The poverty analysis undertaken by the Bank in preparation of the Guinea Food Crisis
       Development Policy Grant (2008) and the Implementation, Completion and Result report
       on the Guinea Food Crisis Development Policy Grant of 2008 (2010) were used to better

       informed the analysis of the context of the present operation, including the historic nature
       of the window of opportunity provided by the first democratic presidential election in
       Guinea`s history.
Future operations will also benefit from a strengthening of the analytical basis, as
envisaged in the ISN. This would include AAA work to better understand the functioning of
Guinean society, especially in those areas which offer high potential for job creation and growth
opportunities.

51.   Development objectives. The proposed operation will facilitate the clearance of arrears
to IDA, which is required to restore normal relations between Guinea and the World Bank. It

directly supports two key priorities of the PRSP, sustain faster economic growth and create
income-earning and employment opportunities, particularly for the rural poor (pillar 1); and
improve governance and strengthen institutional and human capacity (pillar 3). It will also
contribute to improved access for the population to quality social services through its impact
on public financial management and civil service reform (pillar 2). Strengthening the core
functions and entities directly involved in the mobilization and management of public resources
and improving their resilience to political interferences will be critical for long -term good
governance and institutional development to take root and thrive. The proposed operation
focuses on three main policy areas: (i) strengthening public finance management, including
procurement; (ii) strengthening public sector efficiency and accountability, focusing on core
personnel management systems; and (iii) the mining sector, given the sector`s macroeconomic
importance. It will be complemented with a parallel technical assistance operation.

52.     Benefits. This single tranche IDA development policy operation will support the
consolidation of national reconciliation through building state capacity and strengthening
accountability. In addition, the funds provided will help to ensure that the authorities remain
current with their payment obligations and prevent the accumulation of new domestic and
external arrears. The operation will also be instrumental in helping the authorities conc lude and
successfully implement the envisaged RCF IMF program, and therefore pave the way towards
debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI.

53.     Operation design. The amount of the grant is estimated to be around US$78 million.
Upon approval of the grant and effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, and at the request of
the authorities, part of the proceeds of the grant would be disbursed for the replenishment of the
Government`s foreign currency assets used to clear arrears to IDA (US$77 million). In order to
ensure that the payment received from Guinea will cover any exchange rate fluctuations during
the arrears clearance operation, said payment will incorporate a 4.7 percent operating margin.
The remaining US$1 million equivalent, at the request of the Government, would be deposited in
a dedicated foreign currency account opened in the books of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Guinea. The final settlement of the arrears will be produced by the Bank at the earliest possible
date after arrears clearance and the final amount will be notified to the borrower. Any unused
margin will be deposited, at the request of the Government, into the dedicated account of the
borrower at the Central Bank.

54.    Prior actions. The World Bank, in coordination with other development partners, is
supporting government`s efforts to implement its economic governance reform program. Box 1
provides a summary of the prior actions already undertaken.

55.    Annex 3 summarizes the set of measures taken prior to Board presentation of this
operation and lays out possible follow-on measures. These measures are organized along
three broad policy areas: (i) public finance management, including procurement; (ii) public
sector efficiency and governance; and (iii) transparency in the mining sector. This section
presents recent performance, adopted measures, and main challenges ahead under each of these
broad areas.

Improving Public Financial Management, including Procurement

56.     Guinea's public financial management was poorly performing prior to December
2008, but aggregate fiscal discipline was broadly maintained. A PEFA assessment finalized
in July 2007 (see selected scores in Annex 4) showed that, overall, the performance of Guinea`s
public financial management system placed it in the bottom league of African countries9. Over
two-thirds of dimensions (20 out of 28) received a score of D or D+, while less than a fifth
scored a C and only three dimensions reached the best scores, B, B+ or A. Despite obvious and
pervasive weaknesses in the Guinean public financial management system, aggregate fiscal
discipline was broadly maintained: expenditure outturns remained in line with the approved
budget in the years up to 2007 (PI-1, on aggregate expenditure outturn compared to original
approved budget` scored A). The treasury also kept a reasonable degree of oversight over cash

in- and outflows, as evidenced by a score of B+ on PI-22, timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation`.

57.     Since December 2008 however, aggregate budget discipline has collapsed. Despite
flat domestic revenues and a drop in external funding, total government expenditures nearly
doubled between 2008 and 2010, from 17.5 to 29.6 per cent of GDP. Two main factors account
for this massive fiscal expansion. The civil service payroll went from 4.1 to 5.4 per cent of GDP
over the same period, as a result of recruitments, pay increases and promotions. The full-year
impact of decisions taken in 2010 is set to result in a further increase of the payroll to about 6.9
percent of GDP in 2011. This issue is dealt with under the next section, which addresses public
sector efficiency and governance. However, the predominant cause of the collapse of budget
discipline was that, following the military coup, the executive set aside regular controls over
budget commitments in order to enter into hundreds of mostly single-source multi-year contracts.
An audit undertaken with Bank support indicates that the contracts signed in 2008 and 2009 were
worth about US$2.2 billion. About 45 per cent of these benefited the defense sector, for example
for the construction of military barracks in cities and the purchase of military equipment an d
vehicles. The remainder pertained to sectors such as road construction and vehicle purchases (the
team estimated that over 900 vehicles were purchased in 2010 alone).

58.     The strategy of the authorities is to first reestablish basic controls over public
finances, by enforcing compliance with existing rules and regulations, before engaging in a
comprehensive reform of public financial management. Guinea adopted a comprehensive
public financial management reform strategy, developed with IMF assistance, in July 2008. The
related action plan is ambitious ­ it contains 115 actions that cover all the phases of the budget
cycle. Its implementation had not started by the time political instability shifted the authorities`
attention to other priorities. Given Guinea`s limited capacity, its implementation will take time; it
will also be dependent on the mobilization of significant technical assistance. In the short run, it
is therefore essential for the authorities to restore fiscal discipline on the basis of existing laws,
regulations and systems, before turning their attention to a more comprehensive public financial
management reform agenda. The government has identified four key priorities for this first
stabilization phase, which pertain to contingent liabilities, commitment controls, control of cash
movements and the stimulation of domestic resource mobilization.

Restore basic fiscal discipline and transparency

59.     The first priority of the authorities was to find out the full extent of the contingent
liability created by these contracts and reduce the impact of their execution on the budget.
With the assistance of independent public financial management, legal and procurement experts
financed by the World Bank, the authorities have audited 82 contracts (out of 617) covering 75
percent of the total value of contracts signed in 2009 and 2010 10. The audit has concluded that

10
   Additionally, the executive has also drafted contracts worth an additional US$3.6 billion, wh ich were not
approved by the Minister of Finance and were thus legally invalid. Despite this, a proportion of these contracts may
have been partly executed, at the request of line ministries. The new authorities have decided not to honor these
contracts, in order to mark a break with these practices of fait accompli`. The associated risk of contingent
liabilities is uncertain but probably low in the short term, as (i) the suppliers involved tend to be the same as the
beneficiaries of signed contracts, and they typically required the payment of advances before starting the execution,
whereas advances were not paid without signed contracts; (ii) on-site verification of the physical execution of the


                                                        - 22 -
none of the contracts complied with procurement rules and regulations. The contracts contained
clauses that were detrimental to the State`s interests and were often concluded on the basis of
poor or inexistent specifications. In 79 out of 82 cases, contracts were single­sourced, to the
benefit of a very limited set of suppliers (eg. 75 per cent of 2010 contracts by amount went to
four suppliers). The visit of 30 construction sites indicate that in most cases, works were not well
advanced (or not compliant with the specifications) in spite of substantial advance payments
(routinely 30 per cent of total price, sometimes more). The audit also uncovered evi dence of
massive over-pricing and double billing, as well as prima facie indications of misappropriation
of public assets, including luxury vehicles. This provides a strong basis for the termination of all
these contracts: in cases where the implementation has not started, the contracts would be
cancelled outright; in cases where the implementation has started, the contracts would also be
cancelled, but, depending on actual progress, either a negotiation with the supplier would be
initiated, in order to bring prices down, better define the specifications and implementation
schedule, or the contract would be put out to competitive bidding. The transmission to the
President of an audit report on the legality, transparency and budgetary effect of single source
contracts entered into in 2009 and 2010 is a prior action of the present operation.

60.      Second, in order to prevent a recurrence of this breakdown in aggregate fiscal
discipline, the authorities will commit to strict compliance with existing limits on the use of
unorthodox budget execution procedures and exceptions to competitive bidding. Beyond
undertaking an audit of these contracts, the authorities are keen to identify and address the root
causes of this breakdown in controls. These contracts were entered into even though they did not
comply with basic rules on public expenditure, including procurement regulations. This was
possible because the executive by-passed regular commitment controls (payment vouchers
/`mandats de paiement`), and instead used exceptional execution procedures (such as lettres de
guaranties`, autorisations de paiement` or even petty cash payments régie d'avance`). The use
of these procedures, beyond the strictly defined exceptions for which they were initially
designed, allowed the executive to bypass the a priori review of spending commitments by
financial controllers, in charge of checking compliance with rules and regulations, as well as the
availability of budgeted funds. In other cases, although regular budget execution procedures were
used, financial controllers, who report to the Minister of Finance, were either unwilling or unable
to oppose the contractual decisions made by the military rulers. Another factor was that, in a
letter issued on 4 June 2009, the Minister of Finance authorized the ministry of Defense to
bypass all procurement rules and use the single source method by default. Although this simple
letter was clearly illegal, as it contradicted the legal provisions of the procurement code, it was
used to justify the generalize use of single source procurement. As an immediate measure to
prevent the recurrence of uncontrolled commitments, the Minister of Finance will issue
regulatory orders limiting strictly the use of exceptional budget execution procedures as well
as exceptions to competitive bidding for procurement and imposing sanctions for their misuse
(prior action for the present operation). The enforcement of this measure will be monitored by
the Treasury Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister. This Committee has regained sole



signed contracts has shown that progress ranged from non-existent to limited, and it is highly unlikely that it would
be any greater for the unsigned contracts, which would limit any basis for compensation; (iii) the suppliers who did
pre-finance the execution of these contracts would need to go to the courts in order to obtain reparation from the
State, which would be a long and uncertain process.

authority to authorize payments from the Treasury accounts in December 2010, and clears the
processing of each payment voucher on the basis of available cash.

61.     Third, the restoration of aggregate fiscal discipline requires a better control of the
Treasury over cash flows of ministries, departments and agencies. Before the December
2008 coup, the fragmentation of government bank accounts was an issue that had been identified
by several IMF missions as well as the 2007 PEFA report. In September 2007, the Central Bank
had 478 Treasury sub-accounts on its books, while 2,871 government accounts were held in
commercial banks, most of which seemed to be related to externally funded projects. This
fragmentation resulted in inefficient cash management, created risks of fraud and corruption and
complicated the accounts reconciliation process. However, all these accounts were known and, in
theory at least, be monitored by the Treasury. A few of them were shut down between September
2007 and December 2008. Since the military coup however, several line ministries and
government entities have opened bank accounts in commercial banks, without the authorization
or even the knowledge of the Treasury. The ultimate objective of the Treasury is to implement a
single treasury account, allowing for proper cash management and better control of fiduciary
risks. The start of the implementation of a single treasury account is a prior action of this
operation, as evidenced by the conduct of a comprehensive census of all bank accounts held by
public sector entities in commercial banks. This would be followed by the closure of all non-
project related accounts held in commercial banks, and the streamlining of treasury accounts held
at the Central Bank through the setting-up of a system of Treasury Correspondents.

62.     The authorities are keen to improve budget transparency and have undertaken to
make the 2011 budget publicly available. Guinea scored a C on the PEFA indicator related to
budget transparency, PI-10, in the 2007 PEFA assessment. Before the 2008 coup, the annual
budget bill was sent to the press, but it was not directly available to the public or published on a
Government website. Following the events of December 2008, the budget document lost a lot of
significance, as Parliament was suspended and the budget could be approved and modified by
executive order. There was very little transparency of budget procedures and key budge t
decisions. The new authorities are keen to break with this past ­ they have opened their books
and cooperated fully with the professional international auditors financed by the Bank for the
audit of the single source contracts signed in 2009 and 2010. They have also committed to
publish the 2011 budget law on a government website, in order to further entrench their
commitment to transparency. Although this is not a prior action for the present operation, the
fulfillment of this commitment will be monitored as part of its supervision.

Renovate the foundations of the public financial management system

63.     Once control has been restored over basic budget discipline, the authorities will be
in a position to start improving the overall performance of the public financial
management system. This will require a systematic and progressive approach that builds on
early successes, takes due consideration of change management and prioritizes critical reforms.
The following five issues stand out as key areas to be monitored for a possible future operation.

64.   The basic legal framework for public financial management is incoherent, outdated
and inconsistent with the reforms initiated by the authorities. The 1991 Public Financial
Management Framework Act (loi organique relative aux lois de finances`) and 2000 Statutory


                                               - 24 -
Order on Public Accounting (règlement general sur la comptabilité publique`) are based on
their French equivalent of 1959 and 1962, respectively. These statutes are neither coherent
internally nor fully consistent with each other. Besides, the authorities have undertaken a number
of reforms since then, such as the devolution of budget authority to line ministries, which were
not provided for in the statute. The case for a revision of the Guinean legal framework is also
strengthened by the influence of neighboring countries. In June 2009, West African Economic
and Monetary Union member states (including four of Guinea`s neighbors, Guinea Bissau, Cote
d`Ivoire, Mali and Senegal) have adopted a series of public financial management directives
which introduce medium term expenditure frameworks, accrual accounting, program budgeting,
risk based auditing and devolve budget authority to line ministries, inter alia. Although Guinea
would need to take a careful look at which, if any, of these innovations would be appropriate to
its particular context, there is no doubt that these developments will influence its approach. The
revision of Guinea's basic public financial management legal framework will be a key area to be
monitored.

65.      Long-standing loopholes in procurement laws need to be addressed. Weaknesses in
the procurement laws and regulations have played a significant role in the fiscal slippages of
2009 and 2010. The 1997 Procurement Act (article 27 of the Code des Marchés Publics` on
single source contracts) provides for a list of ten possible exceptions to competitive bidding,
which are loosely drafted and subject to abuse. This is only one of the significant weaknesses of
the existing Procurement Act, which is not consistent with international practice as fully detailed
in the model legal framework for procurement agreed with the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (i.e. regional directives on public procurement 11). All WAEMU member
countries which border Guinea have recently passed new national procurement legislation to
conform with the regional directives. The authorities in Guinea have already produced a revised
Draft Procurement Bill which is aligned with the regional procurement directives, under a World
Bank IDF Grant. The submission to Parliament of the revised Procurement Bill would be a key
area to be monitored. This policy action would need to be accompanied by capacity building to
reach conformity with the new legal framework and allow the implementation of the new
institutional structures.

66.     The authorities need to stimulate domestic resource mobilization. Total tax revenues
have been flat since 2008, at around 16 per cent of GDP. There are three main reasons for this: a
2005-2007 Bank financed review of the mining tax regime has showed that it is excessively
favorable to investors; the size of the informal economy and the multiplication of ad hoc tax
exemptions (especially on fuel) and have narrowed the non-mining tax basis; and tax
administration is plagued by poor governance and low effectiveness. The mining tax regime
cannot be altered immediately, as the authorities first need to take stock of existing contracts and
concessions, as well as of the options available to them. They may also want to consult with the
private mining sector industries. They have therefore decided to act immediately on three fronts:
(i) one of the last decisions the transition government took in December 2010 was to increase the
administered price of fuel, by bringing it in line with world prices, drawing an estimated 2.3 per
cent of GDP in additional revenues; further increases are contemplated for 2011, in order to
reflect movements in world prices and the depreciation of the Guinean Franc; (ii) in parallel, the

   Directive N°05/2005/CM/UEMOA; Portant contrôle et régulation et des marchés publics et des délégations de
service public dans l`UEMOA.


                                                   - 25 -
authorities are working to improve the quality of tax administration by changing the incentives
structure of tax and customs senior management, through performance contracts that would
contain revenue generating targets, against which the performance, retribution and job tenure of
these officials would be judged; (iii) the authorities have also identified revenues currently
collected and managed non-transparently by autonomous public bodies, which will be redirected
towards the Treasury in order to be managed in full transparency. Progress in domestic resource
mobilization would be a key area to be monitored.

67.     The authorities need to clear the backlog of six years of unpublished financial
statements. Reporting financial information is the bedrock of public transparency and
accountability. The last publicly available financial statements that have been approved by
Parliament in an Accountability Act (Loi de réglement) date from 2004. The draft financial
statements and Accountability Bill for 2005 and 2006 have been prepared by the Ministry of
Finance in 2008, but were not submitted to Parliament following the military coup. For the years
2007 to 2009, the Treasury has issued trial balances (`Balances Générales du Trésor'), but has
been unable to produce financial statements (Compte Général des Administrations Financières')
as these balances include very significant amounts parked in suspense accounts. This is the direct
consequence of the use of exceptional budget execution procedures, when direct debit orders
were made to the Central Bank without making the corresponding budget and accounting entries
in the books of the Budget manager (ordonnateur') and the Treasury. AfDB and the
IMF/AFRITAC have expressed their intention to support this area. Progress in the production
and submission of financial statements for the years 2005 to 2010 would be a key area to be
monitored.

68.     The internal oversight system needs to be granted greater independence, coherence
and capacity to perform its advisory, audit and investigative roles. The Ministry of
Economic Oversight and Audits is in charge of the internal oversight system, which includes the
General State Inspectorate, the General Finance Inspectorate and sector Inspectorates, which
report respectively to the Presidency, the Minister of Finance and individual line Ministers. All
Inspectorates are plagued by similar structural weaknesses: they have no financial or operational
autonomy, and depend on the goodwill of the executive to exercise their missions (for instance,
provincial Finance Inspectors have to request the authorization of Governors in order to go on
mission, and audited entities are systematically forewarned of upcoming audits); the
independence of their staff is not protected by their terms and conditions, and they can be
removed at will by the executive; their reports are secret, sent exclusively to the reporting
authority and not shared among internal oversight entities; they do not distinguish clearly
between advisory, audit and investigative work; their staff is mostly unfamiliar with modern
audit techniques. The internal oversight system needs to be profoundly renovated to clarify its
missions, increase its operational and financial independence, develop the capacity of its audit
staff and improve its overall coherence through the introduction of a risk based approach. The
Guinea Economic Recovery TA project would support this objective. Progress towards a more
independent, capable and coherent internal oversight system would be a key area to be
monitored.

69.    External oversight has never really existed beyond formal appearances and needs to
be built-up from a low base. An Accounts Chamber of the Supreme Court was created by law



                                              - 26 -
in 199112. Its mandate, organization and procedures were supposed to be determined by
statutory order, but this never happened. Two draft statutory orders on the terms and conditions
of staff and the organization of the Chamber were approved by Cabinet, under pressure from
donors, and submitted to the President in 2006, but they were never signed. Although eight
financial judges were appointed, they had little competency and received no guidance on how to
undertake their duties. The Chamber has never judged an account, or produced an annual report
to the President on its main findings, (as per article 131 of Law 91/108 of 23 December 1991,
which does not provide for its publication). The Chamber did produce two reports to Parliament
on the financial statements for 2003 and 2004, in 2006 ­ it could not continue this task, in the
absence of transmission of subsequent financial statements. The interim Constitution adopted on
19 April 2010 provides for the creation of an independent Court of Accounts (article 116). Its
composition, organization and procedures must be determined by a Framework Act (`loi
organique'). Beyond formal aspects, a significant capacity building program is needed in order
for the Court to start exercising its mandate. This area would be supported by the Economic
Governance TA project, as well as the EU and AfDB. Progress towards the adoption of a
Framework Act on the composition, organization and procedures of the Court of Accounts would
be a key area to be monitored.

Strengthening public sector efficiency and accountability

70.     The combination of large civil service recruitments and repeated pay rises has
resulted in a fiscally unsustainable growth of the public sector wage bill. Although accurate
and reliable civilian and military personnel numbers are difficult to obtain, there is no doubt that
the total payroll nearly doubled in proportion of GDP since 2007. The number of civil servants
officially on the government payroll more than doubled, from 51,000 in 2000 to 124,000 in
2010. These figures exclude the military, which is estimated at anything between 45,000 and
75,000 personnel. In proportion to the overall population, Guinea has one of the highest civil and
military contingents in Africa ­ second after Ghana. The wage structure has been affected by two
conflicting trends. On the one hand, the integration into the civil service of about 15,000 low
level temporary contract workers, mainly in the education and security sectors, has brought the
average monthly wage down. On the other hand, a 50 per cent pay raise for all civilian and
military personnel, combined with mass promotions in the armed forces and improvements of
terms and conditions in the army and the judiciary pushed average wages up. The combination of
these two trends means that the wage bill rose from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 5.8 percent in
2010, capturing a growing part of Government revenue, see Chart 4.2.

71.     Beyond its fiscal impact, this breakdown in controls over the public payroll is
indicative of deeply entrenched governance issues. Although, in theory, Guinea`s rules and
policies should ensure that human resource decisions with financial implications follow due
process and do not exceed available resources, in practice these rules progressively fell into
disuse and were no longer applied following the December 2008 coup. Recruitments were not
competitive but based on ministerial or trade union recommendations, and sometimes made
without even obtaining basic identification from applicants, let alone original diplomas. The civil
service database and the Ministry of Finance payroll are not interfaced and exhibit multiple
inconsistencies. Controls over attendance are absent or ineffective. This breakdown in fiduciary
controls over the payroll opened the door for massive frauds, which took the form of double -
dipping, ghost workers and benefit gouging. Civil servants reaching the pensionable age of 65
continued to remain on the payroll indefinitely. Despite multiple attempts at improving the
situation general or sector-specific censuses of civil servants (in 1990 and 2005 for general
census, and in 2008, for the education sector), the authorities never had the political will to stop
paying undue salaries and benefits and put an end to this deeply-entrenched patronage system.
The quality of public service delivery has been strongly affected by this dismal performance of
the civil service.

72.     The incoming government is determined to make a clean break with the past in the
management of the civil service and the military. Pdt Alpha Condé has made it clear that he
intends to put an end to the patronage system and work to create a modern, efficient civil service.
The authorities` strategy mirrors their approach to public financial management. They will take
immediate measures to stop the rise in the wage bill, combat fraud and signal a new approach to
governance in the civil service. This will create the space needed to reallocate human resources
in line with development priorities, strengthen controls over the payroll, and eventually start
recruiting again to fill skills gaps.

Reinstating basic controls over the civil service payroll

73.     The immediate priority of the authorities is to freeze additional recruitments into
the civil service and the military, in order to put the public sector payroll on a more
sustainable fiscal path. The massive recruitment drive undertaken since 2007 accounts for a
significant part of the increase in the payroll. The authorities recognize that the civil service and
the military hold multiple pockets of under-employed or unemployed staff, and that they should
endeavor to use all existing recruits to the best of their abilities before recruiting more staff.
Authorities also acknowledge that the existing HIPC trigger which compels Guinea to recruit
1,500 primary school teachers per year has lost its policy relevance, given the unanticipated
delays in reaching completion point since it was defined in 2000. However, they indicated that
the achievement of the HIPC trigger on prenatal consultations for pregnant women would require
a number of recruitments in the health sector. In view of this requirement, as well as social and
trade union pressures to follow-through on campaign commitments for recruitments in the non-
primary education sector, the authorities have decided to impose a six-month freeze on all new
recruitments, except in the health and education sector as well as for specific personnel in the
justice sector This covers the case of a limited number of individuals who succeeded at a
competitive exam for the recruitment into the prison service in 2010 but have yet to be
incorporated into the civil service. For sectors excluded from the freeze, recruitments will be
capped at around 4,900 staff, or 1,200 people above the natural attrition of about 3,700 staff.


                                               - 29 -
Therefore, a temporary freeze on all public sector hiring, except in the education and health
sectors as well as for specific personnel in the justice sector is a prior action supported by this
operation. Given past practices in this area, it will be important to monitor the strict
implementation of this decision.

74.     The determination of the authorities to improve the governance of the civil service
will be measured by the actions they will take when faced with compelling evidence of
fraud. During 2010, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Civil Service have worked
at identifying duplicate payments to individuals claiming two full-time civil service salaries
simultaneously. In a preliminary phase, over 2,000 duplicates have been identified. Once
verifications have been made to check that they are genuine duplicates, their salaries could be
blocked. In a further 1,875 cases, civil servants who have reached the pensionable age of 65 in
2010 were not struck from the payroll, in breach of the Civil Service Code. A third set of
recurrent cases concerns senior civil servants who once held management positions associated
with significant bonuses, and continue to receive that bonus after they have left the said
positions. Blocking the wages of the individuals claiming two civil service salaries
simultaneously ("double-dippers") and the civil servants over 65 who remain on the
Government payroll is a prior action supported by the present operation.

Building the foundations of a more effective civil service

75.     Once control over civil service recruitments has been restored, and a start has been
made in reducing the size of the payroll, the authorities can start implementing the reforms
needed to strengthen fiduciary controls over the payroll and increase the responsiveness of
the civil service to government priorities. This will require strong determination on the part of
political authorities, a progressive and coordinated approach. The following three issues stand
out as key areas to be monitored.

76.     Although a new civil service census is called for, it needs to be associated with a
simultaneous investment in human resources and payroll applications in order for its
effects to be sustainable. Past census operations did not result in sustainable improvements in
the management of the civil service for four main reasons: the poor quality of the Guinean civil
registry meant that proofs of identity could easily be falsified; the integrity of the human
resources database that was created through the census was not protected from fraudulent
alterations; the scope of the census was not comprehensive, as it included neither the military,
nor the education sector; and the interface between the civil service database and the payroll did
not work. The authorities have already started procuring an interface between the payroll and
civil service database. They are in discussions with external partners regarding the introduction
of biometric identity cards for both the civil service and the armed forces, the financing of a
public sector wide census, including the security sector. Appropriate logical and physical
security would be introduced to ensure the integrity of the databases. Progress towards the
national biometric census and the interfacing of civil service databases and payroll applications
would be a key area to be monitored.

77.     The institutions in charge of human resources management should be strengthened
to ensure that due process is followed at all stages of the civil service career path. The
principle of competitive recruitment would need to be reaffirmed in practice as soon as the


                                               - 30 -
recruitment freeze is lifted, and before then for the education sector. The formal process needed
to obtain Ministry of Finance sign-off on all human resources decisions with a financial
incidence should be clearly defined and scrupulously followed. IT applications would need to be
adapted to ensure that position specific bonuses could not be carried over from one position to
another. A particular focus would need to be put on attendance verification, with simple,
effective and well publicized procedures to be followed in order to block the salaries of absentee
staff. Third party monitoring, on the model set-up for the education census of 2008 with parent
teacher associations, should be developed in all sectors where the public interacts with civil
servants in charge of service delivery. Progress on competitive recruitment, attendance
verification and Ministry of Finance clearance of human resource actions with a financial
incidence would be a key area to be monitored.

78.     The current make-up and location of the civil service does not meet the priority
service delivery needs of the Guinean population. The government has started a process of
comprehensive functional review of ministries and departments in order to clarify their mandates
and identifies their staffing needs. The next step would be for the authorities to define the
budgeted positions needed for each mission of each entity (cadres organiques`), and to start a
process of rebalancing staff according to government priorities. One key issue will be to find
appropriate modalities to encourage, or force a greater proportion of civil service staff to leave
the capital city, Conakry, which holds more than 70 per cent of the civil service, and serve
instead in the provinces. Another key issue would be the balance between civilian and military
personnel, or, seen from another angle, the possibilities for redeploying military units for civilian
tasks, as provided for under the President`s 100 days plan. Progress towards the matching of
public sector human resources with priority service delivery objectives of the government would
be a key area to be monitored.

Fostering transparency in the mining sector

79.     Guinea's mining and petroleum potential is one of the highest in Africa, with some
of the largest global resources of bauxite and iron ore, sizable gold and diamond deposits
and potential for metals, as well oil and gas exploitation. There are three main sources to
Guinea`s mining potential. The Western bauxite corridor, around Boke/Sangaredi (see map 1
below), holds the largest and highest grade bauxite deposits in the world. This area is where
Guinea`s three bauxite and alumina producers currently operate. The largest of these producers,
the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (or CBG), is 49 per cent owned by the State. This area is
attracting the largest global players in the aluminum sector, who have announced investment
plans amounting to US$ 9 billion in total, at various stages of readiness. The iron ore Eastern
corridor, around Nzereklore/Nimba, includes the world class iron ore deposit of Mont Nimba and
the Simandou iron ore deposit, which is currently the largest non developed iron ore deposit in
the world. The industry`s major players (Rio Tinto/Chinalco, Vale, BHP Billiton, Bellzon) hold
exploration and/or exploitation licenses in the area and have undertaken feasibility studies. The
magnitude of the investment contemplated is in the order of US$5 billion for the mining
component and US$6 billion for the transportation aspect (railway and deep sea port). Other
significant natural resources exploitation potential include several hundreds of tons of gold
reserves, currently mined by three companies producing about 15 tons per year, several million
carats of diamonds, mostly exploited by artisanal miners, as well as uranium, nickel, calcium and



                                               - 31 -
granite potential. Guinea also has significant hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation potential
in the Gulf of Guinea.

80.     Although extractive industries have been a significant feature of the Guinean
economy since the 1950es, their contribution to GDP growth, government revenues and
poverty reduction have not been commensurate with this potential. Even before the advent
of independence, one of the first alumina plants in Africa was developed in Fria in 1957.
However, today only six sizable industrial mining companies are operating in the country (three
in the aluminum sector and three in the gold sector). The sector accounts for more than 90 per
cent of exports, but only 20 per cent of GDP and a quarter of government revenues. At current
production capacity, it would take about 2,000 years to deplete bauxite reserves. Although
government mining revenues have more than doubled since 2004, from US$80 to about 170
million13, they still only account for about 15.6 per cent of total mining export revenues. Over
90 per cent of mining related government revenues come from two companies (CBG and SAG);
the other four companies yield tax rates of between 3 and 5 per cent of their gross sales, far

13
  The main cause for this increase is the fact that the Société Aurifère de Guinée, controlled by Anglo-Gold-
Ashanti, has become profitable and started paying a profit tax of US$ 22 million in 2009 and [50] million in 2010.


                                                     - 32 -
below the international average of 15 per cent. This matters greatly because mining is a very
capital intensive activity that, as a result, does not create a lot of jobs ­ it is estimated that
industrial mining only employs about 10,000 people in Guinea. Therefore, the main channel for
Guineans to be compensated for the loss of non-renewable assets that mining provokes is
through taxation and pro-poor spending. Yet, weaknesses in the mining legal framework and its
implementation have limited the resources available for government expenditures. To make
matters worse, poorly performing public financial management institutions have reduced the
proportion of government spending that was put to productive and pro-poor use.

81.     The recent boom in commodity prices has seen an unprecedented surge in interest
for Guinea's mineral assets, but the poor governance of the sector has resulted in deals that
were probably not in the country's best interests. The global boom in commodity prices has
increased the incentive for investment both in known but idle mining reserves and in the
exploration of undiscovered mineral and hydrocarbon resources. As a result, Guinea has
approved more exploration and exploitation licenses during the 18 months period leading up to
Pdt Condé`s election than during the preceding ten years. As an indication of the buoyancy of
this trend, the income the mining cadastre derived from licenses went from less than US$200,000
in 2008 to close to US$ 6.7 million in 2010. However, this was also a period of great political
instability and poor governance, during which a number of large-scale deals were announced.
The largest and least transparent of these deals involved China International Fund (CIF), Ltd
which reportedly acquired bauxite, iron ore, gold and diamond concessions valued at US$7



                                                 - 33 -
billion in exchange for the provision of a series of transport and energy infrastructures 14. The
exact modalities of this deal, which may have involved the granting of guarantees, privileges and
monopolies to CIF, possibly in exchange for a signing bonus, are unknown to the international
community. However, the complexity of the relative valuation of the mining and infrastructure
assets, the disproportion in the respective technical capacity of the authorities and their partner
and the troubled political situation that prevailed at the time all point to the high likelihood that
this deal was not in the best long term interests of Guinea.

82.     The combination of the advent of democracy and the current boom in commodity
prices creates a unique window of opportunity to harness Guinea's exceptional natural
resources endowment for an inclusive, long­term prosperity. However, in order to create the
conditions needed for such a transformation of its economy to take place, it is first necessary for
Guinea to clarify the status of the process of renegotiation of existing contracts initiated in 2007,
but never completed. Once the government has convinced the market of the credibility of its long
term stance in relation to natural resources investors, it could start building the foundations of an
attractive and mutually profitable partnership in the sector. The key would be to send the right
signals to the market, the civil service and civil society in the early days of this administration.
This would increase the credibility of the authorities` commitment to a stable extractive industry
regime, and thus increase the likelihood of an equilibrium characterized on the one hand by high
levels of private investment and private profits, and on the other hand by high social rewards
trough taxation, business linkages, infrastructure benefits, local community development and
redistribution of extractive industry profit.

Coming to closure on the review of existing mining contracts

83.      The extractive industry legal regime has been affected by a high level of uncertainty
since the 1990s, and these ambiguities got worse as the governance of the country
deteriorated. The implementation of the 1995 Mining code was hampered by the non-adoption
of the set of statutory orders (décrets d'application`) provided for in this Act. Mining
concessions routinely contain provisions that are more favorable to the industry than the Mining
code, such as mining taxes below the 5 per cent of turnover threshold, exorbitant tax exemption
periods and ad hoc depreciation methods. In the case of the bauxite value-chain, manipulation of
transfer pricing is a serious concern, as vertically integrated companies are able to transfer profits
to entities located outside Guinea in order to minimize taxation on profit. The authorities are also
aware that the provisions of the code on exploration licenses freeze-up the use of mining assets
for excessive periods of time; that tax revenues are not commensurate with the export revenues
derived from mining; and that the benefits of mining to the local community are below
expectations. As a result, the government has been working since 2007 on a revision of the
Mining code, as well as a review of existing concessions theoretically managed by the Inter-
ministerial Committee on Renegotiation of Mining Contracts and Agreements (Comité
Interministériel de Renégociations des Conventions et Accords Miniers)15. However, this process

14
   These are reported to include the energy, water treatment, electricity, road, airline, habitat and aluminum mineral
extraction sectors. On a separate note, Vale, the world`s largest iron ore producer, also purchased a 51 per cent
stake in BSG Resources (Guinea) Ltd, which holds concessions in the Simandou iron ore deposit (blocks 1 and 2),
for US$2.5 billion in April 2010. Rio Tinto and Chinalco also signed a US$1.35 billion deal for the latter to acquire
a 44.6 per cent stake in the Simandou (blocks 3 and 4) project.

                                                       - 34 -
of renegotiation itself has been open-ended, non transparent, poorly defined in scope, marred by
conflicting lobbying efforts and affected by the prevailing political instability. As a result, the
level of uncertainty facing potential extractive industry investors has increased markedly,
without a corresponding increase in the government take on existing or new mining contracts.

84.     Despite the downsides of the existing contract renegotiation process, the new
authorities are under a political and moral imperative to review the contracts concluded
since the military coup of December 2008. From an ethical and governance point of view, the
case for a review, and, if warranted by whatever facts are uncovered, a renegotiation of the
exploration or exploitation agreements entered into over the years, and especially since the
military coup of December 2008, is strong. However, any default on existing legal commitments
carries a strong risk of deterring future investors, which needs to be taken into consideration ,
given the scale of investments the government intends to attract in the near future. In order to
strike the right balance between legitimate governance concerns and the need to protect investor
rights, any review of existing large mining contracts would need to comply with the following
principles: (i) avoid the pitfalls of the previous renegotiation process, by announcing a strictly
time-bound process that would be clearly defined in its focus and objectives, and transparent in
its modus operandi; and (ii) communicate clearly to the markets and civil society on the
objectives, rationale, process, time-bound and final nature of the reviews undertaken. This
operation supports the approval by the Council of Ministers and the public disclosure of a
mining transparency roadmap, including the due process that will be followed to revise the
mining code, consult stakeholders and undertake a review of large mining contracts. The
upcoming Guinea Recovery Technical Assistance project would help the authorities undertake
these reviews with due process, diligence and appropriate technical expertise.

Setting the foundations for inclusive, long-term growth in the mining sector

85.     Once the ambiguities surrounding the existing mining contracts review process have
been lifted, the government should make rapid progress in the adoption of a revised mining
and petroleum legal framework that would be consistently applied to future deals. In the
case of mining, this would involve finalizing the revision of the 1995 mining code, issuing
relevant statutory orders and publishing standard mining exploration and exploitation contracts.
In the case of oil and gas, this process would involve the finalization of the new petroleum code,
as well as associated statutory orders and standard contracts. In both cases, work on these codes
was ongoing at the time of the coup, with World Bank and IFC support and the authorities
continued to work on these projects without outside external assistance following the coup. They
would therefore like to submit the resulting draft documents to an outside expertise, before
starting on the process of political consensus building needed for their eventual approval. More
generally, it will be difficult for Guinea to make progress in the implementation of these new
legal frameworks without substantial technical assistance in the area of tax assessment and
collection, mining sector companies financial statement audit, health, safety and environmental
compliance. Progress in the revision of the mining and petroleum legal framework would be a
key area to be monitored.

86.    Transport and energy infrastructures are a key bottleneck for future extractive
industry investments that needs to be lifted through careful spatial planning, cooperation
between mining companies and innovative financing solutions. Although the export revenues


                                              - 35 -
that could potentially be derived from the exploitation of the Eastern Iron Ore corridor could be
in the order of US$4 billion per annum, no exploitation is possible unless a solution can be found
to build a railway line leading to a deep-sea port. The preferred route of the Guinean authorities,
which crosses the country from East to West, is estimated to cost about US$6 billion and is yet to
be financed. Similarly, there are a number of mining companies who have expressed strong
interest in building alumina refineries or even a smelter in Guinea, but these projects, which
would contribute to increasing the value-added of extractive industry chain, are doomed unless
appropriate energy and transport solutions can be identified, financed and built. The difficulty
however is that, in the absence of state funding for the national infrastructure projects needed for
these projects to become viable, mining companies have a built-in incentive to envisage enclave
project solutions, where they finance these infrastructures but restrict their use to the exclusive
needs of their individual projects. However, this default solution can be sub-optimal both in
terms of spatial planning and economic use of these assets, which need to perform at maxim. The
alternative however requires coordination and cooperation between competing mining
companies located in neighboring locations within mining corridors. State intervention, with the
support of external parties like the World Bank group, could create the conditions needed for this
kind of cooperative and mutually beneficial arrangement to be designed and enforced. Progress
in the design, financing and authorization of transport and energy solutions for the Western and
Eastern mining corridors would be a key area to be monitored.

87.     The governance of the extractive industries sector needs to be profoundly renovated
for it to become a source of sustainable and inclusive growth. Although Guinea has
subscribed to both the EITI16 and the Kimberley process, it has yet to publish an audit of
extractive revenues. Significant progress will be needed towards greater transparency both of
mineral resources, through the updating and publication of a modern mining cadastre, and of
extractive revenues, in the EITI context. The sustainability of mining activities in the country
will also depend on relationships of the mining companies with the local communities affected
by their operations. At the moment, the direct provision of energy, health and water services to
local communities is a widespread modality, even though mining companies do not tend to have
a comparative advantage in these areas. This is due to the inability of the Guinean state to define
a fair and reasonable regime of local taxation and public service provision that would provide the
companies with a social license to operate` in a more efficient way. Beyond the communities
directly affected by mining, there is a strong case for the government to intervene in the planning
of growth poles that would link mining activities with downstream value creation through local
business linkages. Artisanal mining is also an area where state intervention should help formalize
operations, thus bringing in more tax revenue, and improving the environmental sustainability of
mining practices. In all these areas, technical assistance would be provided through the Guinea
Recovery Technical Assistance Project. Progress in the transparency and sustainability of
mining activities, (through the publication of an updated mining cadastre and an audited
extractive revenues report, the definition of a local community development regime, the
identification of mining related growth poles and the formalization of artisanal mining) would be
a key area to be monitored.

  Guinea was suspended from the EITI process at its request for a period of one year starting on 19 December 2009,
thus becoming an EITI candidate country ­ suspended`. Its position since the end of this one-year period is unclear.
Delays and inefficiencies at the EITI secretariat were an issue prior to the 2008 coup .

88.      A prudent long term fiscal policy, combined with a strong push on agricultural
productivity would be needed to mitigate the risks of Dutch disease. Extractive industries
could provide macro-economically very significant revenues to Guinea provided the right policy
framework is reached. However, these revenues would be inherently cyclical, and they would be
obtained by depleting non-renewable natural resources. International experience indicates that, in
such a context, it is wise for the authorities to stabilize spending over time in order to avoid
periods of excessive consumption at the peak of the cycles which would not be sustainable in the
downturns. The non-renewable nature of mineral resources also pleads for some degree of inter-
generational saving on grounds of equity. The amount that should be saved every year depends
on the level of the sustainable non-extractive fiscal deficit, which can be approximated using the
permanent income hypothesis. Guinea should work on identifying this level, taking due
consideration to its investment needs in human infrastructure and capital, as well as its
absorptive capacity, while deepening the public financial management reforms that are needed to
increase the likelihood of a productive use of public funds. Beyond the risks associated with the
volatility and non-renewable nature of extractive resources, the authorities should also mitigate
the risk of the Dutch disease, or a long term appreciation of Guinea`s real exchange rate that
would be brought about by increased public and private spending. This real exchange rate
appreciation would make non-mining, and in particular agricultural exports less competitive. In
order to mitigate this risk, it would be advisable for the authorities to invest significant amounts
and public policy efforts in raising agricultural productivity. Progress in the definition of a
sustainable long term macro fiscal stance that would mitigate the risks associated with volatility
in extractive revenues, the non-renewable nature of mineral resources and real exchange rate
appreciation brought about by extractive industry-led growth would be key areas to be
monitored.
                        Box 4.2: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
 Principle 1 -- Reinforce ownership
 All the prior actions of this operation were taken from the action plan of the new Government, which was
 finalized in February 2011 under the leadership of the President.
 Principle 2 -- Agree in advance with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
 accountability framework.
 The operation was prepared in close coordination with IMF, AfDB and the EU. Prior actions retained in the
 proposed operation complements actions listed in the IMF MEFP and are the same than that of AfDB. PFM
 actions were also extracted from the PFM reform matrix which was adopted by the PFM sector working group
 comprising all Development Partners contributing to this sector.
 Principle 3 -- Balancing predictability and flexibility
 While the predictability of funds is strengthened by the plan to process two successive Development Policy
 Operations, flexibility was granted in terms of policy reform, given poor track records in terms of
 implementation and the uncertain overall environment by retaining a stand-alone approach (rather than a
 programmatic one).
 Principle 4 -- Streamlining critical actions for achieving results
 The proposed operation contains a very selected set of prior actions which are key to restore authorities control
 of the budget and foster transparency in the mining sector.
 Principle 5 -- Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financial support
 There was a clear understanding between authorities and the World Bank on the means of verification needed to
 consider prior actions as met.

                          5.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                           A.    POVERTY AND E NVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

89.     The rapid response provided by the proposed operation to the emergency situation
precludes in depth assessments of its poverty and environmental impacts, in line with OP
8.60. Nonetheless, the policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have
either positive or negative significant effects on the environment, forests and other natural
resources. The social impact of the operation is expected to be globally positive over the medium
term, although in the short run, some measures supported by the operation could have a limited
negative social impact.

90.    In the medium term, the measures supported by this operation are expected to have
a globally positive poverty and social impact. The strengthening of public financial
management is expected to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public resources in the
delivery of social and development services. The envisaged public sector reforms supported by
the operation do not consider any downsizing (but the elimination of illegal ghost workers and
double-dippers). More generally, through its impact on fiscal consolidation, these measures are
expected to contribute to containing inflation, against which poor and vulnerable households are
poorly protected.

91.     However, in the short term, some measures envisaged by the Government program,
not directly supported by the operation in the form of prior action, could have a social
impact. This possibly includes the reduction of petroleum subsidies, which could impact the
purchasing power of poor and vulnerable households, and encourage greater use of dirty energy.
In the face of it, the World Bank is currently undertaking Economic and Social Work, with a
view to identify (i) households` vulnerability to various shocks (also including fo od price
shocks) and (ii) interventions (from ongoing or new projects) to strengthen safety nets (public
works, fertilizers subsidies, school feeding, cash transfers, etc.). This analysis will inform the
design of the next Development Policy Operation planned in the later part of 2011. The change
in status of about 1,875 civil servants over the pensionable age of 65, who will stop receiving a
salary and start drawing a Government pension instead, will reduce their disposable income.
However, it is unlikely to result in an increase in absolute poverty levels, especially when levels
of personal savings accumulated over the duration of their careers are taken into consideration.

92.     The proposed operation focuses mostly on institutional reforms and is expected to
have limited environmental implications. The prior action related to the review of mining
contracts is not at this stage expected to have significant environmental implications. A more
detailed analysis of its impact will be useful when the outcome of the review will be known.
Although the hiring freeze in the public sector could theoretically impact the environmental
regulatory and enforcement capacity of the authorities, the authorities have a large pool of under-
employed or unemployed civil servants who have been recruited over the years, some of whom
hold high qualifications. If, during the supervision of this operation, there are indications that the
hiring freeze may affect the ability of these agencies to undertake their regulatory and
enforcement functions, the authorities could reallocate some of these idle civil servants to this
sector and train them accordingly.

                      B. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND E VALUATION

93.     The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Guinea will be responsible for
monitoring reforms, reporting progress and coordinating actions among other ministries
and entities, including at the island level. Guinea has a relatively weak national monitoring
system, but the World Bank is assisting the PRSP secretariat in order to develop its ability to
monitor progress in the implementation of the TPRSP. In the area of Public Financial
Management and Procurement, the authorities are committed to setting-up a reform coordination
unit, under the leadership of the Minister of Finance, that will be tasked with the follow-up and
monitoring of progress in the implementation of the measures contained in the PFM reform
matrix. In the area of Government audits, both the Ministry of Economic Oversight and Audits
and the Audit Committee in the Presidency are committed to ensuring an appropriate follow -up
of the work initiated with Bank support, and that would continue under the aegis of the proposed
Guinea Economic Recovery Technical Assistance project.

                                      C. FIDUCIARY A SPECTS

94.    Given the weak PFM environment, the authorities' commitment to a credible
program of PFM reform and evidence that improvements are occurring in a timely
manner will be critical to mitigate fiduciary risk. The Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) exercise, conducted in October 2007, confirmed the weakness of Guinea
PFM systems, with 22 out of 28 performance indicators rated D, five rated C and only one rated
A (namely, the indicator referring to aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original
approved budget). In September 2010, jointly with IMF, AfDB, UNDP and AFD, the Bank as
lead donor of the PFM technical group has developed a PFM policy note substantiated by a
matrix of reforms. The matrix aims at building the foundations for an acceptable PFM legal
framework and addressing insufficiencies occurred during the last two years. Adequate
implementation of this matrix of reforms with the support from donor community will be critical
and contribute to mitigate the fiduciary risk.

95.     The overall financial mechanisms of the Central Bank are believed to be relatively
sound, despite some weaknesses in the areas of compliance with statutory requirements.
The IMF completed its last Safeguard Assessment (SA) of the Central Bank in 2007 and
revealed vulnerabilities in the Central Bank safeguard framework; the external audit
arrangements were not effective and did not comply with international standards, the financial
statements were not based on a recognized accounting framework and were not published, and
internal controls in the area of reserves management and data reporting were deficient. The
assessment recommended measures to address these weaknesses including engagement of a
reputable external audit firm, adoption of international accounting standards, strengthening of
internal controls over accounting and reserves management, and publication of financial
statements. To this effect, the Central Bank has recruited through a competitive process a
reputable and international external audit firm since 2008 and has developed an action plan to
reinforce the internal control framework. Bank financial management staff has reviewed the
2008 and 2009 audit reports on the Central Bank`s financial statements and discussed it with the
IMF team. The audits carried out by the international audit firm include a clean opinion on the
financial statements. However without qualifying their opinion, the auditors draw the attention of
the Central Bank on disclaimers pertaining to (i) the debt situation of the Central B ank which is


                                              - 39 -
above the statutory ceiling; (ii) the lack of adherence with the statutory requirements in relation
with the temporary advances granted to the Public Treasury; (iii) and the deficiencies in the fixed
asset reconciliation process after the physical count performed in 2009. To address these
weaknesses, the Central Bank has started in 2010 a restructuring process which was hampered by
the transition period. However, with the re-engagement process, the Authorities are taking the
required steps to re-launch the reforms aiming at improving Central Bank governance and
reserves management.

                                 D. D ISBURSEMENT AND A UDITING

96.      The proposed grant will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. Funds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of
the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the grant is
approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of a single tranche of SDR49.6
million (US$78 million equivalent) will be divided into two parts. One part, amounting to
approximately US$77 million equivalent, will be disbursed for the replenishment of the
Government`s foreign exchange assets used to clear arrears to IDA, at the request of the
authorities. Another part, amounting to approximately US$1 million, will be deposited by IDA,
at the request of the Government, in a dedicated foreign currency account of the Borrower and
acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of Guinea. In order to ensure that the payment
received from Guinea will cover any exchange rate fluctuations during the arrears clearance
operation, said payment will incorporate a 4.7 percent operating margin. The final settlement of
the arrears will be produced by the Bank at the earliest possible date after arrears clearance and
the final amount will be notified to the borrower. Any unused margin will be deposited, at the
request of the Government, into the dedicated foreign currency account of the borrower at the
Central Bank. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposits of the grant into said account,
an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower`s budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. Given the fiduciary
risk at the Central Bank, the designated account will be subject to an audit by the external auditor
of the Central Bank, with the aim of verifying that the flow of funds between the Central Bank
and the Public Treasury are appropriate and in line with the Development Grant Agreement
provisions. If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Development Grant Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower, promptly upon notice from IDA,
to refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the
Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this grant will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Guinea.

                                  E. R ISKS AND R ISK MITIGATION

97.    The proposed operation comprises high interrelated risks, most of which cannot be
fully mitigated, namely:

       Macroeconomic risks. The prospects of a deterioration of Guinea`s macroeconomic
       performance, stemming from a deterioration in the external environment (increased fuel,
       food, and petroleum prices, against a stagnation of mining prices) or /and the
       materialization of important fiscal contingent liabilities, represent an important risk,


                                               - 40 -
   particularly if this causes a delay in the HIPC process. This macroeconomic risk would
   be mitigated by close monitoring of the macroeconomic framework elaborated by the
   Government jointly with the IMF and the World Bank, and an acceleration of the HIPC
   timetable, provided that overall performance is fully satisfactory on the part of the
   Government. There is also a risk of falling back into arrears with all creditors, given the
   scale of the outstanding debt. This risk is mitigated by the provision of IDA budget
   support through the proposed operation , which, combined with the IMF RCF, will serve
   as a catalyst for external support from other Development Partners. Future IDA
   assistance expected in FY12 to support Government`s reform program will ensure that
   overall IDA flows will remain positive.

   Security risks stemming from (i) insufficient progress in security sector reform; (ii)
   spillover effects from the ongoing crisis in Cote d`Ivoire (refugee flows); (iii) arms and
   drug trafficking; and (iv) conflicts over the allocation of extractive industries revenues.
   The mitigation of this risk requires a continued commitment of the UN and the
   international community to support the Government of Guinea in maintaining security.
   In collaboration with other Development Partners (United Nations and ECOWAS in
   particular, given their foreseen leadership in his area), the World Bank Economic
   Governance technical assistance project in preparation will contribute to integrate the
   reform of security services in the broader medium term fiscal framework, while
   improving public financial management practices in the military for greater reform
   effectiveness and efficiency.

   Fiduciary risks. Under this operation, the resources will be used indirectly to clear IDA
   arrears. Thus, fiduciary risk is ­ de facto - very limited. An audit of the flow of funds
   from IDA to the Treasury, via a dedicated account at the Central Bank, will be requested
   in order to mitigate risks associated with the weak safeguards environment at the Central
   Bank. However, there is a broader fiduciary risk from failure of the Government to make
   efficient use of the fiscal space made available by arrears clearance and budget support.
   This fiduciary risk stems from a poorly performing public financial management system;
   weak procurement practices and; multiple vested interests. The authorities` commitment
   to a credible program of PFM reform and evidence that improvements are occurring in a
   timely manner will be critical to mitigate fiduciary risks. The new government`s
   emerging track record in the first months of 2011 is encouraging, with the reinstatement
   of a Treasury committee chaired by the Prime Minister and full cooperation with World
   Bank financed auditors in charge of auditing the single source contracts committed to in
   2009 and 2010. The prior actions supported by this operation will also contribute to
   strengthen basic fiduciary controls in the critical areas of budget execution, cash
   management and public procurement. However, a residual fiduciary risk is related to the
   continued presence of vested interests and the time needed to entrench PFM reforms.

   Implementation risks stemming from poor capacity and coordination within the
   Government, which could stall progress in the reform agenda. The focus and limited
   ambition of the proposed operation on a limited set of key reforms/institutions will
   mitigate this risk, and will be complemented with direct technical assistance in similar
   fields (public financial management, public sector reform, and mining sector). The degree
   of coordination between Guinean institutions will also be improved by the demonstrated


                                          - 41 -
       strong ownership of the reform agenda by the President. Revived coordination between
       Development Partners will also facilitate the overall implementation of the reform
       agenda, the action plan in particular. The ownership of the reform agenda within the
       Government is strong, which could help mitigate the resistance to change of vested
       interests, including the security forces.

       Political economy risks stemming from insufficient results (against high expectations),
       deterioration of the security situation, and perception of corruption, which would all
       weaken the political feasibility of reforms. Support to a strong and meaningful Poverty
       Reduction Strategy participatory and consultative process, involving civil society groups,
       and to the strengthening of safety nets would mitigate these risks, in complement to the
       mitigation measures evoked above. By February 2011, this process had already started,
       through regional and national consultations, involving CSOs and the National Transition
       Council. Proactive communication through media (radios in particular), which proved
       very effective to contain tension during elections, will be pursued to manage population
       expectations. The upcoming parliamentary elections carry a risk of political
       fragmentation and reduction in the ownership of and commitment to reforms.

98.     In IDA's assessment, the potentially high benefits of the proposed operation
outweigh the high risks and warrant IDA`s assistance for implementing critical reforms and
policy actions in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation
actions to maximize the sustainability of the reform agenda.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy

Mr. President,

1. I have the honor to transmit to you the Letter of Development Policy from the Government of
the Republic of Guinea in support of its request for a World Bank grant in an amount equivalent
to approximately US$77 million.

2. Having chosen its first democratically elected President, the Republic of Guinea needs
emergency assistance to begin implementation of its economic and social program in a context
that remains very difficult. During this post-electoral period, economic recovery remains slow.
The financial situation has been very much hampered by limited domestic and external resource
mobilization during the two years of transition. Specifically, external resource mobilization has,
thus far, been hampered by the issue of the clearance of our arrears, particularly vis-à-vis the
World Bank. In light of this situation, the State cannot ensure the satisfactory functioning of its
public services, particularly its social services, nor can it meet the country`s reconstruction
needs. Without significant improvement in the economic and social situation, the improved
security conditions, the strengthening of social peace, and the gains of the transition to
democracy will be at risk.

3. The grant we are requesting, in the form of initial assistance for the reengagement and State
institution capacity building program, should help ease the situation on two fronts ­ through
greater mobilization of international assistance on one hand, and capacity building of our
institutions so as to successfully implement the Government`s economic and social policy on the
other.

4. With respect to greater mobilization of international assistance, the resources with which you
will provide us will support some of our financing needs. This operation will therefore allow us
to clear our arrears to the World Bank, thus removing an obstacle not only to your interventions,
but also to the restoration of normal relations with the international community as a whole. We
are making solid progress with the clearance of our arrears to other international institutions, and
the preparation of a three-year program supported by the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) appears to
be on a sound footing following the February 2011 joint IMF/WB/AfDB/EU mission.
Achievement of the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)



                                               - 44 -
Initiative, which we hope to reach by end-2011, will put us in a position to once again service
our rescheduled debt.

 5. In the area of institutional capacity building, the actions supported by your grant are focused
on the key aspects of governance, in particular public and natural resource management, with the
aim of making maximum use of these resources so as to reduce poverty in the context of the
2011-2012 poverty reduction strategy, prepared with extensive assistance from the World Bank
and other partners. These actions will further the progress already made with the help of the
World Bank`s technical support, through the establishment of a matrix of priority actions,
implementation of which will be facilitated by the critical mass now reached as a result of the
technical assistance provided to the economic and financial management institutions by the
World Bank as well as by the AfDB, the UNDP, the European Union, France, and other partners.

6. The prior actions to which the Government of the Republic of Guinea is making a
commitment in the context of this budget support operation are as follows:

   (i)   Have the Recipient transmit to the President of the Republic an audit report on the
         legality, transparency, and budgetary impact of single source contracts entered into in
         2009 and 2010;
   (ii) Adopt regulatory measures to strictly limit the use of exceptional budget execution
         measures as well as exceptions to public procurement bidding and to impose sanctions
         for their misuse;
   (iii) Adopt measures to implement a Single Treasury Account, as evidenced by a
         comprehensive census of bank accounts held by public sector entities at the Central
         Bank and in commercial banks;
    (iv) Make a decision to impose a temporary freeze on public sector hiring, except in the
         education and health sectors, as well as for specific personnel in the justice sector;
   (v) Block the wages of persons earning two full-time civil service salaries simultaneously
         and civil servants who have reached the mandatory retirement age (65) and remain on
         the government payroll; and
   (vi) Have the Council of Ministers approve and publicly disclose a transparency roadmap
         for the mining sector, which outlines the process to be followed to revise the mining
         code, to consult stakeholders, and to undertake a review of large mining contracts.

7. In addition to these prior actions, the Government is mindful of the need to improve the
transparency of budget information, first and foremost for Guinean citizens, but also for the
international community. For this reason, as soon as the 2011 budget law is approved, we plan to
publish it in its entirety on a government website, in addition to its customary publication in the
Official Gazette [Journal Officiel]. These communication measures will bolster the awareness-
building activities that we regularly conduct for the benefit of the population, constituent bodies,
civil society, and the media.

8. The actions supported by this operation are an integral part of our economic and social
program and, to some degree, constitute its foundation. The World Bank was provided with
evidence of our determination to launch a frontal assault on the ills that plague our country
through the adoption in record time of all the prior actions indicated above. The economic and

consistent with our priority action plan as well as the overall poverty reduction program outlined
in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) being prepared with assistance from the World
Bank and United Nations. A high level of mobilization of the international community will be
sought to support its implementation.

Bank Group and ask you to accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my high consideration.
