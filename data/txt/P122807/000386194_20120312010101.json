           Support Grant Project for Guinea were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was high; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: when, after a steep downward\n            spiral, conditions in a country change for the better, it is\n            important for the Bank to seize the opportunity in a speedy\n            way. Prior actions for a re-engagement operation should be\n            simple and should not require extensive preparatory work.\n            They should demonstrate the Government commitment to make a\n            break with the past practices, which led the country into\n            default. An action plan should be agreed upon with the\n            Government to ensure that the reform process proceeds in an\n            efficient way after Board approval. The letter of\n            development policy should provide a framework for monthly\n            monitoring of the action plan by the Government and the\n            Bank. Technical assistance is generally needed to help the\n            Government move beyond the prior actions. A technical\n            assistance project is under preparation, but its processing\n            is taking much longer than anticipated. The country office\n            should be responsible for monitoring program implementation\n            on a monthly basis. All re-engagement operations are highly\n            risky. Experience shows that the high benefits of these\n            operations generally outweigh their high risks. It shows\n            also that the risk of not doing anything may have highly\n            negative consequences."}, "docdt": "2012-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
