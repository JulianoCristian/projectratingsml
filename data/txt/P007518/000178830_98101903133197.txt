REPORT AND RECOD1MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A., OF MEXICO
FOR A LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$65 million to
Nacional Financiera, S.A. to assist in the financing of a livestock and
agricultural development project in Mexico.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In August 1968 the Government requested a loan to continue the
agricultural credit program initiated with the assistance of Loan No.
430-SE and to concentrate on cattle development in the southeastern
region of Miexico. A Bank mission appraised the project in September/
October 1968.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
from April 14 to 21, 1969. The Borrower and Guarantor were represented
by lMessrs. Pedro Galicia, Fernando Ruiz de la Pena and Fernando Torres
from Nacional Financiera, S.A., Banco de Mexico was represented by Messrs.
Jesus Silva Herzog and Horacio Garcia Aguilar, Banco Nacional Agropecua-
rio by Jesus Romero Chavez.
4.        The following is a summary of Bank loans to Mexico as of March
31, 1969:

5.        Construction and procurement financed under outstanding loans
have generally been proceeding satisfactorily. A small part of the
construction in one district financed under the 1963 irrigation loan
(336-ME) has been postponed and the Closing Date extended to June 30,
1970, while efforts were being made to improve drainage and cropping
patterns and to increase the availability of water. Construction under
the 1963 highway loan (354-ME) is now expected to be completed in mid-
1970, three years behind schedule, mainly because of delays caused by
unusually heavy rains, limited budgetary allocations and larger volumes
of work than had been originally estimated on the basis of preliminary
engineering. Construction delays have also occurred under the 1965 toll
transport loan (hal-HE) because of increased quantities of earthwoxks and
additional structures and because of a delay in the decision as to whether
to proceed with one of the roads in the project.
6.        A project for another power sector loan is currently being ap-
praised. The Government has also expr esed interest in loans for projects
in the fields of forest industries and tourism, as well as further projects
for roads and irrigation.
7.        IFCr s total commitments in Mexico, as of Mlarch 31, 1969, totalled
$29.0 million comprising $6.5 million of operational investments and $22.5
million of standby and underwriting commitments, in seven enterprises.
IFC holds for its own account $l.4 million in loans and $3.2 million (at
cost) in equity.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Livestock and Agricultural Develop-
ment Project" (PA-8a) is attach-ed.
10.       Agriculture provides employment for half of Mexicols population,
and accounts for over 50 percent of the countryts export earnings and about
95 percent of domestic food consumption. Considerable resources are avail-
able for the raising of livestock, which represents about 35 percent of the
net value of farm output. In the development of crop production, livestock
and agro-industries the adoption of new production techniques has been
closely associated with the provision of agricultural credit from both
public and private credit institutions. There is still substantial un-
satisfied demand for agricultural credit, especially on medium and long-
term. The FONDO ts resources and organization are playing an important
role in helping to cover this gap.
11.       The FONDO, a trust fund of the Banco de M4exico, operates as an
intermediary between private credit institutions and the predominantly
government-owned Banco Nacional Agropecuario system (BNA) on the one hand,
and the Banco de Mexico, to whose rediscount facilities it has full access,
on the other. Funds from the FONDOts own resources and from borrowings
are channeled through the participating credit institutions to farmers.
livestock producers and agro-industries. The FONDO administers several
lending programs. The Bank's experience with its 1965 loan of $25 million
(430-ME) handled entirely through the FONDO has been satisfactory. A
special fund was created within the FONDO for the first loan, and the loan
was fully disbursed prior to the Closing Date. As of June 30, 1968, it had
contributed to the financing of 2,617 individual projects, of which, in
value terms, 58 percent was for livestock, 20 percent for general crops,
17 percent for agro-industries and 5 percent for fruit and tree crops.
12.       The project is divided into two parts:  (a) a countrywide sub-
project which includes annual crops, perennial crops, agro-industries,
technical services and livestock development (excluding cattle development
in the southeastern sub-project area); (b) the southeastern sub-project,
which consists of cattle development in that region of the country. The



total cost of the project over a five-year period is approximately $200
million, including working capital requirements of about $24 million,
which would be provided entirely by Mexican sources. The prospective
sources of financing for the project would be as follows: producers
20 percent, participating banks 16 percent, FONDO 32 percent and IBRD
32 percent. While the Bank and the FONDO would thus share equally in
the overall financing of the project, the Bank loan would not be avail-
able to help to finance the working capital component of the project.
Accordingly, the Bank would, on the basis of statements of expenditures,
reimburse the FONDO for 56 percent of its disbursements to participating
credit institutions for medium and long-term loans and the FONDO would
cover the remaining 44 percent with its own resources or by borrowing from
other sources.
13.       The major objective of the project is to increase the total flow
of medium and long-term credit into agriculture as a means of rapidly ex-
panding output. Returns on investment will vary greatly depending on
the type of the enterprise and its location. The overall economic rate of
return for the countrywide sub-project is estimated at 28 percent and for
the southeastern sub-project at 34 percent, which would give an average
return on investment for the project of 31 percent. To induce participat-
ing credit institutions to increase their participation in the financing
of the project, the FONDO will rediscount loans at rates ranging from 5
Dercent to 7.5 percent, depending on the contribution of the participating
institutions and on the size of the loan. The ultimate borrower will pay
between 10 and 11 percent and, in addition, a technical service fee of 1
percent, payable to the FONDO, will be charged on the face value of loans
for agro-industries, wiich involve more technical preparation than crop
production and cattle raising.
14.       The Bank loan would cover estimated foreign exchange costs of
about $49 million and local costs of about $16 million. This proposed
financing of local costs appears reasonable on the basis of the Bankts
continuing appraisal of Mexico's development program and Mexico's efforts
to mobilize domestic resources, which are summarized in Part V below.
15.       As under the previous loan for agricultural credit in Mexico
(430-IME) and as is common to most agricultural credit operations, purchase
of the equipment financed under the Loan will be made by borrowing producers
themselves. They will buy relatively small quantities of widely diversified
products, both foreign and domestically,made through local dealers and
distributors who are highly competitive. In these circumstances, inter-
national competitive bidding is not practicable. In the case of agro-
industrial machinery and equipment required for the project, the Govern-
ment will insure that the necessary import permits will be issued promptly.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRU=ENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional
Financiera, S. A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United
Mexican States and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank
and Banco de Mexico, S.A., the Report of the Comnittee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and a draft
Resolution are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       The provisions of the Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements
generally conform to the patterns of previous agreements in Mexico,
particularly those for the first agricultural credit loan. It is a
condition of disbursements for the South-eastern Cattle Development Sub-
project that the FONDOIs office in Villahermosa must be set up as a
regional office with a suitable organization and technical staff (Section
2.03(i)).
PART V - THE ECONOIaT
18.       Mexico's economic progress since the 1950's, during which period
real GNP increased at an average annual rate of about 6 percent, was analyzed
in the Bank's comprehensive report of 1966 (WH-164b) and in subsequent reports
(WH-174a and ME-183a). These reports described the impressive aspects of
Mexican performance, but also stressed the importance of expanding public
sector savings, increasing export earnings and keeping the external debb
service within manageable proportions.
19.       A Bank mission which has just returned from M4exico reports
positively on these major issues. Public sector savings grew by 25 per-
cent during 1968 and plans are now being completed for a major change in
the system of indirect taxes with the view to raising additional revenues.
The balance of payments situation in 1968 wasq reasonably satisfactory and
the Government is currently intensifying its efforts to increase agri-
cultural and industrial production for export and expand its foreign
exchange earnings from tourism.
20.       During 1968 Mexico also continued efforts to obtain the external
financing needed for her investment program and at the same time hold down
the annualservice burden on her external public debt by stretching out
maturities in the process of "rolling over" outstanding debt, despite
tight international money markets. Service payments during 1969 on the
medium and long-term external public debt will be about $544 million and
the debt service burden will amount to about 22 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. Summary tables of Mexico's external medium and long-term public
debt are attached.



- 7 -
21.       Mexico is making continuing efforts to expand public savings
and export earnings, but even after taking this into account and allowing
for the proceeds of foreign bond issues and borrowings from commercial
banks abroad, the volume of gross capital inflows is not likely to be
sufficient to cover the savings-investmaent gap of the public sector and
the overall balance of payments deficit unless the financing extended by
international agencies covers some local costs in addition to the foreign
exchange costs of eligible projects. This situation exists partly because
of the existing high level of debt service and also because of the fact
that Mexico has a diversified industrial structure capable of supplying
a large portion of its requirements for capital goods. In the existing
circumstances in Mlexico Bank financing of a portion of the local costs of
high priority projects is justified.
22.       In view of a long record of good economic performance and the
Government's continuing policies for fiscal and balance of payments manage-
ment, I consider Mexico creditwiorthy for further Bank lending.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE IWITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMEUT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
