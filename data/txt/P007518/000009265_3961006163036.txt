MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Memorandum on Mexico
Livestock and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 610-ME!
Attached is the Project Completion Memorandum (PCM) on Mexico Livestock and
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 610-ME) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office. Given the substantial amount of time elapsed since the closing of the Loan (more
than twenty years), a simplified reporting format was adopted and the Borrower was not asked to
prepare Part II or to comment on the PCM.
The project was the second in a series of nine loans approved over a twenty-year period
(FY65 to FY85). It had a sound conceptual basis, clearly understood by both the Bank and the
Borrower, reflecting lessons learnt from the first loan. Project implementation was satisfactory; under
strong farmer demand for sub-loans, the project was completed in just two years rather than the five
envisaged at appraisal. Project objectives were achieved, with (a) a beneficial impact on physical
production and the profitability of the sub-borrowers, and (b) an enhanced operational capacity of
the project management agency. As typical of the times, the project did not take into consideration
the equity effects of its operations; sub-lending concentrated on commercial farmers, disregarding
small-scale farmers and ejidatarios, and poor farmers with insufficient collateral.
The project did not include a monitoring and evaluation component. A Special Impact Study
on the First and Second projects was carried out in 1972.
The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, its achievements as sustainable, and its
impact on institutional building as substantial.
The PCM, based on an internal desk review (as for other aged projects in the 'backlog"), is
satisfactory. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION MEMORANDUM
MEXICO
LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 610-ME)
PREFACE
1     This is the Project Completion Memorandum  (PCM) for the Livestock and
Agricultural Development Project in Mexico, for which Loan 610-ME in the amount of
US$65 million was approved on February 20, 1969. The Loan was fully disbursed and the
Project closed on June 30, 1971.
2.    This PCM  was prepared by the Agriculture and Natural Resources Operations
Division of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office, in lieu of a Project
Completion Report. Given the substantial amount of time that has elapsed since the Loan
closed, this PCM does not contain Part II (to be prepared by the borrower) and includes
only a limited Part III (statistical appendix). This PCM  was prepared on the basis of
available information in the Project files, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), and Project
Performance Audit reports for follow-up Loans No. 747-ME and 91 0-ME.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
i. The purpose of the Loan was to increase livestock and agricultural production by
providing medium- and long-term finance to commercial producers through two sub-
components: one essentially continuing support for the development of livestock, annual
and perennial crops and certain agro-industries initiated under Loan 430-ME; and the
second financing the development of cattle ranches in the southeastern wet tropical region
of Mexico (para. 3.2). This Loan was the second in a series of five loans approved
between 1965 and 1979, altogether providing US$400 million of Bank funds.
Implementation Experience
ii.    The Project objectives were apparently achieved and Project implementation was
satisfactory (para. 5.1). Organizational restructuring enhanced the operational capacity of
the project administration agency. Increased credit demand by sub-borrowers, mainly due
to attractive discounting terms from the Agricultural Guarantee and Development Fund
(FONDO) to commercial banks, resulted in the disbursement of funds three years ahead of
schedule, prompting a follow-up Third Livestock and Agricultural Development Loan
(Loan 747-ME).
Results
iii.   The Project had a beneficial impact on physical production and the profitability of
livestock production, cropping and agro-industries, according to a Special Impact Study
of the first and second IBRD supported Livestock and Agriculture Development Projects
undertaken in 1972 (para. 6.2). Production gains were generally achieved through scale
expansion rather than through improved production efficiency (para. 6.3). Nonetheless,
the precise returns of this agricultural credit program on production were difficult to
quantify, as was the ERR (para. 6.6).
Sustainability
iv.    Given the rapid absorption and presumed efficient allocation of funds, the Bank
continued to provide agricultural finance for livestock production (para.7. 1) through
several follow-up projects after the completion of Loan 610-ME, indicating a high degree
of program sustainability.
Findings and Lessons Learned
v.    The Project reached its main objective by contributing to increased production
levels and initiated steps towards decentralization and institutional strengthening.
Nonetheless, the Project design was biased towards large commercial producers,



- iv -
overemphasized physical production targets and neglected clear criteria for beneficiary
assessment and sectoral priorities for sublending. The effectiveness of the Project could
have been enhanced by (i) improved evaluation and monitoring of subloans through both
FONDO and Bank and (ii) a stronger focus on poor rural households. Follow-up Bank
loans not only provided larger lending volumes, but also rightly placed more emphasis on
monitoring, decentralization and support for low-income farmers, infrastructure works,
rural housing as well as training (see paras. 13.1 to 13.3).

Subsector          Livestock
2.    Background
2.1    When the Project was prepared in the late 1960s, agricultural products accounted
for over 50% of Mexico's export earnings and local production satisfied about 95% of
domestic food consumption. About 35% of the net value of farm output was derived from
livestock. The late 1960s were a period of major structural change in the Mexican
economy, and government policy aimed to modernize agriculture through technological
change. Production was to be expanded through yield and acreage expansion, and special
trust funds were created to stimulate and provide financing for entrepreneurial agriculture.
Irrigation and mechanization were the main sources of intensification in agricultural
production. As a major component of the modernization policies, credit to the agriculture
sector increased steadily, Government credit programs were targeted primarily at the
private sector, and assisted the limited numbers of large landowners, while neglecting the
vast number of small private producers and ejidatarios. The agricultural sector became
increasingly polarized by the disproportionate credit allocations to both large-scale
commercial farmers and the irrigated areas of northwestern Mexico.
2.2    An agricultural crisis developed in the early 1970s, as agricultural production fell
substantially short of consumption demand. Government policies placed an increased
emphasis on agricultural investment, especially in poorer areas which traditionally had not
received support. Based on forecasts of beef shortages, the Mexican Government initiated
a National Livestock Program to increase productivity in traditional production areas,
develop new areas for livestock production, and improve internal distribution. The wet
and dry tropical areas of southeastern Mexico offered the best scope for livestock
expansion.
2.3   The expansion of livestock was constrained by several factors. Many livestock
products were subject to price controls in response to rising prices in major centers of
consumption. While these measures were not always effective in preventing price
increases, they did provide a disincentive to production. The lack of small agro-industries
or farmer-service enterprises was another significant obstacle to modern agriculture.



- 2 -
Mexico required additional investments in enterprises for storage, preservation, processing
and the marketing of food and fiber crops. With regard to livestock development, more
facilities for animal slaughter, milk pasteurization and mixing of animal feed concentrates
were needed.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The principal objective of Loan 610-ME was to support livestock development,
with 75% of total Project cost earmarked for this purpose. In addition, the Project
supported crop and agro-industries development and included project- related technical
services.
3.2   The Project consisted of a line of credit with two components:
(a) a Countrywide Livestock and Agricultural Development Sub-Project was to
account for 55% of total Project cost (US$110 million equivalent). Essentially a
continuation of Loan 430-ME, this sub-project was to provide 2,800 loans in all parts of
the country for: (i) livestock development; (ii) annual crop development; (iii) perennial
crop development and (iv) certain types of agro-industries.
(b) a Southeastern Cattle Development Sub-Project aimed to support beef
production in tropical areas with high development potential. It accounted for 45% of
total Project cost (US$90 million equivalent). Approximately 2,200 loans were to support
cattle development in a 12 million ha tropical area bordering the Gulf of Mexico.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1    As under the first livestock credit loan (Loan 430-ME), the Project was
administered by the Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para. la Agricultura, Ganaderia y
Avicultura (Agricultural Guarantee and Development Fund, FONDO). Operating as
trustee of the Bank of Mexico, this technical services agency discounted loans through
private and public participating banks. FONDO also provided technical services, basically
farm planning and supervision, on behalf of the participating banks. To ensure the quality
of technical services provided, Loan covenants contained assurances regarding an
intensive reorganization and decentralization of FONDO.
4.2   The project had a sound conceptual base, which was clearly understood both by
the Bank and the Borrower, reflecting the fact that this was the second Bank-financed
livestock credit project in Mexico. Under the first one, Loan 430-ME, US$25 million had
financed 2,617 individual projects; in terms of value, 58% of the Loan were made for
investment in livestock, 20% for general crops, 17% for agro-industries, and 5% for fruit
and tree crops. The principal differences with the first Loan were that Loan 610-ME
contained: (i) a regional component emphasizing high priority areas, (ii) stricter lending
maturities and interest conditions and (iii) a larger emphasis on livestock production
(75%).



- 3 -
4.3   The Project was to be implemented over a period of five years, at a total cost of
US$200 million, including a direct foreign exchange component of US$48.7 million.
IBRD lending of US$65 million was to cover 32% of total costs.
4.4   Loan maturities to sub-borrowers were generally for a minimum of three years
under the Countrywide Sub-project and five years under the Southeastern Sub-Project. A
technical service fee of 1% was charged for agro-industries loans, which involved more
technical preparation for the participating banks and FONDO than crop production and
cattle raising loans. Rediscount and interest rates were fixed according to loan size, in
order to encourage private banks to invest a larger proportion of their own funds with
increasing project sizes. The target for this share was set at 20% in SAR estimates, to be
reached by rediscounting on average not more than 80% of loans made to sub-borrowers.
Unlike the follow-up loans, Loans 430-ME, 610-ME and 747-ME were unencumbered by
a controversy over appropriate interest rates, for two reasons: First, these subloans were
limited to commercial-scale farmers, for whom there was no interest subsidy; and second,
inflation did not begin to accelerate until early 1973, from a level of around 5% in the
consumer price index at appraisal. The following rediscount and interest rates were
applied under the Project:
Size of Loan to      % of Loan        Rediscount Rates     Interest Rates
Beneficiaries      Rediscounted
Up to 500,000 Pesos        90                 7%                 10%
80                 6%                 10%
70                 5%                 10%
Between    500,000          80                 7%                 11%
and 1,500,000 Pesos

Pesos
4.5   The Project reflected the Bank's desire to ensure a continuous flow of funds for
agricultural credit in Mexico and improve the efficiency of agricultural lending. However,
with an emphasis on increasing physical output, the Project lacked clear criteria with
respect to: (i) sub-lending priorities among eligible investment projects and (ii) possibilities
for reaching poor farmers with insufficient collateral. Instead of assisting low-income
producers, the Project concentrated sub-lending on commercial farmers, given their
presumed capacity to utilize credit more rapidly.



-4 -
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   The project was fully disbursed by June 30, 1971, three years prior to the
projected five year period. Disbursement in all Project categories considerably preceded
the estimated dates, particularly for annual and perennial crops under the Countrywide
Sub-Project. Supervision reports attribute the rapid disbursement to: (i) a heavier than
expected demand for credit; (ii) the availability of an increasing number of loan officers
with technical expertise in the participating commercial banks; (iii) the short maturity of
investment credits (4 to 5 years), (iv) repeated lending to the same borrowers; (v) the lack
of meaningful lending priorities regarding borrowers and types of investment, and (vi) the
profitability for commercial banks of using FONDO resources. Banks were not only
offered attractive spreads and a guarantee (free of charge) covering the risks of subloans
to low-income producers, but were also reimbursed for most of their administrative costs.
5.2    A total of 11,651 subloans were financed during a period of two years under the
Project, nearly double those made during Loan 430-ME. FONDO, as the sub-lending
agency, confirmed its proven record of channeling resources to private banks. Auditing
and loan supervision were adequate to prevent loan diversion, although the Bank at one
point urged a more timely delivery of FONDO audit reports.
5.3   The actual distribution of subloans under Loan 610-ME was similar to Loan 430-
ME, with 61% of the funds being allocated to livestock instead of the SAR estimate of
75%. Annual crops and perennial crops absorbed 28% and 8%, respectively slightly more
than the SAR estimates. Agro-industries accounted for 3%, falling short of appraisal
projections, although the development impact of these plants was considered significant
(paras. 6.3 and 6.5). According to the Project Performance Audit Report for Loan 747-
ME (Report No. 1573), the Bank attributed divergences from SAR estimates to technical
and administrative staff weaknesses.
5.4   Given the greater emphasis on livestock and agro-industries, the SAR had
estimated an average subloan size of about $35,000, compared to an average of $15,000
under Loan 430-ME. The actual average subloan size of $17,000 fell short of appraisal
estimates, and 85% of loans averaged $6,400 equivalent. About 10% of the funds
disbursed were granted to loans in excess of 1 million pesos ($80,000 equivalent),
representing 1% of the total loans. Nonetheless, smaller subloans did not necessarily
benefit smaller farmers, as they were repeatedly granted to the same borrowers (para. 6.4).
5.5   Local competitive bidding for project procurement was followed, and outputs from
the project were marketed through normal commercial channels; this practice had proved
satisfactory under Loan 430-ME. Given the Mexican government's policy not to grant
import permits for equipment and machinery comparable to those manufactured
domestically, Loan covenants required prompt issuing of permits for Project-related
imports, in case any foreign supplier was the lowest evaluated bidder. No problems were
reported concerning this provision, although project files do not indicate whether foreign
suppliers were contracted.

6.    Project Results
6.1   In 1972, the Bank commissioned a Special Impact Study of the First and Second
Livestock and Agriculture Development Projects (Loans 430-ME and 610-ME) from an
external consultant. The comprehensive study was based on two field surveys during May,
1972, less than a year after Loan 610-ME had been fully disbursed. However, the small
sample of farms surveyed (4%) limited the general validity of the study and little indication
was provided as to what extent the physical project targets and rates of return projected in
the Staff Appraisal Report had been achieved (Table 5.A). While no cut-off rates for the
economic and financial returns had been set at appraisal, the appraisal estimates of the
project ERR and FRR were 31% and 32%, respectively.
6.2   The study concluded that sub-borrowers benefited greatly from these projects.
Comparing a pre-loan sample of farms with the situation in 1972, significant
developmental progress was indicated by increases in: (i) average annual net cash
operating income per farm of 44.7%; (ii) average net worth per farm of 51.7%; and (iii)
average gross value of farm production per farm by 98.2%.
6.3   Overall, production gains were primarily achieved through scale expansion rather
than through improved production efficiency, with the exception of beef and dairy
production. Increased beef production could also be attributed to efficiency improvements
related to grazing conditions. Dairy production increased due to both herd expansion and
improvements in productivity per cow. By contrast, enlargements of hog enterprises were
not accompanied by efficiency improvements through multiple farrowings. Similarly, no
noticeable productivity gains could be found for poultry farms. Cropping productivity also
showed little improvement. The most significant impact on agro-industries was found to
be associated with the creation of new firms; their operating profitability (an average of
$Mex 1,342,500 in 1971) was more than double the pre-loan average of existing firrns
($Mex 599,100 in 1971). Agro-industry loans also induced substantial employment
creation, reflecting the increased number of firms.
6.4   The incidence of repeat borrowings under the Project was pronounced. Around
37% of participating farms and ranches contracted more than one subloan under Loans
430-ME and 610-ME. While this suggests a substantial degree of borrower satisfaction,
project benefits were less widespread. The target for rediscounting of 20% (para. 4.2) was
not completely achieved, although participating banks contributed on average about 3%
more from their own resources (16%), compared to average contributions of 13% under
Loan 430-ME.
6.5   The influence of the two Livestock and Agricultural Credit Loans on the irrigated
areas of Northern Mexico was regarded as relatively slight by a 1971 social impact study
of Bank irrigation projects in Mexico. Among the major participating public rural credit
institutions, Banco Nacional Agricola was found to be not very active in many of the
Northern irrigation areas and Banco Agricola and Banco Ejidal did not utilize the
rediscount facilities of the FONDO. On the other hand, Bank financing had a beneficial



- 6 -
impact on increasing: (i) the number of processing plants, thereby expanding marketing
outlets for farmers; (ii) cattle production in adjacent areas; and (iii) cooperative dairy
plants and mnilk collection facilities.
6.6   A precise estimate of the economic benefits stemming from  the project is
precluded by methodological problems and lack of data. Project Performance Audit
Reports of successor projects to Loan 610-ME (No.1573 and No.2577) questioned the
appropriateness of estimating rates of return for credit programs, given the wide range of
individual investments covered. Although available data suggest a beneficial impact of the
Project, continued Bank lending in follow-up projects (Loans 747-ME, 910-ME, and
1217-ME) was approved without prior assessment as to what extent original projections
for earlier projects (including Loan 610-ME) regarding physical quantities, profitability
and number of beneficiaries, had been achieved. One and a-half years after the 1972
survey, OED undertook a study of the impact of the Bank's lending for livestock and
agricultural credit in Mexico, which is summarized in Project Performance Audit Report
No.1573. Although repeating a number of questions asked in the first Impact Study, the
OED study confirmed both the beneficial impact of Bank-financed agricultural credit
programs on physical production data and productivity increases below appraisal
projections (para.6.3).
7.    Sustainability
7.1    As a result of the rapid absorption of funds, the Bank expanded its agricultural
credit program with a Third Livestock and Agricultural Development Loan for Mexico in
FY71 (Loan 747-ME), which was followed by a repeater project approved in FY73 (Loan
910-ME). The Bank then approved another six agricultural credit loans in Mexico (see
OED PAR No.8860 of June 1990), the last one approved in 1987, in addition to credit
components in three PIDER (integrated rural development) Projects and two in
agricultural marketing. Livestock development has thus been supported by continued
Bank lending for agricultural credit from the mid-1960s (Table 1).
7.2   While no new institutions were set up, supervision reports assert that the Project
resulted in a strengthening of existing financial intermediaries and technical agencies.
Audit reports for successor projects indicate that lending thereby contributed to the
viability of Mexico's rural credit system and the mobilization of domestic savings in the
agricultural sector.
8.     Bank Performance
8.1    With a free-limit of $400,000, the Bank's approval for subloans was only required
in occasional circumstances and was generally granted with few modifications in
subproject design. The Bank adequately supervised the disbursement of subloans, but little
emphasis was placed on the sectoral allocation and ultimate impact of subloans. Clearer
indicators for subloan evaluation and monitoring of sectoral distributions could have
provided a greater focus on low-income producers; such changes were in fact eventually



- 7 -
incorporated in follow-up loans. Supervision reports also failed to raise the issue of a real
decline in private lending to the agricultural sector during the early 1970s, which can be
attributed to a combination of reduced relative net profitability, increasing defaults and an
inflationary environment. There was also little mention of macro-economic variables and
their impact on the Project. The Impact Study (para. 6.1) seems to have been followed by
relatively little discussion within the Bank, which may be indicative of its methodological
shortcomings. According to Audit Report No. 1573, the influence of the Impact Study
remained largely limited to a change in the design of the monitoring system for successor
loans.
9.     Borrower Performance
9.1   The implementing agency (FONDO), operating as a trust fund of the Banco de
Mexico, complied with organizational changes required by the Bank; no major queries
concerning management efficiency or financial viability of the implementation agency
(FONDO) were reported. The establishment of further regional FONDO offices for
follow-up subloans indicates that the decentralization of staff and operational procedures
undertaken during the Second Livestock and Agricultural Development Project initiated
an appropriate response to the diversity of Mexican agriculture. Decentralization allowed
FONDO to provide technical assistance and monitor sublending in a more effective
manner.
9.2   Project implementation and repayments proceeded on schedule. Bank insistence on
a more effective monitoring system by FONDO as a pre-condition of the Third Loan
suggests that both monitoring and evaluation of subloans during the Second Loan was
considered as insufficiently discerning. In response to the shortfall of lending to agro-
industries (para. 5.3), the Bank urged the Borrower to upgrade its personnel capacity to
evaluate agro-industrial loans.
10.   Project Relationships
10.1    Project relationships between the Bank and the Borrower remained good
throughout the project, as reflected in project documentation. Differences over the format
of FONDO reports, hiring of consultants and repayment delays were satisfactorily
resolved.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1  Technical assistance under the Project was provided through local FONDO
personnel. A consultant for agro-industries participated in the Project appraisal mission.
Although not originally part of the Project and commissioned for Loan 747-ME,
consultancy services were required for the Impact Study of the First and Second Livestock
and Agriculture Development Projects. Some delays were experienced in hiring a
consultant for that study.



-8 -
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The legal provisions of Loan 610-ME provided an adequate framework for this
type of project. The Staff Appraisal Report presented an appropriate evaluation of
projected Project benefits. However, supervision reports did not focus on the benefits or
impact of the Project, but on the volume of sub-lending and organizational matters.
Notwithstanding the commissioning of an Impact Study (para. I 11.1), Project
documentation reflects an emphasis on fund disbursement rather than assessment of
physical output projections. In addition, the lack of clear beneficiary categories made it
difficult to ascertain the overall development impact of the Project. No attempt was made
to evaluate the cause-effect relationship between the investments facilitated by the
subloans and borrower progress.
13.   Lessons Learned
13.1  Loan 610-ME reflected few changes in the basic project design utilized for Loan
430-ME. The project introduced a regional component and initiated an organizational
restructuring of FONDO as the Project implementation agency, reflecting the Bank's
concern to ensure an adequate response to the need of Mexican agriculture for credit. The
disbursement rate exceeded expectations, and FONDO performed as an efficient second-
tier institution to channel further Bank-funded credit programs.
13.2  The Project reached its main objective by contributing to increased livestock and
crop production as well as stimulating agro-industries. It also initiated steps towards
greater decentralization and institutional strengthening. Nonetheless, the Project design
reflected several shortcomings. First, the effectiveness of the Project could have been
enhanced by improved evaluation and monitoring of subloans by both FONDO and Bank.
Physical production targets were overemphasized during Project design, while clearer
criteria for beneficiary assessment and sectoral priorities for sublending were relatively
neglected. Impact evaluation should have been incorporated as part of project design,
providing a basis for designing follow-up projects. Finally, a sharper poverty orientation of
the Project could have strengthened the beneficial impact on low-income rural producers
without access to alternative sources of credit.
13.3  Some differences in the design of the Third Livestock and Agricultural
Development Project (Loan 747-ME) reflect lessons from the implementation of the
preceding Loans 430-ME and 610-ME. In addition to providing increased volumes of
Bank funds, subsequent lending rightly incorporated new elements including (i) lending for
infrastructure works and rural housing; (ii) establishment of further decentralized field
offices for FONDO; (iii) intensified subloan evaluation and monitoring; and (iv)
intensification of FONDO training programs. With the Fourth Livestock Project (Loan
910-ME), the previous lending bias towards large commercial producers was shifted
towards lower-income farmers.
