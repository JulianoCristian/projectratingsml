WATER SPPILY SECTOR QB1RQIE
Credit and Project Summuary
Borrower:       Republic of Burundi
Beneficiaries:  Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) and Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM)
Amount:         SDR 24.2 million (US$32.7 million)
Terms:          Standard IDA
Cograncing:     Belgium and Gernany (AGCD, KfW)
Proiect objectives:
The nain objectives of the project would be to: (a) mprove the quality and quantity of potable water
provided to the rual population; (b) increase the local population's sense of responsibility fur maintaining
its water supply facilities; (c) help the government and REGIDESO, the urban utility company, develop
and implement appropriate institutional and financial arrangements in water supply sector; (d) extend the
pricing policy initiated under the rural water supply project to the entire country; (e) coordinate donor
activity in the rural water supply sector; and (f) help the government prepare and monitor a public
expenditure program (PEP) for the sector.
Proiect Descrintion:
The project would include the following components:
(a) construction of rural water supply systems in 9 provinces split in two stages: stage 1 - provinces of
Kayanza, Ngozi, Karuzi and Muyinga; stage 2 - provinces of Gitega, Muramvya, Cibitoke, Bubanza,
Makamba;
(b) development and protection of about 3,000 springs; and
(c) capacity building in the Department or Rural Water Resources and Electrification (DC-l! ER), within
the MRD, through the provision of expertise, equipment and training, in the conmnunes and ,.  communal
water utilities tbrough the provision of training and sensitization of population, and in REGIDESO through
the provision of studies.
Proiect Benefits:
Tbe proposed project would improve public heulth tbrough provision of safe water supply in rural areas.
Another important benefit would be decentralization and development of communal responsibilities for
infrastructures which directly serve tie population. Institutional strengthiening and cost recovery would
provide the basis for future expansion of raml water supply systems and would improve the financial
situation of REGIOESO.
Though experience under the second project demonsates that even the poorest communes are ready to pay
for wator, there is the risk that cost recovery and beneficiary participation in the maintenar"e of facilities



would be less than expected. This risk will b. moimized by the planned campaigpb for sensitizing
population on benofits provided by the use of safe drinking water.
ioect Cost:
The total cost of the project is estimat.d at USS 54.7 hiilion equivalent, with foreign costs of about US$
38.2 million which represent 70 percent. The detailed cost estimates is sbown in table below.

BURUNDI
WAT*ER ST!PPY SECTOR PROJECT
1. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Burundi is a small landlocked country on Lake Tanganyika situated in Eastem Africa between Rwanda,
Zaire and Tanzania, about 1,400 km from the Indian Ocean. The country covers 27,835 knm, including the 2,800
knm2 that make up its share of Lake Tanganyika. There are three principal geographic zones: (a) the Imbo coastal
plain along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika and the Ruzizi River Valley north of the lake, where the climate
is tropical with an altitude of 800 m; (b) the high, cool, central plateau region that contains the Zaire-Nile divide,
between 1500 and 2000 m, where most of the population lives; and (c) the North-eastern and South-eastem (Mosso
Plain) lowlands extending from the central plateau to the Rwandan and Tanzanian borders. Average temperature
varies from 15 to 25 degrees C throughout the year.
Population
1.02      With a population of about 5.25 million growing at the high rate of 3 percent a year, Burundi is the
second most densely populaied country in Africa (210 inhabitants per square km of land). Life expectancy is 48
years, and child mortality rate is i 19 per thousand. About 93 percent of the population lives in rural areas as small
farmers who depend mainly on subsistence agriculture and on one main cash crop, coffee, which provides the najor
source of the country foreign exchange. Bujumbura, with a population of about 250,000, is the only city in
Burundi.
Ecornomie Situation
1.03      GDP per capita, estimated at about US$230 (1989), ranks among the lowest of the continent. GDP
growth has averaged 6.2 percent in real terms from 1985 to 1987, but was 5.2 percent in 1988 and only 1.5 percent
in 1989. The country has limited natural resources other than a relatively fertile agricultural land. Agriculture is
the predominant activity, contributing more than half of GDP, 93 percent of employment and 88 percent of export
earnings. Bumndi is one of the few African countries that are self-sufficient in food. The most important export
crop is coffee, which accounts for about 80 percent of export earnings. The secondary sector is small, accounting
for about 14 percent of GDP and 8 percent of exports.
1.04      After a period of relatively good growth, partly due to the coffee boom in the mid-1970s and increased
foreign aid, Burundi faced serious economic and financial difficulties in the early 1980s. With the decline in coffee
prices and a rise in oil prices, the terns of trade deteriorated by 45 percent between 1978 and 1981, weakening the
balance of payments and generating large budget deficits. The government imposed import restrictions and tightened
foreign exchange and price controls to hold down the increasing deficit in the balance of payments. Th. resulting
economic slowdown highlighted Burundi's major structural constraints: its dependence on coffee revenues, weak
>rivate sector and lack of incentives for a sustained growth of agriculture and industry.
1.05      In 1986, the government undertook a major adjustment program under the first SAL, with the
objectives of restoring financial stability and initiating structural changes to increase reliance on market forces. The
new government that took office in September 1987 has committed itself to pursue and strengthen the adjustment
program under SAL 11, which became effective in November 1988. It has and will continue to address structural
issues by: (i) improving macro economic management, (ii) stimulating exports, (iii) promoting private sector
development, (iv) reforming the public enterprise sector, and (v) improving public expetiditure management. In
addition new measures are aimed at: increasing the efficiency of the financial sector, liberalizing the labor market
and alleviating poverty.



2-2
1.06      Under th. first phase of the ajusmet progrm, the govemneat implem.ntcd a strict budgetary policy
including a serong reduction of public exponditures. Public investmet was reduced to conform to the new tight
macroeconomic and financial policy. A throyear rolling public expenditurs program (PEP) is now being prepared
to 'erve as the basis for a unified systuen of bdget preparation. This PEP in expected to lead to more efficient
resource maocation and give priority to the mainenance of inftucture rather than to new capital expenditures.
&a]Omanizado
1.07      In 1982 the number of provinces was increas d ftom 8 to 15, and the number of districts, or
*communes from 79 to 114 1/. Tho communes are dministralively divided irto 2,466 'hills', The cemamune
is headed by a communal administrator. He is appointed by the Ministry of the Interior und reports to the govemor
of the province. Each cont-june has an accountant and many of them have a water service attendant who is
responsible for existing wate" supply systems. Most provmces have a smal urban center providing servie3 to
surrounding nral ancas ZI.
1.08      A reorganization of local finaucing was undertaken in January 1984, principally to increase local
involvement and responsibility. New taxes were established, to be collected by the communes. However the
commnunes remain financially weak, with revenue averaging FBu 150 per capita in 1987. Tbe second urban
development project (Cr.No 1968-BU) initiated a study of communal resources with the objective of strengthening
the financial viability of the communes, urban as well as rural.
B. The Water Supply ad Sanitation Sector
Water Resouroes
1.09      Burundi has good rainfall, with 800 Co 2,000 mm a year in two rainy sessons. Rainfall varies from
less dman 900 mm in the Imbo Plain, to 900-1,200 mm in the eastern plains, about 1,200 m  in the central plateau
and 1,600-2,000 mm along the Zuie-Nile crest. lierefore, it has ad',quate water potential for community water
supplies. Because of its geology und climate, there are many springs and surface waters, principally in the central
plateau. In the Ruzizi valley and the eastern lowlands, groundwater is the only source available. However, the
quality of the water provided by many prings, which are not protected, as v._ as by the streams and marshlands
is doubtful or poor. The incidence of water-borne diseases is high and accounts for more than 70 percent of all
endemic diseases (see Annex 3).
Sector Ormnizaion
1.10      A National Commission for Water (Commission Nationale Permanente des Eaux) was established on
March 15, 1976 under the chairmanship of the minister of agriculture. When the Ministry of Energy and Mines
(MEM) was created in October 1987, with responsibility for water, a new National Commission for Water and
Energy was established Ji. This commission is chaired by the minister of energy and mines. Th. main objectives
of this commission are to coordinate the development of the water and energy sectors, define the responsibilities
of the agencies involved and protect waler and energy resources. This commission reports to the prime minister
and minister of planning.

1.11      Water supply in urban centors 8 naed by REGIDESO, a govemnment-owned company that is also
responsible for elerti power in the country. REGIDIESO was establisehod ifn 1968, under the supervision of the
Ministry of Energy and Mines 4I. It lB supported by soveval donots: the African Development Bank (AfDB),
Gernan Cooperation (KfW and GTZ), the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econonique* (CCCE), and
IDA. Originally REGIDESO had responsibility for water supply tbzoughout the country, in rual as well as in
urban arens.
1.12      In Febnuy 1979, resp asibility for water supply in rual area was trmsferred to the Department of
Rural Water Resources and Blectrificatlon (DHER) Il witbin the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR). The
department was in charge of the planning, design, constrction (mainly by forme account), operation and
maintenance (O.& M.) of all mral electricity mnd water 'upply schemnes. However because of a shortage of funds
and technical staff and a lack of proper ins  ional arrangements most of the rutal water supply systems were not
masntained. By 1984, about a third of exisung rurl water systems were out of service. Under the rural water
supply project (Credit 1625-DU), the govemmont d.cided to give Wo local communities under the authority of the
conmnunes, thi responsibility for opetation and maintenance of water supply systems and introduce cost recovery
measures. In 1988, the Department of Rural Water Resources and Electrification was upgraded into the General
Directorate for Rural Water and Energy (DGHER), with two departments, one for energy, and one for water
(Département de l'Hydraulique et de l'Assainissement, DHA) f/.
1.13      Until 1983, sanitation in Bujumbura was handled, by REGIDESO. In May 1983, ihe goverament
transferred this responsibility to a new agency, SETEMU (Services Techniques Municipaux), with the objective of
extending its activities to all urban centers. lI 1989 as a condition of the second urban development project,
SETEMU became an autonomous agency under the responsibility of the Bujumbura Municipality. Sanitation in rural
areas is hasdled by DHA.
Levels of Service
1.14      Cormpared with other Sub Saharau African countries, the levels of service are slightly higher than the
average for water supply, particularly in-the urban areas, sad radier lower than average for sanitation for both urban
and rura ames (see annex 2)
1.15      Water Su_ply. REGIDESO operates 28 water systems (778.5 krm. of pipes), with 354 standpipes and
about 12,350 house connections. Water is supplied to about 92 percent of the urban population, 25 percent through
private connections and 67 percent dirough standpipes.
1.16      Buijumbura receives about 50,000 m3 a day, 7 percent from Lake Tanganyika, 19 prercent from the
Ntahangwa River, and 7 percent from three springs located in the hills above the city. T'e city hvl about 9,800
pn-:.aite connections (17 percent of the population) and 210 standpipes, of which only 120 are workir,g. This results
from REGIDESO systematically cutting off water in standpipes which have not been maintained rather than
maintaining them, because standpipes water bills are not paid by the municipality. 'Me municipality and
REGIDESO have recently agreed to request from standpipes users the payment of an annual fee which would enable
the muuicipality to clear up the situation, Instructions for standpipes management and payment of water by users
in centers operatad by REGIDESO, are under preparation and would be sent to local authorities by June 1991
(para.7.01 (a». This issue ie also being addressed under the second urban project (credit 1968-BU) by strengthening
municipal revenues and therefore the ability of the municipality to pay its water bills.

1.17      The level of service in rural areas increased from 22 percent in 1982 to 48 percent by the end of 1990.
Coverage varies from 25 perçent of the population in Muyinga province, up to 81 percent in Ruyigi provizace.
About 17 percent of the rural population is served through piped systems (16.5 percent through standpipes and 0.5
percent through house connections), 31 percent through developed springs, and 0.3 percent through wells.
1.18      liiere are 338 rural water supply systems with 2,343 kn of pipes, of which 23 with pumping stanon,
equipped with 2,765 standpipes, and about 2,000 house connections. Each standpipe serves about 220 inhabitante.
There are about 1i1,000 developed springs. Prom 1979 to 1989 UNICEF developed 7,625 springs. In addition, 960
springs were developed under the supervision of the NGO Action Aid, and 2,390 by other projects. Each spring
serves 132 people on average and sometimes supplies schools und dispensaries. Annex 4 shows the level of service
for each province. Rural residents without service rely on undeveloped springs and polluted streatns or ponds,
which are generally located at sonie distance from their home.
1.19      Per capita consumption is low at about 8 liters per day (led) compared to 30 lcd recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO). The standard consumption used for new projects is 20 led for standpipes and
100 Icd for house connections.
1.20      Sanitation. In Bujumbura about 11 percent of the population is served by three sewerage systems,
covering the city center, Ngagara and Mutanga. Sewage is discharged into the Ntahangwa River or directly into
Lalce Tanganyika without treatment. The Mutanga system is equipped with a treatment plant, but it does not work.
About 9 percent of the population is served through septic tanks and 80 percent through pit latrines, often used by
several farnilies.
1.21      A study financed by AfDB was carried out from 1982 to 1986 to prepare a sanitation project for
Bujumbura. The total cost of this proposed sanitation project would be about US$30 million. AfDB, Kreditanstalt
fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) are interested in financing the project, but no formal decision has yet been takea, in view
of the uncertainty about the origin of future resources required to cover operating and maintenance costs.
1.22      The secondary towns have no sewerage system; they rely on septic tanks (20 percent) and pit latrines
(80 percent).
1.23      Ln rumral areas 30 percent of the rugos' (family farnis) have a traditional pit latrine that does not moet
minimum sanitary conditions. The rest of the rural population lacks formal waste disposal facilities. Several public
and private improved pit latrine systems have been tested, but proved too costly to install. Although residents could
build the latrines, they have to buy the concrete floor, which costs about FBu 20,000. The present policy is to give
priority to equipment for schools and dispensaries. About 200 schools (17 percent) have been provided with good
sanitary facilities, 150 of which were financed under the IDA supported education sector development project.
C. Previous Bank Involvelment
1.24      In 1966 the Bank financed a water supply project for Bujumbura (Cr. 85-BU). REGIDESO was created
under this project, which was completed in 1972. A project performance audit report (PPAR No 0792) was
prepared in June 1975.
1.25      A second project was approved in 1986 (Cr. 1625-BU) to improve water supply facilities in rural areas.
The credit will be closed in December 1991. This project included the following components: (a) rehabilitation and
extension of 33 rural water supply systems; (b) strengthening the DHER snd improving its effectiveness through
the provision of technical aseistance and equipment; (c) training for DHER's staff, communal administrators,
accountants, and water supply attendants; and (d) feasibility studies for rural water supplies in the provinces of
Ngozi, Kayanza, Kanzi snd Muyinga (to be developed under the proposed project). The project was designed to
support the transfer of responsibility from DGHER to communes for the O.& M. of water systems and introduce
a cost recovery mechanism.



-  -
1.26      Due to an efficient project unit, the project was implemented on time and civil works were completed
in Aigust 1990, despite a delay, due to a government decision in 1988 that water charges necessary to cover O.&
M. expenditures would not be paid by stanpipes usera, but rather by the communes. However this decision could
not be implemented for lack of resources and the govemment eventually agreed to implement the original cost
recovery policy gradually. In 1989 a test was under'aken in 3 communes in which revenue collection rmie ranged
from 40 to 85 percent. In mid 1990, the cost recovery policy was extended to 26 communes where the systems
were operational. For the first year of implementation of the policy, the results are -elatively good and encouraging,
with an average coverage of 35 percent and one fifth of communes over 60 percent. The design of the proposed
project is based on results and lessons learnt through this ongoing project, namely for decentralization of
responsibilities, organization of the local level, cost recovery policy and implementation arrangements.
1.27      lI 1985 IDA provided funds to expand the power transmission and distribution system of REGIDESO
(Cr. 1593-BU). Besides electricity physical components the p:. .ct included the construction of a training center
to improve performance of REGIDESO' staff. Construction of this training center is completed.
1.28      In April 1991 the Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project was approved. This project has been designed
to strengthen the institutional capacity of DGHER and REGIDESO in the power sector.

lTa,   WATER SUPmY SECTOIR OLICY
2.01      A draft letr of sectoral policy was prepared by the govermment and discussed with the appraisal
mission (see annex 1). This draft was reviewed by the national commission for water, sent to the Bank before
negotiations and was discussed during negotiations. The letter was signed as a condition of Board presentation of
the proposed creit. The proposals included in tbis letter provide a sound basis for the development of the sector.
SjççtQr Obied&ËM
2.02      In January 1982 at the first national workshop in the framework of the water supply and sanitation
decade, targets and associated investment costs were set as follows:
Table Z.1 Proposed coverage of water and sanitation services
1982  1987  1992       Investment a/
.Water            90%   95%   98%          US$65 million
.Sanitation       40%   65%   80%          US$53 million
Rul At
.Mater            22%  40%   50%           US$21 million
.Sanitation       30%   60%   85%          US$20 million
a/ in 1981 prices.
2.03      The objectives for sanitation are far from being met as domestic and foreign resources were not
sufficient, and because cost recovery measures were not implemented. For water supply the level of service could
reach 50 percent by 1992 in nral areas, and 94 percent (instead of 98 percent) in urban areas.
2.04      In 1988 the govemment set revised water sector objectives calling for universal access to potable water
by 2000. A level of service of 98 perent in urban centers and 75 percent in rual areas, at a cost of US$80
million, would be & reasonable objective, considering the availability of foreign and local fund's, and the absorptive
capacity of the executing agencies. For urban centers, this objective has been accepted by the govenmment which
has also agreed to deliver the service to the rural sector to the extend allowed by local water resourtes availability
and topographical conditions. These objectives, expressed in the sector policy letter, are consistent with the
development program detailed below (aa 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17). mhe government has also agreed to 70 percent
coverage by sanitation services in Bujumbura and 60% in secondary centers and in urban areas.
Cost Rewcvr
2.05      lhe letter of sectomal policy specifies that the cost of water supply and sanitation services would be
fuUy recovered in urban centers. Tariffs would be reviewed annually to cover actual cost of service. The objective
would be to reach the long-term marginal cost. In rural areas the government would finance construction cost
(including related debt service) and beneficiaries would cover O.& M. and renewal costs. This cost recovery policy
would be reviewed in the medium term, as the economic situation of the rural population is expected to improve.
Remksbilities between Urban and Rural Sub sectors
2.06      When DHER was established in 1979, the respective responsibilities of REGIDESO and DGHER were
not clearly defined, particularly in the rural areas surrounding the centers operated by REGIDESO. This was
corrected in 1986 when REGIDESO's statute was amended limiting its responsibility to Bujumbura and 23 urban



-7 -
centers ?/. A 1987 study covering the financial and institutional aspects of water supply mn- sanitatt  endorsed
limiting REGIDESO's responsibility to these 23 urban centers I/. Although the findings were approved by the
steering committee, no change has occurred and despite this clarification REGIDESO continues to operate 28 centers
and is implementing a rural water supply project, financed by KfW, for 5 new centers. Contrary te govermment
policy REGIDESO's standpipe users do not pay for water; the commune is billed. This would be corrected under
the proposed projecv, and the transfer from REGIDESO to the communes of water systems concerned would be
completed prior to any disbursement for pipes acquisition for the provinces of Karuzi and Kayanza (para.7.03).
2.07       If technical support from REGIDESO is necessary to assure adequate O.& M. of rural systems to be
transferred, the communes could contract with REGIDESO for the services required. The communes would pay
REGIDESO, and would be responsible for collecting service charges from the users. The communes would also
be free to contract with a private company for the same services.
Institutional Arrangements for the Rural Sub sector
2.08       On August 16, 1990 the Council of Ministers agreed on the organization of the rural water supply sub
sector and asked the Ministry of Interior and MDR to prepare instructions, to be sent to all province goiernors and
communal ad ministrators. This statement based on the experience of the ongoing project, transfers responsibilities
to the local level and is in line with the sector policy letter and has been sent to local authorities in December 1990.
During negotiations, assurance was obtained that it would be formdalized in December 1993, taking into account the
experience gained after three years of implementation (para.7.01 (b)).
2.09       Thi communes are responsible for potable water supply and own all water facilities, except those
operated by REGIDESO. After the construction of a new system, the facilities are handed over to the communes,
which are responsible for O.& M. and renewal of the facilities thereafRer.
2.10       The O.& M. of all water systems in the commune, piped systems as well as springs or wells, would
be the responsibility of a communal water utility ('régie communale de l'eau"). During negotiations, assurance was
ootained that the utility would be established before starting works in the concemed commune (para.7.01 (c». T'e
utility would be managed by a communal water board, established in the following manner
(a)   The consumers of a water point, standpipe, spring, or well would elect a person who would be in charge
of the care and maintenance of the facility;
(b) The group of persons so selected would elect representatives to serve on the commune users committee;
(d)   The users committee would meet annually -or as appropriate- to elect a communal water board, composed
of ten to twelve representatives, including its chairman and its treasurer.
2.11       The water board would have full responsibility for O.& M. of all the water facilities in the commune.
The board would present the budget at the annual moeting, outlining expenditures for an adequate O.& M. and
construction. The board would also set the annual user charges. These decisions would be approved by the
communal administrator. If the water board did not fulfill its stated functions, the communal administrator would
take the initiative for the management of the systems.
2.12       At each water point, an elected agent would collect the fees, delivering them to threasurer of the
water board, who would deposit the funds on a bank accouat (or other financial institution) opened in the name of
the communal water utility. 'Me chairman and the treasurer would have joint responsibility for this account. 'Me
water board would pay the salaries of the water attendants and other staff and would finance all O.& M. costs and

replacement of assets. The water board would receive the assistance from the commune as required. In particular,
the communal accountant would be responsible for the accounts of the utility, which would be reviewed every year
by the provincial inspector of the Department of Inspection for Communal Projects of the Ministry of the Interior.
2.13      Where rural water systems served more than one commune, the water boards of the compiunes
involved would form an intercommunai water authority.  This body, composed of ten to twolve elocted
representatives would operate all fixed assets that served the communes involved. The authority would charge a
uniform tariff; the communal water boards would pay the bills and recover the cost from the users of these
intercommunal systetns.
Sector Development frongam
2.14      Since 1985, the rural water supply sector has been developing rapidty. Many projects are under way
and studies are being carried out for future projects under the auspices of IDA, UNICEF, European Development
Fund (EDF), KfW and Belgian Cooperation (AGCD). The project financed by IDA, KfW and AGCD would cover
10 provinces: Kayanza, Karuzi, Gitega, and Muramvya for IDA; Ngozi, Muyinga, Ruyigi, Bujumbura and Bururi
for KfW; Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Makamba for AGCD. The EDF has initiated projects in the provinces of
Cankuzo Rutana and Kirundu, plus the Mugamba Project covering partially the provinces of Bururi, Bujumbum,
Muramvya, and Kayanza. This program would cover the whole country for a total investment cost of about US$73
million.
2.15      The Water and Sanitation Project (PEA) financed by UNICEF includes the development and protection
of 6,400 springs by 1992, the construction of 710 km of piped systems and 5,650 pit-latrines, and the training of
300 commnunal water attendants. In addition, many NGOs such as Association Française des Volontaires du Progrès
and Action Aid, contribute to the sector development.
2.16       All donors involved in the rural water sub sector have agreed to promote decentralization of
responsibilities at local level and cost recovery, as specified in the letter of sectoral policy. After completion of
ail these projects the service level in rural areas would rise from 48 percent at the end of 1990 to about 70 percent
in 1997. 2/
2.17      'Me urban water supply sector would be developped under KfW and CCCE financed projects in
Bujumbura and in ten secondary centers (Kirundo, Muyinga, Rumonge, Rulyigi, Karuzi, Buhiga, Mabanda, Burui,
Cibitoke and Makamba).
2.18      During project implementation the government would submit updated three-year expenditure and
investment programs by October 31 annually to IDA (para.7.01 (e». The government would ensure that
investments in the water supply and sanitation sector are technically, financially and economically justified. IDA
would also review and romment on DGHER's annual budgets (para.7.01 (e)).
Sector Constraints
2.19      The primary constraint is the capacity and willingness of the beneficiaries to pay for potable water.
This is likely to be a continuing problem since water charges will rise as more sophisticated an costly systems wilU
be installed, with pumping stations and treatment plants.
2.20      Another constraint is the weak formal coordination between the various donors and projects. No
formal meeting has been held in Burundi since the 'Décennie Internationale de l'Eau Potable et de l'Assainissement^
(DIEPA) workshop in January 1982. To strengthen coordination in the sector the govermment would send its
sectoral policy letter to aU donors concerned with the sector and would convene an annual meting of their
representatives to review progress in implementing sector policy and investments.
2/ TIi rural population in 1989 was 4.9 million. By 1997 the rural population would rise 'o 5.8 million.



-9-
Rationale for Bank Participation
2.21       Access to safe water supply has been, within the DIEPA, accorded a high priority by the govemnent
and the actual policy is to develop the necessary social infrastructure which should directly benefit the population,
by providing an equitable access to basic goods and services such as health, transportation and safe water supply.
2.22       The Bank involvement in the water sector is consistent with the govemment's main objectives namely
(a) to increase the level and quality of water supply services; (b) to supply low-income neighborhoods; (c) to provide
continued support for increasirg planning, design and implementation capabilities of the institutions involved and
(d) to achieve adequate cost removery in urban and rural water supply sub-sectors.
2.23      The Bank's objective in the rural water supply sub-sector is to support the government's policy to: (a)
give communes full responsibility for water supply in rural areas sad (b) establish a system of charges to be
collected from the beneficiaries to cover O.& M. and renewal costs. This policy, designed during the preparation
of the rural water supply project (Cr. 1625-BU), was initiated in 26 communes in 1990. After extensive consultation
with other donors, this policy was endorsed by KfW, AGCD, EDF and UINICEF. The proposed project provides
a good opportunity to implement this new policy throughout the country. IDA's leadership ensures that adequate
attention will be paid to institutional and cost recovery aspects of the sector.
2.24       The Bank's objective in the urban water supply sub-sector is to help the government improve cost
recovery mechanisnis and clarify the responsibilities between REGIDESO and DGHER. 'fe proposed project will
facilitate the dialogue between the institutions involved.

m. lm PRRECT
Genesis
3.01      Under the rural water supply project (Credit 1625-BU), feasibility studies wre carried out for new
rural water supply schemes in four provinces: Ngozi, Muyinga, Kayanza and Karuzi. TIe studies were completed
in July 1988. After review, MDR decided to retain 43 gravity systems, 9 in Ngozi province, 5 in Muyinga
province, 18 in Kayanza province and 11 in Karuzi province. Tie Bank agreed to finauce the final design studies
for these systems. The contract was awarded in March 1990 and the studies began in May 1990.
3.02      In July 1989, MDR requested KfW to finance the works for these four provinces. Following an
appraisal mission in October 1989, KfW agreed to finance the works for the 14 systems in Ngozi and Muyinga
provinces and to apply the institutional and financial arrangements spelled out in the sector policy letter. nie KfW
grant was approved in July 1990 and the bidding process is scheduled to start during the second semester of 1991.
3.03      During a preparation mission in November 1989, meetings were held in Bujumbura with the Belgian
Cooperation (AGCD), which agreed to cofinance the proposed project for the provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza and
Makamba. A Belgian Franc 39 million (US$1.3 million) special agreement was signed by the Belgian and tie
Burundian Governrnents to finance the studies in these 3 provinces. At the same time the government requested
the Bank to finance studies in two other provinces, Gitega and Muramvya.
3.04      During tie appraisal mission, meetings were held with the UNICEF's PEA project, and with NGOs.
Participants agreed to cooperate on the development and protection of about 3,000 springs in the provinces covered
by the project.
Proect Obiectives
3.05      The objectives of the project are:
(a) To improve the living conditions of the population by increasing the quantity snd quality of potable water;
(b) To implement the policy of payment for water, in urban snd in rural areas;
(c) To enhance responsibility of local govenments for maintaining water supply facilities;
(d) To strengthen the institutions involved in water supply; and
(e) To help the govermment develop and implement appropriate institutional arrangements in water supply
sector.
3.06      These objectives are consistent with the decentralization policy of the goverument, and are supported
by the Bank. In particular, the Bank is financing under the second urban development project a study aiming at
improving financial as well as human resources of the communes.
3.07      A mid-term review by govermment and IDA will serve to follow progress, make corrections during
implementation as needed and draw lessons on replicability and sustainability (para.7.01 (f). During this mid-term
review special attention would be given to the findings of the reorganization study of DGHER (para.3.08 C.(a)) and
a relevant action plan would be proposed.
Proiect DescriDtion

Pe t Cost
3.09        The total cost of the project is estimated at FBu 9.02 billion (US$54.7 million), of which US$38.3
million, or approximately 70 percent, represents the foreign exchange component. Base cost estimates are in prices
as of June 1990. This cost includes refinancing of the IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$950,000,
which was approved on March 29, 1991.
3.10        Cost of works were estimated on the basis of consultant's final design studies for works to be carried
out in tL. first four provinces. All cost estimates for civil works and equipment are based on recent bid prices and
quotations for similar works or supply.
3.11        Since goods and equipment for project purposes would be imported free of customs duties and internal
taxes, base costs are net of tax liabilities. Taxes on locally procured goods (mainly cement and fuel), estinuted at
6 percent of local costs, have been included in the estimate. They amount to FBu 32.9 million (US$0. 19 million).
3.12        Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been added to the cost of the works assessed on the basis
of final designs and have been included in the provision for works that will be carried out after final design studies.
The same rate bas been applied for equipment and operating expenses. Physical contingencies of 15 percent have
been added to the base cost for works estimated on the basis of the feasibility study. No physical contingencies
were allowed for technical assistance, training and consulting services. The total amount of physical contingencies,
US$3.44 million, represents 8.2 percent of total base costs.
3.13        The project cost estimates by component and categories of expenditures are summarized in tables 3.2
and 3.3 below and detailed in annex 7.

3.14        Price contingencies have been added to base cost plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies for
local currency expenditures are based on domestic inflation estimated as follows: 8 percent in 1990, 7 percent in
1991, 6 percent in 1992 and 5 percent thereafter. Price contingencies for foreign currency expenditures, are based
on recent estimates of international inflation as follows: 6.3 percent in 1990, 9.0 percent in 1991, 1.1 percent in
1992, 0.4 percent in 1993, 1.6 percent in 1994, 3.8 percent in 1995, 4.0 percent in 1996 and 4.7 percent in 1997.
Price contingencies are estimated at US$9.21 million, or 21.9 percent of total base costs.
Priect FlnançinL Plan
3.15        The proposed project would be financed by: (a) an IDA credit of US$32.7; (b) a !CfW grant of DM
9.5 million (US$6.2 million); (c) a Belgian grant of BF 378.0 million (US$12.6 million); and a Burundese

3.16        During negotiations agteement was reached tdat -he the communes served by the project would
contribute the equivalent of 5 percent of the cost of the works excluding pipe supply or about US$0.85 million (FBu
140 million). This contribution could be in the form of labor, primarily for earthworks and supply of building
mataerials, or monetary contribution (para.7.01 (g)).
3.17        The proposed IDA credit would finance 59.8 percent of total project cost, including 62.4 percent of
foreign exchange requirements and 53.7 percent of local costs. The credit and grants and the government
contribution for the rumal sub sector would be provided to the executing agency (DGHER), and to the communes
a grants.

IMRIentati
3.18       DGHER would be the implementing agency for the the project, except for REGIDESO studies which
would be carried out under responsability of MEM. The general director of D(HER would be assisted by a project
unit financed by the project.
3.19       The project unit (PAEMR) created in the rural water supply project under the authority of DGHER
would continue to coordinate the project implementation. At the end of the project, the project unit would be
merged into DHA under DGHER according to the conclusions of the proposed organization study: PAEMR's
directorate would become the water planning department of DWHER. The maintenance unit would continue to
provide assistance to the communes as a department of DGHER.
3.20       PAEMR would comprise thres units under the esponsibility of the director:
(a)   PAEMR's directorate. This unit would include a project director, an adviser (job description in annex
15) and four support staff (an administrative assistant, an accountant, a secretary, and a driver). The unit
would program project execution and provide for monitoaang and supervision. This task would include
preparing consolidated project accounts, quarterly reports, studies, audits and the project completion report.
(b)   The maintenance unit. This unit would include a maintenance engineer (job description in annex 15,
financed by AGCD), a counterpart and five sanitary engineers. Its role will be to insure technical control
of the systems in operation, to train communal attendants and to assist the communal water utilities with
maintenance problems.
(c)   The accounting control unit. This group of four accouatants would be responsible for on-the-job training
of communal accountants and for annual control of the accounting system of the communal water utilities
during the first four years of in;;iementation. Thereafter this control would be carried out by the
inspection of communal projects in the ministry of the interior.
(d) The sensitization unit. This unit would have ten people: a community development expert (job descrition
in annex 15), a counterpart and eight social workcers. This unit would help the communes set up communal
water utilities and would develop community awareness program to educate the population about the public
health implications of safe water snd the need to support such services by paying for the water. This
program is expected to be completed in four years.
3.21       Construction of the water works would take place in lots corresponding to the supply of pipes and the
implementation of construction by provinces or group of provinces. Each cofinancier would finance different lots
in line with its own procurement regulations. Tie development and protection of springs would be carried out by
UNICEF and NGOs. Annex 5 shows the pro'ect implementation schedule.
3.22       For Gitega and Muramvya provinces, a feasibility study is underway and would determine the needs
of water supply systems to be constructed. Tie projects would be submitted to IDA for review, selection and
approval. The priorities would be based on per capita investment costs and the capacity and willingness of the
population to pay the fees involved. Thereafter final design for selected systems would be prepared and the program
will be implemented.
3.23       Consultants would provide engineering services for feasibility studies, final designs and supervision
on terms considered acceptable by IDA or other cofinanciers.
Training and Sensitization
3.24       Training programs would be established to strengthen institutions and personnel at all levels of
DGHER, tie communes sed the communal water utilities. Tue training program would: (a) upgrade the skills of
DGHER and PAEMR senior staff; (b) improve t1,e skills of the maintenance staff of DGHER and the communa!



- 15 -
water utilities; (c) educate communal administrators and representatives of user's associations in the use of water
supply systems; and (d) upgrade the knowledge of communal accountants in accounting, financial reporting systems
and collection procedures.
3.25      Sensitization would be mainly addressed to the population and the communal and user's association
personnel to raise their awareness rcgarding the advantages of higher-quality potable water and of maintninZ the
systems by paying a fair price for the water.
3.26      The training program would include short-term seminars abroad for DOHER and PAEMR senior staff,
and training sessions in Bujumbura for maintenance engineers and accountants of PAEMR, communal administrators
and communal water utilities employees. A training program for communal accouatants, including accounting
systems of communal water utilities will be carried out under the second urban development project (Cr 1968-BU).
On-the-job training for water supply attendants and communal accountants would be provided by technical assi6tanco
and by PAEMR personnel. A special unit would be created in PAEMR to implement the sensitization program.
This program would tap the expertise of NGOs.
Procurement
3.27      Contracts for civil wors (US$14.3 million) would be awarded after prequalification on the basis of
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and in accordance with the IDA's guidelines. A preference of 7.S percent
would be applied to ICB bids from domestic civil works contractors. Contracts for simple or small works of low
cost (5 contracts; aggregate value not to exceed US$800,000), would be awarded through Local Competitive Bidding
(LCB). The contracts would be advertised locaily but open to foreign bidders, following local procedures that will
be acceptable to the Association. Tiese contracts would cover construction of the communal water utility
workshops.
3.28      The development and conversion of the 3,000 springs scattered in the whole country involvecommunity
participation and sensitization of population. It is proposed to contract directly the services of specialized and
qualified NGO's and UNICEF to continue carrying out this kind of work in their respective areas, at an estimated
cost of US$1.8 million. The Association would review proposed contracts between NGO's and Governement.
3.29      Contracts for supplying pipes (USS8.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's guidelines. A preference equal to the applicable custom duties
and other import taxes, with a maximum of 15 percent, would be applied to the bids of qualified local manufacturers
participating in ICB. Ligit vehicles and office equipment for the DGHER and the PAEMR (aggregate value not
to exceed US$800,000) each valued at more tdan US$10,000 would be purchased through Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB) following procurement procedures that wil be acceptable to the Association. Foreign suppliers are
eligible to participate. Office equipment, furniture, and supplies contracts valued at les than US$10,000 would be
purchased locally on the basis of at least tiree quotations, aggregating to US$250,000.
3.30     T'e Association's guidelines would be used to select consultants for technical assistance (US$l.9
nillion), training (US$0.4 million), and consulting services (US$3.7 million). The conmulting services include
supervision of works (US$1.7 mrillon), final design (USS0.6 million), and 3 studies (aggregate value US$1.2
million) and audits (US$0.2 milion). Contracta financed by KfW and AGCD would be awarded under competitive
bidding limited to nationals of their respective countries.
3.31       The Association would review tender documents and bid award procedures before invitating bids as
well as bid evaluations and proposed contracts for aU civil works estimated at more than US$300,000 and for
equipment valued at more than US$S00,000. Selective post review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels
should be carried out on about 1 in 4 works contracts, and 1 in 6 goods contracts.

Disburmanent
3.33       Tiie schedule of credit disbursements, given in annex 12, is based on the disbursement profile for the
rual water supply project (Credit 1625-BU), except that it bas been adjusted to reflect disbursement for the initial
deposit in the special account sad refiuancing of the PPF. All disbursements will be made against normal
documentation submitted to the Bank, except disbursements against opeating costs and eligible expenditures for
contracts valued at US$20,O00 equivalent or less, which will be made under Statement of Expenditures (SOE).
Supporting documentation for these would be retained by the PAEMR and REGIDESO and would be availablo "o
IDA during supervision. The closing date would be June 30, 1998.
3.34       To ensure prompt availability of funds for the project, IDA and the govemment would each make an
initial deposit. The annual Govemment counterpart fonds in FBu totaling US$0.45 million equivalent would be
deposited in the Project Advance Account at the Central Bank as a condition of credit effectiveness (para.7.02 (a».
The account would be replenished to the same amount quarterly (para.7.01 (h)). A separate Special Account
(revolving fund) in US dollars would be established in a commercial bank with an initial deposit of US$1,500,O00.
Ihe Special Account opening balance was calculated as the equivalent of thre. months of IDA disbursements from
the pruceeds of the proposed credit.

IV. IMPLEMENTiNGiAGENCX
4.01       The Borrower will bc the Government of the Republic of Buwmdi. DGHER would be the
implementing agency for the project except for the REGIDESO studies which would be undertaken under the
supervision of MEM. To ensue good communication betweon the "mistries and institutions involved, and to
oversee project implementation, a steering committoe would be established, comprised of senior representatives
of MDR, MEM, DGHER and REGIDESO. This committee would be convened every three months and would
be chaired by MDR. The establishment of this committec would be a condition of effectiveness (para.7.02 (b)).
DGHER
Orianizadon and Manaumnent
4.02       The General Directorate for Rural Water and Energy (DGHER) was established in 1988 with the
responsibility of improving the supply of potable water in rural areas and implementing rural electrification.
The distribution of responsibilities between DOHER and REGIDESO is not clearly defined (see para. 2.06).
The tranfer of water systems located in rurl coenters to the concemed communes would be a condition of
disbursement for pipes acquisition for the provinces of Kamzi and Kayanza (jara. 7.03). The situation is the
same for electricity services. Under the energy sector rehabilitation project ap: roied in April 1991, it was
agreed that the issue for electricity would be resolved before June 30, 1992.
4.03       The director of DGHER is appointed by the President of the Repu ,lic, upon nomination by the
MDR. The water and sanitation department (DHA) of DGHER has been the in ïplementing agency for the rural
water supply project financed by IDA, which is almost comi leted. Annex 12 s iows the organization chart of
DGHER.
4.04       DGHER's financial performance has to be assessed as that of a departinent of a ministry. While
DGHER enjoys soms independence, its finmacial operations are embodied in the govemment budgetary system.
With the exception of revenues associated with installing electricity meters and billing for electricity, DGHER
does not have any financial resources of its own. These revenues amounted to FBu 60.7 million (US$0.41
million) in 1988; the government contribution was FBu 87.4 million (US$0.53 million). DGHER thus relies on
government appropriations and donors' contributions.
Staffing and Personnel
4.05       In July 1990 DGHER had 101 employees, of which 45 in water operations. Approximately 20
percent of the staff is permanent. These employees are paid according to the salary structure of the public
sector, which is significantly lower than that of parastatal agencies like REGIDESO. The remaining 80 percent
are contract personnel who have higher wages, but do not have the benefits of permanent employment and may
be dismissed at the end of their contract. A technical adviser for rural electrification is already in place
financed by the Belgian Cooperation.
4.06       Administration and accounting for both water supply and rural electrification are weak. DGHER
has recently hired an administrative and financial director and under the energy sector rehabilitation project, a
fince and accountîug expert widl be recmited to improve DGHER's performance assisting in organizing the
commercial and financial aspects. DHA lacks qualified technical staff, and to improve technical performance of
this department, the Belgian Cooperation would extend the contract of the hydraulic engineer already in place
asd the proposed project would provide training and equipment.



- 19 -
4.07       To strengthen its operational and managerial efficiency, a project unit (PAEMR) was established
within DGHER under the rural water supply project. This unit was assisted by three external experts: a project
coordinator, a maintenance engineer, and an accountant. This unit will be in charge of implementing the
proposed project, assisted by a project advisor and a specialist in community relations (IDA financing), and a
maintenance engineer (AGCD financing) (se. para. 3.20). Recruitment of these experts would be a condition of
credit effectiveness (para.7.02 (c)).
Accountine and Auditing
4.08       The law requires DGHER to maintain accounts on an accnual basis using the double entry system
and in accordance with the national accounting system plan. In practice accounts and financial reporting
systems are used to determine compliance with the authorized limits of the budgets for recurrent expenditures
and investment. Neither consolidated nor separated balance sheets or profit and loss accounts exist for water
supply and electricity operations. It is therefore difficult to abstract information and statistics on annual
operating costs for these services.
4.09       Consumer billing is presently limited to DGHER's electricity operations in five centers, using the
same tariff as REGIDESO. To what extent meters are regularly read, bills distributed, and revenues collected
is difficult to assess given the dispersion of services in the country. Initially, in an effort to promote electricity
consumption, DGHER installed connections without up-front payments and did not require regular payment of
electricity bills. This resulted in arrears of about FBu 3 million as of December 31,1989, of which electricity
sales accounted for 80 percent and connection charges for 20 percent. TIe major part (70 percent) is owed by
private sector, the remaining part (30 percent) by government agencies. One of the najor tasks of the finance
and accounting expert would be to improve billing, revenue collection and accounting systetns.
4.10       Systematic reporting of DGHER's operations is weak and somewhat irregular. Though an annual
report is prepared, coverage varies considerably. The finance and accounting expert is expected to establish a
monthly and quarterly management reporting system, mnd to e-:r te that balance sheets, income statements and
fund flow statements are prepared shortly after the end of D(>1'C-R's financial year. Tie appointee will also
establish procedures for allocating expenditures between Wati udi electricity.
4.11       During negotiations, it was agreed that DGHER woul i provide to the Bank: (a) quarterly reports
covering the progrs of the prtect and other operations, w'.co-.d0g to a system of monitoring indicators; (b)
separate accounts for its water arid electncity operations from F': >1; and (c) a project completion report on the
basis of a stipulated outline within six months of the closing date -n the credit (para.7.01 (i), (j) and (k».
4.12       Under the rural water supply project, DGHER agrid mat its accounts and financial statements
would be audited by an external auditor and submitted to the Bank s i,?in six months of the end of each fiscal
year. DGHER's finance and accounting office has not been able tu st the six-month deadline. Audited
accounts for 1987 and 1988 were delayed by up to one year. T'he i.eorta that have been received are heavily
qualified. Auditors highlight the incomplete recording of accounting tansactions, the lack of accounting
procedures, and deficiencies in the follow-up and monitoring of billirg, collection and transfer of revenues.
Because of these deficiencies the books do not provide a reliable and &ccllrate picture of the financial position of
DGHER. This situation will be improved as a result of the technical assistance to be provided under the energy
sector rehabilitation project.
4.13       The audited financial statenients for 1989 and 1990 are not yet available. Under the rural water
supply project a short-term accounting expert has been recently recruited to put in order the DGHER's accounts
before auditing. Presentation of the 1989 &ccounts to the Bank was a condition of negotiations. The auditing
firm has been hired and presentation of the 1989 and 1990 audit reports would be a condition of credit
effectiveness (para.7.02 (d)). During negotiations, assurance was obtained that the DGHER would provide
witiin 6 months of the end of each fiscal year (a) its audited financial statements; and (b) the audited accounts
for the rural components of the proposed project (par. 7.01 (1)).

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.         SuL M
5.01       Under the rural water supply project, a system of water charges was implemented in the 33
communes covered by the project. The charges for water consumption were set to: (a) guarantee the proper
maintenance of the systems financed under the project, and (b) to sustain the operating utilities. The proposed
project is expected to extend the same cost recovery approach to the whole country.
5.02       The facilities wilI be handed over to the communal water supply utilities (and to the intercommunal
water authorities). These entities will be responsible for O.& M. and replacement. The govemment will retain
responsibility for servicing the credit received for the proposed project. Accordingly, this credit will not appear
in the financial accounts of the water utilities or the commnunes.
Demand Projections
5.03       Projections of water consumption have been made for three separate categories: standpipe users,
private connections and public connections. Standpipe users are assumed to have a demand for 20 Icd when the
systems become fully operational (between 1994 and 1996). This demand is assumed to remain at this level
until 2005, the last year for which demand and financial projections are made. Consumption is expected to rise
with the population; estimates for increases in each of the provinces range from 2.7 to 3.0 percent a year.
Standpipe users will be responsible for almost 90 percent of all consumption (see annex 9). Private connection
users are assumed to have a consumption of 100 Icd and an annual growth rate of about 3 percent, while
consumption from public connections (schools, hospitals, govemment offices) is expected to grow on the
average by 15 percent a year.
Oneration and Maintenance, Renewal Coasl
5.04       O.& M. coste are calculated taing account of the length of each system, and include permanent
and temporary personnel costs, administrative expenses and a provision for smaUl repairs. Renewal costs are
determined on the basis of a 40-year life for civil works, pipes, and buildings and calculated to increase by 0.1
percent a ycar, starting froin 0.5 percent of the investment the first year of operation.
Water Revenues. Water Tariff and Annual Fee
5.05       Water revenues are calculated to cover the expenses of the communal water utilities and generate
a 5 percent income to finance small extensions. Operation and maintenance costs and renewal charges are
projected ta1ing into account a 6 percent inflation rate from the time the system is fully operational until 1996
and 5 percent thereafter. Projections have been made on the basis of a collection rate of 75 percent. There is no
assumption of voluntary work in the projections. Income statements per conunune are shown in Annex 10.
5.06       Water revenues would be deposited in a special account at the 'Coopératives d'Epargne et de
Crédit' (COOPECs) or local banks and used to pay the expenses of the communal water utilities including
permanent and temporary personnel salaries, administrative expenditures, operating costs, repairs, small
extensions of the systems and replacement. The communal project inspection department of the Ministry of
Interior would inspect the financial accounts of the communal water utilities.
5.07       Based on acual costs, including O.& M. costs and renewal charges, excluding the financial
charges for the credit, the water tariff per cubic meter for public and private connections in 1990 real terms
ranges from FBu 38 to 68 (US 23 to 41 cents). Based on the same assumptions, the annual fee in 1990 value



- 21 -
for a family using a standpipe would range from FBu 455 to 1,025 (US$2.75 to 6.20). Annex 9 shows the
amount of annual feus and the water tariff per commune.
5.08       Dunng negotiations assurance was obtained from the govemment that: (a) water tariff for public
and private connections and annual fec for standpipes users b. sufficient to cover operation, maintenance and
renewal costs; (b) charges be reviewed annually by end of October of each year to determine their adequacy; (c)
revenues be deposited in a separate accouzt and payments from this account be made only for expenses related
to water supply; (d) water accounts of communal water utilities bh annually verified by the inspectors of the
Ministry of Interior; and (e) reports related to the inspection of the accounts bh made available to the
Association for its review (para.7.01 (m».
Affordabilitx
5.09       In most of the water systems the annual fee per family would amount to 1.2 to 2.8 percent of
annual average cash income 10/. It is generally agreed that such a contribution for safe water is acceptable
if it remains below 3 percent. KfW recently proposed an annual fee of FBu 1,000 for beneficiaries in the
provinces of Ngozi and Muyinga which represents about 2.8 percent of the average cash income. When some
beneficiaries incomes are well below the average, the communes will have to provide subsidies for these users,
or include a level of cross-subsidy in the tariffs.
5.10       During construction the communes served by the project would contribute the equivalent of 5
percent of the cost of the works excluding pipe supply and this contribution could be in the form of labor.
Community participation in construction poses no difficulty as the population traditionally contributes half a day
a week to improve communal facilities. This labor would be made more productive by the involvement of
NGOs that have some experience in working with the communes. After construction the effect of the project on
communal budgets would be minimal because recurrent expenditures would be puid for by the beneficiaries. If
the water board fails to fulfill its functions, the commune would continue to pay the salary of the communal
water attendants already in place.
B. Urban Sub sector - REGIDESO
Past Financial Performance
5.11       Salient features highlighting REGIDESO's historical operating results and present positions are
sualyzed in the SAR of the recently approved energy sector rehabilitation project and are shown in detail in
aunex 11. REGIDESO's revenues from the sales of electricity and water increased from FBu 1,542 million in
1987 (US$10.3 million) to FBu 1,836 million (US$12.2 million) in 1989. This represents an increase of about
20 percent. Excessive capital investments, inordinate borrowing, and the devaluation of the FBu have brought
total expenses, which have increased of about 95 percent from 1987 to 1989, to levels incompatible with
revenues. As a result, loses increased from FBu 331 million in 1987 (US$2.2 million) to FBu 3,303 million in
1989 (US$22 million).
lmgrovements of Presen¢ Situation
5.12       To improve its performance REGIDESO has agreed under the energy sector rehabilitation project
to: (a) implement a management assistance partnership program ; (b) implement a financial restructuring plan;
(c) reduce the staff of permanent agents to about 600 in 1993; (d) implement a trining program; (e) implement
an intensive program of new connections in urban areas; (f) reduce the amount of its teceivables; (g) review
annually electricity and water tariffs after exchange of views witb the Bank; and (h) improve administrative
buildings and facilities.
L lu rnual arems die annual average cash income is estimated at about FBu 36,000 in 1989.



- 22 -
5.13      On the basis of the audited accounts for 1989, REGIDESO's capital restsucturing would requite an
additional capital increase of FBu 10.4 billion before an acceptable debt-equity ratio is achieved. The capital
increase docs not roquite a new outlay from the government, but outstanding current liabilities estimated at
about FBu 3.4 billion, would bave to be converted to equity. In addition, KFW (Germany) and CCCE (France)
have agreed to forgive part of their loans to the goverament for investmests by REGIDESO as a further
increase in equity. Tmes matters are under study by the government. Finally, the ongoing revaluation exercise
is expected to result in a revaluation s"plus of about FBu 25.4 billion that, according to internationally accepted
accouating practices, could be used to absorb exchange loses and help in the financial restructuring.
Arrars and CObgI»
5.14      At the end of 1989 the balance on receivables for both electricity and water amounted FBu 1,272
billion (US$8.5 million) of which 73 percent from the private sector, and represented 8.6 months of sales.
Through compensation of debts all the balances due from govermnent and municipalities as of December 31,
1988, were paid in 1989. At the end of march 1990, 41 percent of the amount due had been paid so that
arrears represent 4.4 months. A policy of systeniatic cut-off of electricity for delinquent accounts was
established in September 1989 and have resulted in some improvements in billing and collection. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that REGIDESO would set up a similar policy for systematic cut off of
water hi the case of delinquent water accounts of more than 3 months (para.7.01 (n».
Water Tarif
5. 15     At an average of Fbu 40 (US 24 cents), the level of present water tariff per m3 is insufficient. In
1987 the cost per m3 calculated on the fuU cost basis was FBU 54. Furthermore, the structure of tariffs which
ranges from FBu 36 to 44 (US 22 to 27 cents) is inadequate. During negotiations, agreement was reached that
a first step tariff increase of 15 percent for users wihose consumption is higher than 10 m3 per month, would be
implemented before December 31, 1991 (para.7.01 (o».
5.16      The proposed project would finance a study to update tariffs, the structure and level of which are
to retlect the real cost of service, while also taking into account the financial capacity of the various income
groups of consumers. During negotiations agreement was reached that (a) the Government would present to the
Bank an action plan for implementation of new tariffs based on the findings and recommendations of tus study
by July 1992 (para.7.01 (p»; (b) implementation of these tariffs would begin in Septem'v-r 1992 and should be
completed by September 1995 (para.7.01 (Oq; and (c) the Government would undertake an annual review with
the Bank of REGIDESO's water tariffs by the end of October (para 7.01 (r».
feflo[Tance ConËrac
5.17      A comprehensive study of REGIDESO was completed by a management consultant in April 1989.
The suggested rehabilitation program was reviewed by the govemment and approved by all the principal donors
(KfW, GTZ, CCCE end IDA). This program was incorporated in a performance contract signed between the
govermment and REGIDESO in July 1989. In compliance with the performance contract, the government
increased electricity tariffs in April 1990, restructwred the board of directors of REGIDESO, paid all public
debts as of December 31, 1988, and authorized a capital increase as compensation for past debts. Some
improvements have already also ben noted, such as a new policy to increase connections, a reduction in the
delays for billings to 15 days, deposit of cash surpluses in revenue-producing bank accounts, a reduction in
personnel (230 in 1989), mad the creation of planning and internal auditing units. To help REGIDESO
implement the performance contract, the energy sector rehabilitation project will finance a management
asstance partneraisp program with an operator experienced mi the mnanagement mad rehabilitation of public
utilities md which would have responsibility for some key activities in the financial, commercial, planning, mnd
pe- om     _agmt mias.

Future financial Poition
5.18      The projected financial statements of REGIDESO from 1990 to 2000 are presented in annex 11.
Actions mentioned earlier produced positive levels of operating income (before interest) in 1990. Thereafter
income rises to FBu 2,155 million in 1995. All expenses, including interest, would be covered by revenues in
1993. In 1990 REGIDESO financed about 33 percent of its investment program, and would maintain that
amount in the future. The rate of return on fixed assets was only 0.9 percent in 1990, and would increuse to
2.9 percent in 1991, and 4.9 rercent in 1992. The debt service coverage ratio improves from 1.17 in 1990 to
2.22 in 1995. REGIDESO's liquidity position becomes comfortable with an increase in the current ratio from
1.17 in 1990 to 1.56 in 1995 and the debt-equity ratio is satisfactory throughout the period. With improvements
in management and operational efficiency, satisfactory investment programs, adequate electricity and water
tariffs, and the financial restructuring described above, REGIDESO can become financially viable.

VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
lroiject Benefit
6.01      The proposed project will directly benefit some 1,150,000 people, providing safe potable water
through developed springs, standpipes or house connections. It is not possible to quantify the health benefits
due to safe water since many factors influence improvements in health. Nevertheless, the water-bome diseases
that are prevalent in Burundi (see Annex 3) would be checked and the number of sick days is expected to
decline. Family members, almost exclusively women and children, travel long distances for water every day,
particularly in the dry season. In nuav cases the possibility of drawing safe water close to the living areas
should provide time savings that can bc used for other activities.
6.02      A further important benefit is the gain from developing communal responsibility for local utilities.
The principle of communal participation should reinforce the communal structure and serve as the basis for
other improvements in human resource development. Local management of the water systems should ensure
proper O.& M. and demonstrate to the beneficiaries that the fees will be more than offset by their improved
physical well-being due to a safe water supply. With regard to institutional aspects, the proposed project would
not only benefit the communes but would also result in improvements in planning, executing, supervising and
operating rural water systems at the country level. This institutional strengthening should provide the basis for
extending and replicating future water systems and other social investments. In addition, the project will
enhance the cost recovery mechanisms in urban areas, and therefore improve the financial situation of
REGIDESO.
Prooect lustification
6.03      The proposed project will provide safe potable water supply for 24 percent of the rural population.
The resulting improvement in health standards will contribute to the country's goal of developing human
resources and increasing agricultural production. The principle of delegating responsibility for the water
systems to the local level is a step toward decentralization, and should minimize the incremental burden on the
national budget.
Least Cost Solution
6.04      The project selected the most economic alternatives for meeting the demand. Wherever possible,
springs and gravity water systems were identified and proposed. All the systems requiring pumping stations or
treatment plants were rejected because the population could not afford the expenses of O.& M..
Environmental lnmact
6.05       An assessment was made at the project appraisal stage of the potential enviroumental impact of the
proposed project. The rural water supply systems and the development of springs have been designed taking
into account environmental considerations and they would reduce water losses and contamination. fle only
negative enviroumental impact of the proposed project could result from the unsafe disposal of used water. fle
water quantities that will be drawn from public standpipes and yard connections, however, will be relatively
small. Therefore, the threat of pollution of aquifers is negligible. On balance, the environmental impact of the
proposed project can therefore be considered positive.
6.06      Concerning future studies, they should cover such environmental issues as pollution resulting from
increasing of water consumption. In addition suitable safeguards will be incorporate in bidding documents and
contracts to minimize potential environmental damage caused by civil works.



-25 -
Women's Rrle
6.07       As in most African countries, provision of water in Burundi is the woman's task, with assistance
from the children. Women are responsible for food preparation and use most of the family's water. This
project would reduce the time women spend collecting water and allow them to engage in more productive
activities. It is important that a significant number of women be elected to the commune-wide users committees
and communal water boards. Families would be less reluctant to pay for water if women were responsible for
collecting water charges.
Jmpact on Poverty Group
6.08       The poverty threshold is estimated in 1989 at 40 percent of the per capita GNP (US$80).
Assuming a family of 4.6 persons, the poverty threshold is US$368 per family per year, or FBU 60,720. This
sum is about the average revenue, including self consumption, in rural areas. Therefore the poverty group in
the project areas is estiniated at 70 percent of the total population covered by the project, which represents about
800,000 people at the time of project completion.
Project Risks
6.09       The proposed project largely builds on experience gained during the rumal water supply project and
other Bank-fmanced projects. The major risks are not associated with the design and construction of the water
systems, but with sustained maintenance of the systems in rural areas. Experience in Africa has siown that tie
best results can be obtained by delegating responsibility to the village level and fostering the sense of communal
ownership. Questions remain as to whether the population can be sufficiently motivated over a long period to
pay the fees and to join in communal efforts when the system needs repairs. The training and technical
assistance provided to DGHER, as well as the sensitization program for the population, should minimize this
risk.
6.10       However, it would not be prudent to assume diat the communal water utilities could solve ail the
maintenance problems on their own. The necessary outside support would be provided by DGHER. This raises
the question of whether DGHER could provide this, even after completion of the project. Tue techuical
assistance and the comprehensive training program provided to the maintenance assistance unit of PAEMR,
which would be a department of DGHER at the end of the project, would reduce this risk tG acceptable levels.
6.11       In the urban sub sector the main risks are that (a) the govemment may resist further increases in
water tariffs; and (b) REGIDESO may be reluctant to implement the program proposed under the energy sector
rehabilitation project. The fact that the government decided to increase electricity tariffs recently, and the
interest of REGIDESO in preparation of the rehabilitation program suggest these risks are low.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached at Negotiations
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the government on the following points:
(a)    Before June 30, 1991, instructions for standpipes management and payment of water by users in
centers operated by REGIDESO would be sent to local authorities (para. 1.16)
(b)    Before the end of 1993, the financial and institutional arrangements for the rural water supply sub-
sector would be formalized, taking into account the experience g8ined after three years of
implementation of the new policy (para.2.08);
(c)    Before starting works in a specified commune the communal water utility would be established
(para.2. 10);
(d)    During project implementation, updated tdree-year expenditure and investment prograns would be

following fiscal year (para.2. 18);
(f)    A mid-term review would be organi.-ed by December 1994, concurrently by IDA and government
to assess the project achievements and to take the corrective measures that might be needed
(para.3.07);
(g)    The communes would contribute the equivalent of 5 percent of the cost of the works excluding pipe
supply. This participation could be in the form of labor-or monetary contribution (para 3.16);
Oi)    The project advance account would be replenisied quarterly with government counterpart funds in
FBu to bring the level of the account to US$0.45 million equivalent (para.3.34);
(i)    DGHER would present separate accounts for its water and electricity operations from 1991
(para.4. 1 1);
(j)    Quarterly progress reports would be prepared by PAEMR and submitted to IDA within two months
after the end of the quarter (para.4. 11);
(k)    DGHER would prepare a completion report and submit it to IDA within six months of the credit
closing date (para.4.11);
(1)    Accounts of DGHER, as well as project accounts, would be audited annually by external auditors
acceptable to IDA, and audit reports would bu subniitted to IDA within six months of the close of
the fiscal year (para.4.13);
(m)    Water charges would be sufficient to cover opemtion, maintenance end renewal costs and would be
reviewed annually by the end of October to determine their adequacy; revenues would be deposited
in a separate account and payment from this account be made only for expes related to water
supply; water accounts of communal water utilities would be verified annually by the inspectors of
the government; snd reports related to the inspection of th. accounts would be made available to
the Association for its review (para.5.08).



- 27 -
(n)    REGIDESO would set up of a policy for systematic cut off of water in respect to delinquent water
accounts (para.5. 14);
(o)    Urban water tariffs for users whose consumption i8 higher than 10 m3 per month would be
increased by 15 percent before December 31, 1991 (para.5.15).
(p)    New structure and level of urban water tariffs would be prepared by REGIDESO and submitted to
the Bank, as well as an action plan for implementation of new tariffs by July 1992 (para.5.16);
(q)    Implementation of new tariffs would begin in September 1992 and should ba completed by
September 1995 (para.5. 16); and
(r)    The govermment would undertake annual reviews with the Bank of REGIDESO's water tariffs by
the end of October (para.5. 16).
Conditions of Effectiveness
7.02      Before effectiveness of the proposed credit, the govermmat should have:
(a)    Established a project advance account in FBu in the BRB, and made an initial deposit equivalent to
US$0.45 million (para.3.34).
(b)    Established a steering committee to oversea project implementation (para.4.01);
(c)    Hired the three technical assistants for the execution of the rural water supply components of the
project (para.4.07); and
(d)    Sent to the Bank the audit reports of DGHER's accounts for 1989 and 1990 (para.4. 13).
Conditions of Dishursement
7.03      Transfer of water systems located in rural centers to the concerned communes should be effective
prior to any disbursement for the pipes acquisition for the provinces of Kani and Kayanza
(para.2.06 and 4.02).

BURUNDI
SECTEUR DE L'EAU ET DE L'ASSAINISSEMENT
LETTRE DE POLITIOUE SECTORELLE
A. SituatiOn Actuelle du Secteur
Organisation Institutionnelle
1.       L'eau potable dans les centres urbains est produite et distribuée par la REGIDESO, entreprise publique
créée par le décret-loi No. 1/196 du 2 Octobre 1968. La REGIDESO est supervisée et contrôlée par le Ministbre
de l'Energie et des Mines. Aux termes de l'article 3 du décret No. 100/12 du 11 Mars 1986, portant modification
des statuts de la REGIDESO, l'établissement a pour mission 'le captage et la distribution d'eau.. .dans les centres
jugés importants par les autorités compétentes". Pris le même jour, le décret No. 100/13, portant classification des
centres urbains, déterminait 23 centres en plus de la capitale: deux villes principales, neuf villes secondaires, dix
centres à vocation urbaine et deux centres ruraux. Ces 23 centres sont le domaine d'action de la REGIDESO, en
plus de Bujumbura.
2.        L'eau potable en milieu rural est la responsabilité de la Direction Générakl de l'Hydraulique et des
Energies Rurales (DGHER), du Ministère du Développement Rural. Cette stucre avait été créé par décret
No. 100/18 du 2 Février 1979, sous le nom de Département de l'Hydraulique et de l'Electrification Rurales (DHER).
Le décret No. 100/209 du 22 Décembre 1988 l'a transform6 en la DOHER, avec un Département de l'Hydraulique
et de l'Assainissement (DHA).
3.        L'assainissement en milieu urbain est contrôlé par le Mînistére des Travaux Publics et du Développement
Urbain. La Régie des Services Techniques Municipaux (SETEMU), crée par le décret No 100/162 du 12 Juillet
1983, et réorganisée par celui No 100/151 du 20 Juillet 1989, placée sous la tutIle de la Mairie de Bujumbura, a
en charge, dans la capitale, l'assainissement des eaux usées et pluviales. Elle s'occupe également de l'enlèvement
des ordures ménagàres, de l'entretien de la voirie, de la construction et de l'entretien des équipements municipaux.
Le financement de la SETEMU est assré notamment par la municipalité de Bujumbura. L'assainissemet des
centres secondaires urbains est de la responsabilité des communes assistées par le Ministère des Travaux Publics
et du Développement Urbain.
4.        Le décret No. 100/226 du 11 Décembre 1989 a cré la Commission Nationale de l'Eau et de l'Energie,
chargée de coordonner les actions dans ces secteurs. Elle est présidée par le t 'inistre ayant l'Energie dans ses
attributions, et comprend deux sous-commissions: une sous-com"ission nationale Je l'eau et une sous-commission
nationale de l'énergie dont les membres ont été nommés par l'Ordonnance Ministérielle 760/074/90 du 10 Février
1990.
Niveaux de Service
5.        Environ 92 % de la population urbaine est desservie en eau, 409% au moyen de branchements particuliers
et 52% par des bomes-fontaines. Dans les zones ruales, le taux de desserte est passé de 22% en 1982 à 48% à
la fin de 1990, sur une population urale de 5.03 millions. Le taux de desserte varie considérablement d'une
province à l'autre. Environ 17% de la population rurale est desservie par des adductions, 31 % par des sources
aménagées et 0,3 % par des puits. Au début de l'année 1990 il y avait en service 338 adductions, alimentant 2765
bomes-fontaies et 1921 branchements particuliers, 11000 sources aménagées et 97 puits.

6.        Pour l'assainissement il est estimé que 20% de la population de Bujumbura utilise des fosses septiques
ou des latrines améliorées, ce pourcentage étant le même pour le milieu rural, où seules sont utilisées des latrines.
B. Politique Sectorielle du Gouvemement
Objectifs du Gouvernement
7.        Les objectifs du Gouvernement pour l'an 2000 sont, pour l'eau potable, d'assurer un niveau de desserte
de 98% dans les centres urbains et celui de la totalité des populations des zones rurales, sous la réserve de leur
équipement dans des conditions géographiquement possibles. Pour l'assainissement, l'objectif est que 70% de la
populationde la ville de Buiumbara, et 60% de celle des centres urbains et du milieu rural dispose d'un systhne
adéquat d'assainissement, pouvant aller, suivant les zones, de l'assinissement collectif aux fosses septiques et aux
latrines améliorées. Afin de satisfaire ces objectifs, la politique sectorielle du Gouvernement est la suivante:
Recouvrement des Coûts
8.        La politique du Gouvernement est que la totalité des coûts soit supportée par les bénéficiaires dans les
centres urbains, aussi bien pour l'eau que pour l'assainissement. Dans cette optique, les tarifs de l'eau et les futures
xodalités de recouvrement des charges de l'assainissement feront l'objet d'une revue régulière permettant de les
ajuster à l'évolution des coûts, l'objectif étant d'atteindre en plusieurs années le coût marginal à long terme. En
particulier le Gouvernement veillera à ce que soient appliqués les articles 11 et 24 du Contrat Plan signé entre la
REGIDESO et le Gouvernement en date du 7 Juillet 1989, conformément au plan d'action figurant en partie D de
la présente lettre.
9.        Dans les zones rurales, le Gouvernement est décidé à ne faire prendre en charge par les populations
bénéficiaires que les fais de fonctionnement, d'entretien et de renouvellement, le coût des investissements restant
à la charge de l'Etat. Cette politique pourra être revue à moyen terme, pour tenir compte de l'amélic ion espérée
de la situation économique des populations rurales.
Délimitation des Responsabilités entre REGIDESO et DGHER
10.      Le Gouvemement a confié à la REGIDESO la gestion de centres ruraux qui ne figurent pas dans la
classification des centres urbains définie par le décret No. 100/13 du Il Mars 1986, mentionné ci-dessus. Le
Gouvernement, par souci de bien définir les responsabilités de chacun et en application de sa politique de
décentralisation, fera rétrocéder la gestion de ces centres aux communes concemnes. Là où l'appui technique de
la REGIDESO s'avèrera indispensable, les communes concernées passeront avec REGIDESO un contrat d'entretien
technique des installations, moyennant une rémunération. Pour couvrir ces frais, la commune gardera la
responsabilité de percevoir les redevances n6cessaires auprès des populations bénéficiaires. Néanmoins, la commune
sera libre de confier l'entretien technique à une société privée si elle le préfsre.
Dl5centralisation des ResRgonsabilit&s
En milieu rural:
11.      Au cours de sa sdance du 16 Août 1990, le Conseil des Ministres a analysé les problèmes relatifs à
l'alimentation en eau en milieu nual. Il a pris la décision de faire préparer par le Ministre de l'Intérieur le Ministre
du Développement Rural et le Ministre de l'Energie et des Mines une Note d'Instructions à adresser à tous les
Gouvemneurs de Provinces et à tous les Administrateurs Communaux.



Annex 1
Page 3 of 6
- 30 -
12.       Cette Note d'Instruction confie aux communes la responsabilité de l'approvisionnement en eau potable
de leurs populations. Les communes sont propriétaires de toutes les installations d'alimentation en eau se trouvant
sur leur territoire, à l'exception de celles gérées par la REGIDESO. Le Gouvemement, à travers les services ayant
l'hydraulique rurale dans leurs attributions, assurera aux communes l'assistance technique nécessaire pour les aider
à exploiter correctement les infrastructures existantes et à en construire de nouvelles chaque fois que cela sera
nécessaire, et que les moyens le permettront.
13.       Dans chaque commnune sera créée une Régie Communale de l'Eau, dotée de l'autonomie financière.
Les modalités d'organisation et de fonctionnement de la Régie sont précisées dans la Note d'instructions diffusée
auprès des Gouvemeurs de Provinces et des Administrateurs Communaux sur l'organisation de l'approvisionnement
en eau en milieu rural.
14.       La régie communale de l'eau prendra en charge les salaires des fontainiers et autres personnels
travaillant pour la régie, les achats d'outillages et de foumitues, les travaux et la provision de renouvellement. Ces
dépenses seront couvertes par le produit des ventes d'eau aux abonnés disposant d'un branchement particulier, et
des redevances perçues auprès des usagers des bomes fontaines publiques, sources aménagées, puits, etc. La
perception des factures d'abonnés est assurée par le fontainier qui relève les compteurs et celle des redevances par
le responsable de point d'eau. Ils transmettront la recette au trésorier de la régie qui la déposera au compte ouver^
au nom de la régie dans une banque ou autre institution financière. Un contrôle bimestriel sera assuré par les
responsables (trésorier et président) de la Régie.
15.       Le Gouvemement prendra les mesures nécessaires pour que les comptes des régies communales soient
vérifiés chaque année par les services concernés du Ministère du Développement Rural et du Ministere de
l'Intérieur.
16.       Dans le cas où plusieurs communes devront se grouper pour réaliser et exploiter en commun un ou
plusieurs réseaux d'alimentation en eau, il sera créée une Régie Intemmunale de l'Eau, qui fonctionnera suivant
les mêmes principes. En particulier, un Comité Intercommunal d'Usagers sera créé pour la gestion des réseaux.
Les relations entre les bénéficiaires des infrastructures hydrauliques et la Régie Communale de l'Eau s&n' diéfinies
par le Règlement de la Régie Communale de l'Eau, le même pour toutes les communes.
En milieu urbain:
17.       Au cours de sa séance du 21 Février 1991, le Conseil des Ministres a analysé les problèmes relatifs à
la gestion des bornes fontaines en milieu urbain, et a pris la décision de faire payer l'eau aux usagers de ces points
publics de distribution. Il a décidé qu'une Note d'instructions, à adresser à tous les Gouverneurs de Provinces, au
Maire de Bujumbura, et aux Administrateurs communaux, soit élaborée dans les meilleurs délais, comme on l'a fait
pour le milieu rural.
18.       Cette Note d'instructions confie à la Mairie et aux communes la responsabilité et la gestion des bornes
fontaines par la création de Comités d'Usagers par avenue. Chaque Comité d'Usagers sera composé de trois
membres.
19.       Chaque ménage utilisateur d'une borne fontaine devra participer aux frais de production, de distribution,
et de gestion de la REGIDESO, en versant une redevance annuelle minimum de 1.200 FBu au Comité d'Usagers.
Cetre participation forfaitaire pourra étre revue en fonction des coGts de la REGIDESO.
20.       La totalité des sommes collectées par les Comités d'Usagers seront remises à la Mairie et aux
communes. Elles permettront de règler les tactutes émises par la REGIDESO. Ces factures correspondront aux
consommations réelles d'eau aux points d'eau publics.
21.       Le suivi de cette organisation sera assuré par l'Administration en Mairie de Bujumbura et dans les
Communes urbaines. Elles devront organiser des réunions de coordination et de mise en place des Comités
d'Usagers par zone et par quartier, et de sensibilisation des populations utilisatrices des bornes fontaines.

23. De nombreux programmes, qualifiés de desserte maximale, viennent d'6tre lancés avec l'aide de différents
bailleurs de fonds:
IQJ:     Provinces de Kayanza et Karuzi. Les études d'exécution sont en cours et seront terminées à la fin du
premier semestre 1991. 29 adductions pour un montant de 15 millions de dollars E.U.;
Provinces de Gitega et Muramvya. Les études de faisabilité sont en cours de réalisation. Le
financement prévu pour les travaux est de 9 millions de dollars E.U.;
KfW:      Provinces de Ngozi et Muyinga. Les études d'exécution, financées par IDA, sont terminées. Douze
adductions pour un montant de 10 millions D.M.;
Province de Ruyigi. La consultation a été lancée pour les études de faisabilité;
Provinces de Bujumbura et Bururi. La consultation pour l'étude de faisabilité sera lencée au cours de
l'année 1991.
AGCD:   Provinces de Cibitoke, Bubanza et Makamba. La consoltation va être lancée pour les études de
faisabilité et d'exécution. Le financement prévu est de 350 millions de Francs Belges.
FED:      Province de Cankuzo. Le démarrage des travaux commence à la fin du 2o semestre avec financement
italien;
Province de Rutana. Les travaux de 17 réseaux ( et de 4 réseaux complémentaires en province de
Cankuzo), seront lancés en 1992 dans le cadre du Vllo FED;
Région naturelle de Mugamba. Les études d'exécution des réseaux sont en cours. Le programme
couvre 3 provinces et 12 communes et le financement disponible est de 1,5 million écus;
Province de Kirundo. Accord de principe pour un programme de couverture totale à lancer dans le
cadre du VlIo FED.
UNICEF: Projet Eau et Assainissement (PEA). Aménagement de sources sur l'ensemble du pays, et d'adductions
pour desservir les centres de santé et les écoles dans les provinces de Bubanza, Makamba, Cibitoke
et Muramvya.
ONG:      Des ONG interviennent dans le sous-secteur de l'alimentation en milieu nual.
24.    Tous ces programmes devraient permettre de porter le taux de desserte des populations rurales entre 70%
et 80% en 1997, sur une population rurale qui sera passée de 5,03 millions en 1990 à environ 5,9 millions.
D'autres programmes à venir permettront d'augmenter ce taux de desserte.

25.       Au cours de la même période plusieurs progmmeS de réhabilitation et d'extension de réseaux de
distribution d'eau à Bujumbura et dans les centres secondaires urbains seront réalisds avec les financements de
diff6rents baifeurs de fonds:
Villes de Kirundo, Muyinga et Rumonge. Travaux d'extension des réseaux de distribution d'eau dans
ces trois communes Début des travaux prévu ri Io semestre 1991 pour un montant de 5,6 miUiond
de DM;
Villes de Ruyigi, Karuzi, Buhiga, Mabanda et trois quartiers autour de Bujumbua. Programme de
renforcement et d'extension des systOmes d'alimentation en eau. Lancement des études de faisabilité
en Mars 1991. Financement affecté à l'étude 50.000 DM;
Villes de Bururi, Cibitoke et Makamba. Programme d'amélioration de l'alimentation en eau potable.
La consultation pour l'étude de faisabilité sea lancée avant la fin de l'année 1991.
CCCE      Réhabilitation de l'ancien réseau du centre de la ville de Bujumbura. La définition de l'opération sera
effectuée au cours de l'année 1991.
26.       Tous ces programmmes devraient permettre de poner le taux de desserte de la population urbaine à
98 %, en am6f rant en m8me temps les conditions de service offertes aux populations déjà bén£flciaires des réseaux.
Reue Annuelle du ProYmme Sectoriel d'Investissenent
27.    Le programme d'investissement du secteur de l'eau et de l'assainissement sera revu chaque année dans le
cadre de l'examen global des investissements de l'Etat, en vue d'assurer que 'Ous les investissements du secteur
s'insrent bien dans le Programme d'Investissements Publics (PIP).
Coordination du Seteu
28.       Pour assurer une bonne coordination du secteur, la Commission Nationale de l'Eau et de l'Energie
organisera chaque année, à date fxe, une table ronde des bailleurs de fonds int6ress8 par le secteur. Cette table
ronde r6unira en priorit£ les financiers et cofinanciers des projets en cours, en vue de leur supervision, mais sera
ouverte aux autres bailleurs de fonds potentiels.

WAM-R SlJPPY SECIOR PROlE:C
Update of the Urban Water Tariff Study
Tenis of Reference
A. CONTEXT
1.       The existing REGIDESO's tariffs do not allow the utility to cover operating costs. In addition, te tariff
structure is inadequate and penalizes the small consumers.
2.       In 1987, an institutional and tariff study financed by ADF, for both the urban and nwal water supply
and sewerage sectors was camried out by SOGREAH. Tie recommendations were not implemented, and updating
of this study is necessary.
3.       The main objective of this updating water rates study is to lay the groundwork for the introduction of
new potable water rates, the structure and level of which are to reflect the res! cost of service, while also taldng
into account the financial capacity of the various income groups. The new rates should also encourage long-tern
conservation of water.
B. FIR STSlAGE
4.       Ihe first phase of the study shall review in detail the current rate structure and its changes over the last
ten years acompared with changes in the cost of living. It sh.ll cover the cost per m' of water as well as the
charges for lease of meters, maintenance of connections and meters, cost of private connections and simnilar services.
5.       The mainly tasks to be performed by the consultant are the following:
(a)   revaluation of the total fixed assets as of the date of the study, mentioning ail investments to be made
over the next ten years;
(b)   projection of water consumption by user category and monthly volume: leus than In m3, from 10 to
20 m3, from 20 to 50 m  and more than 50 m;
(c)   projection year by year of operating costa, based on expected consumption and planned investments.
Tie share of unbilled water should steadily decrease from its current level to 20% by the end of the 10-
year period;
(d)   computation of the long-tern marginal cosa per m3 of water based on the cost of planned expansions and
projected operating costs. A 10% discount rale shal b. applied to water costs and volumes; and
(e)   Using existing studies, drawing up a table of income groups.
C. SECOND STAGE
6.       The Consultant shall then propose a rate policy designed tn accomplish the following objectives:
(a)   the lowest income groups should have access to potable water at a cost not exceeding 2% of the
household budget;
(b)   as many households as possible should be able to have private connections, to be achieved by reducing
the charge for installation to the actual cosm and spr.ading payment over four years at low interest;
(c)   prejctWd opemting costs, debt service and capital investment should be fully covered.
7.       Romdions shall bo made on the rate structure and the levels to apply by consumption category.



Annex 14
-61-                             PagA 2 of 4
8.       Alternatives are to be proposed under which revenue would cover only 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of
capital cot rpectively. Each aternative should be examined for accssibility and for its foreseeable impact on
overali consumption. An indexing formula should be proposed whereby rates cm be adjusted each year to refle¢t
price chages.
9.       For each dternative, the rate of return on the revdlued fixed amets is to be calculated by dividing net
operating tevenue, including provision for depreciation of fixed asets but before payment of debt-service
obligations, by the average of revalued net fixed amets for the preceding and current years.
D. ORGANlZATION OF THE SIUDY
10.      The time allowed for the study is seven months, split into two phaes of three months each. An interim
report is to be submitted after the first phase. A final report is to be prepared and discussed with the Authorities
at the end of the second phase. Both reports are to be sent in duplicmteto the World Bank.
11.      The Water Authority (REGIDESO) will provide the following to asuist the Consultant:
(a)   a full-time engineer to work in conjunction with him on the stuies and eventually take on the
responsibility for regular updating of the study data;
(b) a furnished office and secretarial support;
(c)   access to all available data, existing reports, sstics and annual aocouats.

WATER SUPPLY SECTQR PROJECT
Water Supply Master Plan for BDuumbura
Tenms of Reference
A. CONTEXT
1.       The 1980 Bujumbura Urban Development Master Plan is now out of date. The city has been growing
rapidly for several years and a number of expansions have taken place dtat were not envisaged in 1980, including:
In the North:     development of the Mutanga i neighboahood (1989-90), the Gasenyi I and II
development project, the SIP project to build 1,000 dwellings, the new squatter
settlement in the Gasenyi zone (above the Kamenge Tochnical School) and the creation
of the village of Camama.
In the South:     development of the Musaga and Kanyosha neighbothoods (ECOSAT project, over 4,000
low-income hcusing units) and sizable expansions of the Kinindo neighborhood (over
1,000 serviced plots).
In the East:      expansion of the city toward the Buhonga hills and the Sororezo neighborhood
development project.
2.       Ail these sites and services projects for new neighborhoods for which financing has already been secured
are additional to the squatter settlements and were not included in the studies for the 1980 Master Plan. It is
therefore urgent that this new configuration be taken into accouat and that the measures needed to meet the city's
future water needs be redefined.
B. URBAN GROWTH FORECASTS
3.       The consultant will be required to prepare spatial development forecasts for the city by type of housing;
the horizons to be considered are the years 2000 and 2010
4.       The plans envisaged will be based on the prec.iing studies (1980 Master Plan), on the studies under
way, on recent developmentz and on the trend presently observed. The industrial development programs will also
be analyzed and taken into account.
5.       The forecasts will he prepared by homogeneous city zone, for which possibilities of expansion and
densification will be studied according to the type of housing and its density.
C. WATER REOUIREMENT F-RECASIS
6.       'hM forecast of water requirements will be prepared globally for the city as a whole and also broken
down at the level of each homogeneous zone for the 2000 and 2010 horizons.
7.       The unit quantities adopted must be realistic and based on consumption statistics gathered by sector
andior by sapled consumer groups and the consumnption forecasts will bh broken down by user category (domestic,
commercial, industrial, govemment, standpipes, etc.).
8.       The consumption forecsts will then be grouped by levels, as determned by technical studies of the
distribution system. They will be caculated mn terms of annual averages, daily peaLs and hourly peaks.

D. CAPACIY AILYSIS OF EXISI ÉG FAC
9.       'Me consultant shal prepare an exhaustive and precise inventoty together with a techuical diagnostic
study of the existing facilities, in particular catchment facilities, raw water output, treatment, treated water output,
gravity supply systems, storage and distribution systems.
10.      'Me distribution of connections and standpipes in the different zones sad quarters of the city will also
be inventoried and anaiyzed.
11.      The consultat will study the capacity of the existing facilities, identify bottlenecks ansd snalyze the
possibilities for improvement of the ptesent instaled capacities.
12.       A critical analysis must also be made of the generdl functioning of the facilities and of the brokdown
into pressure antdor service zones. In particular, a detailed aysis will be mado of the system output in order to
deternle the percentages of physical and commercial losses. The consultant shaU set reduction targets for these
losses for the 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 horizons, specifying the nuesus to be employed and their cost.
E. DETERMINATION OF NEW WORRS REOUIRED
13.       On the basis of the urban growth snd water consumption forecasts together with the findings of the
inventory and diagnostic study of the existing facilities, the consultant shall determine the new facilities (bat will
be required to meet the needs as of the study horizons, afler having thoroughly studied the possibilities for
improvement, strengtheniig and rehabilitation of the existing facilities.
14.      The phasing of the proposed measures will ho accompanied by a schedule of the capital and operating
costs entailed, together with an economic and financial analysis. An environmental assessment of the proposed
measures will be carried out.
15.       The consultant shahl also analyze the institutional aspects iuherent in the nanagement and operation of
the facilities, paying special attention to the question of maintenance. He will also sualyze the medium and long-
term- financial impact of the proposals formulated, at the tariffing and customer management (connections and
standpipes) level.
16.      fle consultant shal identify and evaluate the content of an emergency phase.
F. ORGANIZATION 0F THE STUDY
17.      The study shall be carried out lu two sepamate phases. The first phase will comprise the forecasting of
urban growth and water requirements together with the analysis of the functioing of the existing facihities. The
second phase will comprise the determination of the facilities required to moet the needs as of the study horizons
sad the proposals concerning the emergency phase. The total time period is 10 months.
18.      The personnel needed for the sudy is estimated to be as follows:
Man-months
Hydraulic engineer             8
Engineer                       2
