FOR A WAT$ SUPPLI 8BC50R PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
Credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 24.2 million <US$32.7 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard
IDA terme vith 40 years' maturity and would help finance a water supply sector
project. The project would be cofinanced by the Grman Cooperation Bank - KfW
(US$6.2 million equivalent) and the Bolgium Cooperation - AGCD (US$12.6 million
equivalent). Part I discusmes the country' s economic performances and prospects
and the Sanke' Group assistance strategy. Part Il describes the proposed credit.

2.       Burundi is a omall landlocked country in Central Africa. Ite per capita
CDP i8 about US$220 (1989). With a population of about 5.25 million and a
population growth rate of 3 percent, Burundi has the second highest population
denaity in Africa (188 persons/square kilometer>.  About 94 percent of the
population lives in rural areas and the economy is highly dependent on
agriculture (more than half of GDP, 90 percent of employment and 90 percent of
export earninge).  Coffee accounts for 80 percent of total expirts.  The
secondary sector (mining and manufacturing) represento only 14 percent of GDP and
6 percent of exports. The private sector plays a major role in the production
of both export and food cropo and transport, while the public sector enjoys a
quasi-monopolistic positior in the processing and export of primary commodities,
manufacturing, energy, and nfrastructure, and generates half of the country' s
formal employment.
3. *ince the country s independonce in 1961, ethnic rivalry between the
minority Tutois and the majority Rutus bas been a major feature of Burundi's
political history. The Tutoie have ruled Burundi continuously for the last three
decades. The current government li led by President Buyoya, a Tutsi, who took
power in September 1987 in a military coup.  In Auguet 1988, there vas an
outburst of ethnic violence in Burundi which led to a temporary outflow ot
primarily Nutu refugees to neighboring countries. The President responded by
promoting a policy of national reconciliation and unity, appointing a new cabinet
with equal representation from the two ethnic groupe and giv4-ig priority to
recruitment of Hutue in the administration.  This policy has been largely
successfulS peace bas been restored and most of the refugees have returned to
Burundi. A significant opening-up of the political aystem is underway.
4.       Burundil  annual per capita growth has been consistently above average
levels for Sub-saharan Africa since the mid 1960s, while following the general
pattern of lower growth in the 19709 and stagnation ln the 1980.. Hovever, its
eeonomia and ftnancial situation has been closoly linked to the international
prie  for coffte whieh has fluctuated widely from year to year. In the 1982-85
period, lover eoffee price. and adverse climatie conditions, combined with
oxpanLionary fiscal and monetary policy, led to a financial crisis.   The
government responded with administrative controls aLmed at containung the
external deflcit and protecting  domestie  industry.   External borrowing,
espeeially on non-concessional terme, accelerated, causing the debt service ratio
to Increase fram an average of 5 percent of exporta of goode and non-factor
services in the late 19705 to 25 percent in 1986. The distortionu introduced



- 2 -
through those  measures rdinforced the role of the state in the econo.y,
aggravating disincentives to private sector development.
5.      In late 1985, the goverument embarked on an adjustment program. The
Initial phase of the reform program wVa  upported by the f iret of the Bank's two
structural adjutmunt credits (SAL) and the first of three annual arrangements
under the IM's structural adjustment facll'ty (8AP). The program emphasized
stabilisation moatures, *stablAihed the first st-ps to bring about structural
changes and strengthensd the management of public resources. The exchange rate
was devaluod by 24 percent ln SDR terms and a number of import liberalization
snasures were takbn.  Production incentives were rationalized.  Exc.pt for
products competing vith those produced by public enterprises (Pz), quantitative
restrictions on laports wer. rmov d and replaced by lmport duties, and the first
phase of a comprehensive tariff reform vas introduced.  The number of tariff
rates was cut and the tariff range for non-luxury goods was narrowed from 0-280
to 15-50.  The number of pria.. controlled officially by the government was
reduced to certain *trategic producto and to producer prices for key agricultural
exports. Wlth respoet to public resource management, the goverument prepared a
firot public inventment program, lncreased fiscal receipts and lnitiated reform
of the PB sector vith the creation of an independent unit to monitor lts
performanc.
6.      Volloving the completion of the first phase of the adjustment program,
there vas a change in govermet and another collapse of the international price
of coffee, resulting ln a 34 percent declin. ln coffee export receoptu. Despite
the setback, th. government decided to pursue a second phase of the adjustmont
program d.signed to broaden and deepen reforms   A comprehonsive package of
additional masures vas formulated to str.ngthln macroeconomlc management, croate
an incentive frauevork to timwlate exports, reform public enterprises, improve
public expenditure management, Increase th. efficiency of the financdal sector,
sad liberalise the l.bcr market.
msssso  et et Porfonxanc
7.       éeasures taken under the adjustment program and the external support
mobilized as a result of the program enabled the Surundi econcmy to weather
external ehocks vithout making sharp cuts in essentlai public sector programs or
relntroducing price and lmport control. While real growth declined somewhat
during the adjustment program fros 5 percent in 1980-85 to 3.8 percent ln 1986-
89, lt was still slightly positive ln per capita terms.  Nevertheless, the
economy remaine highly dependent on the International coffee priae, both vith
respect to fiscal and xternal receipts. Thie dependence on coffee helps explain
the fact that the ratio of exports to importe declined over the adjustment period
from 54 percent ln 1986 to 38 percent in 1989. If the high coffeo prices of late
1988 and .arly 1989 had continued throughout 1989, then the ratio would have
remained at about the sacs levl.

8.       TIh  adjuutment progra. bas net yet *timulated a strong supply side
rempoua., partly because ci the mixed signals given by the goverament to the
private sector. Even though the elaborate ystam of controles has been roduced,
the PB sector has remained basically unchang.d. However, nov Imptus for reform
la building up. ALter the civil etrife in 1988, the government reallzed that lt
vas essential to accelerate the pace of economic and political reform.   it
undertook a major public information campaign durung the leat balf of 1989 and
the first half of 1990, which has been succeesful la mobilisung national support
for the referm program and repr.sents su a mpn rt nt tiret stop towards changung
attitudes. The second tranche of 8AL IZ was reloased la April 1990 and the third
tranche la expected to be released ln the next four to six months.  Performance
under the four major compononts of BAL il is described below.
9.       Publia Resouroe Manaomment.  The overall fiscal deficit remained at
about the same average level of 12 percent of oDPI however, during the perlod,
extra-budgetary expenditure bas incrtasingly been lnt.grated Lnto the budget.
TMe number of extra-budgetary accounts han been reduced from over 500 ln 1988 to
20 ln 1991. on the revenue aide, performance has improved due to incroased tax
revenue, and non-tax revenue rose, owing to more systemtle servicing of external
debt by the PEI.  However, there are still many aLhoc tax exemptions accorded
which  have  limited potentlal revenue  growth.   On tie xpenditure  side,
instrumente for managing public expenditure are now in placo  but these have not
yet had an impact on the share of public expenditure ln CDP which has remained
at about 27 percent throughout the 1980o.  Procedures for formulattng three-year
public investment program  (PIP) for all sectors have ben established. Detailed
public expendlture programe (PEP) for 1990-92 and 1991-93 vere als  prepared for
three  ectors with the assistance of the Bank staff.  A consulting firm has



-4-
developed a methodology for preparing PEPo and a training program for civil
servants wll bugin sbortly. A partially unified budget (covering revenue and
current expenditure) wva adopted in 1991 and full unificiétion La expected
*tarting vith the 1992 budget.
10.      PucgL ntgeriae form. There are 84 PBs in the sector that accounted
for 45 percent of groom capàtal formation butween 1984 and 1987 but generated
only about 7 percent of GDP. This doeo not compare favorably with the Sub-
Saharan African average, which l 30 percent of groso capital formation and 15
percent of GDP. The PZ restructuring component includes   (1) rehabilitation of
certain public enterprises when justif ied by studies; (iL) signing of performance
contracts for strategic enterprises remaining under government control; <i11)
reduction of the site of the sector through merger, privatization and
liquidation; (iv) revislon of the legal framework to Lacrease the management
autoncmy of the enterprises; and (v) completion of studies on key issues *uch as
pricing and tarif f policies.   There have been lmplementation delays, and
performance--even for those Pts that are being rehabilitated--has yet to lmprove.
11.      Ixchange and TXrde RotfMs. Under the progra., effective protectlon was
to be reduced through trade reform and maintenance of a flexible exchange rate
poliy.  The government has been largely successful on both counts; however,
these policies have not yet had a significant impact on the structure and volume
of production. An examination of the composition of major exports reveals that
most are cither produced by PEs or, as in the case of agro-industries, are
proceused and exported by them. slow progrese on PI restructuring has undermined
the potential ef fect of tarif f and exchange rate reforu on production of
traditional exports, either because these enterprises were too inefficient to
respond to price signal or because, as ln the case of agro-industry, the
vindfall in local currency terms from devaluation vas absorbed by the enterprises
instead of being passed on to producers. In the case of a number of low volum,
high value agricultural export producto recently introduced by the private
sector, such as tobacco, passion fruit and cut flowers, farmers have generally
received higher ahares of the international price.
12.      The lncentive Structure   The incentive system was to be rationalized
to improve resource allocation. De jure price controls have been eliminated
where thora  nsae element of competition and prices in monopolistic or
oligopolistic sub-secters are kept under review. Nevertheless, the government
bas utilised the import licensing systes and ito influence Lu PIE to maintain
some indirect price controle but Ls now addressing the issue in preparation for
the next phase ot rofons. The producer price for rice has been liberalized an4
a progressive liberalization of the coffee producer price Ls expected in the
context of the ongoing coffee sector project.
13.     With the political reforms underway and the atmosphere of open dialogue
crsated during the public information compaign on economic reforms, the
goverament*s capacity to make significant progress on Surundi's central
development Issues has been greatly enhanced. There are sions that the econcav
la lmprovinga the average number of annual commercial and industrial enterprise
creations han doubled rec-ntly au bas the number of importers. The goveroment
is Incr.asingly taking charge of the reform program.  In January 1991, the
Council of Minioters adopted a revised policy for the PB sector whih calls for
an acceleration of the divestiture of the governmntles portfolio. The goverrnaat
also took the initiative to prepare the f irst draft of the Policy Framework Paper
for 1991-93 and is currently formulating proposal for the third phase of the
adjustment procese.
Cetral Dvloment Imsues
14.      The Role of the Btate. Burundi's formal economy is still ovarwhelmingly
public sector and is supported by substantial official development assistance.
A major challenge for the year ahead il to shift the economy to one that ls
characterised by a sialler, more efficiently manageC public sector co-existing
with an emerginq private sector. The transition ia a difficult one and will take
time to achieve. Following the f irst two phases of the adjustment proces., which



have increased the government a capacity to monitor public expenditures and the
performance of PfE and to redire¢t public invoutment towards the maintenance of
social and economic Infrastructure, the Instruments for etfectively reâefining
the roi. of goveromnt are now ln place.  Zn fact, a recent survey of erivate
businessmen revealed that private sector confidence in the government's
coemitaent to a more limited rol ln productive sectors has increased. 1Te
governm nt will continue lmproving public sector manigement while concentrating
on the roval of bottlenecks at the microse.ctoral lvevl Ln order to stimulate
grovth.
15.      Diversification of the Economv.  ustained growth in Burundi will reault
in a reduction in the country'* dependence on coff-e exporte. Snce 1986, the
number of producte e*ported by the private mector bas inereaeed, even though
export volume bas not yet picked up significantly.   Continued efforts to
liberalise the econoemy and, ln particular, to provide an adequate legal and
rogulatory framework vill croate a favorable enablng environment for export-led
private sector growth *ver ths medium term. in the short to medium term, efforts
to diver4ify the economy will als foeus on improving the efficiency of existing
enterprises <both public and private) with emphasis on a major restructuring of
agro-industry. Nevertheless, constraints such as the mountainous terrain, the
lack of direct accoes to the sea and the small 8i1e of the domestie market will
tend to limit the rapidity with which the econouy's structure can be modified.
16.      Disoetions in Factor Market. The public sector resource allocation
procens has generally bypassed demestic factor markets (financial and labor).
Wages have been set by governeent, due to the quasi-monopoli$tic position of the
public sector in the labor market. Capital financing for the public sector has
been obtained prlmarlly f rom external donors on grant terme or at subeidised
interest rates rather than through the domestie banking sector. However, with
an increasing role for the private sector in productive activities, the need for
market-determined pricing of capital and labor has becvm apparent.
17.      Experience with the Danke line of credit to enterprises through
cmmercial banko demonstrates that, despite reforme, the competitiveneus of the
Ci,fniial secto still neede improvement. Commercial banke are reluctant to lend
for investment projecte even when their potential financial viability can be
demonstrated. The banking sector'e lack of interest ln medium-term lending bas
alse placed a damper on efforts to lncrease domestic resource mobilisation.
Similarly, distortions in the labor market have peruisted partly, due to
automatic wage adjustments in the modern ector which have made it difficult to
reduce real wages through devaluation. The labor code, despite revisions made
during the second phase of adjustment, continues to discourage emplyment
creation through excessive regulation and administrative difficulties involved
in hiring and firing employeos. The formal private sector ia aleo required to
bear 100 percent of its employees' and their dependonts' medical expenses  The
government is currently undertaking a camprehensive review of the labor code.
e18.     Poulation  *roth   Burundils Economic and Social Council, created i"
1990 to provide a forum for discussing deveiopment issues with participants from
all segments of the population, has just issued a draft study of the country's
longer-term development prospects and constraints. The study considers the high
level of population growth as the single most Important constraint to future
economic and aocial development.  The government has launched an ambitious
campaign to inform the public of the need fov and the moans of improving family
planning. While training for health center staff in the Une of contraceptives
has proceeded satisfactorily, contraceptive pre7alence has not yet increased.
19.      Z&yà£nm&t.  Rising population density has led to fragmentation of
agricultural land, overgrazing, declining coil fertility and the use of
ecologically fragile and marginal lande for cultivation. The growing scarcity
of woodfuels and loue of natural torest habitats have taken place in response to
an over-exploitation of foreste to meet rising demana for fuelwood. An estimated
90 percent of wood production is utilized for domestic ; ~ergy consumption. In
ome areas there are alroady lmbalances between wood consumption and supply. In
recognition of the lncreaslng importance of environmental issues for 8urundi's
economic and social prospects, a special Ministry for Land Management, Tourism

markedly In the 1985-90 period with the approval of two SAL8, two major credits
to agriculture, and substantial support to the health and education sectors.
Hovever, tbe diébursement pattern for the portfolio over the pant three yearo han
reained steady (US$48.6 million ln calendar year 1990, JS$45.6 million in 1989,
and u8$44.4 million In 1988). Annual coumitments have averaged U8S$84 million for
FY87-90. Forty percent of total ccmaitmente is undiabured (US$231.7 million).
Project implementation le, on the whole, satisfactory with a disbursement rate
that la above average for the region. Physical implementation of projecte has

reduce poverty. Through lto policy advice and economic and sector work, the Bank
La supporting Durundi's efforts to develop an incentive structure geared at
prcmoting export-oriented private sector tnvestment, and to reorient public
expenditure away from productive sectors and towards social and economlo
infrastructure. The aim la to encourage a significant supply side response by
addressing the central development Issues dircussed ln an earlier section.

24.      The Bank and other donors have responded generouxly with budget  nd
balance of paymentr financing in support of the firet two phases of the
adjustmunt program. These recources have been utilised primsrily for offsetting
the impact of external shocks and most recontly, accumulating external reserveo.
Oiven the prenent comfortable leval of reserves, borroving requirementx to
finance balance of payments gaps over the next two to three years vill be
Iimited.  In view ot the shifting resource requirxmento of the next phase of
adjustment whicb vill foeus on the aupply aide, the Bank will reduce the level
of quick-diabursing assistance and introduc nem vehicles for direNtly promoting
the private sector. Msources for the private sector will ba channaled through
the domstic banking *ectow and the  ank wlll focus on ensuxing that adequata
levles of equity financing are available end domestic resource mobilisation La
strengthoned through the creation of nov savinge instruments.
25.      As the government divesta itself of directly productive activities, it
wlll b  looking incrraingly to the private sector to provide it with certain
essential gooda and services. The donors are encouraging thus procoe by using
their projects to croate market opportunitie. for the private sectoe ln the for
of maintenance contracta for certain public assets, other types of construction
work and greater une of local consultants.
26.      The i ank's assistance strategy involves a threo-pronged approachu
(i) providing support for an acceleration and deepening of the adjustmnt proce.
through a modest leval of non-projmct assistance# (i) timulating the productive
sectors through investmant operations; and (Iiii designing social and economic
infrastructure operations that will lay the groundwork for Lmproving long-term
developmant prospects while introducing more financially sustainable funding
mechanisms for providing social services and maintaining public assets. The
lending program calls for two to three oporations a year.
27.      The Adiustment Proce|.  A third adjustment operation (BAL III) ic
currently under preparation. It vould empiasise reforma necessary to achieve a
supply response and would help accalerate and deepen the adjustment proces.
Major reforma would focus on removing remaining price controls and fully
iiberaltzing importe and exporte of goode and services, accelerating the
reatructuring and privatisation of PEs to reduce further the role of the state,
and providing an appropriate enabling environment to encourage more private
sector inveotmsnt by both local and foreign entrepreneurs.
28.      Promotion and Regtructurino of Prodctive Sectors. To complement the
ar¨&; z   rr°r  te the government s adjustmant program, the londing program
includes investment operations in agro-industry and private sector devolopment.
These oporations would be focused on promoting the creation of private sector
enterprises in new sectors while increasing the competitiveness of traditional
agro-industries by creating conditions for private sector entry and lmproving the
efficiency of existing PEs. Longer-term issues which could compromise Burundis
agricultural production potential are to be addressed in an enviroument and land

deterioration in the generally satisfactory food security situation, through
erosion control, management of water resources, including irrigation networke,
and reforestation.
29.      Economic Infrastructgre. In the Infrastructure area, the proposed Water
suoolv  Sctor Credit, discussed in part two of this report, la fully consistent
vith the Sank s strategy.  The project ls designed to support the goveraumnt's
efforts to expand rural infrastructure lncluding the population'. accens to safe
drinking water and to help the government and REGIDESO develop institutional and
financial arrangements in the sector. Another project recently approved (3nergy
Rehabilitation sector Project) will improve the efficiency of REQIDEsO through
botter management, to promote more efficient use of various energy sources
through appropriate pricing policies, to enhance the quality of the sector's PEP
and to provide groater focus on the environmental impact of energy use.
Systematie attention to the maintenance of investments wll b. given through
regular reviewe of the sector PEPe, wider application of co0t recovery measures



and shiftlng the responsibility for the management and maintenance of facîlîties
to local gov ernmnto (comunes).
30.     social services.  TSh  Bank will be giving priority to lncreaaing th.
prevalonce of the use of contraceptives au a *Mans of controlling population
growth. Accesti to famlly planning services la bein; expanded and integrated vith
primary health care services. The objective of future operations ln the hoalth
and population area vill be to continue rationalisnag delivery syste_, with
special emphesis on preventive medicine, fdmily planning,  dacentralized
management of health facilities und coot recovery. Considerable efforts have
been made both by goverument and by parents to Increase access to prlmsry
education and gros. enrollment has resched 70 peroent. The ratio of girls and
boys enrolled et the pr.mary level, at about 45 percent and 55 percent
respectively, in fairly well balanced, but needs further mprovemnte The Bank's
support for education sector reform will continue to emphasize the enhancement
of the quality of education in prlmary and secondary echoole by upgrading teacher
and student ekills and lmproving teachers' living conditions especially at the
primary level.
31.              _             In the content of the public expenditure review
process, the Bank staff w$ii continue to encourage the government to allocate
sufficient budgetary resources to meet the needs of the poorist segments of the
population, both longer-tere and those that may be identified with the adjustment
process.  This target group is comprised largely of vwmen who are heads of
household and street children. The goveruint bas not requested a free-standing
project on the role of women in development but i8 targeting women through the
Bank-oupported education and health projects, as well as the agricultural
services project which focuses on more user-friendly extension services to
farmers, of which women are a major group  In addition, a social action project
is currently under preparation and vill make resources available through the
communes and NOOs to address the need of vulnerable groupe including women and
children.
32.      In order to improve prospects for the Implimentation of the Bank's
strategy snd the lnstitutional sustainability of Bank operations, greater focus
ill given to the area of capacity building. Technical assistance and training
needs wll be taken lnto account bys <i) expediting implementation of the
existIng technical assistance projeet to help the goverament In deosigning macro
and sectoral policies and (II) including technlcal assistance compononts in
future oector projecta that reinforce public sector management objectives pursued
at the macro level*  The Bank vill support qoverament's efforts to improve
project lmplementation through regular country implementation reviews and by
devoting more resources to project supervision. Special emphas$. wlli be given
to streamlining procurement procedures and accelerating disbursements.
33      ZEconomic and Sector Work. The intellectual underpinnings of the Bank'"
strategy and dialogue with the government are established largely tbrough
economi and sector vork. The work in supportive of the etrategy to address
Burundi, s central development issues  With respect to the adjustment agenda, the
UNDP through an umbrella project for which the Bank is executing agent, is
financing studies to evaluate the Impact of SAL I and II and to prepari AL I.
The recently completed Public Expenditure Review and the Project Completion
Report for SAL S and Il (to be distributed to th. Executive Directors ehortly)
have constituted critical Inputs in the Bank'a efforts to conv$nce the goverment
of the need to deepen the adjustment process. Bank etaff has undertaken two
major sectoral studies to provide a better assessent of the potential and
constraints in Durundi's major productive sectors*  The first, sn lndustrial
sector review, in approaching completion. it a5Ce5Ces relevant macro and micro
issues including the enabling environment for the private sector and identifies
bottlenecks to be addressed in SAL IlI snd the private sector development
operation.  An in-depth analysis of the agricultural sector has also been
undertaken. It addresses the issues of land tenure, sol erosion, rural credit
and input use, export promotion, product development and more user-responsive
extension services. Ths work in being complemented by studies on the labor
market and communal development and will provide inputs for operations under
preparation. For social services and economic infrastructure the Bank will give

36.      There  are  factors whi¢h  oould  cause  serlous  slippages  in ths
implementation of reform and heuce the capacity of the Bank to pursue its
strategy.  These are both political and economlc.   Tiret, the national and
regional political situation ruains fragile.  Ethnlc confltlt in neighborinu
Rwanda  (Auvolving the sme two groupe as la Burundi) could lead to a
de-stabilliktion of the current Burundi regnim and lto attempts to lncrease power
siaring peacetully. Thi geverument rmains conuvlced that thi best meano of
avoidinq more ethnie confliet le by pushing forward with democratizatlon and wlth
econoeic reforms.  However, a potential short- to aediua-term unemployment
problem could arise vith shitte In the composition of public expenditures <avay
from salaries asd towards goode and services) and the liquidation of unviable
Pas. The gever       wit wlll be monitoring the situation cloesly and th. Baak ha6

developsoent   n the political side, priority li already being given to changinq
attitudes through continued public information campalgnz and to lntroducing a
more democratic form of goverument.

Mhile the comfortable level oe reserves could help deal with the forelgn exehange

ot political dîffIculties, th.  ank would remaln flexible snd allow the

39.     Progreus towards lmplemsating economic reforma and achieving sustained
growth will be monitored closely. A key criterion, barring any further adverse
developmsnts Ln coffee prices, vill be the extent to which the econaoy can
Lncrea   experts and ice ability to cover import requirements through export
earnaings. Another indicator will be the rate of growth of the private sector ln
terme of lnvetmeat and productLon and in terme of .mployment. On the public
resource managneont front, progres. will be aussssed on the basie of changes ln
the volume and composition of public expenditure towards a contaimnent of
eadature in real terme and a ohift avay from investments Ln productive sectors
ln favor of meeting the operating coste of critical social services and economic
infrastructure. Improvemnts ln the *fficiency of PSs will alo be considered.
To determine the effectivens of safety net foatures ln the PRP, the Bank will
monitor a number of social lndicators such au thii percentage of the population
living below the poverty line and average daily calorie intake. The degree to
which ceat recovery mechanism are applied to health, education and rural water
supply and decentraliiation to the commune level of management responslbllity for
these services wili also be kept under review.
40.     Burundi does not benef Lt from a $ignif icant natural resource endowmnt.
Neverthelees, the country has a favorable climate for agricultural production and
h  beon able to feed its growing population despite probleme of soil erosion,
emall farm aise and minimal use of modern inputs. On the whole, Burundi has been
sucessful ln implementing mont of the measures recoemuended by the Bank and the
Pund. In order to maintain mumetum in f avor of economic reforme and to minimie
the riake lnvolvd LA the political reform agenda, real per capita growth muet

maintenance of water supply in rural areas has progressed well during
implemontation of the ongoing projoct. It is Important for IDA to retain an
effective presence in water supply, to assist Burundi implement lts neo sector

Enfilronmental I nact
51.      The project has been designed taking into accouat environmental
considerations and no activities would create significant adverse environmental
effects. The project would reduce water lonues and contamination and the health
and socio-economlc conditions of the population would be greatly improved as a
reault of the provision of safe water supply services. All future studies
included in the project would cover such environmental issues as pollution
reoulting from increased water consumption.
§Mfàtn
52.      The proposed project would improve the productivity and well-being of
the population, particularly women, resulting from time saving and botter health
through provision of safe water supply. Decentralization and development of
communal        ibility with respect to infrastructure directly scrving tho
population would be an important project bonofit. Institutional strengthening
would resault in Improvements In the planning and management of water resources
and extension of the cost recovery policy would provide the basil for future
expansion of rural vater supply systeme.  The pricing policy reform to be
Implemented In urban areas would improve the financial situation of REaIDESO.
53.      In the rural subsector the major risks are institutional and financial
and are related to (l) the capacity of the communal water utilities to operate
and maintain the vater facilities and (il) the capacity of the population to pay
the vater focs. Experience In Africa has shown that the bout results can be
obtained by dolegating responsibility to the communal lvel.  T.he project has
been largely built on exporience gained during implementation of the on-going
rural water supply project, which demonstrates that the pooreet oommunes are
ready to pay for vater.   Moreover theso two risks would b. minimized by
otrengthening the operational capacity of DOHER to provide the necessary outside
support, by the training programe for communal water utilities staff and by th.
plannad campaignu for sensitizing the population on benefits provided by the use
of afe drinking water and the importance of austained maintenance of the
facilities.

implementation of the new  tariff structure.   This Issue vlll b  regularly
