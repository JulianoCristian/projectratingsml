rural population; (b) increase the local\n            population's sense of responsibility for maintaining\n            its water supply facilities; (c) help the government develop\n            and implement appropriate institutional and financial\n            arrangements in the water supply sector; (d) extend the\n            pricing policy initiated under the rural water supply\n            project to the entire country; (e) coordinate donor activity\n            in the rural water supply sector; and (f) help the\n            government prepare and monitor a public expenditure program\n

The project includes the following\n            components:  (a) construction of rural water supply systems\n            in 9 provinces (Kayanza, Ngozi, Karuzi, Muyinga, Gitega,\n            Muramvya, Cibitoke, Bubanza,, and Makamba); (b) development\n            and protection of about 3,000 springs; and (c) capacity\n            building in the Department of Rural Water Resources and\n            Electrification through the provision of expertise,\n            equipment and training; in the communes and the communal\n            water utilities through the provision of training and\n            sensitization of population; and in the National Water and\n            Electricity Authority through the provision of studies."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
