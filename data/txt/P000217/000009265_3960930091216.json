"The main objectives of the Water Supply\n            Sector Project for Burundi are to: (a) improve the quality\n            and quantity of potable water provided to the rural\n            population; (b) increase the local population's sense\n            of responsibility for maintaining its water supply\n            facilities; (c) help the government develop and implement\n            appropriate institutional and financial arrangements in the\n            water supply sector; (d) extend the pricing policy initiated\n            under the rural water supply project to the entire country;\n            (e) coordinate donor activity in the rural water supply\n            sector; and (f) help the government prepare and monitor a\n            public expenditure program for the sector. The project\n            includes the following components: (i) construction of rural\n            water supply systems in nine provinces (Kayanza, Ngozi,\n            Karuzi, Muyinga, Gitega, Muramvya, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and\n            Makamba); (ii) development and protection of about 3,000\n            springs; and (iii) capacity building in the department of\n            rural water resources and electrification through the\n            provision of expertise, equipment and training; in the\n            communes and the communal water utilities through the\n            provision of training and sensitization of population, and\n            in the national water and electricity authority through the\n            provision of studies."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
