The appraisal mission consisted of Messrs. H. David Davis, Gianni Brizzi
and Michael Sarris who visited Honduras in May/June 1978. Both in the
field and at headquarters, the mission received assistance from Messrs. Luis
Vera (physical planning), Herbert Boehm (financial analysis), Miguel Ruiz-
Herrera (legal affairs) and H. Rex Shama (airports). A further visit was
made by Messrs. Davis and Sarris in September 1978 for discussions with
newly appointed Government officials.



I. THE TOURISM SECTOR
A. Tourism Potential
1.01      Honduras has considerable potential for the development of inter-
national tour±sm. Its Caribbean coast includes some of the most attractive
and extensive beaches in Central America (e.g., Tela and Trujillo) featuring
fine sand and palm-lined tropical vegetation. With their impressive reefs
containing a variety of coral and marine life, the Bay Islands are a para-
dise for scuba divers and snorklers. In the northwestern forested region
of Honduras, situated in a narrow valley with scenic mountains rising on
both sides, are the ruins of Copan, one of the most important archaeological
centers of the Maya civilization, with excellent potential for attracting
an increasing share of the ever growing culture-oriented international tourism
market. Other attractions include Lake Yojoa, with good fishing and water
sports and numerous towns and villages where Spanish heritage and contemporary
Honduras blend into a distinctive national culture. Proximity to the North
American market and a favorable cost structure should enable Honduras to
offer these diverse assets at competitive prices.
B. Present State of the Sector
1.02      International tourism to Honduras is still in its infancy.  Until
very recently the Government has accorded low priority to the sector. The
private sector, without access to suitable financial resources, has been un-
able to develop tourism facilities. In the absence of these facilities, it
is hardly surprising that tourism flows to the country have remained at
relatively low levels. In 1977, of the 181,113 foreign visitors to Honduras
nearly half were classified as "transits" passing through the country. More
than 60% of all visitors came from neighboring Central American countries.
By 1977, North American visitors numbered about 45,000, most of whom came to
Honduras for business reasons; since 1972, their number had been increasing
at an average annual rate of 6%, in line with the growth of business activity.
European visitors, also mainly on business, total less than 10,000. The few
statistics available indicate an average length of stay for North American
visitors of three to four days and an average daily expenditure of US$50.
Since most foreign visitors are businessmen, there is no pronounced season-
ality in the distribution of arrivals.
1.03      Total hotel capacity of Honduras is estimated at 2,530 rooms, of
which only about 700 can be considered suitable for most international
visitors (equivalent to three stars or more). More than 500 of the rooms
in this category are situated in the two main cities of Tegucigalpa and San
Pedro Sula and currently cater primarily to business demand. The remaining
200 rooms of international standard are distributed among several small
establishments, more than half of which are on the Bay Islands; these are
the only accommodation facilities utilized primarily by holiday visitors.
The two hotels currently under construction are located in the two major
cities and are primarily intended for business people. All hotels in Honduras
are owned by private entrepreneurs, most of them Honduran nationals. The



larger hotels have thus far been financed with funds of small groups of in-
vestors, short-term bank loans and, more recently for the hotel under con-
struction in San Pedro Sula, with longer-term funds from the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).
1.04      Occupancies in major city hotels have stabilized at very high levels
because accommodation development has lagged behind the growth of business
traffic. Construction costs, even in the early '70s when the newer hotels
were built, were still relatively low. It is only recently that they have
taken a sharp upward course. Another important advantage of Honduran hotels
lies in their relatively low operating costs.  Because of the generally low
wage structure in Honduras, payroll expenses are a small proportion of total
sales and the cost of food and beverage sales is low despite the relative in-
experience of Honduran hoteliers in management. As a result of high occu-
pancies and low investment and operating costs, the major city hotels are
very profitable. By contrast, the smaller hotels on the islands, despite low
investment and operating costs have only recently begun to show satisfactory
returns. Their mediocre performance thus far has been due to low occupancies
(30-40% annually) reflecting poor and unreliable air access from the mainland
and deficient marketing.
1.05       Apart from hotels, several other types of activities have been
stimulated by international visitor demand. Several good and moderately
priced restaurants have opened in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula and are
being successfully operated by their Honduran owners. Travel agencies are
now available to take tourists and businessmen in their free time to the Bay
Islands and Copan. The production and distribution of handicrafts are
emerging as a promising tourism-based economic activity. Despite a generally
limited road network, the rent-a-car business has grown and local air services,
both scheduled and chartered, derive part of their traffic from foreign
visitors.
1.06      Tourism has been the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture,
Tourism and Information since the Ministry was established in 1975 until
August 1978 when Information was removed from its portfolio leaving a Ministry
of Culture and Tourism. The National Institute of Tourism (IHT), established
in 1972, has been responsible for the promotion, regulation and inspection of
tourism activities. In January 1978, it became the tourism executive arm of
the Ministry. IHT has also been responsible for recommending which tourism-
related projects ought to be granted state incentives. Approved projects
located in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula benefit from a five-year full
exemption from income taxes and a further five-year exemption from half the
payable income taxes. For projects located outside the two main cities the
full exemption applies for the entire ten-year period. Hotel investors
are allowed to import free of duties construction equipment and furnishing
materials, provided these materials cannot be produced locally in sufficient
quantity and at an acceptable quality standard.



C. Contribution of Tourism to the Economy
1.07      The significance of tourism to the Honduran economy has so far been
limited.  In 1977, tourism contributed less than 1% to the Gross Domestic
Product.  In the same year, the sector generated an estimated US$15.0 million
in foreign exchange receipts, or only 2.4% of total receipts from exports of
goods and services, as compared with 29% for coffee exports, 22% for bananas
and 8% for lumber.  About 2,000 people earn their living in hotel employment
and another 1,500 in other activities that provide goods and services directly
to foreign visitors, such as restaurants, transport services and handicrafts.
Some indirect employment is also generated in activities supplying part of
their output to enterprises catering to foreign visitors. More than half
the people working in tourism are young women. Wages in Honduras are general-
ly low and, although most workers in the tourism sector are relatively un-
skilled, wages, earnings and overall benefits are higher than in other sectors
with comparable skill levels. Government tax revenues from tourism are small
as the major hotels are still enjoying tax holidays.
D. Tourism Development Strategy
1.06      The Government has decided, in view of Honduras' lack of experience
in promoting, marketing and operating an international tourism industry, to
adopt a gradual and pragmatic scenario for developing the country's tourism
potential. Such a scenario has two main features:
(a)  selective hotel development on the mainland in places
where little additional public infrastructure is
required or where such infrastructure is already planned
for other purposes; and
(b)  dispersed development on Roatan and other Bay Islands,
with small hotels at suitable sites, providing their
own infrastructure (wells, septic tanks, electric
generators and bulldozed access roads) on the basis of
an environmental control plan, to be implemented by
zoning and building regulations, together with the im-
provement of air access to Roatan.
Development of the tourism sector can thus be achieved without major public
sector investments. The main thrust of the investment effort in the next few
years would come from the private sector.
II. PROJECT CONCEPT AND COMPOSITION
A. Project Objectives and Content
2.01      The primary objective of the project is to provide financial support
for the realization of the above scenario and thereby:
(a) contribute to the diversification of sources of foreign
exchange earnings;



(b)  generate employnent and incomes in regions of the
country, such as the Bay Islands, with few alter-
nate economic activities, or in regions deprived of
their previous economic vocations such as around
Tela (where banana packing and shipment have been
severely reduced); and
(c) build institutions for both tourism planning at
the macro and micro levels and for tourism imple-
mentation during the investment and operational phases
and thus lay the groundwork for sustained growth.
2.02      The project would consist of the following components:
(a) a line of credit for onward lending to hotel and other
tourism enterprises;
(b) improved facilities for international passenger handling
at San Pedro Sula Airport;
(c) Roatan airfield improvements;
(d) Copan archaeological park development; and
(e) technical assistance for:
(i)  the establishment and initial operations of a
new technical department in the Ministry of
Tourism;
(ii) the expansion and systematization of hotel
training provided by the National Institute
for Vocational Training (INFOP);
(iii)  tourism environmental control on Roatan;
(iv) tourism marketing; and
(v)  the establishment of an effective airport
cost accounting system; and
(f)  establishment of a land tenure unit for Foatan.
B. Line of Credit
Program to be Financed
2.03      The line of credit would assist in financing new hotels with a total
capacity of about 700 rooms, extensions to existing hotels and other related
tourism enterprises. The Central Bank would provide a rediscount facility
through financial intermediaries (the commercial banks and the National
Investment Corporation (CONADI)) for onward lending to final borrowers. A
new National Industrial Development Fund (FONDEI) has been established within
the Central Bank by resolution No. 356-12/78 dated December 28, 1978, to manage



5-
a rediscount facility for small and medium sized industries financed partially
by a World Bank loan approved by the Executive Directors on February 6, 1979.
FONDEI would also manage the tourism line of credit.
2.04       The Ministry of Culture and Tourism, with technical assistance pro-
vided in the project, would establish a technical department within IHT, which,
in addition to being responsible for project implementation, would also in-
clude a hotel credit evaluation unit responsible for evaluating feasibility
studies submitted for each prospective subproject and for supervising their
implementation. The Central Bank would review evaluations prior to approving
subloans. All subloans in excess of US$100,000 would also require prior World
Bank approval.
2.05      There is already considerable investor interest in hotel subprojects.
Current hotel investment proposals at various stages of consideration which
would total about 350 additional rooms are estimated to cost about US$14.0
million. Once long-term finance becomes available through the proposed redis-
count facility, additional subprojects are expected to be forthcoming so that
the line of credit is likely to be fully committed during the first three
years of the project.
2.06      The new hotels would be at various geographical locations and of
different types and categories. Some 450 rooms would be built on the main-
land and the remaining 250 rooms on Roatan. Those on the mainland would be
built either in the cities or on the North Coast beach areas (such as around
Tela or Trujillo) or at inland points of tourist interest (such as at Copan
or Lake Yojoa). They would include a top category, offering facilities of
the highest international standards; a second category, more modest but still
providing services expected by international traffic; and a third category
of smaller, simpler establishments in the style of vacation cabanas although
providing the high standard of services expected in the international vacation
market. First and second category hotels would be found in cities, all three
categories on the mainland beaches and only the third category at inland
points of tourist interest. The 250 rooms on Roatan would all be of third
category, of an average size of 40-50 rooms, located at dispersed shore sites.
2.07      As tourism development stimulated by the project  gets under way,
some of the existing hotel enterprises will see an opportunity for an expan-
sion in capacity. Such extensions would also be eligible for financing from
the line of credit, as would other tourism enterprises catering to inter-
national tourists, such as tour operators, restaurants and such leisure facili-
ties as water sports.
Financing Structure
2.08      Subprojects would be financed on average by 35% investors' equity
and 65% loan funds, of which 55% would be derived from the rediscount facility
and 10% would be provided from the intermediaries' own resources. Of the 55%
derived from the rediscount facility, 5% would be provided by the Central Bank
and the remaining 50% (equal to the average foreign exchange component) would
be financed from the World Bank loan. Thus, the proposed Bank loan would
finance 50% of the total costs of the hotel investment program, 77% of total
hotel loan finance and 91% of the rediscount facility.



- 6 -
2.09       Hotel loans would include grace periods of up to four years (typi-
cally to cover two years of construction and the first two years of opera-
tions) with final maturities up to L7 years. In order to encourage invest-
ments in smaller hotels (less than L50 rooms), the maximum loan for any one
subproject will be set at US$5.0 million. The portion of each subloan derived
from the proceeds of the Bank loan (covering the foreign exchange costs of
the project) would be denominated in lempiras and would be repayable in such
an amount of lempiras as to repay the US dollar equivalent of the original
amount of the subloan, such US dollar equivalent to be determined on the basis
of the dollar exchange rate prevailing on the official market in Honduras on
the date such loans were granted. :Furthermore, in order to implement the
scenario for tourism development on Roatan and the other Bay Islands (see
paras. 1.08 and 2.01), at least 25% of loan funds will initially be reserved
for such islands, this policy to be reviewed in the light of experience.
2.10       The rate of interest to be paid by final borrowers for funds ob-
tained through the rediscount facilLty would initially be fixed up to 12%
annually, a rate consistent with both current interest rates in Honduras and
prospective cash flows of typical hotel operations. Since inflation rates
are projected at 7-8% annually, the interest rate would be appreciable in
real terms. 1/ The rate of interest paid by the financial intermediaries
for FONDEI funds would be 9.5% annually, thus allowing the intermediaries
a margin of up to 2.5% to cover administrative costs, commercial risk and
profit. The difference between the FONDEI rate of interest to intermediaries
and the cost of the Bank loan would constitute the Central Bank's margin to
cover cross-currency exchange risks and administrative costs. The rates paid
both by final borrowers to intermediaries and by intermediaries to the Central
Bank will be reviewed periodically, in consultation with the World Bank and
if necessary revised, to reflect current economic and financial conditions.
2.11       While financial intermediaries would be required to lend at least
10% of total subproject costs (see 'para. 2.08) for the same maturities and
grace periods as those for the financing provided through the rediscount
facility, the intermediaries would not be bound to charge the same interest
rate on their. own portion of the loan finance as that stipulated for the
portion derived from the rediscount facility (see para. 2.10). However, they
would be subject to the regulations issued by the Central Bank governing in-
terest rates.
2.12       All intermediaries would assume full credit risk on subloans and
would service their debt to the Central Bank in accordance with fixed amortiza-
tion schedules.
Lending Policies
2.13       The policies and regulations that will govern FONDEI (acting on
behalf of the Central Bank) in tourism financing operations have been adopted
by FONDEI's Executive Committee (see Annex II). Any subsequent modification
would require Bank approval.
1/ The rate of inflation in 1975 was 8.1%; in 1976, 5.0%; in 1977, 8.6% and
in 1978 an estimated 8%.



-7-
The Participation of Intermediaries
2.14      Several of the larger commercial banks in Honduras, as well as
CONADI, are expected to participate in hotel lending taking advantage of the
line of credit. Commercial banks, with assets amounting to US$845 million,
extend mainly short-term credit. In 1976-77, 72% of all credit went for loans
of less than one year maturity, while loans with maturities of five years or
over accounted for only 2.4% of total bank credit. A major reason for this
portfolio structure is the lack of long-term funds. CONADI was created to
provide longer-term resources. Its investment portfolio of US$53 million
includes US$21 million of longer-term loans, including mortgage loans for tourism
projects.
2.15      The commercial banks have expressed interest in long-term tourism
lending, while CONADI wishes to continue and expand its ongoing involvement
in tourism development. In connection with the industrial credit project,
the commercial banks in any event will be required to strengthen their
project evaluation capability. With the assistance of IHT's technical department in
the Ministry of Tourism and with appropriate training, commercial bank loan
officers can be expected to adopt satisfactory project financial evaluation
procedures. CONADI already has qualified project analysts.
C. Other Components
San Pedro Sula Airport
2.16      Much of the increased traffic resulting from the project would
arrive at the "gateway" airport at San Pedro Sula. The airport is strategi-
cally located to serve the North Coast beach areas (one-hour drive to Tela),
the Copan archaeological site (2 1/2 hours' drive, once the CABEI-financed
road is completed), and Lake Yojoa (1 1/2 hours' drive). It is also a trans-
fer point for local feeder air services to the Bay Islands. The existing
runway and taxiways are considered adequate to handle the type and frequency
of aircraft expected. However, the international arrival facilities at the
terminal building are insufficient and would be augmented under the project
by a 220-square meter extension to the building and suitable baggage handling
equipment. Such an extension would afford a 200-peak hour passenger handling
capacity which is consistent with the traffic projected as a result of planned
tourism development. Furthermore, a 4,000-square meter extension to the parking
apron also to be financed by project funds would increase its practical capacity
from four to five aircraft of a typical mix of types as required by the prospec-
tive growth in international aircraft movements.
Roatan Airfield
2.17       Tourism development on Roatan in the Bay Islands is presently con-
strained by limited air access. The project would finance:
(a) paving of the existing gravel runway, taxiway and apron
for a total surface of some 51,000 m2;
(b) construction of additional sea protection and drainage
works; and
(c) provision of telecommunications, weather and firefighting
facilities and equipment.



- 8 -
Furthermore, although IHT is constructing a casa turistica (tourism center)
at the airport which will provide waiting rooms, tourist information and a
small cafeteria, specific facilities for passenger and baggage handling are
not provided and accordingly are included in the project. Design and con-
struction standawds of the additional facilities would be simple and would
minimize construction costs and their foreign exchange component. The build-
ing would not be airconditioned but would be carefully designed to exploit
cross ventilation. As a result of the proposed program of works, SAHSA would
be able to serve Roatan by Convair 580 (48 seats), in place of the present
DC-3 (30 seats) service. This would increase capacity on the route and allow
more economical operation per seat mile.  Occasional Electra service (98 seats)
would also be possible.
Copan Archaeological Park
2.18      The program of works for the enhancement of tourist attractions at
Copan would include:
(a) construction and equipment of a visitors' center;
(b) training of guides;
(c) production of tourism information material;
(d) extension of the archaeological park;
(e) installation of visitors' facilities, such as
pedestrian walks and rest benches;
(f) improvement and extension of the small museum in
the nearby township of Copan Ruinas; and
(g) completion of an on-going six-year technical assis-
tance program, the first two years of which have
already been financed by CABEI, for the exploration,
consolidation, restoration and preservation of monu-
ments. 1/
Technical Assistance
2.19      Technical Department.  The Ministry of Tourism is planning to estab-
lish a Technical Department within IHT whose functions would include coordina-
tion of project implementation and hotel credit evaluation. The existing econ-
omic analysis section of IHT's Planning Department would be strengthened and would
be responsible for sectoral planning. Because of lack of experience, heavy
expatriate assistance would be required initially.  Accordingly, the project
would finance the employment of four experts--a chief advisor, an architect/
engineer, an economist and a financial analyst--who would assist in the work
of the new Technical Department and of the existing Planning Department for
the first two years of the project after which local staff will assume full
responsibility. The Director of the department has already been recruited and
the remainder of the staff, together with the foreign experts, will be recruited
by loan effectiveness. Administrative arrangements have been made to remunerate
The first twe years of the program were included in a larger CABEI project
which incluJed 60 kms of the highway frorm La Entrada to Copan and the up-
grading of munici'LI services in the town of Ccpan Ruinas.

the local staff outside the career civil service structure so that salaries
would be adequate to attract experienced personnel of high caliber.
2.20      Hotel Training.  At present, INFOP has provided limited training
for basic hotel skills, mainly in the form of upgrading direct-entry em-
ployees in existing establishments. With the expansion of the hotel industry
envisaged under the project, the demand for skilled workers will be substan-
tially increased. Accordingly, INFOP would be required to expand and
systematize its activities in this field. To this end, its training program
will need to be restructured and local teaching staff will itself have to be
trained. The project would thus finance the employment of an expatriate chief
training advisor (to be employed no later than October 1, 1979) who will
initially advise on curricula and courses and will subsequently act as
senior instructor. He would be assisted by expatriate instructors until such
time as local teaching staff have returned from overseas training which itself
will be financed under the project. There would be a total of 57 manmonths of
expatriate instructing assistance and 63 manmonths of overseas training of
local instructors. In addition, a small amount of teaching equipment would
be provided.
2.21      Environmental Control on Roatan.  Since substantial tourism devel-
opment is expected on Roatan, where there are excellent beaches and outstanding
reefs which attract scuba divers, environmental control is essential if the
unique qualities of the island are to be conserved. Accordingly, a plan
needs to be prepared indicating tourism zones, their use and building standards
and other requirements for envlronmental proteecion. Thie preparation of the
plan would be supervised by an interagency steering committee (chaired by SECTUR)
the establishment of which would be a condition of disbursement of Bank funds
both for this project component and for the Roatan airfield component (para.
2.17). The implementation of the plan would be supervised by the interagency
committee and carried out by SECTUR which already has power to accord or deny
permits for hotel construction. The environmental control plan would be pre-
pared by consultants, assisted by local staff and would be completed by June 30,
1980 and discussed with the Bank.
2.22       Land Tenure.  An important constraint to tourism development on
Roatan has been uncertainties concerning land tenure, much of which has been
based on usage rather than formal registration of title. Accordingly, the
Government has prepared draft legislation to resolve these uncertainties. The
legislation authorizes the establishment of a special unit within IHT to ascer-
tain the facts of ownership in tourism zones and to assist occupants to obtain
and register title. Occupants either with formal title or with other acceptable
documentary evidence of ownership would be registered. Under the Honduran con-
stitution, foreigners are not allowed to own coastal or island land unless it
is an urban area, but the new legislation would permit leases to foreigners up to
40 years. The legislation specifies the procedures for the sale of land deemed
public in the absence of individual title. The proceeds of such sales would be
devoted to the benefit of the island community. Enactment of the draft legisla-
tion--which includes a decreto ley and an acuerdo which would designate Roatan
as a tourism zone where the provisions of the decreto ley would apply--and
establishment of the land tenure unit within IHT would be conditions of dis-
bursement for the Roatan airport works, and also a condition of credit eligibility
for Roatan hotel subprojects, unless evidence can be shown in the latter case,
to the Bank's satisfaction, that the prospective investor already had clear



- 10 -
title to the land proposed for development. The funds required to equip the
land tenure unit and to initiate its operations until December 31, 1979 are
included in the project.
2.23       Marketing.  IHT is the r(esponsible public agency for promoting
tcurist traffic to Honduras and, for this purpose, maintains a seven-person
promotion and public relations department. Because of limited tourism de-
velopment to date, promotional efforts have been severely restricted. As
the new hotels to be financed by the loan are constructed and start operations,
a sustained marketing effort would be required. While each hotel enterprise
would be responsible for individual marketing, a coordinated national market-
ing program would be mounted to acquaint the overseas travel trade with the
attractions of Honduras as a tourist destination. The services of an inter-
national travel marketing expert during the third and fourth years of the
project would be financed by the loan.
2.24       Airport Finances.  At present, the Direccion General de Aeronautica
Civil receives its operating funds through the Government budget while user
charges are remittable directly to the Treasury. There is therefore no ready
possibility of determining whether receipts cover costs. Fragmentary evidence
suggests they do not. In any event, there is a substantial backlog in the
collection of user charges. Because of the importance of the airport sector
to tourism development and to help form a basis for future governmental in-
vestment and policy decisions with respect to this sector, the Government has
agreed to undertake a study of airport user charges and develop a cost account-
ing system which would provide data needed to rationalize tariffs. The cost
of such a study will be financed by the proposed loan. The terms of reference
for the study would be presented for Bank approval by December 31, 1979. The
study would be completed within 12 months and the Bank would review its results
with the Honduran authorities by December 31, 1980.
III. BORROWING/EXECUTING AGENCIES
3.01       The loan would be made to the Government of Honduras (Ministry of Finance)
while various public agencies will lbe responsible for the execution of the different
loan project components. The Central Bank would administer the line of credit,
while the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (SECTUR) would be responsible for all
other components. The Ministry of Works would act on behalf of SECTUR in ensuring
implementation of the airport component and the environmental control plan for
Roatan. The National Institute for Vocational Training (INFOP) would implement
the hotel training program.
A. The Central Bank
3.02       The Central Bank is generally regarded both within and outside Honduras
as a professionally well managed and adequately staffed organization. In addi-
tion to its central banking and fiscal agent role, the Central Bank also provides
economic and financial advice to the Government and its president is a member of
the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers 1/ which formulates national
economic policy and programs.
3.03       The Central Bank has established the National Industrial Development
Fund (FONDEI) to help finance investment in small and medium sized industries.
FONDEI, which would be partially funded by a Bank loan for industrial credit,
1/ Membership includes the Ministers of Finance, Economy and Natural Resources
and Agriculture and the Executive Secretary of the National Planning Council.



- 11 -
approved by the Executive Directors on February 6, 1979, would operate as a
second tier financial institution to finance loans made by financial inter-
mediaries to small and medium sized firms. FONDEI would also manage the tourism
line of credit for which a separate account will be kept.
3.04       FONDEI has been established as a permanent institution with its own
staffing and financial resources and separate accounting. Responsibility
for setting FONDEI's operating policies, establishing budgets and staffing
plans and overseeing its activities will be vested in a three-member Exec-
utive Committee, to be drawn from the Central Bank's directors.
3.05      The Central Bank has prepared a draft organization chart and staff-
ing plan for FONDEI (Annex I, Chart A). FONDEI would be headed by a director
responsible for managing the operations of the fund. The Central Bank, which
would appoint the director and provide FONDEI with supporting technical staff
and logistics facilities, expects to be able to transfer most of the necessary
professional staff from its Industrial Studies Department. The Central Bank
is proposing that the detailed work of subloan administration, disbursement
and recovery and the keeping of records and financial accounts be handled for
FONDEI by the Central Bank's Credit and Securities Department which handles
such work for other Central Bank funds (including the Bank's agricultural
credit loans).
B. Ministry of Culture and Tourism (SECTU)
3.06      The Ministry of Culture and Tourism is responsible for the formu-
lation and implementation of tourism policies, sectoral planning, regulation
of the tourist industry and the promotion at home and abroad of the tourist
trade (Annex I, Chart B).
3.07      The current Minister has designated the National Tourism Institute
(IHT) as the executive arm of his tourism portfolio. The IHT was created by
congressional decree on October 18, 1972. Since that time, the congressional
form of government was replaced by the Government of the Armed Forces and
subsequently a ministry responsible for tourism was created. Thus, the legal
status of IHT is being reviewed and amended.  In the meantime, IHT has carried
on its work as an integral part of the Ministry.
3.08      IHT is divided into five departments for planning, promotion and
public relations, tourist services, social tourism and handicrafts (Annex I,
Chart C). IHT is headed by a competent director and several of the depart-
ment heads are of suitable background, but the intermediate and support staff
is limited both in numbers and experience and requires strengthening (see
paras. 2.20 and 2.24 for proposals in this connection). The promotion and
public relations department, for example, contains a small section dealing
with overseas promotion and public relations but, at present, has only one
representative office overseas. Within the planning department, the statis-
tical section provides a limited range of statistics, insufficient for oper-
ational analysis and very much delayed. The planning department's economic
analysis section concentrates on justifications for fiscal incentives and
has little capacity for sectoral planning. The tourist services department
has a three-person inspectorate of hotels and travel agencies which needs
strengthening. The tourist information bureaus at various tourism points in
the country are undermanned and provide a severely restricted range of services.



- 12 -
It is expected that technical assistance under the project (see para. 2.20)
will strengthen IHT and enable it to carry out its planning, project ap-
praisal and project implementation tasks effectively.
C. Ministry of Communications, Public Works and Transport (SECOPT)
3.09      The General Direction for Civil Works is responsible for the
planning, design and construction of runways, taxiways and parking aprons
at airports, while the Public Buildings Division of the General Direction
for Planning has similar responsibilities for terminal buildings (Annex I,
Chart D). Maintenance is in the hands of the General Direction for Highway
and Airport Maintenance. The operation of the airports is the responsibility
of the Direction General for Civil Aviation which receives budgetary alloca-
tions for this purpose; this Direction also records user charges incurred but
responsibility for their collection lies with the Government's central
Treasury Department (Tesoreria).
3.10      The General Direction for Planning also contains an Urban Planning
Division which is responsible for physical planning carried out either in-
service or by consultants (Annex I, Chart E). In the latter case, the
Division selects consultants, monitors their activities and provides, as
needed, logistic support and staff assistance.
D. National Institute for Vocational Training (INFOP)
3.11      The Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP), created
by decree in December 1972, is an autonomous agency responsible for training
at all levels of employment and for all sectors of the economy (Annex I,
Chart F). It is governed by a Board of Directors composed of the Ministers
of Labor, Education, Economy and the Plan, together with two representatives
each of the employers' council, the Consejo Hondureno de la Empresa Privada,
and of the labor unions' confederation, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de
Honduras. INFOP's operating costs are financed by a 1% payroll levy applied
to all enterprises with more than five employees or with assets of more than
US$10,000.
3.12      The Bank/IDA has financed (under Loan HON 954/Credit 452) the con-
struction, furnishings and equipment of two vocational training centers, one
in Tegucigalpa (240 places) and the other in San Pedro Sula (270 places).
The centers are staffed with the support of technical assistance financed by
the Loan/Credit and also by UNDP/ILO and the Canadian, German and Spanish
Governments. In 1978 there were also 37 Hondurans training abroad as instructors.
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
4.01      Total project cost, net of customs duties, is estimated at US$38.3
million equivalent. The estimated foreign exchange content of the project cost comes
to US$19.5 million. Detailed cost estimates for the various project components
are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

4.02       Hotel investment costs to be financed under the line of credit
are estimated on the basis of the program outlined in para. 2.06 and current
construction costs per hotel room in Honduras detailed in Annex I, Table 5.
The costs of imported construction materials, furniture and equipment do not
include customs duties from which they are exempt by Honduran law. The average
construction cost per room amounts to US$28,000 without contingencies and US$40,000
including contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at some 50% of
the total cost.
4.03       Civil works cost estimates for the airport and Copan components
are based on current unit construction costs and on a detailed analysis of
space requirements for buildings and quantities for other works. The cost
of furniture and equipment is based on an average shopping price either in
Honduras or abroad. Cost estimates for the airport and Copan components ex-
clude customs duties and other taxes which are expected to be negligible. An
average increase of 10% has been allowed to cover physical contingencies for civil
works, equipment and furniture. The foreign exchange cost of civil works varies
between 30% and 35%. The foreign exchange cost of fuviiture and equipment amounts
to some 60% and 90% respectively.
4.04      Technical assistance will be engaged for an estimated total of
206 manmonths at an average cost of US$5,800 per manmonth. Except for a
portion of internal travel and subsistence expenditures, technical assistance
is a foreign exchange cost.
4.05      Price increases are estimated over June 1978 base costs according
to the implementation schedules of the various project components and the
following annual price escalation rates:
Table 3: ANNUAL PRICE ESCALATION RATES

B. Financing Plan
4.06      The project financing plan provides for an IBRD loan of US$19.5
million equivalent, or 50,9% of the total Drolect cost. The ProDosed loan
would finance the equivalent of the full foreign exchange costs together with
US$29,000 equivalent, or less than 0.2%, of local costs. The total Glovern-
ment budgetary contribution for infrastructure and counterparts to technical
assistance will be US$2.8 million, or 7.3% of the total project cost. The
Central Bank will contribute US$1.6 million of its own funds to the line of
credit, or 5% of total hotel investment costs (see para. 2.08). The Central
Bank will provide half its contribution, namely US$800,000 equivalent, as a
condition of loan effectiveness and the remaining half one year after loan
effectiveness.



- 16 -
4.07      Financial intermediaries are expected to participate in the project with
US$3.2 million equivalent of their own funds and private investors with
US$11.2 million of equity funds, 10% and 35% respectively of total hotel
investment costs. Thus, funds originating in the private sector will cover
45% of total hotel investment costs and 37.8% of total project costs. The
sources and uses of project funds are summarized in Table 4.
4.08      The Government is fully committed to this project and, since the
required counterpart funds are limited, they are well within the capabili-
ties of the budget. Financial intermediaries are prepared to participate
in hotel finance; however, since commercial banks are limited by law to a
20% exposure of their capital to any one borrower and such capital is often
fairly restricted, the larger hotel lending operations would require con-
sortia of lenders. Present investor interest suggests that equity funds
should be forthcoming without difficulty. Indeed in some cases, commercial
banks are part of investment groups which will facilitate the raising of
the necessary funds.
C. Lending Terms
4.09      The Bank loan of US$19.5 million equivalent will be for 20 years
with a 5-year grace period at the prevailing Bank lending rate (presently 7%)
and the standard commitment fee of 0.75% annually. From the proceeds of
the Bank loan, US$16 million equivalent will be channeled through the Min-
istry of Finance to the Central Bank for the line of credit and the remain-
ing US$3.5 million to the Ministry of Tourism for the other components of
the project. Hotel subloans would include grace periods of up to four years
(typically to cover two years of construction and the first two years of
operations) with final maturities of 17 years and would be at an annual
interest rate of up to 12% (see paras. 2.09 and 2.10). Since the line of credit
is expected to be committed within three years of loan effectiveness, all
subloans would be repaid by final maturity of the World Bank loan (20 years).
V. IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Implementation
5.01      The project will be implemented in five years from loan effective-
ness with a proposed completion date of June 30, 1984 and a closing date of
December 31, 1984. Funds in the lLne of credit are expected to be fully
committed within three years from 'Loan effectiveness with all hotel construc-
tion completed in five years. Work at the airports of San Pedro Sula and
Roatan is scheduled to be completed by the end of the third project year, as
are all technical assistance activities except those for marketing which would
be completed at the end of the fourth year. Work at Copan spreads over the
entire five-year project period.
5.02      The Central Bank will ut-ilize the line of credit as part of a
rediscount facility for onward lending through financial intermediaries to
hotel and other tourism enterprises. The Central Bank will establish a
separate account for the rediscount facility which will be managed, on its
behalf, by the National Fund for Industrial Development (FONDEI). Feasi-
bility studies in support of subloan applications will be evaluated by the

Technical Department of IHT within the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
Only subprojects approved by the Technical Department will be considered
by FONDEI for subloan approval. All subloans in excess of US$100,000
will require prior Bank approval. The Technical Department would also be
responsible, together with. financial intermediaries, for supervising approved
subprojects.
5.03      Coordination of all other project components will be the responsi-
bility of the Technical Department of IHT within the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism which will ensure that they are implemented in accordance with
the loan agreement. In the case of the Copan component, implementation of
the various items will be supervised within the Ministry itself. The
Institute of Anthropology and History will supervise the archaeological
works, administer technical assistance funds, train guides and produce
informational material. The Technical Department of IHT will be responsible
for the construction and equipment of the visitors' center and the museum and
the installation of visitors' facilities. In the case of the airport works,
implementation will be supervised by the appropriate directorates within
the Ministry of Communications, Public Works and Transport.
5.04      IHT will provide local counterparts to technical assistance for
the Technical Department and will assume full responsibility for the contin-
uing operation of the department after the termination of such technical
assistance. The marketing advisor will work with the Promotion and Public
Relations Department of IHT. INFOP will provide counterparts for the
technical assistance in hotel training. The General Directorate of Urban
Planning of the Ministry of Communications, Public Works and Transportation
will supervise elaboration of the tourism environmental control plan for
Roatan while the Ministry of Culture and Tourism would chair an interagency
coordinating committee to oversee the plan's implementation, the latter to
be established prior to disbursement for this component. The study of airport
finances would be supervised by the General Directorate of Civil Aviation.
B. Procurement
5.05      Hotels.  Several construction companies in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
Sula are financially and technically capable of building the hotel units
envisaged under the line of credit. To construct hotels on the coast and on
the Bay Islands, such companies will be assisted by local contractors. Yearly
project investments during the peak years of the project implementation per-
iod would average some US$12 million or, according to the extrapolation of
past trends, some 10% of the expected total investment in the building sector.
Present construction capacity is adequate to meet hotel demand.
5.06      For contracts in excess of US$20,000 equivalent, prospective sub-
borrowers from the line of credit would normally be required to submit with
loan applications at least three bids for civil works accompanied by a de-
tailed bid evaluation report. If three bids could not be obtained (either be-
cause the investment group includes an interested contractor or for any other
reason), prospective subborrowers would be required to engage an independent
consulting cost engineer or quantity surveyor acceptable to the Bank to certify
that the proposed costs are reasonable. In addition, the experts provided
under technical assistance to THT's Technical Department would help to establish,
and periodically adjust, construction cost norms for various types of hotels

in different parts of Honduras. Civil works contracts under US$20,000 equiva-
lent would be procured through regular commercial channels from responsible
contractors. Civil works contracts of more than US$100,000 equivalent would
be subject to prior Bank review and approval.
5.07      For procurement of furniture, equipment and fixtures, the sub-
borrower would bt required to submit quotations from at least three speUalized
suppliers and justify the proposed selection. Direct contracting would be
allowed for purchases of less than US$20,000 equivalent provided their total
aggregated amount will not exceed US$50,000 equivalent. Prior review and
approval by the Bank of procurement of furniture, equipment and fixtures
would be limited to purchases of more than US$20,000 equivalent.
5.08      Other Project Components (Airports and Copan).  Contracts for civil
works would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank's prior review
and approval of civil works contracts would be limited to those in excess of
US$50,000 equivalent. Contracts for procurement of furniture, fixtures,
equipment and vehicles would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement, except
for contracts amounting to less than US$20,000 equivalent each, provided that
their aggregated amount will not exceed US$50,000 equivalent for each project
component. In evaluating furniture and fixtures contracts domestic manufac-
turers would be granted a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price of
competing imports or the prevailing level of customs duties, whichever would
be lower. The Bank's prior review and approval of procurement of furniture,
fixtures, equipment and vehicles would be limited to contracts of more than
US$20,000 equivalent.
C. Disbursement
5.09      The following disbursement rules will be applied:
(a)  with respect to the line of credit, 77% of the amounts dis-
bursed under each subloan (equal to 50% of total expendi-
tures made by final subborrowers for each subproject); and
(b)  with respect to all other components:
(i)  33% of total expenditures for civil works;
(ii) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported
goods;
(iii) 70% of the cost of locally procured goods;
(iv)  75% of total expenditures for technical assistance
and professional services;
(v)  100% of foreign expenditures for fellowships;
(vi)  100% of total expenditures until December 31,
1979 on operations of the land tenure unit; and
(vii)  100% of the project preparation advance.



.  20 -
Disbursements for subloans under (a) will be made against a certified statement
of expenditures, the documentation for which will be retained in FONDEI to be
made available for inspection by the Bank. The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments .s shown in Annex I, Table 10.
VI. PROSPECTIVE TRAFFIC
A. Occurancy Rates and Tariffs
6.01      Occupancies of hotels to be financed under the proposed line of
credit are projected to attain 80% for city accommodation and 65% for
accommodation elsewhere. These occupancies would be reached after a gradual
build-up of 5 years, the tl.'e required for Honduras to become a better
known tourism destination, for the new hotels to gain operational experience
and for the marketing assistance, provided under the project, to take full
effect.
6.02      In Tegucigalpa, where seasonality of vacation traffic is mitigated
by the regularity of business visits, current occupancies of first class
accommodation are over 90%, well above occupancies predicted for the new
international hotels which would be built under the line of credit. This
leaves a margin for a possible drop in occupancies, which would occur if the
build-up of demand in the next several years were not sufficient of itself to
fill out the 150-room hotel facility envisaged in the capital city.
6.03      Room occupancy rates predicted for hotels outside the cities, which
would primarily cater to vacationers,are considered plausible in view of
Honduras price competitiveness and hotel occupancy levels prevailing in des-
tinations elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean.
6.04      Published room rates in the new hotels will range from US$30-40
single occupancy and US$36-50 double (in 1978 prices) which compares with
a range of US$25-110 single and US$35-150 elsewhere in the region. The
MAP add-on rate (for two meals a day) will vary between US$12 and US$15 per
day according to category as compared with US$11-18 at competing destinations.
The package price of an inclusive trip of seven days from New York to a beach
hotel either on the mainland or on the Bay Islands would cost US$341-361
(group air fare, hotel accommodations, transfers and taxes, but excluding
tips), a cost which, primarily as a result of lower hotel prices, would be
competitive with Cancun, Mexico, where package prices in 1978 ranged from
US$299 to US$425. (Honduran resorts will be directly competitive with Cancun
and Cozumel in terms of accessibility--half-hour additional flight time from
North American departure points--and of attractions--tropical beaches together
with the possibility of excursions to Mayan ruins.) Circuit tourism within
Honduras (the main cities, Copan, Lake Yojoa) will be complementary to circuit
tourism throughout the Central American countries. A seven-day package from
New York to inland destinations in Honduras will cost US$361-381 as compared
with US$451 for such a package to neighboring Guatemala where hotel prices are
higher.
6.05      The 65% room occupancy rates assumed for new resort hotels in
Honduras in a typical year are somewhat below those current in such Caribbean
destinations as Barbados, Puerto Ricc and the Virgin Islands, and considerably
below those experienced in 1977 by Mexico as a whole (73.7%), Bahamas and
Bermuda (76.3%) and Cancun (68.5%).

B. Traffic Growth
6.06      Based on the target occupancies and an expected average room density
of 1.4 persons per occupied room in a city hotel and 1.7 persons in a resort
hotel, the total volume of bednights to be achieved in 1988, the ninth year of
the project, when all hotels would have attained maximum occupancies, would
amount to 283,147. Allowing for 10% of bednights occupied by domestic
travelers and an average length of stay for others of five days, international
arrivals occupying the new hotels in that year would total some 51,000. Of
this total, some 21,000 would spend all or part of their stay on Roatan, as
compared with 7,000-8,000 in 1977, while more than 20,000 of them would visit
(but not necessarily overnight at) Copan, as compared with 9,000-10,000 in
1977.
6.07      The achievement of viable occupancy rates would entail a 2.6%
average annual growth rate in vacation visitors (as distinct from transit,
business or other). Assuming that 80% of all guests in the new hotels were
from North America, this particular market segment would grow at an annual
average of 7.8%. The foregoing growth rates are considered modest and a
reasonably attainable marketing target; they are below the 8-10% growth
rate projected by the Secretariat for Central American Tourist Integration
(SITCA) and the Caribbean Tourist Association for the Central American and
Caribbean region as a whole, which in 1976 received 13,596,000 visitors,
C. Air Services
6.08      To take advantage of Honduras' natural assets and price competitive-
ness, the Government is now taking steps to remove international air access
constraints. The two key physical constraints at San Pedro Sula and Roatan
airports will be eliminated as the result of the works to be financed by the
project.
6.09      Steps are being taken to encourage an improvement in international
air services. SAHSA and TAN, the two Honduran airlines, operate services to
and from the US to the two gateways of Miami and New Orleans. Although the
US naturally has reciprocal rights, the designated carrier, Pan Am Airways,
does not utilize those rights but concentrates its own services on Guatemala
City, relying on the various Central American airlines as feeders to and from
Guatemala. Pan Am has made a heavy investment in facilities at the Guatemalan
airport and is unlikely to change this policy. The Honduran authorities are
seeking to have the designation for the two existing routes transferred from
Pan Am to other willing US carriers. They have negotiated
with the US Civil Aviation authorities to obtain two new gateways--at New
York and Houston. On the basis of reciprocity, both a Honduran and a US
carrier would be accorded rights to the new routes and the Honduran authorities
intend to seek a US carrier, other than Pan Am, which is prepared to operate
on these routes. In addition, the Government has reaffirmed its existing
liberal policies with respect to air charters which are a necessary addition
to traffic capacity, particularly during peak seasons.



- 22 -
6.10      San Pedro Sula, the main Honduran gateway for vacation air travel,
is closer to the main North American cities than most other competing desti-
nations.  From New York, for example, the operated air mileage is 1,824 as
compared with 2,064 for Guatemala City, 2,100 for Barbados and 2,210 for
Panama City. Only Jamaica and Cancun are closer, at 1,583 and 1,587 miles
respectively.
VII. HOTEL PROFITABILITY
7.01      To evaluate the profitability of hotel investments likely to be
financed under the proposed hotel line of credit, four types of possible
hotel subprojects have been analyzed. Type A hotels would provide a full
range of facilities expected by international traffic; Type B hotels, while
more modest than Type A, would nevertheless meet requirements of a segment of
international traffic; Type C would be of simpler construction in cabana or
motel style, but would also offer services required by the international market;
on the Bay Islands, the standards of construction would be similar to those
for Type C, but the hotels would also offer a full range of resort facilities.
A combination of these types of subprojects may be expected to be undertaken
at various locations and the investment costs to vary according to the type
of hotel and location, as summarized in Table 5.
Table 5: HOTEL INVESTMENT COSTS

B                   150               35,425                     5.3

7.02      Detailed projections of operating results of each hotel type are
shown in Tables 7 to 10.  On the basis of the assumptions detailed in Annex
III, the four different types of hotels should attain satisfactory levels of
gross operating profits (GOP), ranging from 27% to 34% of hotel revenues after
reaching the maximum expected occupancy in the fifth year of operations and
thereafter. The financial internal rate of return after taxes (IRR) varies
considerably according to hotel type and ranges from 7.3 to 16.6 % on total
investment and from 8.3% to 23.9% on equity. The variations in operating
results stem primarily from differences in investment costs, occupancies,
tariffs and franchise arrangements. The GOP ratios and internal rates of
return for each type of hotel are summarized in Table 6.

7.03      While internal rates of return on the project are valuable criteria
for the hotel investment decisions, an equally important criterion commonly
used by both lenders and borrowers is the likely financial result of a hotel
on an annual basis. In the second year of operation, annual rates of return
'on investment vary frQm 0.4% to 8.9% (in real terms). In the fifth year of
operations and thereafter when operational results are expected to stabilize
(in constant prices), the annual financial rates of return (net profit/invest-
ment) also vary widely, from 4.5% to 16.0% for the different types of hotels,

7.04      The operating projections indicate that the hotels will be able to
service their debts without difficulty. As Table 11 shows, hotel enterprises
will beable to meet interest and principal payments from their net cash flows
with a reasonable margin of safety even during the early critical years of
operation. Since grace periods of the subloans extend to the first two years
of operation during which only interest payments have to be met, a marked
decline in the debt coverage ratio occurs in the third year when principal
must be repaid. This would put considerable pressure on the hotels' liquidity
position. This would be particularly so with regard to the Type B hotel which
has a negative net cash flow in the third year. This negative cash flow, how-
ever, is small enough to be covered by positive cash flows from the previous
two years.

7.05      Hotel profitability has also been analyzed with respect to changes
in the underlying assumptions. Table 12 illustrates the sensitivity of the
internal rate of return on total investment to variations in
investment costs, occupancies and tariffs. This analysis indicates that
fluctuations within a reasonable range (+/-10%) in any one of the analyzed
basic assumptions have only moderate effect on hotel financial returns.

7.06       The financial analysis of various hotel types likely to be financed
under the proposed line of credit shows that well-conceived hotel projects in
Honduras can earn a satisfactory return on the invested funds and maintain a
sound financial condition. Particularly, smaller and less elaborate hotels at
locations highly attractive to certain segments of the tourism market such as
those on the Bay Islands should yield attractive returns to their owners. But
also a large city hotel with international standards--presently in short supply
in the country--will be able to achieve high occupancies and tariffs resulting
in attractive financial returns. It may be more difficult, however, to achieve
similar results with Type B hotels where relatively high investment costs on one
hand and not fully commensurate tariffs on the other may not provide an equally
broad safety margin during the first few years. This seems to be the case with
hotels to be built on the mainland coast. Investors with interests in other
related enterprises, such as land developments, golf courses, marinas or airlines,
may nevertheless wish to undertake such hotel investment as part of a wider
enterprise. Subloans for such hotels would of course only be approved if such
hotels could be shown to be in themselves financially and economically justified.
If the demand for funds for this type of hotel were not forthcoming, these funds
would be used for other hotel enterprises with at least equally good economic
justification and more attractive financial returns.

VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project to be analyzed comprises a hotel program of over 700
rooms, the development of other tourist facilities, such as restaurants, shops,
handicrafts, and their operator services, and associated infrastructure and
public sector services.
8.02      The economic analysis has been carried out in three stages.  First,
a rate of return on the hotel investment program alone has been calculated.
For this part of the economic evaluation, net benefits are defined as visitor
expenditures in hotels less the costs of building and operating the hotels.
Second, incremental visitor expenditures outside hotels and the cost of providing
the corresponding services were added to the benefit and cost streams. Third,
infrastructure investment expenditures at the airports and at Copan, as well
as Government outlays for the various items under technical assistance, were
added to project costs, but no additions were made to project benefits. This
may have introduced a conservative bias since at least some nonhotel invest-
ments will generate benefits for existing tourism facilities and for other
economic activities.
A. Economic Analysis
Hotel Investment Program
8.03      Of the 700 rooms to be financed by the line of credit, about 250
are expected to be built on the Bay Islands. Of the remaining 450 rooms, 150
are expected to be built in a city, most probably Tegucigalpa. The other 300
rooms will be built on the North Coast, at Lake Yojoa and Copan. The economic
investment costs of the entire program, expressed in June 1978 prices, amount
to US$20.4 million, or 92% of the financial investment costs. The economic
costs differ from the financial costs in that they do not include indirect
taxes (about 2% of total costs), half the market price of land (about 3% of
total costs), because of limited alternate use outside cities, and about one
third of the wages of unskilled labor used in hotel construction (about 3% of
total costs), to reflect the underemployment situation of this type of labor.
Annual replacement costs, after three years of operations, are estimated at
4% of the original financial investment cost, a weighted average of 15% for
furniture, 10% for equipment and 2% for construction.
8.04      The operating costs and revenues of hotels are derived from the
financial forecasts outlined in Tables 7-10 and in Annex III. These fore-
casts have been modified for the economic analysis. Economic operating
costs have been estimated at 96% of financial operating costs, 1.5% of the
reduction representing indirect taxes on hotel purchases and 2.5% of the
reduction reflecting an economic pricing of unskilled labor at 70% of market
wages. To calculate the gross benefits stream, hotel revenues have been
raised by 8% to account for sales taxes and tips (3% and 5% respectively on
total revenues). All foreign receipts and costs were valued at the official
exchange rate.
8.05      The economic cost and benefit streams resulting from the above
assumptions, projections and estimates are presented in Table 13 below. On
the basis of these streams and of an economic life of 30 years (with no



- 31 -
residual value taken into account) the internal economic rate of return for
the entire hotel investment program is 21.9%. This rate of return is more
than double the opportunity cost of capital in Honduras, estimated at around
10%. The present value of net benefits from hotel operations, discounted at
10%, is about twice as high as the present value of the investment costs
(including replacements) of the hotel program (US$40.2 million compared with
US$21.8 million).

Present value
at 10%        21,784              64,479           104,761            18,497
Internal economic rate of return:  21.9%
8.06      The relatively high economic returns from hotel investment are due
in part to the virtually full incrementality to the country of expenditures
by visitors to be accommodated in hotels built under the project. Little, if
any, demand would be diverted from the few existing hotels, which are fully
utilized and cater primarily to businessmen, to the proposed hotels which
would be primarily aimed at the vacation market (a possible exception would
be slight diversion in the city where the 150-room hotel may be built). At
the same time, the limited size of the proposed accommodation and the expected
demand build-up resulting from the establishment of Honduras as a vacation
tourism destination, would prevent diversion among hotels built at various
stages of the program. By the same token, it is unlikely that hotel prices
in existing hotels will be forced lower than they would have been without the
investment program. Thus, no adjustment has been made to the cost and benefit



- 32 -
streams either for demand diversion or for price softening. Another reason
for relatively high returns is that, although investment costs are quite
substantial, operating costs bear a favorable relationship to sales, largely
as a result of low payroll expenses.
Nonhotel Tourism Activities
8.07      International visitor traffic induced by the project will consti
tute an incremental demand for a whole range of goods and services provided
outside the hotels. The costs and benefits of providing such goods and
services (whether financed by the line of credit or not) have been taken into
account in calculating the economic rate of return and the present value of
net benefits. Nonhotel expenditures by hotel guests are expected to average
about US$10 per visitor/day. The investment cost for providing these facili-
ties in any one year is projected to equal 60% of the incremental tourist
expenditures outside hotels for the following year. Annual replacement costs
after three years of operations are taken as 15% of the original investment
costs. All investment and replacement costs are entered at their market
price. Operating costs are estimated as 70% of sales. The economic rate of
return for the project when taking into account both hotel investments and
investments in other tourist activities comes to 24.1% and the present value
of net benefits to US$23.8 million.
Public Sector Investments
8.08      The Government will be investing US$6.3 million (in current prices)
for airport improvements at San Pedro Sula and Roatan, the archaeological and
tourism works at Copan and technical assistance for orderly sectoral develop-
ment, project evaluation, training and marketing. The net present value of
these investments in 1978 prices comes to US$4.6 million. The airport works
will be removing important constraints to tourism development. There will be
benefits in terms of time savings for tourists and other passengers and also
incremental revenues to existing accommodation facilities. None of these
benefits is credited to the project.
8.09      Similarly, the overall program of improving the accessibility and
attractiveness of the archaeological park at Copan is expected to contribute
to motivating travelers to visit the country in general and Copan in particular.
Not only is the number of visitors to the archaeological park expected to rise
substantially, but the improvements there will justify an increase in the
present low entrance fee from US$1.00 to US$3.00. As a result of both the in-
crease in visitors and in entrance fees, park revenues are expected to rise
by about US$120,000 annually when the project is completed. Most of these
benefits, however, have already been directly taken into account in calculating
nonhotel expenditures (para. 8.07) and indirectly in the projected hotel occu-
pancy rates.
Rate of Return and Net Present Value
8.10      When the investment costs at the airports and Copan, together with
technical assistance expenditures, are added to the hotel and nonhotel
investment costs with no corresponding additions to project benefits, the



- 33 -
economic rate of return is 19.0% and the present value of net benefits US$18.3
million (see Tables 14 and 15).

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
8.11      The sensitivity of the internal economic rate of return and the net
present value of the benefits to changes in cost and revenue assumptions for
the hotel program areshown in Table 16 below. Economic returns to the pro-
gram are more sensitive to increases in operating costs than to changes in
the investment costs. A 20% increase in operating costs would reduce the net
present value of benefits from US$18.3 million to US$6.3 million and the
economic rate of return from 19.0% to 13.3%. Although there is some risk that
operating efficiency may fall short of the one implied by the hotel financial
projections, the shortfall is not likely to persist as management skills and
experience are gained.

- 36 -
8.12      Economic returns are also sensitive to changes in hotel occupancy
and tariff levels. A drop in both occupancies and hotel tariffs by 10%
would reduce the rate of return to 14.0% and the present value of net bene-
fits to US$7.9 million. This result suggests that, although a shortfall in
traffic is one of the main risks for the project, it would take a very large
drop in both occupancies and tariffs to endanger its economic viability.
The risk of the latter is relatively small.
8.13      Although the evaluated hotel investment program is justified both
under the original set of assumptions and for reasonable changes in these
assumptions, the economic viability of each subproject will have to be
separately demonstrated. This will be carried out by the Technical Department to
be established within IHT (see paras. 2.05 and 2.14). The Technical Department
will be guided by the technical assistance provided under the project.
B. Economic and Social Impact
Balance of Payments Effects
8.14      Foreign exchange receipts are forecast to exceed US$15 million by
the ninth year of project operation (see Table 17). About US$3.7 million
of foreign exchange payments, however, will have to be made annually
in order to maintain and operate the new tourism facilities. Between the
5th and 20th years of the project there will also be an outflow of nearly
US$3 million a year to service the Bank loan. During these years, the net
foreign exchange receipts will amount to about US$8.6 million or 56% of
gross foreign exchange receipts from foreign visitors. In year 30 the net
inflow will be US$11.6 million, or 76% of gross receipts.

Employment Effect
8.15      About 2,500 manyears of employment will be created during the con-
struction phase of the project. Another 840 permanent jobs will be created
once all the hotels built under the program are completed. About 650 per-
manent jobs till be created in other tourism activities. Thus, a total of
1,500 direct permanent jobs will be created by the project. Additional jobs
will be created indirectly in activities which supply goods and services to
the tourism sector.
Budgetary Impact
8.16      The Government is expected to invest about US$6.3 million equivalent
in the project, about US$2.8 million from the budget and about US$3.5 million
of borrowed funds. When the project is in full operation, the Government is
forecast to receive more than US$0.5 million annually in the form of sales
taxes on tourism services, an additional US$100,000 a year in airport charges
and about US$120,000 year from entrance fees at archaeological sites. There
will also be budgetary revenues from duties on goods imported by tourism
establishments amounting to some US$180,000 annually and income taxes on
wages and salaries of tourism employees in the order of US$360,000 annually.
After the fifth year of operations for a city hotel and the tenth year for
all other hotels,the Government will also begin collecting taxes on hotel pro-
fits. When all hotels are paying the full profits tax, they will amount to
US$1.2 million equivalent. In summary, total Government receipts arising
from the project when fully operational will amount to some US$2.5 million
equivalent annually.
Project Beneficiaries
8.17      Apart from the Government, the main beneficiaries of this loan
would be private sector enterprises investing in hotels and other tourism
facilities and their employees. Unskilled labor will particularly benefit
because wages, benefits and overall earnings will be appreciably above their
maximum earnings in the next best alternate employment opportunity in
Honduras' low-wage economy. Producers of handicrafts will also increase their
earnings as the result of tourist demand. None of these benefits would have
materialized without the project.
Social Impact
8.18      Through its economic impact of creating employment opportunities
for a large number of families, the project will have obvious positive social
effects,Because of the dispersed tourism development envisaged under the
project, relatively small numbers of tourists will be visiting specific loca-
tions on the country's coastal areas and islands at any one time. These
numbers are well within the social absorptive capacity of these areas and
thus few, if any, adverse social effects are anticipated.

/a 'Investment costs do not include physical or price contingencies.  They refer to hotels constructed in Tegucigalpa or San Pedro Sula
Investment costs of hotels in provincial cities should be multiplied by the following escalation factors:
Bay Islands  - 1.35          La Ceiba    - 1.10              Omoa          - 1.10         Tela     - 1.15

Copan        - 1.20          Olancho      - 1.20            Porto Cortez - 1.10
Lb  Type A hotels provide the full   international standard of facilities; type B hotels, more modest than type A, nevertheless
meet requirements of a segment of international traffic; and type C, while of simpler construction in cabana or motel style,
nevertheless offer services required by the international market.

HONDURAS
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FONDEI OPERATING REGULATIONS FOR TOURISM LOANS
1.         A special account will be opened and maintained in the National
Industrial Development Fund--FONDEI--to finance tourism enterprises, with
resources from the World Bank and counterpart funds from Banco Central de
Honduras.
2.         FONDEI shall use the resources mentioned in the preceding para-
graph to discount loans made by financial intermediaries (commercial banks
and the National Investment Corporation (CONADI)) for the construction, ex-
pansion and modernization of hotels and other activities related to the de-
velopment of tourism, except gaming houses and casinos.
3.         Participating financial intermediaries shall enter into a partici-
pation agreement with the Central Bank which will stipulate the operating
regulations to be followed and the procedures for loan appraisal, analysis
and supervision.
4.         FONDEI shall finance up to 55% of the cost of each investment proj-
ect, 50% from World Bank funds and 5% from counterpart funds. The financial
intermediaries shall provide at least 10% from their own funds and the borrower
shall contribute at least 35%.
5.         The rate of interest paid by the final borrower shall be 12%.  The
rate of interest paid by financial intermediaries for FONDEI funds shall be
9.5%. These rates will be periodically reviewed and if necessary be revised,
to reflect current economic conditions. The Central Bank shall always receive
the difference between interest rate on the World Bank loan and the rate paid
by intermediaries, this margin to cover cross-currency exchange risks and
administrative costs.
6.         The maximum amount of each loan to be rediscounted by FONDEI shall
be L 10,000,000, the maximum loan period being 17 years, with grace periods
of up to 4 years. Where the project so requires, funds may be provided by a
banking consortium.
7.         The portion of the subloans to be financed with the proceeds of
the Bank loan will be denominated in lempiras and will be repayable in such
an amount of lempiras as to repay the US dollar equivalent of the original
amount of the subloans, such US dollar equivalent to be determined on the basis
of the dollar exchange rate prevailing on the official market in Honduras on
the date such subloans were granted.
8.         In considering loan requests, FONDEI shall require the prior ap-
proval of feasibility studies by the Technical Department of IHT. In evaluating
projects to be financed, the following criteria shall be borne in mind:
- The development priorities of the tourism sector;
- The technical aspects of construction, equipment and operation;



- 58 -
ANNEX II
- The rate of economic and financial return;
- Labor requirements;
- The increase or savings in foreign exchange;
- The opportunities to increase the percentage of value added;
- The use of Honduran goods and services;
- Other economic aspects, according to the nature of the project.
The foregoing criteria shall be set out in greater detail in a separate document
to be agreed between the Ministry of Culture & Tourism and the Central Bank.
The Technical Department of IHT and the financial intermediaries shall be
responsible for project supervision.
9.         FONDEI shall review the work of the Technical Department of IHT for
purposes of approving loans. Loans greater than L 200,000 shall additionally
require the approval of the World Bank.
10.        In authorizing withdrawal from each loan account, FONDEI shall en-
sure that the procurement procedures laid down in the loan agreement for tourism
development between the Government of Honduras and the World Bank have been
followed.

subject to the following basic requirements:
(a) They may only be granted to financial intermediaries
operating in accordance with the laws of Honduras;
(b) The financial intermediary must ensure that the
borrower has sufficient funds to finance its needs
for equity capital;

or their advisors to present the necessary studies for
project analysis to the Technical Department of IHT
in an acceptable form;
(d) The financial intermediaries shall punctually repay
their loans from FONDEI even if they may not have
been reimbursed by their borrowers. They shall pay
to FONDEI without delay any prepayments received from
borrowers.
12.        FONDEI's financial statements, including the Special Account for
Tourism Loans, shall be audited by the Auditoria Externa of the Central Bank
or by other independent auditors acceptable to the World Bank.

ANNEX III
HONDURAS
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES
A. Financial Analysis
Types of Hotels
1.        To evaluate the financial profitability of hotels to be financed
under the proposed line of credit, the following four types of hotels were
selected:
(a) a small resort hotel on the Bay Islands, with 50 rooms at a
total investment cost of US$26,850 per room, catering to the
international vacation market and providing a variety of
leisure activities, particularly water sports, and managed
by its owner;
(b) a 150-room city hotel, operated under a franchise agreement
catering both to business and vacation clientele; investment
costs per room are estimated at US$41,535   (Hotel Type A);
(c) a 150-room beach resort hotel with recreational facilities
such as tennis courts, boat rentals, scuba diving school,
operated under a franchise agreement; investment costs per
room are taken at US$35,425   (Hotel Type B);
(d) a small owner-managed tourist hotel with 50 rooms at such
locations as Copan or Lake Yojoa; investment costs per room
are estimated at US$24,165   (Hotel Type C).
Hotel Profitability
2.        Pro forma income statements for the four types of hotels were pre-
pared on the basis of past and current experience of hotel operations in
Honduras together with information from similar hotel projects in neighboring
countries. All revenue and cost items and rates of return are in constant
June 1978 prices.
3.        Revenue assumptions are as follows:
(a) occupancies of 45% are assumed for the initial year rising
to their maximum of 65% by the fifth year except for Type
A hotel for which a 50% occupancy is assumed in the first
year, rising to a maximum of 80%. An occupancy factor of
an average of 1.7 persons per occupied room has been assumed
for all resort hotels and 1.4 persons per room for the city
hotel. Average published room rates have been estimated at



- ;n -
ANNEX III
US$40/50, US$40/45, US$36/40 and US$30/36, single and double
occupancy for Bay Islands, Types A, B and C respectively.
Commissions averaging 15% of room sales are assumed for the
Bay Islands and Types B and C where, in addition to retail
commission, there would be an incidence of group rates, while
only 10% average commission is expected for Type A where busi-
ness travel would predominate. Allowing both for commissions
and the single to double occupancy factor, the average bed-
night rent received would be US$23.50, US$27.00, US$19.40 and
US$17.10 for the Bay Islands, Types A, B and C respectively.
(b)  food revenues have been estimated at an average of US$15 per
day per guest with a provision of 20% for passing trade. (No
passing trade has been assumed in the case of Bay Islands and
Type B hotels). Revenues from beverage sales have been taken
at US$5 per day per guest with a 30% adjustment for nonhotel
guest sales. Revenues from other operating departments such
as telephone, valet service, sports equipment and concession
income have been estimated at US$6 per bednight for the Bay
Islands hotel, US$2.95 for Type A hotel, US$4.26 for Type B
hotel and US$3.07 for Type C hotel. These estimates include
rental income (US$2,000 to US$2,500 per annum) for five shops
in Type A hotel, three shops in Type B hotel and one shop in
Type C hotels. No hotel shops are expected in the Bay Islands
hotel.
4.        Cost of sales assumptions are as follows:
(a) cost of food and beverage sales take into account the geograph-
ical location of the hotel. Hence, on the Bay Islands (where
transport costs are the highest) food costs are estimated at
38% of sales, while on the mainland, food costs are estimated
at 36% of sales outside the city and 35% for the city hotel
itself. Likewise, beverage costs represent 28% of sales on
the Bay Islands, 27% on the mainland and 25% in the city.
(b) payroll at the maximum occupancy rates has been based on 1.2
employees per room except that in the case of the city hotel
a ratio of only 1.1 has been taken, since personnel in the
city are usually better trained. 85% of the staff work in
operating departments. The average annual salary per employee
has been estimated at US$2,400 on the Bay Islands, US$2,600
on the mainland and US$2,800 in the city hotel. Payrolls in-
clude the usual Christmas bonus of one month's salary, paid
holidays, an INFOP levy of 1% of payroll, employees' meals add
the employer's social security contribution of 7%. Since full
staffing will be needed only when maximum occupancy has been
reached, a gradualbuild-up of staff has been taken from 85% in
the first year of operation to 100% in the fourth.



- 61 -
ANNEX III
(c) other costs include costs of sales of minor operating depart-
ments (telephone, valet service, etc.) and direct departmental
expenses incurred in the operation of departments, e.g., cost
of china, glassware, cleaning supplies, decorations, laundry,
linen, entertainment and uniforms. Minor operating department
costs have been estimated at 35% of sales for Bay Islands hotels,
33% for Type A and 35% for Types B and C hotels. Direct de-
partmental expenses have been calculated at 10% of gross sales.
5.        Overhead expense assumptions are as follows:
(a) administrative and general expenses have been set: 10% of
total revenues for the city hotel, 8% for the mainland hotels,
7% for the Bay Islands hotel;
(b) promotional expenses have been set at 4% of total revenues;
(c) the expenses for utilities including the cost of electrical
power, fuel, steam and water have been valued at 5% of hotel
revenues on the assumption that the hotels, except the one
in the city, must install and operate their own facilities.
In the city, where public service connections are available,
such expenses are set at 4% of total revenues.
(d) expenses for repairs and maintenance depend to a large degree
on the type of construction, material and equipment. Such
expenses have accordingly been set at 7% of revenues in resort
hotels and at 6% in the city hotel.
6.        For the two larger types of hotels (A and B), it has been assumed
that they will be linked to an international hotel reservations system.
These services are commonly available at a franchise fee of 5.5% of room
sales.
7.        Capital cost assumptions are as follows:
(a) according to Honduran law, buildings and construction can be
depreciated over 40 years. Other assets can be written off
on the basis of their useful life, which has been estimated
at ten years for hotels. Deferred expenses and interest
during construction have been amortized over five years.
(b) the individual financial plans for the various hotels assume
a debt/equity ratio of 65:35. Interest rates on the loan
funds have been adjusted in real terms (on the basis of a
projected inflation rate of 7% and a nominal interest rate
of 12%), arriving at an interest rate of 5% for long-terr
and 6% for short-term funds. Annual interest expenses have
been calculated on loans with final mhaturities of 17 years
including grace periods of four years to cover two years of
construction and the first two years of operations. Working
capital will be repaid as part of the long-term funds.

ANNEX III
8.         Municipal and income taxes have been deducted in accordance with
present Honduran laws and schedules and on the assumption of a ten-year in-
come tax holiday for hotels outside the cities and five years' tax holiday
for city hotels thereafter they pay 50% of their taxes for another five
years).
9.         Internal rates of return (IRR) on equity and total investment have
been calculated in real terms for a 30-year period by eliminating inflationary
price increases from the cost/benefit stream.
B. Economic Analysis
10.       The financial investment costs for hotel donstruction are adjusted
by 2% of total costs for indirect taxes, 3% for half the market price of
land and another 3% or one third of the wages of unskilled labor used in
construction.
11.       Annual replacement costs for hotels are estimated at 4% of the
original financial investment cost, a weighted average of 15% for furniture,
10% for equipment and 2% for construction.
12.       Hotel operating costs have been adjusted by 1.5% for indirect
taxes on their purchases and by 2.5% accounting for pricing unskilled labor
at  70%   of its market price.
13.       Sales taxes are 3% and tips 5% of total revenues.
14.       Investment costs for nonhotel tourism activities in any one year
are assumed as 60% of the incremental tourist expenditures outside hotels
for the following year.
15.       Annual replacement costs for nonhotel activities are set at 15% of
the original investment costs.
16.       Operating costs of nonhotel activities are estimated at 70% of
their sales.
17.       All costs for activities outside hotels are at their market prices.
18.       Foreign visitors account for 90% of bednights in hotels built under
the project.
19.       Half the maintenance and replacement costs are assumed to be in
foreign exchange as are 20% of operating costs.
20.       The wage bill in construction is assumed to amount to 20% of total
investment costs and annual earnings of construction workers are assumed at
US$1,800.
21.       In nonhotel tourism activities 35% of the operating costs represent
wage costs and the average annual wage is US$1,000.
22.       All costs and benefits are in 1978 prices.
