employment especially in the regions of the country with few\n            alternative economic activities, increasing Government\n            revenues, and building institutions for tourism planning and\n            implementation. The project comprises a line of credit for\n            hotel and other tourism enterprises, improved air\n            facilities, establishment of a special unit to regularize\n            the land tenure situation on Roatan Island, archaeological\n            works at Copan, and technical assistance for (a) the\n            Ministry of Culture and Tourism, (b) hotel training, (c)\n            environmental control on Roatan, (d) tourism marketing, and\n            (e) airport cost accounting studies. About 1,500 direct\n            permanent jobs as well as additional indirect employment,\n            will be created by the project."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
