                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Team has initiated work on the Implementation Completion Report. The Province of Cordoba has finalized an impact evaluation study that presents project outcomes in terms of
                         connectivity, improved access, reduced travel times and vehicle operating costs, regional productivity, etc. The results of this study were presented at a public event and widely
                         disseminated during the supervision mission in July 2013. This study will be a key input for preparation of the client's completion report as well as the Bank's ICR.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
