A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed reallocation is necessary to reflect the modifications introduced to the
   Program’s Procurement Plan since the original matrix was first approved. These
   changes reflect further changes in the expected procedures (which in some cases had
   to be cancelled in light of the Project’s needs, objectives and changing contexts): (a)
   A number of procedures from Component 1 (Institutional Strengthening) were
   cancelled, and a series of other procedures were included as part of the Procurement
   Plan following Supervision Missions in May and November, 2012. These included
   the acquisition of IT equipment for Cordoba’s Supercentro, and the hiring of a
   consultant that is carrying out the Project’s Impact Evaluation Study, (b) Actual
   resources for the execution of Component 2 (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance)
   have exceeded originally allocated resources as a result of automatic price
   redeterminations, and (c) Component 3 (Road Paving) originally contemplated the
   execution of six (6) works, of which only five (5) were carried out.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The project entails a US$75 million loan extended directly to the Province of
   Cordoba with the guarantee of the Government of Argentina. It was approved by the
   Board on July 11, 2006 and became effective on December 13, 2006. The loan is 99
   percent disbursed. The latest ratings for progress towards achievement of the Project
   Development Objective (PDO) and Implementation Progress are both satisfactory.
   The PDO will be fully achieved by closing.

3. Implementation progress is significantly advanced with the major civil works
   completed with only the last maintenance phase of the CREMA contract remaining.
   The institutional component is also in the final phase, and has had important
   successes in the road safety, financial management, governance, and road asset
   management areas. The Project has been highly satisfactory to date, as evidenced in
   beneficiary satisfaction levels noted in the mid-term review; and through beneficiary
   and stakeholder review meetings held in the most recent supervision missions (May
   2012, November 2012 and June 2013). It also has a consistently satisfactory track
   record during implementation with provincial authorities providing attention to
   fiduciary (financial management and procurement); and safeguards (social and
   environmental) requirements as per Bank policies and guidelines. The latest audit
   report (for the period January-December 2012) has been received by the Bank and
   found to be satisfactory. In addition, neither the loan in particular, nor the country in
   general is subject to an ongoing suspension of loan disbursements.

 D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 Overall, it is considered that the changes correspond to a reallocation of 2.75 percent in
 the Project’s proceeds. The changes do not significantly affect other aspects of the project
 (Costs, Disbursements, Economic and financial analysis, Technical, Social,
 Environmental, etc.).
