The extension is\n            necessary to: (i) further the major governance agenda by\n            completing the procurement and installation of priority\n            information technology equipment and systems related to the\n            Province's efforts for increased transparency,\n            accountability, and citizen responsiveness; (ii) further the\n            road safety agenda that has been of high impact, and a model\n            for other provinces by the procurement of priority road\n            safety equipment; and (iii) enable the timely conclusion of\n            the CREMA (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract -\n            Contrato de Rehabilitacion y Mantenimiento) contract (which\n            ends May 2013). The Borrower has a plan to satisfactorily\n            complete the project in the extended time. This will be the\n            first extension of the project (8 months extension total)."}, "docdt": "2012-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
