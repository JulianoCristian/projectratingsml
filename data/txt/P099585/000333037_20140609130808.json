outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: projects that encourage and facilitate\n            close, continuous and direct interaction with the Borrower\n            have a better chance to succeed. In the case of this\n            project, direct lending to a sub-national government, which\n            obviated one layer of bureaucracy, coupled with a Bank field\n            based supervision team providing continuous support to the\n            implementing agencies was a key to the prompt execution of a\n            project with a rather complex civil work component. The\n            focus placed on a multisectoral approach for road safety\n            rooted in the safe system approaches which lead the project\n            to interact with the Ministry of Government on issues\n            related to enforcement (strengthening the Highway Patrol,\n            fine processing procedures, etc.), safe drivers (licensing\n            system, education and awareness campaigns, etc.), and\n            linking it to the lead agency at the national level,\n            contributed to the good outcomes that the province of\n            Cordoba has had in recent years. In this sense, this project\n            showed the merits of improving road safety management based\n            on performance and results, not just road safety\n            interventions linked to infrastructure, but rather working\n            with other sectors and strengthening road safety management\n            more broadly for enhanced impact. Maximizing the benefits of\n            public participation and beneficiaries' opinions while\n            containing the potential costs of a small group of people\n            hindering the implementation of valuable projects requires a\n            well thought management of public information. This includes\n            the timely release of high quality studies of different\n            alternatives prepared by qualified and trusted professionals."}, "docdt": "2014-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
