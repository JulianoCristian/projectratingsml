objective of the Education\n            Sector Development Project is to accelerate access to basic\n            education and the qualitative development of primary and\n            general secondary education while maintaining the share of\n            the sector within the Government's recurrent budget at\n            a level approximating 20 percent.  To this end, the project\n            intends to:  (a) implement phased sectoral adjustment\n            measures to contain education costs; (b) strengthen the\n            planning, budgeting and cost-control capacity of the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE); and (c) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of education at the primary and general secondary\n            levels through the training of supervisors, upgrading of\n            teacher skills, preparation of new programs for secondary\n            education, and provision of textbooks and teacher guides.\n            It also seeks to (d) improve access to education for rural\n            children, by providing additional student places in rural\n            primary and secondary institutions."}, "docdt": "1988-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
