MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPKENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 23.0 million (US$31.5
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance an
education sector development project. The project would be cofinanced by
UNDP (US$0.5 million) and UNICEF (US$1.5 million).
2.       Background.  In 1973 the Government adopted a reform of the
education system to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of education
and to make the system more responsive to the country's medium-term
development needs. Attainment of Universal Primary Education (UPE) by the
year 1995/96, without impairing the quality of instruction, is a major goal
to which the Government is publicly committed. IDA has assisted the
Government in implementing the most critical initial phases of the reform,
in three projects, providing financing for the construction of rural
primary schools, the preparation of new teacher training programs and more
relevint curricula, improvement of primary education, and the development
of technical education. While these efforts have resulted in an increase
in the primary enrollment ratio (from 292 in 1980 to about 501 in 1985) and
the output of better trained technicians needed in improving agricultural
productivity, much more progress is required in the development of
education, qualitatively and quantitatively, if the objectives of the
reform are to be met. A major problem facing the sector is the skewed
pattern of education financing, whereby the Government and external donors
finance mainly upper secondary and higher education, without controlling
their cost -- a situation stemming from urban social pressurt in favor of
those levels of education. Also the wide dispersion of Burundi's rapidly
growing population hampers the delivery of social services and is
particularly a handicap in access to education in terms of cost as well as
equity. Other major issues facing the sector are: the declining quality of
primary and general secondary education, pointing to the need to improve
the efficiency of teacher support and to upgrade teachers; and over-
centralization of the planning and management of the education system,
leading to deficiencies in school administration and a lack of coordination
of the work of regional staff, school inspectors and headmasters. To
address these issues and thus intensify education reform, the Government
has adopted a sectoral adjustment strategy to be implemented through policy
measures aiming at reducing per student costs, eliminating the major
sources of inefficiency, and restructuring the education budget. These
phased structural adjustment measures are in line with the Public
Investment Plan (PIP) and the Public Expenditure Program (PEP) being
prepared by the Government.

3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's strategy for support of
Burundi places emphasis in the long term on creating a framework for
sustainable growth for which development of human resources is crucial, and
in the short term on strengthening macroeconomic management and
rationalizing public expenditure. The education sector represents a
substantial part of total public expenditures. Thus IDA involvement in
development of the education sector is an important part of both our long
and short term strategies for Burundi. It complements our ongoing
macroeconomic dialogue and our support to the Government's structural
adjustment program.  Through restructuring expenditures in the education
sector and implementing education reform, the Government is intensifying
the momentum gained under the previous three education projects and is
strongly committed to creating an. education system that is equitable, cost-
effective and responsive to the country's needs.
4.       ProJect Objectives.  The overall objectives of the project are to
increase access to basic education and to improve the quality of primary
and general secondary education while maintaining the share of the sector
within the Governmaent's recurrent budget at a level approximating 20Z. To
this end, the project would: (a) implement phased sectoral adjustment
measures to restructure 3ectoral expenditures and to contain education
costs; (b) strengthen the planning, budgeting and cost-control capacity of
the Ministry of Education (MOE); (c) improve the quality and efficiency of
education at the primary and general secondary levels through the training
of supervisors, upgrading of teacher skills, preparation of new programs
for secondary education, and provision of textbooks and teacher guides; and
(d) improve access to education for rural children, by providing additional
student places in rural primary and secondary institutions.
5.       Project Description.  The project consists of four main
components. The first component would strengthen the Government's capacity
to establish targets and to implement phased policy measures during the
project. The measures to be undertaken include: (a) reduction of the per
student cost of teaching and administrative staff by decreasing
teacherlstudent ratios at the primary, secondary and university leiiels,
increasing the teaching workload for secondary and higher education
teachers, reducing the number of substitute teachers in primary schools,
and reducing administrative staff at all education levels; (b) reduction of
subsidies in secondary and higher education by reducing the number of
boarding secondary students and the fellowship allowances for higher
education students studying abroad; (c) cost-recovery improvement by
increasing parents' contributions to the cost of primary schooling and the
boarding of secondary school students, increasing charges for meals for
higher education students; and (d) increase in the enrollment of primary
school-age children over the period 1988-92 while accelerating student flow
through the system by increasing the promotion rate at primary level and
reducing the repetition rate in the first three grades.  These measures are
expected to reduce per student costs by about 15Z.  Meanwhile, the
education budget would be restructured to increase the primary education
budget from 452 to 54? of total.  The measures are expected to generate the
savings required to provide the recurrent budget for further expansion of
primary school enrollments and improvement of education quality. The
adoption by the MOE of a Public Expenditure Program (PEP) and of a Public
Investment Program (PIP) would provide the budgetary framework which is
needed to manage a buoyant sectoral development within the constraint of



both domestic and foreign resources. Because of commitments undertaken by
the previous Government, the level of internal and external scholarships in
1988 is too high for the education budget to support. As an adjustment
measure, the credit would provide US$1.5 million equivalent in 1988 only,
to finance scholarships and so to allow the Governmertt budget to meet the
sector's recurrent needs. A revised PEP for 1988 would be submitted to IDA
as a condition of effectiveness. In 1989, external scholarships would be
limited to those financed by donors.
6.       The second Project component is to strengthen the Ministry of
Education's planning, budgeting and cost-control capacity. This would
include support for the Direct-,rate of Educational Planning to enable it to
implement and monitor the sectoral adjustment program and to prepare
subsequent adjustment and cost-effective measures and growth plans. School
administration would also be strengthened and steps taken to improve
coordination of the work of the regional inspectors and headmasters. The
third component is the improvement of the quality and efficiency of primary
and general secondary education; this would include enhancing effectiveness
of teachers support through seminars and in-service training programs,
improved science instruction, and increased production and distribution of
textbooks and teacher guides. The fourth component, improvement of access
to education, would provide additional student places in rural primary and
secondary schools by financing the construction of about 55 (mainly rural)
primqry and three lower secondary schools (Collages Ruraux), a primary
school rehabilitation program, and the reconversion of about 10 upper
seconda-y schools, to reduce boarding and increase classroom space. Under
this component, a decentralized school maintenance program would be
established and monitored, and the Education Projects Unit would be
reorganized into two departments, one for project management and the other
for implemetting the school construction program.  The reorganization of
BPE would be a condition of Credit effectiveness. The total costs of the
project are estimated at US$37.5 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$26.4 million (70Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements and the disbursement .schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Burundi are given in Schedule C. A map is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6913-BU, dated Janary 15, 1988, is also
attached.
7.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following: (a)
specific, time bound, reform targets have been set; (b) these targets would
be closely monitored and IDA would be informed annually on the results
achieved in unit cos.. reductions and the restructuring of the education
budget; (c) the school construction program would be implemented in two
phases, and a condition of disbursement for the second phase (expected to
begin the third year of the project) would be realization of satisfactory
progress in attaining the mid-term objectives of the sectoral adjustment
program; (d) a PIP would be established for a three-year period to be
regula:ly updated, and any major departure from this program would be
submitted to IDA for comment; (e) a PEP would be established on a rolling
basis and each annual revision submitted to IDA for comment; and (f) the
Ministry of Education's Planning Departmert, with the assistance of the
project Director, would have the authority to control and monitor the use
of school maintenance funds. A Coordinating Committee for Education



-4-
Activities has been set up to monitor implementation of teacher training
programs. Project staff of the Education Projects Unit and the School
Construction Unit are being appointed in accordance with the staff
appointment schedule agreed with IDA.
8.       Benefits.  The project would help the tovernment to develop cost-
control mechanisms, to restructure the financing of education, and to make
the education system more cost effective. It would help to attain UPE by
the year 1995/96. Through the sectoril adjustment measures, primary
enrollments are expected to increase by about 18Z (72,000 additional
students) by the end of the project, without increasing the share of
education in the Government budget. The strengthening of the Ministry of
Education's planning, budgeting and cost-control capabilities would permit,
in the long term, a more effective allocation of budgetary resources,
allowing further expansion within the available education budget. Due to
the project-supported measures to improve the quality of education at the
primary and secondary levels: (a) during the span of the project, the
capabilities of primary and secondar, teachers would be enhanced and the
majority of students would be provided with a critical mass of education
materials, enabling them to study under favorable conditions, despite
overcrowded classrooms and the adoption of the double-shift system at the
primary level; and (b) in the long term, better trained students would be
able to complete the secondary and higher education cycles more rapidly,
thus leading to a reduction of unit costs at those levels. When project
objectives are met, the restructured education sector would be more
efficient and better suited to the goals of the country's economic
development.
9.       Risks.  The.e are three main risks.  First, policy measures such
as the containment of the growth of secondary and higher education and the
setting up of a cost-recovery system, based on parents' contributions to
tuition and boarding costs, may rot be fully endorsed by the population;
aware of this possibility, the Government intends to embark upon a public
acceptance campaign. Second, there is a risk that the Government may be
unable to resist demands from upper secondary and higher education students
and their families to maintain a disproportionately high allocation for
fellowships, thus jeopardizing the financing of primary educational
development. Experience with the short lived student loan scheme at
university level shows that these pressures are difficult to resist. The
third risk concerns the possible decrease in educational quality resulting
from the generalization of the double-shift system and the decrease in
teacher/student ratios. To reduce this potential risk, the project would
provide for the permanent monitoring of teachers by inspectors;, improved
school administration through the training of headmasters and teachers, and
increased production and distribution of textbooks.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of IDA and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit to the Republic of Burundi.
