To this end, the project\n            intends to:  (a) implement phased sectoral adjustment\n            measures to contain education costs; (b) strengthen the\n            planning, budgeting and cost-control capacity of the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE); and (c) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of education at the primary and general secondary\n            levels through the training of supervisors, upgrading of\n            teacher skills, preparation of new programs for secondary\n            education, and provision of textbooks and teacher guides.\n            It also seeks to (d) improve access to education for rural\n            children, by providing additional student places in rural\n            primary and secondary institutions."}, "docdt": "1988-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
