Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) conditions of disbursement for sectoral policy\n            achievement should be used only when a case can be made that\n            the policy change is a necessary prerequisite for the\n            justification or successful use of the investment which is\n            being made conditional; 2) conditionality should be\n            structured to ensure that there is an incentive for the\n            beneficiary to meet the conditions; 3) conditions should be\n            as unambiguous as possible and clearly understood by all\n            parties. In cases where generally phrased conditionality is\n            deemed more appropriate than very specific conditionality,\n            it should include criteria for what constitutes satisfactory\n            performance. Monitoring tables with indicators can be\n            useful, but should not be contractual; and 4) the timing of\n            the review of conditionality should coincide with key points\n            in the school-year or budget-year, so that the Government\n            has the opportunity to take necessary action without holding\n            up the investment which is dependent upon meeting the conditionality."}, "docdt": "1996-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
