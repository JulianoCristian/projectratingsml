A key\n            lesson is that a small but timely and well designed\n            operation can make a significant contribution to\n            consolidating peace, reviving the economy and helping a\n            post-conflict country get away from the conflict trap. A\n            second lesson is the importance of receiving strong signals\n            of Government commitment to reform. In this case, commitment\n            was shown by reform efforts launched by Government, with its\n            own resources, prior to credit approval. A third lesson is\n            that parallel implementation of other mutually reinforcing\n            lending operations, notably those providing technical\n            assistance, can improve the chances of success. In\n            post-conflict countries, a comprehensive, not a partial,\n            approach seems more likely to yield quick and positive\n            results. A fourth lesson is that for a post-conflict country\n            like the Congo, privatization goals should not be too\n            ambitious. Efforts to privatize the water and electricity\n            utilities, and the railways, were less successful than\n            expected because potential investors viewed the risk of\n            undertaking large investment as too high A fifth lesson is\n            that for a post-conflict country with limited implementation\n            capacity, the design of the project should be kept as simple\n            as possible. Although this project had only two main\n            components, the number of its sub-components (at least six)\n            was rather high."}, "docdt": "2005-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
