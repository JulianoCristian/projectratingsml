Economic\n            Rehabilitation Credit (Post-Conflict ERC) is an integral\n            part of the World Bank's Transitional Support Strategy\n            (TSS) (report no. 21328) to assist the Republic of Congo in\n            the transition from war to sustainable peace, in the context\n            of the Government's 2000-2002 Interim Post-Conflict\n            Program. It is the first operation of the TSS that supports\n            implementation of 1) key structural reforms; and 2) improved\n            governance and better transparency in managing the\n            country's natural wealth and public funds. These\n            reforms are needed to stabilize and bring about the economic\n            rehabilitation that will pave the way for broad-based\n            poverty reduction, and a higher and sustained growth path in\n            the years ahead, after three decades of centrally planned\n            economic management and almost a decade of war. Proceeds of\n            the Credit will provide critical funds needed to assist the\n            Republic of Congo with foreign exchange cash immediately\n            after arrears to the Bank have been paid. The Credit will be\n            disbursed in a single tranche, and implemented in parallel\n            with the Transparency and Governance Capacity Building\n            Project (see pid10370)."}, "docdt": "2001-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
