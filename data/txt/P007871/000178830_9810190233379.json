         well-prepared public investment projects and to support\n            institution-building and sector analysis efforts; (b)\n            consolidate the preinvestment mechanism established under\n            the first Preinvestment Studies Project (Credit 587-PA of\n            1975) through technical assistance in project preparation to\n            the National Project Office, Ministry ofAgriculture,\n            Ministry of Public Works and Communications, and National\n            Development Bank; and (c) provide technical assistance to\n            establish a multi-year financial planning and programming\n            mechanism within the Ministry of Finance that will\n            incorporate in its forecasts the financial implications of\n            the investments generated by the preinvestment studies. The\n            project is expected to foster better resource allocation,\n            improved budgeting and more effective coordination of\n            external financial assistance.
