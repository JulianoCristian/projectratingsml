follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            components were clearly linked to the objectives of the NTP,\n            thus favoring a clear assessment of its outcomes with\n            respect to national transport targets. Maintaining this\n            approach in future operations will be a major contribution\n            to sustaining the NTP as long term framework. A fortunate\n            but unforeseen situation was the financing of part of the\n            civil works with the government's petroleum resources.\n            With a cost increase in US dollar terms of nearly 74 percent\n            on the road rehabilitation component, the project will\n            evidently have fallen short of its planned objectives, since\n            such a cost increase and associated financing shortfalls\n            were not anticipated in the risk analysis and Bank financing\n            was not flexible to accommodate additional costs. At project\n            preparation, a good set of performance indicators were\n            designed, but not supported with a well articulated\n            monitoring and evaluation framework; the latter only being\n            prepared at the beginning of the project. Performance\n            indicators without a comprehensive monitoring and assessment\n            framework defined at design stage may lead to many pitfalls.\n            Continuous and close monitoring is essential to ensure that\n            steady progress and effective supervision are maintained to\n            readily address essential and specific needs during\n            implementation. A periodic classification of contractors to\n            ensure that only well qualified contractors are allowed to\n            compete is essential in the Chadian context to avoid poor\n            contract performance. In addition, supervision missions need\n            to put more emphasis on procurement and financial management\n            through the use of external technical support."}, "docdt": "2009-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
