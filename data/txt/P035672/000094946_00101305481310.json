isolation,\n            by improving access to markets, and services, particularly\n            in rural areas, improve national food security, and,\n            contribute to reduced consumer prices for basic consumption.\n            The components are: 1) investments in road upgrading, and\n            paving, specifically for a key road segment on the main\n            east-west axis of the country, and, rehabilitation of\n            existing paved roads. Civil works will rebuild the existing\n            road alignment, raise the road to prevent flooding, and\n            includes earthworks, pavement, and drainage works; 2) a\n            pilot program for performance-based road management, and\n            maintenance contract for unpaved roads, to ensure transit,\n            and road maintenance. It should be noted that substantial\n            technical assistance was provided in the establishment of\n            the model contract; 3) to establish institutional capacity\n            in support of a National Road Safety Program, through\n            technical assistance, and training provision, including\n            physical road safety signaling, mainly in urban areas; 4) to\n            support the Rural Travel and Transport Program, ensuring\n            access to markets, and economic/social goods and services,\n            by the rural population; 5) to support institutional\n            capacity building through training, consulting services, and\n            operational practices; and, 6) to reduce HIV/AIDS risk\n            incidence, through awareness, and education campaigns."}, "docdt": "2000-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
