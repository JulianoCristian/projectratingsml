Group's first operation in Mozambique--would help meet\n            the country's priority economic rehabilitation needs\n            within the context of the Government's Economic Action\n            Program (PAE) for 1984-86. The PAE is designed to initiate\n            the process of correcting structural imbalances and\n            rehabilitating the economy. It focusses on increasing\n            agricultural production and trade, and calls for actions to\n            improve the supply of inputs and basic consumer goods to\n            smallholder farmers, to provide price incentives and to\n            improve the financial situation of enterprises. The PAE also\n            provides for the introduction of a tighter credit policy,\n            changes in interest rates, and a review of exchange rate\n            policy. While implementation of the PAE is just beginning,\n            its directives provide a reference point for the proposed\n            first IDA lending operation focused on the rehabilitation\n            and maintenance of those investments and economic services\n            which may be expected to generate some immediate production\n            response. The proposed credit would help finance part of the\n            Government's 1985/86 program of imports of equipment,\n            spare parts and raw materials, as well as related technical\n            assistance, in the key industry, transport, and agriculture sectors."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
