over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of
such member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any
public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any
external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the
benefit of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation,
realization or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall,
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto, and at no cost
to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the obligations of the
Guarantor to the Bank under Section 2.01 of this Agreement, and
the Guarantor, in creating or permitting the creation of such
lien, shall make express provision to that effect; provided, how-
evcr, that, if for any constitutional or other legal reason such
provision cannot be made with respect to any lien created on
assets of any of its political or administrative subdivisions,
the Guarantor shall promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure
the obligations of the Guarantor to the Bank under Section 2.01
of this Agreement by an equivalent lien on other public assets
satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property or
as security for the payment of debt incurred for the purpose of
financing the purchase of such property; and (ii) any lien
arising in the ordinary course of banking transactions and
securing a debt maturing not more than one year after its date.
(c) As used in th4s Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative sub-
division thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or
operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and foreign exchange assets held
by any institution performing the functions of a ceutral bank or
