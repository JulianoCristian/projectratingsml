Key\n            findings and lessons for the IDP included: Financial sector\n            operations should be undertaken only in a conducive\n            macroeconomic environment; for a project whose goal is to\n            advance structural transformation of the enterprise sector,\n            a more suitable instrument might have been an adjustment\n            operation; the size of the line of credit was too large,\n            given the risks, and uncertainties of the macro, and\n            business environment. For the PSAL, lessons included:\n            Timing, and government commitment are critical to the\n            success of an ambitious reform program; ready access to\n            technical assistance was key to project achievement."}, "docdt": "2003-09-03T00:00:00Z"}
