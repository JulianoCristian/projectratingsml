impacts. Lessons indicate that the strong\n            institutional, and political support from the Government\n            contributed to the project's overall success, and, its\n            effective coordination with the Bank, helped sustain\n            momentum. The major success factor was the use of\n            international investment, and privatization advisors to\n            assist with the restructuring, privatization, and\n            liquidation plans of major state-owned enterprises, and\n            banks, since it introduced an element of transparency,\n            professionalism, and objectivity which may not have\n            occurred, had it been left to the State Ownership Fund. In\n            addition, joining social protection with major restructuring\n            efforts, as a priority to mitigate the social costs of\n            enterprise restructuring, is perhaps one of the reasons why\n            social turmoil did not erupt, since the efforts made to\n            provide unemployment and severance payments, appear to have\n            had positive impacts, even in the politically sensitive\n            mining sector. However, the government's administrative\n            capacity was stretched too far, particularly in relation to\n            the multitude of tasks, and components to be achieved in a\n            relatively short period. The appointment of permanent\n            on-site advisors to assist during implementation, would have\n            been beneficial in the preparation of Terms of Reference,\n            procurement issues, and in developing comprehensive data bases."}, "docdt": "2000-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
