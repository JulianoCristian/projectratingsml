remaining\n            SOEs, and implement an action plan to stimulate private\n            sector development and streamline the business environment;\n            2) gradually strengthening the banking system, ensure that\n            state banks are restructured, develop further the government\n            securities market; 3) create income support program for\n            displaced workers, improve employment services for displaced\n            workers, strengthen the social assistance programs for the\n            long-term unemployed and poor, and inform the general public\n            about the rationale for the reform. In terms of benefits,\n            this project will enhance Romania's prospect for\n            growth, and sustain its macroeconomic stabilization.\n            Privatization will increase economic efficiency. Stronger\n            governance will reduce losses and arrears in the SOE sector.\n            Financial sector reform will provide the basis for\n            developing a new capital market. The main risks stem from\n            the political difficulty of implementing the ambitious\n            program. However, the government has shown commitment to see\n            through the program. Another risk is the negative impact on\n            poverty because of job losses, weak social safety nets, and\n            low wages. This risk is partly mitigated by the unemployment\n            insurance, severance pay, micro-credit, etc. provided by\n            this project."}, "docdt": "1999-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
