Project Objective/Description:
1.      The main objective of the PSAL is to support structural reforms in the
areas of privatization of SOEs, banking reform, the development of the
business environment, and energy sector divestiture. The loans will also
support the financing needs of the country.
2.      The loan is a two-tranche operation in which the first wave of
conditionalities is to be met prior to Board presentation and two other waves
of conditionalities lead to disbursements when adequate privatization and
banking reform steps have been undertaken. The main conditionalities are the
following:
3.      Privatization of SOEs.   There are two main conditionalities proposed in
this area. First, there should be satisfactory progress in the privatization
of significant SOE assets (including power companies) based on an agreed
timetable for large-scale privatizations. Additional targets also include
the implementation of significant small and medium size privatizations based
upon an agreed timeline. Second, Government will wind down a significant
percentage of state-owned enterprises that are currently a significant fiscal
drain on the economy. The PSAL will also rectify the main legal impediments
that have hampered these privatizations and liquidations in the past.
4.      Banking Reform.   There are three main conditionalities proposed in this
area. First, there should be immediate and long-term corrections for the
financial health of Bancorex and other large state-owned banks on the verge
of failure. Second, a coherent privatization and liquidation plan will be
put into place to avoid having future fiscal deficits carried over to the
financial sector. Third, there should be satisfactory progress in upgrading
the monitoring and supervision capacity of the National Bank of Romania to
prevent these kinds of pressures on the banking system in the future.
5.      Development of the Business Environment. The business development part
of the PSAL aims to enhance the environment in which the private sector can



grow and prosper. Conditionalities in this area relate to the streamlining
of the tax code, elimination of current disincentives for private sector
development, along with the legal streamlining of various laws with the aim
of promoting private investment.
