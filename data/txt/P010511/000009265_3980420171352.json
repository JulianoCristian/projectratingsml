Accidental release of\n            organophosphorus insecticides into lakes, rivers, and other\n            water bodies may exert toxic effects on fish and small\n            aquatic organisms before degradation is complete. Carbamate\n            insecticides generally are highly toxic to honeybees.\n            Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are highly toxic to both\n            fish and honeybees. Mitigation measures arise from chemical\n            use that is focally applied (selective areas); seasonally\n            applied (limited to the seasons in which peak disease\n            transmission or pest nuisance occurs); partially applied to\n            selected resting sites (certain areas in the house); and\n            partially applied to bed-nets, curtains, and traps. To avoid\n            increasing health risks (vector resistance) and releasing\n            insecticides into the environment resulting from improper\n            insecticide use, several different insecticides in rotation\n            are proposed. Further, vector control options available are\n            to: use indoor residual spraying (where only the inner walls\n            and roofs of houses are sprayed), take personal protection\n            measures, and conduct larviciding. Appropriate precautions\n            must be taken in the packaging, handling, and disposal of\n            insecticides. To eliminate accidental release during\n            transport and storage, local packaginghave to conform to\n            government and internationally-accepted standards, and the\n            empty containers should be treated as hazardous wastes. Date\n            expired insecticides will be sent to a secure landfill.\n            Wherever synthetic pyrethroids are used, care should be\n            taken to avoid their spillage into surface water as these\n            are extremely toxic to fish, and to avoid their release into\n            places where honeybee cultivation is taking place. Local\n            authorities responsible for distributing these insecticides\n            should know about their chemical toxicity, and possess\n            protective clothing and equipment, ensure clear and durable\n            labeling on all packages depicting their hazardous nature.\n            To discourage recycling of containers, the government should\n            encourage manufacturers to use nonreusable containers.\n            Spills generated during impregnation of bednets and curtains\n            should be collected, and after mixing with the washings of\n            the empty insecticide containers, need to be chemically\n            destroyed in situ. Workers engaged in the impregnation\n            operation should wear gloves and masks to avoid skin contact\n            with insecticides and inhalation exposure."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
