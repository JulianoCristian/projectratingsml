Executive Summary
Though  malaria  declined  from 75 million  cases  with  0.8
million  deaths annually about half a century back to about 2   o
2.5  million cases with about 200 to 1100 deaths during the  last
decade,  it continues to be a major health concern in India  with
increasing  incidences  of P. falciparum infection  and    deaths
during the last five years.  The strategy of malaria control  was
changed from time to time.  The vertical programme was changed tc
horizontal  one for case detection and treatment thrcugh  primary
health care system.  The Government of India appointed an  Expert
Committee on malaria in 1995  following malaria epidemics in  the
country.  The committee laid down criteria for selection o,  high-
risk  and  hard-core areas for instituting  control  measures  or
priority.
]   :
Integrated Malaria Control Strategy is community based which
proposes  balanced  emphasis on selective vector  control,  earl>
diagnosis  and  prompt treatment,  personal  protection  meap-reE
including  extensive use of medicated mosquito  bednets  whe  ver
feasible, epidemic prediction & control and capacity building fo,
'Jmanpower  development. As a primary preventive step, however,  it
As  necessary to carry out control of mosquitoes  by  eliminatinc
their breeding sites in the house, around the house, and in thE
community and by maintaining proper sanitary conditions when sucr
, -a      breeding sites are eliminated.
The cost of selective vector control alone is presently  '4'
of the total project cost which is expected to be reduced to  1i5.
in  future.   The  two broad categories  of  vector  control  fo-
malaria   are  adulticide  activities (or  IRS)  and  anti-larva
activity.  IRS  consumes  a  large part  of  the  present  budget
allocated for Malaria Control Programme. Anti-larval activity, i
turn, encompasses use of chemical larvicides and biologica
larvicides  (e.g.  bacteria  and  larvivorous  fish)  and  sourc-
- .        reduction.   It  costs almost twice, four times and four  &  hal-
times  as  much  of DDT and 8HC to  use  lindane,  malathion  an~
deltamethrin  respectively  in  IRS.   Chemical  larvicides   anrt
relatively inexpensive compared to mosquito larvicides oil (MLO)
Bti  and  B. sphaericus which are respectively  2.7,3.1  and  3.
-i .2        times  as much expensive.  The annual cost per capita of MMNs  i
slightly  less  expensive than IRS with malathion or any  of  th
synthetic pyrethroids.  It is, however, more than twice the  cos
Sof  IRS with DDT or BHC and at least 1.5 times the cost of  earl
detection and prompt treatment (EDPT) at any of the annual  bloc
examination  rates  (ABERs)  and slide  positively  rates  (SPRs
1 .'         given.   However, the efficacy of synthetic insecticides used  i
^ D        IRS   is  reduced  by  the  development  of   vector   resistanc
(resistance  refers  to  below  80%  mortality)  and,  therefore
incremental cost benefits of IRS are off-set by the disadvantage   g
associated with loading the environment with these chemicals.
Anti-larval  inter  ~ntions  are feasible  only  with  t  i 1
identifiable  breeding   1aces  and  are  thus  of  limited  use



Source reduction techniques such as drailacJe and land  management
can have significant effects in mainly urban areas, planned human
settlements,   or   development  projects.    Therefore,   source
reduction cannot assume a major p .rt of malaria control  project.
There  is a mixed reaction about che use of larvivorcus  fish  to
predate  on mosquito larvae as t:ieir effectiveness is yet  to  be
proved in field trial and as some of these fish have reported to
have  an  adverse effect on other fish species  and  on  mosquito
predators.
Numerous  studies  on  pyrethroid treated  MMNs  in  several
countries have shown high mortality of nuisance insects though
the  efficacy of MMINs against An. Stephensi and An.  culicifacies
is  yet to be established  for malaria control  purposes.   Also,
community  participation  is necessary to make the  use  of  MMNs
sustainable.
Among the conventional insecticides, BHC will be phased out
from 1997 and the use of DDT will be reduced in the coming years.
Policy issues related to vector control through sectoral
approach involving health, developmental projects, agriculture
and     environmental    sectors    have    been         highlighted.
Intezministerial  and  interdepartmental  collaboration  on   the
prop.e  use oLf insecticides and other containment measures against
malaria have been suggested. The developmental projects should
incorporate safeguards against vector-borne diseases at the
planning stage itself. The use of insecticides in agriculture
and health should be properly managed to avoid precipitation of
resistance in malaria vectors. The environmental sector should
include officials from health sector for incorporating health
safeguards in the projects.
Eliciting intersectoral collaboration on routine basis may
require legal support and provisions should be made through
appropriate amendments, extension of existing laws or by framing
new  law-s.  The Insecticide Inspector should be well  trained  in
safety  aspects.   The  pesticides  testing  laboratories  (about
forty)  in  the  country  should  be  involved  in  environmental
management   plan.   The   developmental   projects   with    the
representation  of  the  Directorate  of  NMEP  would   undertake
project related malarial control. A national task force should
be established to develop and implement vector control and
disease prevention measures which are environmentally friendly.
The management information system covering all endemic districts
should be developed and interfaced with other sectors for
implementing integrated malaria control through intersectoral
coordination geographical information system (GIS) should be
employed to generate scenarios in malaria control programme.
Envtironmental   management   plan,  essential   for   proper
mronitoring of v ctor control measures is delineated. Insecticidal
polluticn  should  be avoided and guidelines  issued  by  various
authorities  should  be  strictly  implemented.   The  change  of
insecticides  should be judiciously planned.   The  environmental



..       impact  and risk assessment should cover all hazardous  chemicals
associated   with   the  programme.    The   institutions   whose

1.1.  IIntroduction
Malaria in India contribuces mortality, morbidity as well
as social and economic loss. Prior to the launching of
National Malaria Control Programme (NNICP) in 1953, it  was
estimated that malaria incidence was about 75 million with
0.8  million   deaths  every  year.  Had  the   endemicity
continued  at the same pace, today there would  have  been
196  million  cases  with  more than  two  million  deaths
annually.
The   launching  of  the  National   Malaria   Eradication
Program.me  (INIEP)  in  1958  markedly  brought  dcwn   the
morbidity to less than 0.1 million cases with no mortality
by 1965. Unfortunately due to technical, financial and
operational bottlenecks, there was resurgence of malaria
reaching  the  peak  of 6.4 million cases  in  1976.   The
deterioration    in   malaria    situation    necessitated
introduction of Modified Plan of Operation (MPO) and
hitherto vertical programme was changed to horizontal
operation for case detection and treatment components
through  the  Primary  Health  Care  (PHC)  System.    The
malarious areas were reclassified according to the Annual
Parasite Incidence (API) instead of old epidemiological
classification based on enlargement of spleen rates among
children.  The change in the strategy paid quick dividends
and the incidence was brought down to 2-2.5 million cases
every   year.   However  the  proportion   of   Plasmodium
Zfalciparum  was 9.7 1 in 1977 which showed a  gradual  and
consistent  increase reaching the peak of 43.4 2 in  1991.
The   same   was  39.4k  and  34.5h  in  1994   and   1995
respectively.   On  account of increase in  P.  falciparum
(Pf) ratio, the deaths due to malaria exhibited increasing
trend.    A  study  carried  out  by  the  NMEP  in   1995
(unpublished)   suggests   that  malaria  in   India   was
responsible for economic losses between 0.5 and 1.0
billicn USD annually (0.2 to 0.4 oL India's CDP).
The   increase  in  malaria  (especially  Pf)   has   been
attributed mainly to increasing unsanitary conditions, man
r..ade   degraded~ environmental  conditions    poor   spray
cove-age coupled with precipitation of vector resistance
to  ccnventional  insecticides, varying  degrees  of  drug
resist-  -e,   inability   of  the  states  to  n.eet  the
cperat  7al expenditure for spraying and vacancies in  the
keQy pCp     in malaria control departmnents.
I



'In 1994, India experienced outbreaks of malaria in the
states of Rajasthan and some north eastern states  leading
to  inireased  number  of  deaths.   An  Expert  Committee
(1995)   was constituted whiclh suggested crash  strategies
to bring down malaria as well as long term measures in
high endemic areas.  The recent outbreaks of malazia  have
provided  insight  and provoked  changes  and  intensified
malaria control activities throughout the country.
As  a part of the malaria control project with  the  World
Bank financing, the work of Environmental Assessment  (EA)
has been allocated to National Environmental Engineering
Research Institute, Nagpur in the month of March, 1996 cn
the terms of reference given in A=nex-l.
1.2    lrialaria Control Sltrategies
1.2.1  Past Strategy
Adult-Vector Control Measures followed by Surveillance
A)  N>-TCP  (1953-1958)    The Strategy of  malaria  control
was :
Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) of Muman  dwellings
and cattle sheds with DDT (1 g/m ), one or two
rounds per annum
Malaria Surveys to monitor malaria incidence
Making  available  of  drugs  whenever  a  patient
reported to an institute. The NMCP was expanded in
phases covering finally 165.57 million population
through Control Units.
B)      NE P  (1958-1977) : The strategy in  National  Malaria
Eradication Programme was :
Coverage  of all human dwellings and cattle  sheds
through  Indoor Resi ual Spraying (IRS)  with  tw
rounds of DDT (1 g/m  per round) or BHC (0.2  g/m
per round, three rounds a year as a substitute to
DDT  to  overcome the sh rtage  in the  import  of
DDT) or malathion (2 g/m per round, three rounds
a year) from 1969 onwards in areas where the
principal rural vector, Anopheles culiclifacies,
was found resistant to DDT and BEC. Focal spray in
50 houses in and around every positive case was
also given in areas where IRS was either withdrawn
or not undertaken.
Antilarva'   operations  conducted   with   weekl
a,plicati 1 of Mosquito Larvicidal Oil  C(MLO)  (1
lt/50  s- -re or linear metres).  The  larviciding



continued in all endemic urban areas and semi-arid
rural areas where An. stephensi breeds in water
storage containerq. Aviation Gasoline Lead Free
(AGLF  : 90  ml/m-)  was  applied   for  treating
drinking water sources. Gambusia fish also was
introduced in many states as a biological  control
measure.
Case  detection was effected  through  fortnightly
domiciliary visits (Active Case Detection-ACD) and
with   the  help  of  voluntary  health   agencies
(Passive   Case  Detection-PCD)  and   presumptive
treatment of all fever cases with chloroquine as a
single oral dose of 600 mg per adult.
Anti-mosquito    and    anti-parasitic    measures
implemented through vertical infrastructure in
NMEP..
Initial results of the programme were excellent and
malaria morbidity and mortality were brought to the
lowest possible extent in 1965. However, due to
operational, technical and administrative constraints,
focal  outbreaks   of  malaria  took  place.  In  1977
Modified Plan of Operation (MPO) was launched.
C)  11PO-"-KEP  (1977 to 1994)    The control  strategy  wa
modified as :
IRS with DDT/HCH/malathion in areas showing AP
and above during the preceding three years,
Weekly antilarval measures in identified areas   :h
MLO or organophosphorus compounds, temephos (   9-
a.i.)  or fenthion (100 g a.i.) per  hectare    :er

Primary Health Care Systems.
An  in-depth  evaluation committee was  appoint    by  the
Government  of India in 1985 to review the wor'  3 of  MPO
and,  as  a  follow-up  of  the  recoamendati        of  this

The  model was tried in Karnatak;a State which was  divided
into  five  strata.  The malariogenic  stratification  was
extended in a phased manner to other states like  Gujarat,
Rajasthan,   Andhra   Pradesh   and   Maharashtra.       The
malariogenic  stratification  was  taken  up  as  a  pilot
project   with   the  assistance  of  the   World   Health
Organisation   (WHO). It  has  been  observed  that   the
malariogenic stratification requires to be further refined
as a tool for control of malaria.
After  the  recent  outbreaks,  the  Expert  Committee  05
Malaria (1995) identified high risk/worst affected areas
in both rural and urban situations for intensification  of
control  measures.  Subcentre with a population of 3  -  5
thousand serves as a unit for undertakina different
control measures.  Thus the malariogenic stratification of
the country has percolated from one million population  as
a  unit  in 1960s down to 3 to 5  thousand  population  in
1996.   There is a need to develop microstratification  to
village  level  especially for IRS and for  monitoring  of
insecticide resistance status.
1.2.2  Present Strategy
The E.pert Committee1 laid down the following criteria for
select'ion of high risk/epidemic prone and hard-core area..
A.    1tural. Areas
Recorded   deaths  due  to  malaria   (on   clinical
diagnosis   or    microscopic   confirmation)   with
P.  falciparum  infection  during  the  transmission
period with evidence of locally acquired infection
in  an  endemic area, during any of the  last  three
years
Doubling  of the slide positivity rate (SPR)  during
the  last three years provided the SPR in second  or
third year reaches 4% or more
Wher;- SPR does rnt show the doubling trend as  above
but the average SPR of the last three years is 5  oG-
more
P. falciparum proportion is 30% or more provided the2
SPR is 3% or more during any of the last three years
An  area  having  a  focus of chloroquine  r-sistant
P. falciparum.   A chloroquine resistant PHC will be
characterised by detection of more than 25% of R. IL
and R III level cases in a minimum sample of 30
cases.



*   .  TroIpical agregaltion of labour ill project areas
New settlements in endemic/receptive and  vulnerab-
B.    Urban Areas
The  high  risk  urban  areas  identified  by  the  Expert
Committee are as follows
All  15 cities identified as high risk arezr by  the
Expert Committee. (vide .rtnex-2).
Among  the remaining cities/towns presently  covered
under UVS, the SPR 10% and above during any of the
last  three  years.  The  Expert  Committee  further
identified 14 cities/towns under this criterion.
(vide A-nve-3)
* .   Any other urban area with a population oF 50,000  or
more and SPR more than 5 * or the ratio of  clinical
malaria cases to fever cases more than one third  as
per  hospital/dispensary statistics during the  last
calendar year.
The high risk rural and urban areas are to be accorded toD
priority  for  transmission  intervention  measures.   F
other areas the guidelines given under MPO-NVM4EP will Le
applicable.
The Integrated Disease Vector Control (IDVC) is the  ideal
strategy for malaria control supplemented with  deployment
of  larvivorous fish and environmental management  methods
in urban situations.
1.2.3.  iajo-r Corstraints -n T--lem=nting Iaaria Control
-,              The  major  technical  and  operational  difficulties   in
imDlement-ing malaria control in India are as follows
Gradual  i½c-e-se  in Pf  mala-ia  and  reporting  of
varying  degrees of drug resistance  to  conventional
drus.
Devolo,.e- of vector res4stance to one, two c- three
,  cornventincal insecticides in use

urbanrisat-on,  river  valley  prcjects,  and   others
-  le-adin   to environmental degradaticn  a;-d  i.ncreaF i
malaricgenic potential.



Case  detection and treatment are delayed because  of
number of vacancies of peripheral level staff.
For IRS, sbcentre (3000-5000 population) is taken  as
the  unit.  The  sates  are  not  able  to  meet  the
operational  wages for spraying,  thereby leading  to
poor  coverage.  Some  states  delayed  sanction   of
operational  expenditure  for spray as well  as  cash
assistance to local bodies.
w  .    Insecticides  could  not be supplied in time  by  the
manufacturers  on many occasions delaying or  denying
spray operations in target areas.
-.              .   The quality of insecticides was sometimes found to be
very inferior.
There   was  shortage  of  antimalarials,  especially
8-aminoquinolines in the country and drugs could not
be imported immediately due to global shortage
=   Socio-cultural patterns  of  the beneficiaries  some-
times hamper the malaria control efforts.
1.2.4 Need for Cbange in the lIalaria Control Strategy
Strategies for prevention and containment of epidemics
should centre around
Selective vector control
Early diagnoses and prompt treatment
Personal protection
. Epidemic planning & response
* InLormation, education and communication
A  Institutional & capacity strengthening
Further, the WHO Study Group on vector control for malaria
and other vecto- borne diseases (Geneva, 16-24 November,
1993) recomm.ended the following approaches in  re-planning
control programmes in South East Asia Region (WHO, 1994)
* to undertake stratification as means for selective  and
cost-effective vector control strategy
- to  establish  criteria for planning  and  prioritizing
vector  control  aimed  at  reducing  indoor   residual
_                  sspraying  and increasing other vector control  measures
based on local epidemiological characteristics and
resource availability
to  manage  vector  control  activity  through  primary
healt'h care.
at7:   - rt.ia_ns to be added to the aforesaid strategy is  the
envi--cnmcental   control  of  mosauitoes   by   eliminating



breeding sites in the lhouse, around -he house and in the
com,munity  as elaborated in Table 2 of this  roport  under
environmental management methods (1.2.5). Thereafter it
is necessary to maintain proper sanitation conditions once
such breeding sites are eliminated.
ks  malaria is a local and focal disease,  the  strategies
for its control should be planned at the peripheral level.
The  decision  malking at the local  level  would   promote
quicker   responses  for  m-alari a  control.   To   promote
sustainability,  community  involvement  in  planning  and
implementation is a must. Community involvement would
promote  sustainability  and  ownership.   As  malaria  is
directly or indirectly pronagated by various sectors,  the
involvement of these sectors in malaria control activities
is necessary.
The  overdependence on one or more components  of  malaria
control is to be avoided. There is reed for u±ncrtaking  a
balanced view of the various interventions  -ale   and
use them as per the prevailing local needs. This -'z-up
approach will need upgradation cf technical kznowledge and
skills at the state, district and PEC levels by intensive
training. To makce the people aware of the malaria  control
strategies,   an   improved  Informaticn,  Education   and
C-m^unication   (IC) has to be developed.  Involvement  of
the  local  health staff in the decision  making  process,
p-omotion oL ccmunity participation and sectoral approach
will go  a long way to make the programme sustainable  and
acce-ptable.

and social issues by the current and proposed malaria
c.ntrol activities are showqn in Table 1.

:iolog±cal Co-'ro' ,;onts
malaria Research Centre (MRC) has been work-ing .or several
years on various preparations oL Bacillus thuringiensis H-
14   and   Bacillus  sphaericus.  A   large   number   of
preparations of Indian and foreign origin were tested
routinely in MRC but none of them was found suitable.
Either these formulations produced poor kill or the
results  were  not  reproducible.   MRC  then  tested  the
Bactoculicide and Spherix wetable powder formulations of
Russian   origin.    Laboratory   results   were    highly
satisfactory in terms of killing effect on immatures,
residual toxicity and reproducibility. Because of the
importance of biolarvicides in vector control, Government
of India imported 10 metric tonnes (MT) of Bactoculicide
and   40   MT  of  Spherix.   These   biolarvicides   were
distributed to various field units of MRC for field trials
to demonstrate the impact of spraying on (i) breeding of
mosquitoes,  (ii)  adult  mosquito  densities,  and  (iii)
transmission  of malaria and  filariasis.   Simultaneously
toxicological  data are being generated at the  Industrial
Toxicoloaical Research Centre, Lucknow, to ensure the
safety o- biolarvicides to warm-blooded animals.
There are a few characteristic differences between Bti and
B.  sphaericus  : Bti is effective  against  all  moscuito
genera, while B. sphaericus is more toxic against Culex
and some AnopAheles spp. and much less toxic against Aedes.
Bti has a short residual field efficacy for 1-2 weeks,
whereas  B. sphaericus has a  generally  longer  residual
efficacy,   reportedly  for  several  weeks   in   certain
habitats and is said to have a recycling capacity. Bti is
eLffective  in  clear waters while B.  sphaericus  performs
.w,ell even in polluted habitats. Both are non toxic to
non-target organisms and safe to warm blooded animals.

The  primary breeding habitat of mosauitoes is  water  and
the  basic  recuirement in the  environmental  control  of
mosquitoes is the elimination of breeding sites. Major

Malaria Link Volunteers to be  appointed in all  high
endemic   and   remote  villages  0  one   per   2000

The  MPW  will  continue the performance  oL ACD  by
domiciliary visit at fortnightly interval and   guide
the voluntary agencies.
The  severe and complicated malaria cases are  to  be
promptly  referred to PHC after collecting the  blood
smear and administering presumptive treatment.
Every  PHC  in  high risk areas  should  serve  as  a
referral centre equipped with life saving drugs and
equipment   for  timely  management  of  severe   and
complicated malaria.
The  DM0 in consultation  with the  concerned  MO-PHC
should mobilise the active participation of private
practitioners and clinics for EDPT.
All personnel at different tiers as well as voluntary
organisations should be imparted requisite training
on essential comPonents for successful implementation
cf EDPT.
EDPT in Urban --d Penri-Urban Areas
Case detection and treatment component in urban and peri-
urban areas need to be properly organised. The following
action is suggested
EDPT through ACD to be established in all slum  areas
w%hich mostly ser-ve as focal points for  dissemination
o  infection.

The personal protection measures mainly comprise of
Selection of proper house site and mosauito proofing of
house,
Zooprophylaxis (animal barrier),
Use of clothing,
Use of mosquito repellents, creams, oils, mats, etc.
* Use of bednets/curtains impregnated with insecticides.
The use of first four methods and their relatve impacts
are well-known to all malariologists in the country  which
are   purely   individual  oriented  methods   with   many
limitations which are briefly given in Aznex-4. The last
method (impregnated bednets) which is the latest advent to
malaria control is discussed in detail which possesses
very   high   potential   for   curtailment   of   malaria
transmission,   if  deployed  with  intensified  IEC   for
community  participation.   Extensive  field  trials  were
carried  out  in many parts o' the world  using  medicated
mosquito  bednets  (MMN) in many  malaria  endemic  areas.
This method could be taken up in India on a pilot scale in
different geographical areas and its further extension to
other  areas  could  be  decided  after  the  outcome   of
successful pilot studies.
It  has been observed in the field studies in  India  that
the synthetic pyrethroids (SP) are technically effective
to  repel  or  kill the vector for six  months  after  one
treatment  of bednets and certain proportion of  community
can aFford to buy their own bednets and sachets of SP  for
re-im-cregnaticn.  Community cooperation and  participation
wil1 make this method sustainable.   The areas having well
orcanised  Gram Panchayat,  Mahila Mandals and also  where
tribal  develcomnent  or  social welfare  and  health  care
delivery system are fully staffed will be highly suitable
for nilot studies.

The use of bednets is practised in areas where pecole
readily accept this method.
It  is suitable in high malarious areas  like  'Jhum'
(shifting) cultivated areas where IRS is nct feasible
or in other areas where sericulture/honey-bee culture
is a cottage industry. It should be ensured that
impregnation  of  bednets should not be done  in  the
vicinity of such sensitive areas.
No  IRS should be undertaken simultaneously in  areas
where MMN is introduced.
There  should be flexibility to change  the  strategy
according to local situation.
The   Directorate  of  NMEP  should  prepare   and   issue
guidelines on the distribution system of MMNs emphasizing
the need to propagate MMN as a public health measure for
malaria control and not merely for personal protection.
Monitoring system is to be developed on the use of MriN and
the impact on vectors as well as malaria incidence.    The
guidelines for medication of bednets and tabular summary
of personal protection measures   are given in it-Anext-4.
The  integrated  vector  control  strategy  must  consider
optimisa tion  of  insecticides  application  (for   vector
control  and  personal  protection)  and  bioenvironmental
control  measures  in  such a  mAnner  that  the  residual
impacts are minimized through balancing each approach
(Fig. 2).
1.3    The Role of Environmental Assessment in Project Design and
Ilonitoring
IRS,  the main control activity of NMEP, warrants  use  of
chemical insecticides such as DDT, BHC, and malathion.
However, insecticides have a limited useful life in vector
control due to pronounced changes in vector behaviour and
their  susceptibility  to  insecticides.   In   principle,
selection of residual insecticide against the susceptible
endonhilic vector populations so as to interrupt/curtail
transmission to levels where the disease can be managed by
the  existing  priLmary health care system  should  be  the
bottom  line.  The ',Y.HO study group on vector  control  for
malaria  and  ot-her vector borne diseases  (Geneva,  16-24
November,  1993) recomr.ends undertalking of  stratification
as a means of planning s2lective and cost effective vector
control  strategy.  The district under question, needs  to
be stratified based on disease profile and epidemiolo,ical

to the loading of the environment withlout fully attaining
the  goal of malaria control.  After stratification,   the
selection of insecticide will be based on efficacy, cos- &
safety.   It  should,  however, be recognised  that  as  a
primary preventive step, it is necessary to carry cut
environmental  control of mosquitoes by eliminating  their
breeding sites in the house, around the house, and in the
community.   Once this is done, insecticide usage  can  be
curtailed  considerably.  All urban areas should  strictly
implement  civic by-laws for prevention or elimination  of
intradomestic and peri-domestic mosquito breeding places
as set by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. In many umS
towns,   the   by-laws   are   not   implemented   despite
promulgation   of  very  strict civic  by-laws.   The  MCP
should initiate deterrent action for dereliction in the
implementation   of  legal  provisions  for  keeping   the
environment clean and healthy.
Secondly, the policies of sector other than the health
sector (natural resource development sector,  agricultural
sector   affect  the  vector  borne   disease   situation.
Sectorial  environmental assessment is therefore  required
to address to cross sectoral issues related to malaria
management and control which must be internalized in the
policies  of the concerned sector.   Therefore, NMEP  will
be able to coordinate with these sectors to ensure that
all its interventions can be carried out in the most
environmentally friendly manner.
Lastly,  it  is the community  participation  which  shall
ensure   that   the   malaria   control   strategies   are
environmentally friendly and sustainable in the long run.
At microlevel, community involvement proved successful in
industrial malaria control in three industrial areas in
EHEL, Hardware; IDPA, Rishikesh; and IOC, Mathura as
reported  by  Dua and Sharma (Curum,unity  Participation  in
Malaria  Control, Sharma, V.P. ed. pp  115-180.   Malarial
Research  Centre,  ICMR, Delhi, 1993).  According  to  the
authors, when communities are involved, the cost goes dowTn
and large areas can be handled in a short time and field
operations can be sustained.
The  community should, the-refore, be suitably  trained  to
marke it aware about the environmental conseauences related
to  the  prcposed malaria control project  and  about  the
sLeps to be undertaken by the comamunity to avoid  creation
of negative envrironmental impacts with the intervention of
NMEP in case such impacts are unavoidable.

2.0     .cani-ing oX Insecticides Being used/Proposed to bo Used  in
Selectiv3 V-ector Cont_ol Progrpre
The insecticides used in malaria control programme  should
be  Judged from the benefit and risk factors  involved  in
terms of cost, efficacy and safety.  The cost of selective
vector control alone is presently 74% of the total project
cost which is expected to be reduced to 551 in future.  In
spite of use of DDT for the last half a century in  India,
there  has been no death due to DDT till  date.   However,
taking    into    consideration   the    persistence    of
orcanochlorine   compounds   in   the   environment,   the
Government of India (GOI) decided to completely phase  out
the use of BnC from 1997.  Regarding DDT, the GOI  already
banned  its use in agriculture sector and  restricted  its
use  in  public  health sector to 10,000  metric  tons  or
technical  product.   The actual use of DDT is  far  below
this ceiling.  During the last four years, the use of  DDT
was  belo  4,500  metric  tons  per  annum  in  terms  of
techniical product.
Of  t:he  three  insecticides extensively used  in  MCP  in
India,  malathion has been the least used  compound.   The
averaqe annual consumption of malathion during the last 10
years was about 1000 metric tons which was sufficient to
give protection to 1.1 million population only. The
environmental  pollution caused by insecticides in MCP  is
negligible as compared to that caused by the agricultural
pesticides  and hazardous industrial  pollutants.   During
1994  the total ccnsumption of pesticides in  the  country
was  85,030  metric  tons  while  the  malaria   programme
utilized only 7252 metric tons of insecticides in terms of
technical product. Thus MCP constitutes about 8.5 °s of the
total usage of pesticides in the country. The insecticides
in  malaria  control programmre are mostly applied  as  IRS
with trained manpower and suitable equipment resulting in
nil or minimum contamination to food, fodder, water, soil,
air, etc. unlike the agriculture pesticides.
Among larvicides, Mosquito Larvicidal Oil (MLO) is used in
limited  areas.   The  major larvicides used  in  UMS  are
organophosphorus   (OP)  compounds  mainly  temephos   and
fenthion, environmental friendly biological control agents
and  selective  use  of  larvivorous  fish  coupled   w i h
environmental manacement methods wherever feasible.
2.1.    _ ze C. .ns,ct ficidc Z in iialaria Cot-rol Pograzo
In  viet.w of tlhe revised strategy of malaria in .India,  in
consonance  wJith   ! cbbal malaria strategy  recomrmended  by
7W$0,  the  follc-:irg  changes  are  contemplated  in   the
country's progra.r.



2 .1.1  Sc-ctvo Unc of Voctor Control
IRS  will  be  restricted to high  risk,  epidemiC  pron.e,
developmental  project  areas during  construction  phase,
drug resistant areas, and areas recording mortality due to
malaria. a  .Afected villages only will be covered  instead
o0  the entire PIC/subcentre.  It has been observed in many
subcentres  that  one  or two villages out  of  average  8
villages  ccntribute most of the malaria cases.   In  such
situations the reouirement of insecticide for IRS would be
one-fourth  the  quantity  required to  spray  the  entire
subcentre.
2.1.2  Criteria for Selection and Use of insecticides  for
IRS
In  the present criteria (MPO guidelines)  the  subcentres
sno.-ing API-2 and above are covered under IRS.  The  othe-
a-eas are given IRS during emergencies.
Th;e zroposed criteria for IRS are as follows
Vllaues reccrdirn  deaths due to malaria.
Villages in the epidemic grip of malaria or  indicating
likely trends.
*f resistant foci as defined by the Expert Committee1.
Develcrmental  project areas during construction  phase
in endemic belts reco-rding high m-laria incidence.
Sensitive  areas  like  movement  of  military  troops,
transit camps for migratory population due to natural
calamities like floods, cyclones, droughts, earthquake,
and ethnic disturbances.
The above qualifying areas will be subjected to IRS with
the recoimmended insecticide.  In case of double  resistant
areas, malathion will be sprayed while in triple resistant
areas SP compounds will be the insecticides of choice.
2.2.   Safety Classification of Insecticidez
2.2.1  Isnzct-'c±des,  Larrvicides,   -d tar  Rank.ing  and
Safety of Anplication
According to the 1986 F.TiO International Code of ronduct on
the  Distribution  and Use of Pesticides,  tox x
physiological or biological prop0erty whlich det
car:acitv  of a chemical to do harm or produce
living  organism  by other than  mechanical  r
che-mi.-cals used for nest control are not only



intend_d target organisms, but also to non-target species.
Th  refore,  they  carry a nctential health hazard  to  the
apDlicators  and  consumers  of the  products  of  treated
edib'le  and  potable commodities.  They may al-so  have  an
adv-erse effect on wildlife.  Toxicity is normally measured
by  the response to a single dose of insecticide  entering
the body of a test animal.
Insecticides are not always immediately debilitating or
lethal.   Animal tests have shown that some compounds  may
cause birth defects in off-springs born to exposed adults
or cause other chronic effects such as enzyme disorders,
deterioration  of blood cells, or cancer.  Information  on
these   and  other  insecticides  may  be  obtained   from
regulatory   agencies  in developed countries,  the  World
Ilealth Organization (WHO), the International Programme  on
Chemical Safety (IPCS), National Registry of Potentially
Toxic Chemicals (NRPTC) and other sources.
The classification of insecticides and larvicides deployed
in  NMEP by hazard in respect of active ingredient  (a.i.)
and  formulation is given in Annexr-5 (a,b, c).  The  dosages
of insecticides and larvicides are given in  Anne-.-6,7 and
S.   The  relative  hazards of pesticides  should  not  be
judged alone on the basis of classification of active
ingredient but one should apply the method suggesied by
WHHO   for   classification  of   the   formulation.    The
insecticides  being  used  in  the  programme  should   be
compared by hazard of the formulations and ready to spray
suspensions/emulsions      rather    than    the       active
ingredient(ai).
Among  adulticides,  HCH  and  DDT  are  classified  under
moderately  hazardous chemicals.  BHC w.p. formulation  is
suspended   @  1.5  kg/10  lt.   water  while   DDT   w.p.
Lormnulation is suspended @ 1 kg/10 lt. water for spray  in
the  field.  Howaever the deposit o' BHC (all  isomers)  is
2.25  times as high as DDT deposit per annum.  In view  of
phasing  out  of  these two  insecticides  in  India,  the
moderately   hazardous  chemicals  will  practically  pose
negligible  hazard to the environment in the  coming  five
years.
Fenthion,   a  lar-icide,  ranks  one  among  the   highly
ha   CU -adu ccmPoundS.  This larwicide  is   diluted  with
.ater by 2000 times of- its volume and hence the  hazardous
l e-e1  Of t.e rea'y to spray emulsion attains  the  safety
en-11e1  of  65G,000 ma-g Cbody wt. in  terms  of  mammalian
toxicity.   Hotever, e.treme safety precautions should  be
CC'- rmZa  t.7';ile h;andling the fonrulation of  fenthion  and
I7irl'     zhS"culd  be  totally  prevented.   Temmephos,   a

fc .-.u- ion is furher ciluted by 4000 times of its volume
wi'h '-ctab:'_ 'ater ,---for a:vDlication in the field.
-'7



The  anmount  of temephos and fenthion  released  into  the
env-ircnm,nt  per  .hectare  per year is 2.6  and  5.2  ltrs
respectively while the quantitv of biocide formulation  is
173 kg of B. sohaericus or 130 kg of B. thurihgienSis ~r
hectare per year.  There is therefore, a need to undert  2
EA when such huge quantities of the so called eco-friendly
larvicides   along  with  additives are  dumped  into  the
environment.
W  The  slightly    hazardous        formulations      include
Lambdacyhalothrin, Fenitrothion and Lindane.  These  three
insecticides  are  not used in the  programme  on  regular
basis.   The first chemical is a synthetic pyrethroid  and
it   is  yet  to  be  granted  license  by   the   Central
Insecticides  Board for public health use.   Fenitrothion,
at  the  recommended  dose  of  6  gm/mr  per  annum,   is
. >               considered  to be more hazardous as compared to the  other
two compounds in this group.
The  adult-icide  formulations unlikely  to  present  ac  e
hazard  in  normal use include two  synthetic  pyrethroids
(Cyfluthrin  and  Deltamethrin) and  two  organophosphorus
compounds  (Pirimiphos-methyl and rmalathion).  Pirimiphos-
Methyl was used for field trial only. The total deposit of
a.i.  of Deltamethrin is 40 mg/rm2 per annum an2 the  same
for  Cyfluthrin  and  Lambdacyhalothrin is  50  mg/mr  per
annum. The O.P. compounds are deposited Q 6000 mng a.i. per
-n2  per annum which is 150 times as high  as  Deltamethrin
deposit       or     120      times      as      high
Cyfluthrin/Lambdacyhalothrin   deposit.  Thus  the   o.;-.
compounds  pose more health ris;; as compared to  synthetic
-<               pyrethroids  because of use of higher quantities  of  O.P.
compounds in IRS.
The relative toxicity of insecticides and larvicides  used
in NMEP is given in Table 3-5.
2.3.   Development of Vector Resistance and its IManagem.ent
One of the major technical constraints surfaced in the MICP
was  emergence  of  resistance among  malaria  vectors  to
different insecticide not on.ly in India but also in  other
parts of the wiorld.  Developmen. of resistance reduces the
-*               efficacy of insecticides in question.
DD-T resistance was first recorded in 1955 in I.ndia6 in Ann.
steohensi  in Tamil Nadu, in rA:. cu7icifacies in  1959  in
Gujarat which also exhibited reslct ance to -3H0C in 1958  i r
-  ;ahtlarashtra  andc  to Malathion in 19/73  in  Guj rat.   The

Basis of calculation : The average sprayable area of the house is 150 m  with  five

The relative rislc given above indicates that BHC-IRS possesses 76 times higher risk
followed by DDT with 59 times higher risk as compared to Deltamethrin-IRS.

Unc'er '?, 72 Entvcmological Zones were established in  the
countr,  covering  16  endemic  &  states  and  one  Union
TerriI-o r   to  monitor entomological  data  including  the
susceptibility status. These 72 Entomological Zones should
be  reallocated  to  the high  risk  malarious  areas  for
regular entomological monitoring.
A  ques,icn would arise :whether the insecticida should    >
changed in case vector resistance appears.  The WHO Expert
Committee7  clarified that alarmist reaction about  vector
resistance  should  be  avoided  and  the  appearance   of
resist.ance  should  be  placed  in  perspective  in   each
particular eco-epidemiological situation and should not be
used as an excuse for operational or administrative  short
comings or be ignored for financial or  political reasons.
As per WHO test results, below 80% mortality is conside  -1
to be resistant but the field data showing even 60 to  bu%
mortality  arnong  vectors brought  dramatic  reduction  in
transmission potentiall0.
)   . 2.4.   Toxicity to Target and Non-target Organisms
2.4. 1  Effect on Vector
The righit choice of insecticide should be used to keep the
vect-r densities/man-mosquito contact at a very low  level
durinri  the entire period of transmission season, lest  the
IRS  at the prohibitive cost should end up into  a  futile
exercise   w ithout   alleviating   tnalaria   disease   and
overburdoning the _nvironment with residues.



2.4.2 Effecti on 1ton-t2rget Organ±s5D3
W,hen  the insecticide is directed against target  species,
it also affects the non-target organisms disturbing the
delicately balanced eco-system. Some of the domestic pets
and birds like geese, chicken, birds, etc. get killed wnhen
preyed  upon  dead insects.  Many  environmental  friendly
organisms,  both  micro  and macro, are  depleted  due  to
nonsPecifi-c nsecticidal toxicity.  The studies showq that
the    eco-system    is   disturbed   by    killing    the
predators/parasites  of  nuisance  pests.   The  community
often becomes non-cooperative for IRS because of emergence
of nuisance pests, especially bedbugs.
2.5.   Efficacy and Cost
2.5.1. Efficacy
IRS may be considered! as an appropriate method for  vector
control when the following conditions are met
a high percentage of the structures in an cperational
area have adequate sprayable surfaces, and can be
expected to be well sprayed;
-    the majority o- the vector population is  endophilic,
i.e. rests indoors;
the vector is susceptible to the insecticide in use
In these circumstances, IRS can reduce the vector life
span, vector population, man - mosquito contact and thus
control malaria transmission.
The efficacy and persistence of residual insecticides vary
with the type of surface sprayed (e.g. mud, wattle, wood,
etc.). Resistance to insecticide reduces their efficacy.
2.5.2 Conparative Cost of IRS
The different malaria control methods are given in Table
6-9.
j
DDT and Blic continue to be the cheapest insecticides
available  to  the  programme in spite of  steep  hike  in
y               prices  in  recent  years  (Table  6).  The  per   capita
expenditure  of  DDT  - IRS comes to Rs.  9.91  per  annum

Thie cost of Malathicn-IRS is 3.6 times as high as that  of
DDT.  The cost of synthetic pyrethroids-IRS is about  four
and  a  half  times as that of DDT-IR.S.   The  per  caoi-
e-_p eXrnditure 2C  malathion is Rs. 36.12 per annum as agaii
i  Rs. 42.35 to "Rs. 44.64 for synthetic  y--.-t-roids.  The IRS
with  synthetic pyrethroids would reauire about 20 g  more
:                  L funds as comnared to malathion spraying.
2.5.3 Ccr.arative Ccst of Larviciding
The  comoarative cost of larviciding used in UmS is  given
in Table 7.  Temephos larviciding is the  cheapest  method
among  the current larvicides wqith per capita  expenditure
.)               of Rs. 7.62 per annum followed by fenthion with Rs.  8.24.
per annum Larviciding with M4LO will be 2.7 times and with
biological control agents (BCA) 3.1 to 3.8 times as hic7h
as that of teme-hos.
The field trials with BCA biocides are in proaress in  the
countrny  and the efficacy of these products is yet  to  be
evaluated.   The different strains of such control  agents
differ  widely in their efficacy and one  should  exercise
-~ 'caution   in  choosing  the  right  type  of  strain   for
-*               larviciding.   The very high cost of BCA  restricts  their
use on a large scale since many local bodies cannot afford
to  sustain  the escalated cost  of  larviciding.  Effor
should be made to produce more cost-effective BCA than t,__
current ones to substitute the chemical larviciding in
future.   From  the safety angle  and  cost-effectiveness,
_,               temephos stands out as the cheapest larvicide as on date.
Though per capita expenditure of larviciding with temephos
or  fenthion  in urban areas is cheaper than that  of  IRS
with  DDT  or  EHC  in rural  areas,  the  expenditure  on
larviciding  in rural areas will be more than  five  tim.
(per  capita  expenditure) because most  of  the  breeding
places  in  rural  areas  are very  vast  as  compared  to
population density.
Efficacy,  cost  and  a-fety must be  taken  together  into
account  in selecting an insecticid_ for :alria  control.

Amnong adult-vector control measures, the selective use  o.
NWMMNs to protect fever cases, infants and pregnant womer
will  be the cheapest method since this selective  use  of
£Irvi will be one-twelfth the cost of mass use of MMN.   (i.e
J   600 bednets are required for mass use for lO00  population
chile for the selective use, the average number of bednets
will be 50 only).
2.5.5   Cost Benef it Aspects of Indian Malaria Prog-ramme
The cost-benefit analysis was estimated by the Directorate
of  N iEP  in 1994 on the premise that the  individuals  or
families   could  have  been  incurring  expenditure   for
treatment to severe morbidity due to projected malaria
cases   in   India,  if  control   operations   were   not
implemented.  This estimated expenditure was compared with
the expendi.ure of the current control measures.  Thus the
overall  expenditure on malaria control comes to Rs.  3.85
per capita during 1994 in the country.
B3sides the above estimated expenditure, the individuals
also  incur expenditure for treatment of malaria which  is
estimated as Rs. 3.33.
Thus the expenditure on morbidity due to malaria by the
Govt.,  private organisations and individual comes to  Rs.
7.13 per capita per annum.
The analysis shows that every rupee invested in malaria
programme provided a direct return of Rs. 22.10 benefit.
The estimates also show a saving of 1323.75 million
mandays  of labour per year.  Tf the gain to the  national
gross product due to saving of laboui- days is also  added,
the benefit will be much higher thar   e projected figures
above.
2.6    Monitoring of Insecticidal us  . .aploying GIS
The success of vector control strategy using  insecticides
depends on the ability to assess complex relationship
between a variety of economic, environmental and social
factors  across space and time.  Geographical  Information
system  (GIS)  have emerged as  a  particularly  promising
approach in this regard, enabling users to collect,  store
-l e.-,a?;se     frmt>-n that can be-referred in accordance
:i>;1 i-  C_^ reiphic&i location.
'*:os  situaions that swould benefit from C-IS capability can
;:; c-te ^:rised as loncg term  or short term.  Tl lor.c  ter m
categorv   i5s  where  management  malaria,  economic   and
environm,ental  issues  on a national,  regional  or  local



level   is   called   for   involving   institutional   o-
programmatic   applications.   The  short  term   category
usually involves specific project situations. Both short
and long terms applications help  in determining  region's
vulnerability   to   insecticide   resistance,    seasonal
fluctuations   in  disease  occurrence   and   -nsecticide
pollution in water and soil.
One  clear advantage of GIS in monitoring  is  flexibility
which  allows  specialists  to  create  a  wide  range  of
reports,  maps  and  statistical  summaries  suitable  for
public  briefing as well as technical analysis.   GIS  may
thus  help in increasing transparency and  broadening  the
scope of public participation in project iipem.cntatiocr.

-          3 .2'.P_pZ2' 1 Prevailing .odes or: Application
*         The  modes  of  application  of  insecticides  should   be
selective for resistance management and include
'ocal application
se"csonal application
partial application to selected resting sites
partial  application  to bed-nets,  curtains  and
t raps
,n focal application, insecticide are applied only to
selected areas or localities and no attempt is made to
ac:--eve  complete  coverage of large  geographical  areas.
The rationale underlying focal insecticide application for
_sistance  management is that, after application  of  the
insecticide to the focus, susceptible individuals will
migrate from neighbouring areas into the treated area,
Lhus  dilutirg any resistance that has been developed  and
thereby  conserving  a  pool  of  succeptible  genes   and
diminishing  the selection pressure producing  resistance.
T;.e success of focal application will depend on the vector
species fcund in the area and their amenability to control
by means of insecticides and/or cther measures.  The  size
of  the  foci  selected  will  depend  on  flight  ranges,
distributicn,  breeding sites, natural barriers and  other
narameters which influence the movement of vector species.
Seasonal  application involves limitation  of  insecticide
use to the seasons in which peak disease transmission or
pest nuisance occurs.
Many  species  of  vectors rest in  certain  areas  within
houses.   Applicatic- c-ily to those areas rather  than  to
all of the areas of the house, results in savings -in
irsecticides  and, perhaps, in the reduction in  selection
p ressure.
Impregnation of  bednets and curtains can be considered as
special  types of p artial application of insecticides.   By
placing the impregnated bed-nets and curtains between  the
vector and its host, contact between adult females and the
insecti_ide  is facilitated.  At the same time,  both  the
a.mcunt o: insecticide used and the selection pressure  are
In insecticide applicaticn, rotation of insecticides,  use
of mi xture of i4nsecticides and use of synergists can  play
itrmor.-.nt roles in resistance management.

Anopheles  mosquito and parasite in a  given  env:          c.
DDT was the principal insecticide used in malaria          -ol.
Adequate  quantity of DDT was supplied for vector           rol
to  NMEP  until 1062-62.  Indiaenous  DDT  oroduct         .:as
about  30 percent of the total reauirernent and its          l 
was  partial during the eradication phase and  even
the  modified  plan of operation  (MPO),   implemente   i
1977.
In  India,  there  are 57  Aiiophleles  species  distributed
unevenly  all  over thre countr.  Nlot  all  Anoo.h.eles  are
vectors,  and  only six  Anopheles  are  epidemiologiCally
important (Please refer section 1.1).
DDT  sprayPirg  produced  dramatic  impact  on  these   sj-.
vectors.      DDT   and  HCH   are,   however,   persistent
insecticides  and  have a tendency to  accumulate  in  the
environmental  niches.  Concentrations of HCH and  DDT  in
soil,  water and whole llood were determined in two  areas
under malaria control.    These were areas involving

IDT  resistaance  wias first detected in  1959  in  Gujarat.
Till  196G,  DDT  resistance did not  interfere  with  the
successful  control of malaria. However, in  later  years,
resistance   posed  problems  in  parts  of  Gujarat   and
Maharashtra.      The   development   of   resistance    to
insecticides may riot; be due to their use in  public health
and could be attributed to their use in agriculture  where
the quantum applied is more.
As  a  result of recent publicity concerning  the  alleged
carcinogenecity  of  DDT,  there has been  an  unsurge  of
queries  on  W;,O's policy oin the use of  DDT  for  malaria
control.  Siince many endemi.c countries rely on DDT for tlhe
control of malaria, the WHO study group on Vecto-  Control
Lor  Malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases was  asked,
as  a  specific  additional task, to  review  the  current
situation regarding the use of DDT in vector control.
Af'.ter careful review of the documents and intensive
discussion,  the  Study Group concluded that there  is  no
convincing evidence of adverse effects of DDT exDosure  as
a result of indoor residual spraying as carried out in
malaria control activities. The conclusions arrived at by
the Study Group are presented in Annex-9.
However,  because  of  its  lipophilic  nature,  DDT  gets
biomagnified  in  food  chain and its  presence  has  been
detected  in breast milk or breast-fed infants.  Also  DDT
hlas  been associated with human cancer.  Therefore,  there
is an urgent need for che ministry of Health & Family
Welfare to undertake investigation to determine long  term
implications of these  i-ndings.
3.1.2  Imnact of use Co  Or;anopLospIlorus Insecticides
The organophosphorus insecticides commonly used in malaria
control are malathion, fenitrothion and  pirimiphos-methyl
as  adulticides and temmephos and Fenthion  as  larvicides.
Malathion and pi-rimihos-methyl are classified as slightly
hlzardous wlhereas fenitrothion is classified as moderately
haz-ardous.   Tem~.,phoz is un4likely to present acute  hazard
n  no=mal use as has bean described in earlier  sections.
Crganophoshcr-us  insecticIdes  are  not  very  stable  in
azu=atic media.  ,ccidental release of pesticides in lakes,
ri,-ers and other water bcdies many e;ert toxcic effects  cn
f-sh  and small aiua.- orcanisms such as  Daphnia  be-Lore

.1.3  Taz-t of Us  of Car-cmbe Tnscti-cd-
The carbamates wn:^ch are cc.--monly used for vector  contrr
in  malaria control include bendiocarb and propoxur  _,hic-
are   moderately   hazardous  as   per   Wq O   reccmmended
classification of pesticides by hazar-d.   These pesticides
resemb2le the organophosphates in their biological  action.
Like  organophosphorus  insecticides,  carbamates  do  not
accumulate in the adipose tissues of the body. In general,
the  vapour  pressure of carbamates is low and  its  to.xic
effect  is  limited  by their  rapid  decomposition  under
acueous  conditions.  Photodegradaticn oL propoxur  is  pH
dependent. Carbam-ate insecticides, in general, are highly
toxic to honey bees.
3.1.4   z-cA o; Use of Synthetlc TPyrthroid Insecticides
Deltamethrin,     cyfluthrin,    lambda-cyhalothrin        ana
permeth=in  are the four synthetic pyrethroids  which  are
commonly  used in malaria control.  Synthetic  pyrethroids
have the advantage of high biological activity against
insects  and, in general, have a lower mammtalian  toxicity
than    other   insecticide   groups.    However,        these
insecticides  are  highly toxic to fish  and  honey  bees.
These insecticides are suitable for personal protection
wherein synthetic pyrethroids impregnated bednets and
curtains  are used.  So far, only pyrethroid  insecticide
have been extensively tested for treatment of bednets  and
curtains as they are considered safe for human.
Pyrethroid resistance has been detected in some insect
species including anophelines. The use of pyrethroid
insecticides  for  IRS  is not advisable  in  areas  where
pyrethroid -treated bednets are currently in use, or their
use is being contemplated, since it will enh>ance and speec
up resistance to pyrethroids. Some concern has been
expressed that as pyrethroids are used more frequently  in
agriculture, mosquito breeding or resting in agricultural
areas will become pyrethroid resistanit. Resistance of
vectors and crop pests to synthetic pyrethroids in India
have   already  been  documented  for  Spodoptera   litura
(Tobacco Caterpillar), Plutella ,xylostella (Diamond  black
moth),   h.elicoverpa   armigera   (American    bollworm),
Pectinophora   Cosypiella    (Pink-  bollworm),   I'ylabris
pustul2ta  (Blister  beetle)  and  Syz,.us  cersicae  (.-eac1l
aphid).  Recent studies show that mosquitoes can  devel cu
resistance  to 1c2.paratively faster rate,  i:  -'.ot
used  properly.               This   may   adve-rselv   c.t
recnet Drogrammes in such areas.



3.1.5  Impact   CL  Use  of   Insecticides/Pesticides   in
Agricultural Sector
India's economy is predominantly agricultural economy wvith
about 75% of the population depending upon agriculture and
in  rural areas.  Indian population is expected  to  cross
1000 million by 2000 AD with the corresponding requirement
of food grains exceeding 220 million tonnes. As against
this, the availability of land per capita is expected to
be  only  0.14  hectares.   The  per  capita   consumption
(gms/hectare) of pesticides in India is 475 as compared to
750 in Mexico, 960 in Argentina 3000 in USA and Germany
and   1800  in  Japan.   Quantitatively,  the  demand   of
pesticides in India is expected to grow to about  1,08,000
tonnes  by  1994-95 and 1,18,000 tonnes by the  year  2000
A.D.,  of  twhich  agriculture  w:ill  account  for   97,000
tonnes. 11 13
4.0    Sectoral Environmental Assessment
4.1  Sectors linked to malaria control
The  release of insecticides in the environment is  caused
ky  a  number of diverse sectors such as  chemical  sector
which is responsible for insecticide manufacturing, health
sector which uses insecticides for vector control and
agricultural sector which employs insecticides for pest
manacement.   Project  specific  environmental  assessment
(EA)   in each sector enables analysis of impacts  related
to  the  project  & the sector in question  but  does  not
encomoass  the  cross  sectoral  issues  which  contribute
substantially   to  developmental   planning.    Sectorial
environmental  assessment  (SEA),  therefore,  is  a  much
needed  complement to project specific EAs in  develooment
planning  and avoids the inherent limitations  of  project
specific  EAs in addressing issues related to  policy  and
planning  and  legal  and  institutional  framework.   SEA
indeed provides a basis for collaboration and coordination
across sectors, and helps to avoid duplication of  efforts
and  policy  contradictions between  sector  agencies  and
ministries.
In  a malaria control r-ogra-mme, the role playing  sectors
_n --2 'lealth, national resource management,  agriculture
ai-d  enKironrien,t.  In the absence of SZ-E, any progress  in
one  se-ctor  may have a necative environmental  impact  in
anothrer  sector.   *or  example,  the  Indian  Council  of
i:-2lice1  Research  has  obDservcd that  the  real  economic
r.turns  from ;.'ater resource  development projects may  be

Alternatively   an  intensive  vector  control   Drogram ,
involving insecticides may lead to water po.lluticn.  There
is,  therefore,  an: imperative  need  for  a  sector-wide
envircnmental analysis of developmental activities and fo
identifying broad institutional resource and tecLuncloaica±
needs to amend decisions that might be environmentally
harmful.
The SEA in the present investigation broadly aims at
Identification of sources of insecticide release in
the environment
Management  of off-specification, discarded and  date
expi-red products
Identification  of environmental irmacts arising  out
of  the  modes  of application  of  insecticides  for
)                     vector control programme
*    identification  of  policy issues  and  carrying  out
analyses  of  legal,  regulatory  and   institutional
aspects  of  environmental  management  in  a  vecto-
control programme
*    delineation of an environmental management plan.

In India, the production, formulation and distribution  of
pesticides   is  handled  by  the  government   controlled
companies,    cooperatives,    private    companies    a-A
formulators.    Government  policy  is  based   on   sel.
sufficiency  and local production is  encouraged.   within
the chemical sector, pesticides account for  approximately
3 percent of the total chemical production.  Of the  total
production  of pesticides  in this country,  insecticides,
rungicides,  rodenticides, and fumigants   and  herbicides
(including plant growth regulators, etc.) account for S33s,
-,7;, 2°-, and 8; respectively.
-J               Presently,  India  manufcactures  pesticides  which   meets
around 959 of the country's requirement. In the large  and
medium   sector,  the  country  has  57  basic   pesticide
manufactu`ina  industries and 21  formulatinq  industries.

4.2.2  Z-iszions and Wastes
Countries   which  have  insecticide   manufacturing   and
formulation   plants  are  aware  of  the  irmportance   of
controlling  discharges  of  toxic  effluents  from  these
industries.   Consequently, legislation to  control  these
environmental contaminants has been initiated by man,
governmencs.   The 1Xocument on wastewater  management  in
pesticide  industryy   prepared by the  Central  Pollution
Control Board furnishes useful information on the effluent
manacement   in   pesticide  industries.   The   Pesticide
Manufacturing & Formulation Industry Standards  for liouid

Cyfluthrin _CO- ;Vp         9.38 MT per million population
Lambdacyhalot>rin 100 wp   9.38 MT per million population

BIS specification.  The a'    o be covered by 10 litre  cf



suspension  to  get  correct dosage for IRS  is  shown  in
C"---6.   For  mass  bed  net treatment,  1  lg  of  2.59
deltamethrin  contains  encugh  insecticide  for  65   -et
reatrments  (at 25 mrn/m' and assuming an area of  15  mi2)
The  larvicidal formulation and their doses are  shown  in
Annex-S.
For  licuid  formulations the smaller bottles tend  to  be
slightly  more  expensive,  but  with  the  drums,   small
c-uantities  must be frequently decanted for  use,  usually
with  some  spillage  each  time.   Self-priming  siphons,
similar to those used for petrol, can help to avoid this.
Spillage can also occur in the measuring process, and the
outside  of  the bottle often  becomes  contaminated.   To
avoid this, several manufacturers are developing "squeeze-
and-pour"  bottles.   These  consist of  two  chambers,  a
larger one below containing the insecticide, and a smaller
graduated chamber above.   Squeezing the bottle forces the
liquid into the upper chamber; when this chamber contains
the desired quantity, it can be poured out without
spillage.   Squeeze-and-pour  bottles will  be  useful  in
public  health  net  treatment programmes, 1gnd  in  local
companies that offer net-treatment services .
-Iowever, such bottles are far too big to be suitable for
the domestic market, which is likely to require individual
net treatment. One possibility is that local retailers
would decant a liquid insecticide concentrate from a large
bottle into smaller re-usable containers at the point of
sale.   However,  the  safety  of  this  is  questionable.
Accidental spillage and contamination are likely, and   in
some countries, re-usable containers may be prohibited.
There is also the possibility of deliberate adulteration.
Adulteration of an emulsifiable concentrate with water
would be visible, but dilution with organic solvents such
as  kerosene may be hard for the purchaser to detect.   If
such- small quantities are to be sold, they will need to
be packaged appropriately, for example, in sealed sachets
or in small bottles with tamper-proof lids.
Stor.ge o. Insecticides    The requirements of storage  is
as under
The insecticides should be stored away from food,
foodstuffs,  children and animals.   The  insecticides
should  be  kent  pr eerably in  e_nc   - ed  and  locked

It  is recmired to be ensured that the containers  are
properly labelled
A ma-.rk of caution like "Poison", "Danger, JKeep  A,way",
should  be  placed  at the  store  room  with  symbols
whichever is applicable
Empty containers should be destroyed so that they  are
not used for storing food materials or for other
household purposes.
The storage records should be kept for regular  inspection
by designated authority
Handlina : The precautions to be observed for handling of
insecticides are :
While   making  suspension,  rubber  gloves   are
reauired to be used so that skin of hands does
not come in direct contact with the insecticide
The   cholinesterase  level  of  all  spray   men
employed in spraying of malathion or the other
organophosphorus compounds should be monitored
regularly at the recommended intervals and those
showing a drop in cholinesterase level to 62.5
percent and below should be withdrawn and given
rest and, if needed, medical aid.  For estimation
of   cholinesterasy  level,  standard   techniaue
recom"mended by WHO   should be used.
Contamination of cooked foods or food materials
should be avoided during insecticide application.
Smoking, drinking or eating should not be done
while  handling the insecticides.   If  necessary
such things should be done only after thoroughly
washing hands and face
While  spraying  organophosphorus  compounds  and
synthetic pyrethroids, protective clothing should
*   be  used. The exposed skin, hands, face and  eyes
should  not  come  in  direct  contact  with  the
insecticide
In case of accidental contamination, contaminated
part should be washed liberally with soap and
water.

Washing  and disposal of Containers    The containers  are
reauired to be washed thoroughly before they are made
unfit for recycling, preferably by crushing, and then sent
to  secure  landfill.   Appropriate  provisions  for  such
disposal should be made in the prevailing Insecticide  Act
of 1968 so that the Insecticides Inspectors receive,  from
time  to  time, infoz-mnation about safe disposal  of  empty
pesticide   containers.   Such  Inspectors   should   have
sufficient   powers   to  prosecute  anyone   using   such
containers  for recycling purposes.   Alternatively,  such
containers  may  be  returned  to  the  manufacturer   for
repackcing under intimation to the Insecticide  Inspectors.
All  washings and unused solutions should be  collected  &
disposed   off   on  land  after  treatment.    Under   no
circumstance,  these  should be dumped into  nearby  water
courses cr wells.

5.0    Policy Issues Related to Vector Control
i5.2  Sectoral Appr-oach
In  general, vector control programmes operate within  the
policy  framework of the health sector or  municipalities.
However,  the  policies  of  other  sectors  and  national
resource management and development policies, can directly
influence  the effectiveness of vector control  activities
cr indirectly affect the vector borne disease situation.
5.1.1  hiealth Sector Policies
A  key issue in policy modification is the integration  of
malaria  control  into the general health  services,  with
provision for a vector control component, staffed by  well
qualified entomologists and other relevant personnel  that
can function effectively within this structure.
Interministerial and interdepartmental policies involving
-2                the  collaboration  of  Ministries of  Health  and  Family
Wlelfare,  Environment  and  Forests  and  Agriculture   in
addition to municipalities are needed to prevent or delay
the  appearance of insecticide resistance as a  result  of
excessive or improper use of insecticides.
W i ithin  the healthl sector, the Institutional and  capacity

is a prerequisite for successful imolem2ntation of control
s,._t_y .   Traini.G sh5oul C:o  only  inculcate  uDgradrng
technical slcills but also imbibe positive moti-vation among
tra-nCC5   for  developing  hish  degree  o'   discipline,
diligence  and dedication in discharging their duties  and
responsibilities.   The  training in EA will  enhance  the
perfornamnce  of  NMEP  for  the  overall  benefit  to  the
c m,unity.   Stakeholders for a oarticular  community  are
recauired   to   be  identified  for  training   as   these
stalKeholders  are  required to ensure  that  the  proposed
malaria control strategies are environmentally friendly
and sustainable in the long run.
Intersectcral WN0orl}sLp : Workshop can be held in these two
RTLs  where  the  analysts from PTLs can  be  trained  for
analvsis  of environmental samples. Thereafter,  suitable
legislative changes may be incorporated in the Insecticide
Acts & Rules to enlarge the canability of these analysts
to handle envircnmental samples so that environmental
analysis can be carried out at places where insecticide
application is intensive under malaria vector control
programme.
Intersectoral   workcshops   involving  sectors   such   as
irrigation, highway development, housing, fisheries etc.
are also required to develop capability and procedures to
ensure that environmental concerns related to malaria
control are addressed in the EA report submitted by these
sectors to the Ministry of Environment and Forests for
environmental clearances as well as to improve their
awareness of environmental management needs for malaria
control.  The MOH & FW, in consultation with MoEF, prepare
environmental  guidelines  for  malaria  control  in   the
projects which are submitted by the a-orereferred  sectors
from time to time. The workshops should aim to develop
capacity  within MoH & FWA7 to provide  necessary  technical
support   and  guidance  in  environment  assessment   and
management  to other sector agencies/programmes that  have
potential to impact on malaria control.
The attempts for Intersectoral coordination will be a
futile exercise unless the professionals in the concerned
sectors are imoarted training to highlight that the nature
oL  activities  in their respective sectors  wzill  impinge
upon environment with irreparable pollutants besides the
problem of malaria.
Training   and. education  on  methods  to  minimise   the
environmental  degradation especially pesticide  pollution
snall  be  imparted to senior level officers  involved  in
pesticide  production, quality control,  distributic<a. ano

.recom,mend  adjustmornis wherever appropriate. For  example,
use  of synrthetic pyrcthroids as  agricultural  pesticides
should be discour-qed in situations where the selection of
resistant malari  vector is likely.
5.1.4 Environmental Sector Policies
'f.   Envi.ronmental Imp,tct Assessment  Notification,  1994,
issued  by  the  MIinistry  of  Environment  and   Forests,
rec3;.ires  any development project, listed in  schedule  of
the notification, to obtain environmental clearance  after
submitting  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment   Report
-oeparcd  in accordance with the guidelines issued by  t he
,:inis-try  of  Environment and Forests from time  to  time.
The  health  sector should ensure that  health  impact  is
included  in  environIental impact  assessments  and  that
P-roject   plan  incornorates   health   safeguards,   w-ith
provisions  for  any  necessary  strengthening  of  health
se_vices.     Tn   collaboration  with  th'ne  14inistry   of
Environment  and  Forest,  the iMoM  &  FW  should  develop
procedures   for   environmental   review,,   scoping   and
assessment for future malaria and related programs in  the
heailthl sector and also to prepare specialized training and
technical su-port to enhance capability w.ithin the  health
sector for environr.ental review and assessment.
5.1.5  Legal, Regulatory and Instiltutional Aspects
:\'c;ever   good  the  malaria  control  strategy  may   be,
im-eaningful   results   shall  emerge  only   when   legal,

are  adequatelv addressed and intersectoral  collaboration

stood in the ;-,y of progress in agriculture and industrial
sectors.  Insecticides in India account for as much as 83%
of the total production of chemical pesticides.
DDT,  in  India, cannot be use2  in agricultu-re &  its  use
under the public health programme is restricted to 10,000
MT a year except in the case of a major outbreak.   Almost
the entire cruantity of DDT, 26.3% to 28.7- of HCH and
40.5%- to 66. 79 of malathion produced in the  country  are
used for public health.
Environmental  management plan (EMP) for  malaria  control
using  insecticides  are  essential  as  improper  use  o-
insecticides can lead to
*   increase in vector resistance
release of insecticides in the envir-onment
which, in turn, reduces the efficacy of the insecticide in
question.
Since the use o' insecticides for malaria control is mucn
lower than that of aoriculture, malaria control  progra=e
involving insecticides, may not lead to vector  resistance
to insecticides especially where the same insecticides are

Synthetic pyrethroids shculd not be used for  IRS
in areas targeted for insecticide - treated  bed-
net  use  if  the  development  of  physiological
resistance is to be prevented or delaved.   Th-ir
use   as   ag-icultural  pesticides   should   be
discouraged in sitLuations where the selection  of
resistant  malaria  vector is  likely.   Wherever
synthetic pyrethroids are used, care should be
taken  to see that the insecticide(s) do(es)  not-
spill into surface water as these are extremel-
toxic  to fish.  Also these  insecticides  should
not  be  released  at  places  wher-e  honey   bee

9.1    Broad Recomrmendations
9.1.1  As  a primary preventive step, it is  necessary  to
carry  out  environmental  control  of   mosquitoes
through E-1N by eliminating of their breeding  sites
in   the  house,  around  the  house  and  in   the
community.    All  urban  areas   should   strictly
implement   civic   by-laws   for   prevention   or
elimination  of  intradomestic  and   peri-domestic
mosquito  breeding  places as set  by  Brihanmumbai
Municipal  Corporation. In many UMS towns, the  by-
* laws  lare not implemented despite promulgation   of
vcry strict civic by-laws.  The !M1CP should initiate
cleterrent    action   for   derelict on   in    the
implementation of legjal provisions for keeping  the
environie,nt clean andc healthy.
9.1.2  Tlhe  1-CFP  has  to involve  diff'erent  sectors  for
un,drta:-ing   EMM   for  source   reduction.    T he
Oirectorate o olf NIrE  and MR conducted large  number
'F  trainling ; !.ork;s!iops  on  E'd,i. Admrninistrative
..ction i, resuLred to co-Amit the concerned  sectors
to  aionet nreventive measures.  The Directorate  of-
4T E P  she    tal.1ck  a lead role in  tLis di raction.

9.1.3  As ms alaria  is  a local  and  foccaald sease,  the
strategies for its control sh-ould be Toanned a2 the
