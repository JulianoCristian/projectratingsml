Lessons learned from the\n            project: With the benefit of hindsight, the overall project\n            was overambitious. The managerial capacity of the\n            implementing agency was not given sufficient attention\n            during project design. The monitoring and evaluation\n            framework was not sufficiently developed. Task Teams and\n            Management should be responsive to changing needs of the\n            project and restructure accordingly. Suspension and\n            restructuring of the project, though late, were crucial for\n            the success of the project. Strong leadership is an\n            important but not necessary condition for success. Nurturing\n            ownership of states, which are at cutting edge of\n            implementation, is critical for program success. Identifying\n            and adequately addressing procurement and supply chain\n            logistics up-front is critical for the success of the Vector\n            Borne Disease Control Program (VBDCP). Strengthening program\n            management at district and state levels is essential for\n            successful decentralization. Program monitoring needs\n            further strengthening by incorporating objectively\n            verifiable process and output indicators and establishing a\n            system of data triangulation by experts complemented by well\n            targeted surveys and supportive supervision. Vector control\n            measures need to be better integrated and of higher quality,\n            and there is an urgent need to improve the vector\n            surveillance. The introduction of Insecticide Treated\n            Bednet, albeit late, was one of the most successful aspects\n            of the project. Monitoring therapeutic efficacy of anti\n            malaria drugs and insecticide resistance should be more rigorous."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
