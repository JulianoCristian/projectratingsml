While sustainability is likely, it is however\n            subject to a number of risks, namely, the need for further\n            reforms, and, a new course remains to be charted for a\n            viable retirement security system, that encourages private\n            savings. The key lessons convey that: 1) the analytical\n            tools applied, allowed the Borrower to conduct its own\n            analysis, and, staff trained in the use of simulation\n            models, both quantified liabilities, and determined optimal\n            reform strategies. This approach is considered critical in\n            mobilizing essential resource support for future amendments\n            to the Constitution, and further structural reforms; 2) the\n            politics of social security reform should be considered\n            early, to prod a fruitful dialogue, as in this case, the\n            support to provide only modest improvements to the reformed\n            pension system, as requested by the Government, allowed\n            greater influence on the formulation of future reforms; 3)\n            comprehensive public awareness is critical for successful\n            social insurance, and pension reforms, though information on\n            fiscal imbalances of pension systems alone, is not enough,\n            for, inevitably it will hinder the Administration's\n            reform strategy; and, 4) the selection of a single-tranche\n            adjustment instrument, was appropriate, given the\n            politically sensitive policy agenda."}, "docdt": "1999-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
