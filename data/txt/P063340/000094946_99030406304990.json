The first loan will support the first phase\n            of the Social Security Reform Program. The first phase of\n            the reform consists of a constitutional amendment to modify\n            clauses of the Federal Constitution of 1988 dealing with\n            Social Security, to: a) introduce the principle of actuarial\n            balance; b) replace retirement based on length of service\n            with length of contribution; c) eliminate specific benefit\n            rules from the Federal Constitution; d) eliminate most\n            special pension regimes; and e) reduce inequalities between\n            benefits of public and private sector workers. The first\n            risk of this loan is that the legislature may not approve\n            the imposition of higher pension contributions and income\n            taxes on the politically powerful public sector workers and\n            retirees. The Government has tried to mitigate this risk by\n            widely publicizing the inequities and abuse of the system.\n            Another risk is that states and municipalities may refuse to\n            accept either the limits on their ability to establish their\n            own pension systems or the requirement to introduce\n            automatic adjustments in contributions when net pension\n            payments exceed a determined share of current revenues. This\n            risk is mitigated by reinforcing Federal controls over state\n            and municipal expenditure on salaries and pensions."}, "docdt": "1998-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
