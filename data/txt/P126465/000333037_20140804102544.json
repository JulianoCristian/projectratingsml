"Final", "loan_no": "8191", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Rio State Fiscal\n            Efficiency for Quality of Public Service Delivery\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Brazil were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the first is the importance of considering\n            the dynamics of the political economy of reforms in\n            establishing performance targets, even when dealing with\n            individual executing agencies. This was most evident in the\n            establishment of ambitious targets for parts of the program,\n            such as in the investment area. The Bank felt it was\n            important for the planning secretariat to show improved\n            results in the identification, selection and tracking of\n            investment projects. The lead agency negotiating the loan,\n            State Secretariat of Finance, or SEFAZ, also had a\n            particular interest in agreeing with those targets. This\n            approach was seen as means to induce the line agency to make\n            greater efforts in handling the evaluation of public\n            investments. The second main lesson concerns building\n            institutional capacity. Successful public sector reforms are\n            often accompanied by measures to create stronger\n            institutions. This includes both better organizational\n            structures and incentives frameworks. Finally, one last\n            important lesson is the value of consistency and persistency\n            in the reform process. The DPL was the result of a long\n            engagement with the State of Rio, as well as the city of\n            Rio. The engagement occurred through the preparation and\n            supervision of several operations that focused generally in\n            the same areas. This helped to build expertise and knowledge\n            through a process of learning by doing, which proved to be\n            critical. This knowledge not only applied to the design of\n            the programs and the adjustment to measures over time, but\n            equally as important to overcome the resistance to reforms."}, "docdt": "2014-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
