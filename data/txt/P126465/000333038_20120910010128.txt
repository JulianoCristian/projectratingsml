million, on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2012-
0166).

social service delivery in health and education, and public financial management. Directors
commended the government for sound macroeconomic management, a prudent fiscal policy
stance, and a solid financial system. Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that the
benefits of the operation reach the poorest regions of the State, and underscored the importance
of gender in the operation. They noted the assessment of fiscal risks and urged maintaining close
dialogue with the authorities on the fiscal outturn. Directors also encouraged the dissemination
