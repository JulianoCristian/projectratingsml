Some lessons\n            learned included: a legal framework governing land\n            transactions by itself is insufficient in promoting land\n            consolidation. In the absence of a complementary law on land\n            consolidation, an exclusively market-driven approach to land\n            consolidation as was adopted by the project is unlikely to\n            succeed in promoting land consolidation in a transition\n            context. Wholesale markets should probably be initiated at\n            the lower end of their feasibility spectrum, with room to\n            grow as demand is demonstrated. Wholesale markets with Bank\n            financing have often failed commercially, and even more\n            commonly in other donors' programs. This may be due in\n            part to excessive optimism at the feasibility stage, leading\n            to excessive capacity and investment at their opening, and\n            excessive debt for the market company to bear later on.\n            Under the project, stakeholder working groups and detailed\n            feasibility studies provided a sound base for decisions\n            concerning the size, design, location and fee structure of\n            the four first markets. This allowed the markets to start at\n            an appropriate level and grow as demand increased,\n            predominantly with the markets' own funds. This in\n            turn, contributed significantly to the high occupancy rates,\n            and hence financial viability. Successful interventions in\n            seed development and supply require a careful balance of\n            public and private domains, tailored to the country's situation."}, "docdt": "2008-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
