The land market and rural technology\n            demonstration components will have minor to moderate impacts\n            on the environment. Designs of the wholesale markets will\n            consider the proper handling of solid waste and waste water.\n            Sub-projects under the rural technology demonstration\n            component will need to be reviewed according to their\n            individual environmental impact.
