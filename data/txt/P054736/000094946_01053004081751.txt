Agriculture Services Project
Summary of Environmental Assessment, Environmental Management Plan
1.    The Government of Albania received a credit of SDR equivalent 9.9 million USD
from IDA for an Agricultural Services Project. The proposed Albania Agricultural
Services Project (ASP) aims to create an environment conducive for rural income growth
and poverty reduction by addressing key constraints faced by Albania's emerging small-
holder farmers in agricultural production, trade, and the functioning of land markets. It
will pursue these objectives by: (i) improving access of smallholder farmers to quality
seeds through an improved seed regulatory framework, an enhanced role of the private
seed sector, and the strengthening of public seed related training and research; (ii)
supporting the establishment of a functioning land market through improved land
registration and pilot initiatives for land consolidation; (iii) improving participation of
smallholder farmers in market activities through the rehabilitation of selected market
infrastructure and active demonstration and facilitation of market linkages; and (iv)
improving access of smallholder farmers to adapted technologies, potential of diversified
production, processing and marketing through community based technology pilots. The
implementing agency for this project is the Ministry of Agriculture of Albania.
2.    An environmental review carried out during project preparation led to the
development of an environmental management plan and the recommendations of the
environmental management plan have been incorporated into the project design and
monitoring plans. The environmental impacts and mitigations summarized here were
presented and discussed with local stakeholders (governmental and non-governmental) at
two workshops in the country during project preparation. In addition, environmental
awareness training will be provided in parallel with the competitive grant program and
environmental impact (either the absence of, or appropriate mitigation for) will be
included in the criteria for selecting projects to finance under the competitive grant
program.
3.    Environmental management guidelines will provide project management with the
direction to be followed to ensure that the potential environmental impacts will be
minimized. The plan includes requirements for mitigation, monitoring, capacity
strengthening, responsibilities and cost requirements. Training on environmental
assessment will also be provided to Project Management Unit.
4.    The environmental assessment and management plan satisfies World Bank
requirements for a "Category Fl" project, as outlined in the Bank's Operational Policy
4.01. The project will also be implemented in accordance with Albanian regulations and
will make use of existing capacities for environmental reviews in the country.

Summary of Findings and Consultations
5.    The environmental assessment discusses the project's potential direct and indirect
environmental impacts. The assessment concluded that overall the project's impact on
the environment would be positive to neutral and that the Environmental Management
Plan would be implemented to ensure that there are no unexpected environmental
outcomes related to project activities. A summary of the environmental analysis and the
mitigation measures incorporated into the Environmental Management Plan are as
follows:
6.    The seed development and market development of the project are not expected to
have substantial negative environmental impacts. The land market and rural technology
demonstration components will have minor to moderate impacts on the environment and
with effective mitigation these can be all but eliminated. Sub-projects under the rural
technology demonstration component will need to be reviewed according to their
individual environmental impact. The competitive grant secretariat must be in a position
to recognize the environmental effects of proposed sub-projects of the community-based
rural productivity and marketing improvement component and be able to recommend
alternative designs or alternative projects, to ensure that the environment is not adversely
impacted. A sample guideline system for determining the environmental appropriateness
of proposed activities was developed under project preparation and has been included in
the operational manual.
> Issue/impact: The project would support seed research institutions in the production
and multiplication of breeder seeds and the improvement of quality seeds available.
The seed institutes will also focus on indigenous varieties and allow for their
protection. In addition, wild germplasm collection will be supported and ongoing
efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture strengthened.
Mitigation. No additional mitigations are required.
> Issue/impact: The project would finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of
immovable property registration offices. It will also pilot land consolidation
activities which would seek to avoid further land fragmentation and solicit stronger
security on ownership of land. No negative environmental impacts are foreseen.
Mitigation. No additional mitigations are required. Land consolidation pilot will be
closely monitored and lessons will be drawn. Civil works will take environmental
standards into consideration.
> Issue/impact: The market development component would finance the rehabilitation
and development of around four or five wholesale markets. The design of the
markets will incorporate environmental concerns like waste management, water
contamination. The new sites will improve the current situation of wholesale market
facilities and are thus expected to have a positive impact on the environment. In



addition, improved locations outside of the city center will contribute to less noise
and congestion in the town centers.
Mitigation. No additional mitigations required. Designs of the wholesale markets
will consider the proper handling of solid waste and waste water. Sites have been
carefully selected to avoid ownership conflicts and public consultations are ongoing
and will be completed before beginning of the construction works.
> Issue/impact: The community-based rural productivity and marketing improvement
component will support sub-project proposals of selected beneficiary groups. In
principal, no negative environmental impacts are expected as the sub-projects are
expected to consist mainly of small improvements in the current agricultural
production and marketing with, however, high benefits for the groups. Sub-project
proposals will be screened according to their impact on the environment.
Mitigation. The Operational Manual of the component describes in detail the
selection mechanism of the sub-projects. The sub-projects will also be reviewed
related to their impact on the environment. In order to enable the PMU to do so,
environmental awareness training will be provided to the PMU and the competitive
grant secretariat.
Monitoring
7.    Regular monitoring will ensure that mitigation is being carried out and to
determine whether or not additional impacts that are not identified in the EIA have not
been overlooked. Monitoring will be conducted in a systematic manner by the project
management team or its designate. An appropriate designate would be the PEMU which
is already established within the Forestry Department. Key to effective monitoring will
be the establishment of a set of simple baseline data against which to measure effects of
various activities. In order for monitoring to be effective, monitoring results must be
reviewed and seriously considered by project management, and where appropriate, acted
upon to eliminate or reduce the impact to an acceptable level (e.g. established standard).
Monitoring should occur on a biannual basis. A detailed monitoring procedure will be
developed and the individual(s) responsible should receive training in monitoring
techniques.
Capacity Development
8.    A one-day workshop on environmental awareness was presented by the expatriate
environmental consultant to ASP staff and officers of other World Bank supported
projects. Additional environmental training will be made available to ASP staff in the
future. The training would focus on the competitive grant secretariat responsible for the
community-based rural productivity and marketing improvement component. Such
training would include assessing environmental consequences on the range of activities
that are likely to be proposed and funded through this component. Proponents of
demonstration activities could also be included in this training in order to ensure that
projects that are proposed are considered and designed from an environmental viewpoint.



Project management and/its designate (e.g. PMU) will receive a short training course
(e.g. 2 days) in environmental monitoring technique and procedure.

9.    Most of the potential impacts can be avoided or minimized through the
application of good practices, which can be directed to the farmers through the MOAF
extension service and the ASP. Advice to farmers on environmental and agricultural
sustainability matters is likely not to be requested - it will be made the responsibility of
the extension service and the ASP to include this advice when advising on agricultural
production matters. Annex A provides a summary of mitigation for various issues along
with the costs, responsibilities and scheduling. It should be noted that most mitigation
will be built into the plan and designing of the sub-projects under the community-based
rural productivity and marketing improvement component and additional costs will be
minimal. Also, it should be noted that most potential impacts are insignificant (low
significance) and those that require attention are those that fall into high and moderate
levels of significance, indicated by the shaded cells.
10.   Table 1 provides a preliminary set of good practices, intended only for guidance,
and these should be further developed with the assistance of agricultural expertise prior to
finalizing and adoption.
