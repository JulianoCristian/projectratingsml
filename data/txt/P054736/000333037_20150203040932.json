A truck driver in the\n            Albanian army, he used to transport sacks of produce on the\n            sly, hiding the weights for his scales inside the cavity of\n            peppers. He continued selling vegetables when communism\n            collapsed and eventually dropped his low-paying army job to\n            trade full-time. Verga would mount one sack of produce on\n            the handlebar of his bicycle, load two on the back and cycle\n            down dirt paths selling tomatoes and squash to his\n            neighbors. Today Verga, 39, shares two minivans with his\n            brothers. He brings the bountiful Mediterranean produce of\n            Lushnje, neatly packed in plastic cases, to the market of\n            Korca, 250 km away in eastern Albania where the weather is\n            colder and the growing season kicks in\n            later.<BR>Verga\u0092s happier circumstances reflect the\n            transformation of Albania\u0092s market economy from illegal to\n            grey and finally, in the last few years, to something more\n            open and organized. The transition is particularly visible\n            in the agricultural sector where a World Bank loan to the\n            Albanian government has helped fund the country\u0092s first\n            professionally-organized fruit and vegetable markets. The\n            first market funded by the Agricultural Services project was\n            established in Lushnje, a town in Albania\u0092s most fertile\n            valley, southwest of the capital city of Tirana, close to\n            the Adriatic sea. Although the market was opened only two\n            years ago, business is so brisk that it is already expanding\n            to keep up with demand for stalls and parking spaces. A\n            second market opened in Korca last year and two other\n            markets, in Shkodra in Albania\u0092s mountainous north and in\n            Vlora on the coast, are under construction."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
