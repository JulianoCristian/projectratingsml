Although\n            the market was opened only two years ago, business is so\n            brisk that it is already expanding to keep up with demand\n            for stalls and parking spaces. A second market opened in\n            Korca last year and two other markets, in Shkodra in\n            Albania's mountainous north and in Vlora on the coast,\n            are under construction. In Lushnje, farmers have found a\n            reliable outlet for their produce, eliminating the need to\n            drive for hours looking for buyers scattered in different\n            towns and ridding them of the fear that what they grow will\n            not sell.
