The project comprises five\n            components. 1) The seed market development component will\n            ensure farmer access to a full range of seed technology and\n            to foster establishment and development of public and\n            private seed-related institutions suitable for market\n            economies. 2) The land market development component will\n            support the physical and institutional development of the\n            Immovable Property Registration System and a pilot Land\n            Consolidation Project. 3) The market development component\n            will support a variety of measures essential for the\n            establishment and promotion of functioning market channels,\n            marketing facilities, and export opportunities. 4) The\n            community-based rural productivity and marketing improvement\n            component will assist emerging smallholder farmers and other\n            rural entrepreneurs to develop their businesses by improving\n            their access to information and knowledge needed to improve\n            productivity, diversify production, and add value to their\n            products; and by exploiting market opportunities.
