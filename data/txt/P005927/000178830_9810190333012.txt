SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES S.A.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a pro3ect for the expansion of
power facilities in Buenos Aires during the three year period 1970-1972. A
third Bank loan to Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.A. (SEGBA)_
of US$60 million, is proposed to help finance this project. SEGBA is the
larger of the two utilities supplying the Gran Buenos Aires area. where about
one-third of the country's population and two-thirds of its industry are lo-
cated. It accounts for about 50% of the electricity nroduced by all of the
entities supplying the public in Argentina. In 1968, the maximum demand on
SEGBA's system was about 11400 MW and sales to its more than 2 million eus-i
tomers were about 5.4 million GWh.
ii.       The Buenos Aires power system has been characterized by shortages
of capacity through 1963/64 and subsequently, by a rela+ively slow row+h
through mid-1968, reflecting the performance of the economy. The recent ex-
pansion of business aci+it+y would indicate --r-opee+  for m.ore rapid overal 1
economic growth.  As a consequence, the demand for power is expected to grow

iv.       Tne project is estimateud to cost US$247 million equivalent.  Its
main purpose will be to provide facilities to distribute the energy generated
by SEGBA and the two projects referred to above. It would result in an ef-

Argentine manufacturers will be granted a margin of preference of 15th over
the CIF price of the lowest qualified foreign bidder. In addition, some of
the equipment and materials needed by SEGBA may be procured locally without
international competitive bidding and with financing from sources other than



the BlaUk.  Such prucure,ent , however-, will be liU[LmitL L oU LU i  a mUxinux-Wn 0
one-third of SEGBA's needs for each category of equipment and materials, and
to (ii) a maximum price oI 38% above the CIF price oI the successfui foreign
bidder for the same category of equipment and materials. The proceeds of
the Bank loan would be applied only to the foreign currency component of the
project and to interest during construction on the loan.
vi.       One of the purposes of the Bank loans to SEGBA has been to trans-
form it into a modern, efficient and financially viable utility. The neces-
sary institutional framework was provided at the time the first loan was
made, and gradual improvement was expected to follow. This objective, how-
ever, suffered a severe setback in 1964-66 as already pointed out in (iii)
above, and was made more difficult to achieve by the inflationary conditions
which prevailed until 1968. The present management, appointed in mid-1966,
has begun reducing the number of personnel and eliminating uneconomic pro-
visions of the labor contract and has made progress towards improving the
organization of the company and the quality of service to the public. Oppor-
tunity was taken of a 6% decrease in power rates at the beginning of 1969,
made possible by improved economic circumstances and efficiency of operations,
to continue a policy, introduced in 1968, of correcting imbalances in the
rate structure.
vii.      In connection with the financing plan for the project, the Govern-
ment and SEGBA have agreed in principle that SEGBA would start to pay cash
dividends and borrow small but increasing amounts from the market in order
to prepare itself to finance its expansion after 1972 without, if possible,
further assistance from the Government and the Bank.
viii.     The project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$60 mil-
lion, with a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 4 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE 1970-1972 EXPANSION PROGRAM
SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GRAN BUENOS AIRES S.A.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank has made three loans in the Argentine Power Sector, two
to Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA) and one to Hidroelec-
trica Norpatagonica S.A. (HIDRONOR). The first loan to SEGBA (308-AR) for
US$95 million was made in January 1962 to complete a 600 MW thermal generating
station and expand the transmission and distribution systems in the Buenos
Aires metronolitan area. The second loan to SEGBA (525-AR) for US$55 million
was made in January 1968 to help finance the continuing expansion of its
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The third loan (577-AR)
for US$82 million was made in December 1968 to HIDRONOR, a government-owned
corporation, to help finance the first stage of the El Chocon hydroelectric
project now being constructed on the Rio Limay about 1,100 km southwest of
Buenos Aires. Energy from this project will be supplied to SEGBA by means
of a 500 kv transmission line. The first stage, expected to be in operation
in 1973, is estimated to cost US$317 million and will have 600 MW installed;
the complete El Chocon-Cerros Colorados complex will have an ultimate capa-
city of 1,650 NW.
1.02      A loan of US$60 million is now proposed to help finance a program
for the expansion of SEGBAts facilities in the three year period 1970-72.
The proJect is estimated to cost US$247 million equivalent. It includes (a)
a 220 kv transmission line around the metropolitan area which will connect
SEGBA's system with transmission lines from El Chocon and from Atucha, the
nuclear power station being constructed by the Argentine Atomic Energy Com-
mission; and (b) further expansion of SEGBA's generating, transmission and
distribution facilities.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of the Appraisal Mission which
visited SEGBA in April and May 1969, consisting of Messrs. A.D. Spottswood,
Y. Rovani, T. Berrie and E.C. Wessels.
2. BACKGROUND
2.01      Argentina has an area of 2.8 million km , and a population of about
23.6 million.  In the past 17 years the population has been growing at a rate
of 1.7% per year.  In 1968, the gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated
by the Bank to be about US$17.3 billion equivalent, or US$732 Der cavita.
Industry is the largest sector of the economy and accounts for 31% of the
GDP. After several years of stagnation, a strong expansion of industrial
Droduction began in mid-1968. Over the past seventeen years, the GDP has
been zrowinz at a real rate of about 2.5%, but on a per capita basis the
growth was only about 1% annually. The relatively slow rate of growth of
electricity production during the same period, about 6% annually, is in part



- 2 -
a reflection of the performance of the economy. Conversely, the power short-
ages which existed from the early 1950s through 1964 undoubtedly had some
bearing on the slow economic growth. For the next decade the annual rate of
increase of electric power production is expected to average about 7% to 9%
on the assumption there will be a somewhat more rapid overall economic growth
than in the past.
2.02      The electric power sector in Argentina had, in mid-1969, a total
installed capacity of about 4,100 MW, not including "captive" industrial
plant estimated at 1,670 MW, 600 M4W of which was in the Buenos Aires area.
The total generation in 1968 by the entities supplying the public was 13,500
GWh of which more than 90% was by thermal plants. All of the principal en-
tities in the electric power sector are publicly-owned except Compania Italo-
Argentina de Electricidad S.A. (CIAE), a corporation controlled by Swiss in-
terests. As a rough approximation, power assets serving the public may be
considered to have a value of, say, US$2.0 billion. Over the next five years
the annual investment in the electric power sector, including El Chocon, is
expected to average about US$280 million equivalent, or about 1.5% of the
GDP in 1968.
2.03      The Buenos Aires system is by far the most important in the country
because of the large concentration of population and industry in and around
Buenos Aires. It is supplied jointly by SEGBA and CIAE, which had in mid-
1969 a total installed capacity of 2,092 MW. SEGBA is the principal supplier;
CIAE serves about one-third of the Federal Capital and four of the 31 sur-
rounding municipalities. In addition to its own generation, SEGBA purchased
energy from Agua y Energia Electrica (AyEE), the federal water and power
authority which had an installed capacity of 502 MW in the Litoral area
centered on Rosario. Thus, the Buenos Aires-Litoral system had available an
installed capacity of 2,594 MW, all of which was thermal. The combined sales
of SEGBA and CIAE in 1968 were 6,403 GWh, with SEGBA supplying 5,429 GWh and
CIAE 974 GWh. The total number of customers connected to the combined system
exceeded 2.3 million at the end of 1968. Since January 1, 1968, all of the
generating plants in this system have been controlled by a central dispatch
office guided by a computer.   In the Federal Capital and in the four sur-
rounding municipalities served by CIAE, there is some duplication of distri-
bution facilities but SEGBA and CIAE are now coordinating all phases of
planning and operation. Such coordination is in accordance with covenants in
the existing Loan Agreements between SEGBA and the Bank which are reneated in
the Agreement for the proposed loan. Eventually, a merger of the two compa-
nies may be effected, but in the meantime, the present arranaements are accept-
able.
2.04      The 313 MW heavy water moderated, natural uranium power station at
Atucha is scheduled to begin supplving 8EaRA in 1072 through an existing trans-
mission line.  HIDRONOR is scheduled to start selling energy to SEGBA in 1973.
Performance under Previous Loans
2.05      The program financed in part by the Bank's first loan to SEGBA in
1962 was earried ont  uice-ssfu11u .  The first Of the two major ob,ectives,



- 3 -
the relief of the severe power shortage in the Buenos Aires area, was achieved
in 1963/64. The second, longer term objective, of building SEGBA into an ef-
ficient and financially viable utility suffered a severe setback in 1964 due
to Government interference, which led to the replacement of the board and
management. In the ensuing two years personnel increased sharply, the finan-
cial position became critical and further expansion was delayed. Significant
progress was achieved, however, before the second loan was made, under the new
board and management appointed in mid-1966. For further details regarding
SEGBA's performance through 1967, see Report No. TO-606a, dated January 10,
1968, on the appraisal of SEGBA's earlier expansion program.
2.06      The second loan to SEGBA in 1968 helped to finance a part of its
1967-70 expansion program which included a 250 MW base load unit for the
Puerto Nuevo station, 140 iMW of gas turbine peaking canacity- the expansion
of the 132 kv transmission system, the construction of new substations and
a general exnansion of the distribution system. The oas turbineR are in
operation; the installation of the 250 MW unit is on schedule (completion
datp in Jine 1070)- The qtart. n-f onsntructinn nf the tfracsmisisn   qfhsubfstinn
and distribution work was delayed because orders for equipment could only be
nlnred after th)e Bnnk loan was signedp   As a result, it is expected that the
work would now be completed in the first half of 1970 instead of in March 1969
ns originally A estimaed.  Tt is also expeeted t'ha+ +'he fr-omreig  rt-vpr-xc r-cst
of the project will be lower than originally estimated, due to the high pro-
portion Or' eontacts won by Argentne mnuracturers ana to cavrins       It 
estimated that up to $9 million would remain undisbursed by the closing date
of Decemb.>er 31, 1969.  SEGBA plans to request an extension of the closing date
of the loan to April 15, 1970 and cancellation of up to US$4.5 million.

Power Market
3.02      SEGBA's power market consists of the major part of the Federal
Capital and 31 of the surrounding municipalities. It extends roughly in a
semi-circle, with a radius of about 65 km and includes the port and all im-
portant suburbs. 'The population in this area is estimated at about 7.5 mil-
lion.  In 1968, SEGBA supplied about 2 million customers, 85% of which were
residential. Actual and forecast data on the power market are shown in

cial and industrial sales indicate an increase in economic activity in the
BuenJos  A-- s area du_ing 1I96.  Tn addition the air condltion.ing s-a- are
growing steadily.   The sales to large industrial consumers (50 kw or more)
increased b,y 15.4t in 16ovrthos           1967. L     gohae
and 1968 of large industrial sales was 13-1/2%2 compared with the growth of
all industrial sales in the samle period of 12%.    TLis trend is expected to
continue provided no significant business recession occurs.     The growth in
residential sales came more from the addition oI new customers than from an
increase in consumption per customer which has averaged about 1.7% per year,
although it was 2.4%- in 1968.   in the past two years about 400 new customers
were connected per working day.
3.05      SEC-BA's transmission and distribution losses in 1966 and 1967 were
about 175 of the energy supplied to the network.     in i608, the losses declined
to 15.2%. This decrease reflects the strengthening of SEGBA's network and the
elimination of overloading in some parts of the system. Some further decline
in losses is exnected as the improvement in the capacity of the network pro-
gresses with the continuing of the expansion program, and by 1973 the losses
are estimated to be reduced to about 13.5%.    'This would be a reasonable fig-
ure for SEOBA's system (see Annex 2).

.3. o6    SE nR s S peak ioad in 196o was 1,394 Mw and iz is expecea to reaen
1,530 MW in 1969.  Since 1964 the increase in SEGBA's maximum demand has aver-
aged aDout 6% per year.   Tne system load factor in 1968 was about 55> which
is on the low side.  This would indicate potential for increased off peak
sales for industrial and air conditioning use.   if SEGBAMs distribution ex-
pansion program had been more nearly complete, the increase in the demand
might have been greater. Tnere are a number of areas which still require re-
habilitation or expansion before more load can be accepted. However, the
progressive expansion in the transmission system at 132 kv, in the number and
capacity of substations, and in the distribution network has enabled SEGBA to
reduce outages drastically and greatly improve service to customers and volt-
age conditions.
3.07      The installed generating capacity in SEGBA's system in mid-1969 was
1,573 MW, consisting of 1,433 MW of steam capacity in three stations and 140
MW of gas turbine peaking capacity at five locations. With the completion of
the 250 MSW steam unit at the Puerto Nuevo station in June 1970, SEGBA's total
installed capacity will be 1,823 MW.
3.08      With an assured supply of generating capacity in the future and
with the expansion and improvement in its transmission and distribution sys-
tems, SEGBA should be able to attract to its system in the next decade part
of the industrial and commercial load now served by "captive" plants which
were installed during the power shortages in the 1950s and early 1960s. In
mid-1969 there was still about 600 MW of this capacity in existence in the
Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The amount of this capacity is expected to
decline, but the rapiditv and extent of the decline will depend on the confi-
dence which industrialists have in SEGBA's ability to supply their energy
needs with good security and on how soon their equipment wears out. Some
industries using process steam may never change to SEGBA because they can
produce their own electricity economically and others may be reluctant to
change because of SEGBA's relatively high industrial and commercial rates
and the sales tax which must be paid on electricity that they purchase (see
para 3.28).
3.09      SEGBA, however, has been successful in the past two years in sign-
ing contracts with large industrial clients for substantial amounts of new
load. In 1967, such contracts amounted to 140 MW and in 1968 they totalled
260 MW. The connections to the system will be made gradually over a period
of years. For example, the demand for a large steel mill now under construc-
tion at La Plata will start at 25 MW in 1970 and is planned to increase to
75 MW by 1976.
Organization and Management
3.10      SEGBA has a Board of Directors of eight members, including the
President and the Executive Vice President, appointed by the Government as
the only shareholder. The Executive Committee, consisting of the Executive
Vice President and four department heads appointed by him is responsible for
the principal functions of the company. The proposed Loan Agreement provides
that any substantial changes in SEGBA's by-laws or concession would be an



- 6 -
even of default and that the Bank will be consulted prior to the appointment
of a new Executive Vice President.
3.11      The Executive Vice President, an engineer with long experience in
utility and private business management, is supported by a team of able
managers and assistant managers. The organization below them, however, is
deficient. During the long period of stagnation and political interference
under the Peron regime, there was a gradual erosion of management authority
which led to the breakdown of existing controls. Also, an unfavorable labor
contract resulted in excessive numbers of unqualified personnel. Modern fi-
nancial and administrative techniques were not introduced and the middle
management personnel which would have been necessary to develop and implement
their. was not recruited. As a result, SEGBA by 1961 had inherited a highly
centralized, bureaucratic organization, in which standards of efficiency and
quality of service had declined to very low levels.
3.12      In 1963, SEGBA engaged the International Middle West Service Com-
pany as management consultants. Progress in modernizing SEGBA, however, has
been slow, due in part to the setback experienced in 1964-66, and in part
to the magnitude of the problems involved. SEGBA's management was forced
to concentrate on the immediate task of planning and carrying out the ex-
pansion programs, dealing with the labor situation, and resolving serious
financial difficulties.
3.13     liowever, some modernization has recently taken place.    Billings
have been computerized, and about 70% of SEGBA's customers are now receiving
their bills through the mails and paying through banks. This has led to sub-
stantial improvements over the previous door-to-door collection system,
through better service, speedier collections, and improved control over re-
ceivables. The timeliness of financial and operating reports has also im-
proved, and interim balance sheets are now available within 30 days from the
end of each month.
3.14      Despite the progress noted above, financial controls and management
information remain inadequate. SEGBA has set up four working parties to pro-
pose and implement improved systems, with the help of the consultants. Also,
after some delay, SEGBA has started to decentralize its commercial and techni-
cal departments. The responsibility for customer service, meter reading, col-
lections not handled by mail, construction of low voltage lines, installation
of transformers and connection of new customers will be delegated to the manna-
gers of about 14 district offices, each serving 150,000 to 200,000 customers.
This would constitute a malor step towards solving the dupliration, delays and
lack of responsibility inherent to the present structure, in which all deci-
sions must be referred to the higher levels of man_g_e_mnt. Two district of-
fices have been set up to date. Progress is likely to continue to be slow
until SEGBA is able to acquire sufficient additional managerial talent to
carry out these programs. During the next year, SEGBA will concentrate on
imnroving its budgetary control systems and in addition, eect to st up
four more district offices. This program is realistic.

The Labor Problem
3.15      The Bank has; in the nast, called the labor nroblem to the attention
of both the Government and SEGBA, stating in July 1965 that a second loan would
he conditional on the initial resiilts of a rnoarm to reduceAlabor costs. By
the time Loan 525-AR was made in January 1968, significant progress had been
made to restore management autho         +,heen the iO..ar.y,¶r +the nMber of personnel
had been slightly reduced, and initial steps had been taken by SEGBA towards
revising the existing ,nfavorable labor controt    in accordance with a pro-
cedure established by a law of October 1967. It was then understood verbally
that during 1968 personnel would bDe reduced by about 1,000 and --a  progress
would be made in revising the labor contract.   No specific agreements were
in personnel after 1968.
3.16      The labor contract was amended Mlay 6, 1968 by a decision of the
Secretaz y    a Tb-or as arbDit'rator bDet-ween t1he ULgbht andu P'ower U'nior, and SEIGBA-/
CIAE. This amendment removed most of the restrictions affecting SEGBA's and
rCT A VIAs power to adjust workIng hoVurs, decide overtime, Lhi 're and promuole, em-
ploy contractors and enforce retirement of personnel. In addition, it gave
the companies authority to revise staffing requirements and Job descriptions,
the main sources of featherbedding, as necessary to improve efficiency of
service and achieve full ernulo-yment ol personnel.
3.17      SEGBA has studied new staffing requirements and joD descriptions
for some sectors of its activities, and some have been implemented with union
agreement, resulting in the cancellation of vacant positions and the transfer
of redundant personnel to construction or other work. It is only after studies
covering the entire company have been completed that a reasonably accurate es-
timate of the number of redundant personnel can be made. It was generally
agreed in the past that the number of excess personnel amounted very roughly
to about 6,000, and that a reasonable ratio of consumers per employee would
be in the order of 100.
3.18      Since mid-1966, however, when a maximum personnel of 25,780 was
reached, personnel was reduced by about 1,400 to 24,400 at the end of March
1969, including about 1,100 in the period since Loan 525-AR was made. Most
of these reductions have been obtained by enforcing retirement as permitted
by the recent revision of the labor contract.   SEGBA expects to continue re-
ducing personnel, mostly through attrition, by a net percentage of about 1.5%
per year. In selected sectors SEGBA further intends, by offering a year's
severance pay, to encourage excess personnel to leave. Combined with the
growth of SEGBA's operations, these reductions would result in gradual but
significant improvements in efficiency. As an example, the number of consu-
mers per employee, which was 73 at the end of 1966, would increase to about
89 at the end of the current year and would exceed 100 in 1972, at the end of
the project period.
3.19      In addition, SEGBA intends to transfer to construction work an
average of about 300 men per year over the next three years as they are made
available by the gradual reduction in staffing requirements for operations.

3.20      This progrnm is realistic and the results already obtaineA con.
stitute sufficient evidence that it will be carried out, provided that con-
tinuitv in management and goverrunent support is maintained.
Power Rates
3.21      The concession of February 1, 1962, provides that SEGBA 's rates
should generate revenues sufficient to produce a return of 8% on the average
value, expressed in dollars, of net plant in serv'ice, plus a notional value
of working capital equal to 5% of the average value of net plant in service.
Depreciation charges are computed on the value, also expressed in dollars,
of gross plant in service at year-end, at an average rate of 3% on all assets
(except furnit    ~   LLL ure and flxtures, 10rs;m andu vehicles 2 0S).
3°        Fo wer rates are revised a,±nualy, effective -with the first meter
reading of January, on the basis of a detailed application submitted by SEGBA
to the Secretaria de Estado de Eniergia y Mineria (SEEfi), for approval.  The
concession provides that, if the 8% return to which SE(TBA is entitled has
not been achieved (or has been exceeded) in any past year, the shortfall (or
surplus) must be compensated for by revenues of the year immediately succeed-
ing. Changes arisin7 in labor and fuel costs during the year are to be
automatically compensated for by interim rate adjustments. Furthermore, if
chlages in economic circumstances, such as lower sales, devaluation of the
currency, etc., could be expected to result in an insufficient net income
for the current year, SEGBA can adjust its rates proportionally after in-
forming the Secretaria.
3.23      The seven year period since the concession was made effective pre-
sented particularly difficult challenges. While it may be argued that the
Government and SEGBA departed in the two instances described below from a
strict implementation of the provisions of the concession, there is no doubt
that SEGBA was able to maintain satisfactory levels of earnings and cash
generation under most unfavorable inflationary conditions.
3.24      In 1964 and 1965, the Government caused SEGBA to reduce its de-
preciation charges from 3%/ to 2% and granted lower power rates than requested.
However, unlike the change in management, which took place at the same time,
this action did not have lasting effects. The most difficult challenge of
the period, a rapid depreciation of the peso accompanied by devaluations from
MItN83 per US$ in earl1r 1962 to M$N350 per US$ in 1967, was met by frequent
rate increases which brought the 1968 rates to 4.7 times the level at the
end of 1961.
3.25      At the end of 1967, however, the Government granted SEGBA only
part of the rate increase required under the concession. Revenues from power
sales were calculated to achieve the permitted 8% return in 1968, but not to
recover the shortfall at the end of 1967 (see para 3.22). This shortfall was
to be recovered out of appropriations of M$N6.3 billion from the National
Energy Fund, to be transferred to SEGBA in the course of 1968 as extraordinary
revenues. Prior agreement to this exceptional measure, made necessary by
economic circumstances, was obtained from the Bank. The arrangements described



- 9 -
above were carried out satisfactorily. Actual earnings in 1968 exceeded the
amount permitted in the concession, and another surplus is expected for 1969,
despite a 6% average reduction in rates made effective in January.
3.26      The existing rate covenants have been repeated in the proposed
agreements. They provide that SEGBA should seek. and the Government should
grant, the rates to which SEGBA is entitled under the concession. In addi-
tion, they confirm that adequate depreciation charges will be maintained, of
not less than an average 3% of plant in service.
3.27      Severe power shortages from the mid-50s to 1963/64, when the first
Bank nrolect was comnleted. virtuallv eliminated incentives to apply com-
mercial criteria for rate setting purposes. Power rates were generally un-
bha1ranted in f'avnr of residential eonsumers.  Average industrial rates were
somewhat above the residential level and commercial rates were significantly
higher (see Annex 3 for details Of the rate strunture).    The ranid denrecia-
tion of the peso between 1962 and 1967 was met by frequent rate increases,
of the order of 30% to 40% per anniim   Any siznifi ent attempnt to rentifv
imbalances in the rate structure under those circumstances would have re-
quired even higher increases of residentlal rates and this was deemed in-
advisable by the Government and SEGBA. The only adjustment in that period
was a night hour reduction for ind-ustrial consl ly+    -n intr-oduce  in 1965
but it was not until 1967 that the average revenue per kwh for industrial
and residtl a! consumers becam-e equal.
.28      CS1DA is aware of tbe oanoalies 4n its 4ate structure.     It needs
time and Government support to rectify them.    In 1968, the Government decided
to inres ------  -- es-identisl a  rates and a'llowed SC!V-BA to appl -  fie  charge
for residential consumers. This partially rectified the imbalance between
reiential ar, Lnutia      rates.  A   thle bkegitnnin- Of 1n6n,ardcino

4.05      Most of the debt, totalling about US$150 million and only 24% of
the capitalization, is in foreign exchange. The two Bank loans, excluding
about US$45 million still undisbursed at the end of 1068, accounted for 60^,
of the debt outstanding (see Annex 5 for details).   With final payments being
made this year on the suppliers' credits which financed the Costanera Station
and 132 kv ring completed in 1964, the only significant shorter term debts
still outstanding are three loans from the Caja Nacional de Ahorro Postal,
aggregating US$30 million equivalent, which will be fully repaid within the
next two years.
4.o6      The existing and proposed Bank Loan Agreements include a negative
pledge clause and a debt limitation covenant. The incurrence of long-term
debt is limited by an assets test and an earnings test. Under the assets
test, SEGBA is not permitted to incur new debt if after the incurrence of
such debt, its net assets in operation plus work in progress would be less
than 1-1/2 times total indebtedness. Under the earnings test, SEGBA could
not incur new debt unless the maximum future interest payments on all indebt-
edness, including the proposed new debt, were covered at least 1-3/4 times by
net income for the past twelve-month period or the last fiscal year. SEOBA
could presently meet both tests and incur debts substantiallv in excess of
the amounts contemplated in the financing plan for the proposed project.

4.o8      The Guarantee Agreements for the existing and proposed loans record
the Government,'s policy to encourage the investment of private savin,gs in SEGBA
and to sell all of its common shares to private investors. SEGBA undertook
under the previous Loan Agreeents to use its best efforts to sell new shar-es
to private investors to finance its expansion, and to follow a dividend policy
consistent with the need to encourage pri-vate investmernt in its electricity
services. No shares have been sold due to adverse market conditions, and
dividends were paid exclusively in Stock due to shortage of cash.   nl V1ieW oI
SEGB:P's improved financial condition, the company and the Government expect
that an initial cash dividend will be paid in i970 '(para. 7.03)).
4.09      Under the proposed Loan Agreement, SEGBA undertakes to use its best
efforts to borrow from private sources and to sell new shares to private in-
vestors, in order to prepare itself to finance the expansion of its services
without, if Dossible, further assistance from the Government and the Bank.
4.10      During negotiations, SEGBA indicated that it would, within the limits
prescribed by Argentine law, revalue its balance sheet on a basis consistent
with the concession, in order to allow a meaningful presentation of its finan-
cial condition. (see paras. 4.02 and 4.03).
Current Position
4.11      Working capital is ample.   Current assets at the end of 1968 were
M$N38 billion, as compared with current liabilities of M$N22 billion. This is
due partly to excess earnings and partly to the delayed expansion in 1968 (see
paras 4.13 and 2.06). Cash was about M$N6.0 billion, well in excess of SEGBA's
working needs. The surplus cash would be used in financing the proposed pro-
gram (see para 7.05).
4.12      Accounts receivable from Government authorities and agencies amount-
ed to about M$N4.5 billion at the end of 1968, equivalent to about 12 months of
billings to these customers. These accounts have been reduced during 1969 and
the Government has undertaken to ensure prompt payment in the future of amounts
due to SEGBA by its agencies.
Past Earnings
4.13      Income statements for the two years ended December 31, 1968 are
given in Annex 6. Net income for 1967 was about M$N13 billion, equivalent to
a return of 6.8% on the dollar rate base. Due to devaluation of the peso
during the year, from M$N247 to M$N350 per dollar, the earnings shortfall of



- 13 -
M$N3.2 billion at the end of 1966, which was to be recovered out of 1967 re-
venues, increased instead to about M$N5.5 billion at the end of 1967. Based
on an earlier, higher estimate, the Government provided M$N6.3 billion to
SEGBA in 1968 as extraordinary revenues to offset this deficiency (see para
3.18). In 1968 sales increased more than forecast while, for the first time
on record, operating expenses were within estimates, resulting in a net income
of M$N25 billion, equivalent to a return of 12.5%, and excess earnings of
M$N3.5 billion. Interest coveraaes continued to be amnle repfelting the satis-
factory earnings and the relatively low debt. See Annex 7 for details of

5.02      The balance of expenditures on the 1967-70 program which will be
made in 1970, will cover:   (a) the completion Of the 250    t steam. turline base
load unit in the Puerto Nuevo station which is scheduled for commercial oper-

after consultation with the Bank, SEGBA agreed to increase its usage of coal
1roM 151,000 ts i tons in 1967 to     tons in 1972.  Lne coal will be supplied
by Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF) the state coal agency.    YCF will

5.03      T-ne expenditures on SEGBA's new 1970-72 program will cover primarily
extensions of its transmission and distribution systems.   A relatively small
increase in generating capacity is contemplated, namely:   (a) tne instaiiation
of 90 IMW of gas turbines (see para 6.06); and, (b) minor improvements of ex-
isting capacity.
5.04      The transmission program includes:   (a) a 220 kv overhead double
circuit transmission line, in an arc about 119 km long around the metropol-
itan area, with appropriate step-down connections to the 132 kv network; and,
(b) underground and aerial transmission lines from SEGBA's generating plants
to the load centers. Power from Atucha will be fed into the system at the
M1oron substation. The 500 kv line from El Chocon will interconnect at HIDRONOR's



El Pino substation which steps the voltage down to 220 kv. At El Pino, SEGBA
will be responsible only for the 220 kv equipment beyond the 220 kv terminals
of the step-down transformer. The rest of SEGBA's transmission program in-
cludes: (a) 10 new 132 kv substations; (b) a 220 kv switching station; (c) a
second 220 kv substation; (d) extension of 10 existing 132 kv substations; and,
(e) about 136 route km of 132 kv lines.
5.05      The program for distribution includes:   (a) rehabilitation of the
existing network; (b) reinforcement of the distribution system in general;
and, (c) the extension of the network to connect additional consumers. The
latter involves: (a) laying about 850 km of underground cables; (b) 1,200 km
of overhead 13.2 kv lines; (c) over 6,200 km of low voltage lines and cables;
(d) the installation of over 2,500 transformers; (e) 351,000 meters; (f)
about 100,000 new connections per year; and, (g) public lighting. SEGBA has
decided to phase out gradually the old 27.5 kv transmission voltage and the
6.5 kv distribution network both of which have become inadequate for the
present loading conditions. Fortunately it is technically possible to uprate
the existing 6.5 kv circuits to 13.2 kv at relatively little cost. For fur-
ther details of the program see Annex 8.

5.07      These cost estimates are based on the most recent actual cost of
installing similar facilities and include about 7% for contingencies. The
total cost and the foreign exchange component of the equipment and materials
for transmission and distribution will depend in part on how much is procured
locally and at what level of effective protection. Under the procurement
arrangements described in paras 5.09 and 5.10, however, the effects of these
two factors on the program's cost and financing plan would be insignificant.
The foreign exchange content of equipment and materials would in any case be
more than the loan amount to be allocated for its financing, ensuring that
the use of the loan will not be affected by the origin, local or foreign, of
such procurement.

Procurement
5.09      The arrangements under the proposed loan for the procurement of
equipment and materials may be Asmrn.arized as follows
SEGBA w411 invte hbita   r'Q.,5,1       fo r rn,ntitipc
equivalent to two-thirds of its needs of each category of
equipment or materials and vill request cz.1nim,i1t tQ_niie1%us
separate bids, from Argentine manufacturers only, for an
additional one-third.  In aw tvdingr contracts fo-r the main
quantities bid internationally, a 15% margin of preference
will. 1be granted too Argentine bidders over +th  CIF -rice of
the lowest qualified foreign bidder. Under Argentine law,
locall. ranufactr ers will also be exem..pt fro. sals t   --nd
import duties on raw materials and component parts.
If an Argentine manufacturer bids successfully under the 15%
pref-erence, SEGBAt mLay alsoV invite LAirU toV su4Jppljy thWadiioa
one-third at the same unit price bid for the main quantity.
If a foreign bidder is awarded the contract for the main
quantity, the senarate Argentine bids for the additional
one-third will then be opened. The corresponding second
contract will be awarded to the lowest Of the Argentine
bidders provided that (i) his quoted price is less than
38% above the CIF price of the successful foreign bidder

above or, if not  that ti4) he is wiling to reduce his
price to such level. Equipment and materials procured
locally *.nder th',,ese conditions will no.ot bLe eligbl  for'
Bank financing.
- If no Argentine bidder is willing to reduce his price,
the successful foreign bidder for the main quantity may
be invited to supply also the additional one-third, at
the same unit pr'ce.
5,. 10    The procurement arrangements described above would thus ensure
that:
(a)  the Bank will finance only equipment and materials pro-
cured through international competitive bidding, including
a maximum domestic preference of 15%;
(b)  local procurement without international competitive
bidding, to be financed from sources other than the Bank,
would be limited to (i) a maximum quantity of one-third
of SEGBA's needs for each category of equipment and
materials, and to (ii) a maximum price of 38% above the
CIF price of the successful foreign bidder for the same
category of equipment and materials. In this case the
other two-thirds would be awarded to the successful
foreign bidder. The cost of SEGBA of the combined
foreign and local contracts would average a maximum
of about 12.7% above the cost of the foreign bid.
5.11      Civil works contracts would also be awarded after international
competitive bidding but it is doubtful whether foreign contractors would com-
pete because of the relatively small size of the individual contracts. SEGBA
uses a system of prequalification whereby civil contractors are divided into
categories according to size and ability to carry out jobs of different mag-
nitudes. The arrangements for procurement are satisfactory.
Disbursement
5.12      The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed to finance:
(a) the CIF cost of imported equipment; (b) the foreign exchange component
of the cost of equipment procured locally as explained in para 5.09 and the
foreign exchange component of civil,works, on a percentage basis, (c) con-
sultant's services; and (d) up to US$5 million to cover interest and other
charges during construction; all of which is reflected in the allocation of
proceeds schedule. To permit SEGBA to make retention payments after the
scheduled completion of the Dro.ect at the end of 1972 (see para 5.18), the
closing date would be June 30, 1973.

Consulting Engineers
5.13      SOFRELEC has been retained as engineering consultant to SEGBA
since October 1965 and has assisted SEGBA in a variety of ways, including
design, project preparation, supervision of construction and improvement of
operations and maintenance. SEGBA now has the necessary skills to plan and
operate its system without full time consultants. Accordingly, it has entered
into a new contract with SOFRELEC under which, supported by Electricite de
France, it will assist SEGBA on request in each particular case with: (a)
studies of the stability of the transmission system; (b) lay-out of projects
and preparation of specifications; (c) comparison and evaluation of tenders;
and, (d) operational problems of power stations and of the transmission and
distribution system.
5.14      SOFRELEC may carry out the work, according to its importance and its
character, either in Paris or through long- or short-term missions to Buenos
Aires or, if so requested by SEGBA, by establishing a permanent mission in
Buenos Aires; the type and size of such a mission would be in agreement with
SEGBA. These arrangements for consulting engineering services are satisfac-
tory. Any changes will be subject to the approval of the Bank.
Construction Schedule
5.15      The construction of the 250 M4W unit in the Puerto Nuevo station is
on schedule and no difficulty is expected in having it in operation before
the winter peak of 1970. SEGBA has accelerated the pace of construction for
both transmission and distribution now that the equipment procured under loan
525-AR is being delivered in increasing volume. All orders placed with local
manufacturers under this loan are scheduled to be delivered by the end of
1969. These cover a very substantial part of the equipment required for the
distribution network, since under the last Bank loan local manufacturers were
successful in winning 87% of the contracts for the supply of such equipment
for which they competed.
5.16      In order to keep up the momentum on the construction of its trans-
mission and distribution systems, SEGBA planned to call for bids in August and
September 1969 on about US$8.5 million worth of oil filled cables, breakers,
insulators. transformers, switchgear and related equinment scheduled for in-
stallation during the period of the project. Orders for this equipment are
exnected to be nlaeed late in 1969, after the loan i- made, but no payments
would be made on the eauipment until deliveries start in 1970.
5.17      The 220 kv transmission line and practically all of the 132 kv
lines will be erected by contractors with SEGBA supplying the conductors,
insulators and hardware.  There will be numerous contracts for laying under-
ground cables, construction of substations and erection of   tro    +   n,es of
equipment for the transmission systems. These contracts are generally for
periods of ten to fourteen months.   About half of the construction on the
distribution network will be carried out by contract and the remainder by
cvEDAt's o..   orces.



- 19 -
5.18      The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1972.    To
accomplish this SEGBA will have to sustain a high level of activity both in
procurement and construction. The pace-reached by mid-1969 indicates that
SEGBA could carry out the project as scheduled.
6. JUSTIFICATION
Demand and Sales
o.0l      The number of customers awaiting connection at the end of 1968 to-
talled 60,000, a rather large waiting list which has not declined since 1967.
It amounts to a backlog of about seven months' work to make the required con-
nections.  Not included in this figure are customers in the 'barrios' I/ or
groups of poorer class housing where it is estimated that a further 100,000
customers are awaiting connections.
b.02      SEGBA follows careful nroeedures for estimathin the fuiture demands
on its system, on the basis of nine year projections of load growth in each
of the 21 zones in its service area.   Tn the past, SEGBA's estimates of load
growth have been rather accurate. In 1966 it estimated peak loads of 1,319
iW for 1967 and 14i12 MW for 1968. The actual loads were 1,316 MW in 1967
and 1,394 in 1968. SEGBA's maximum demand is expected to increase from 1,394
'NJ in 1968 to 1,909 in 1972.  The growth rates would be 9.7Z in 1969, 8.0% in
1570 and 1971 and about 7,% thereafter.
6.03      SEGBA estimates its growth in sales by analyzing the probable growth
in each class of conslamer to reach an estimate for over-all sales growth and
adjusts its estimates every year. Estimates have been reasonably accurate
excent for a lar-e overestimation for the e-ly 1°60s (when a recession occur-
red) and an underestimation for 1968. The large growth in sales of 11.4% in
1968 over the preceding year and the forecast growth of 12.4% in 1969 are the
result of an expansion in economic activity which affected industrial and
commercial sales more than expected.   A comparison of the sales estimates
made in 1966 with actual results for 1967 and 1968 and present estimates for
1969 and 1970 is shown below:

houses 'ha' Jointly reouest to be connected to the system, and in which
the consumers must contribute to the cost of the distribution network as
exDlained in Annex 4, Note 2.



- 20 -
6.o4      SEGBA estimates its sales will grow at a rate of 8.5% in 1970,
9.4% in 1971 and then at a declining rate varying from 7.3% in 1972 to 7.0%
in 1978. The estimate of about 7.0% inCrease per year after 1971 may be
on the conservative side. Under the above assumptions SEGBA estimates that
its sales will increase from 5,429 GWh in 1968 to 7,240 GWh in 1971 and
7,770 GWh in 1972. For the growth in energy sent out and sales to 1978 see
Annex 2.
Future Increases in System Capacity
6.05      As shown in the table below. SEGBA did not have in 1968 nor will
it have in the future sufficient capacity, with the largest unit out of ser-
vice, to meet the maximum demands of its own consumers and must depend on
capacity from CIAE, AyEE and others for this purpose:

/b   T'he reserve includes the largest unit (less auxiliaries) plus 5/O of the
effective thermal capacity. It is intended to meet unanticipated out-
ages and allow for possible errors in estimates of future demand.
Assessment of SEGBA's Program
6.07      SEGBA's expansion program has been closely coordinated with that of
CIAE. It is based on the estimates of load growth discussed in paragranh
6.02. The sizes for equipment have been well chosen and the program has been
reviewed and anoroved by SEGBA's consultants- SQFRFLRC.
6.08      The facilities in SEGBA's program are urgently npeied     to enable
SEGBA to keep pace with the increase in demand in its service area as required
under its conepssion- Withont thee faeilities, and especially without the
220 kv transmission line, SEGBA could not efficiently utilize the energy from
El Chocon and Atucha. A continuing exnansion of the faeilities necessary to
send electricity to the ultimate consumer is needed to prevent overloading of
the existing svstem.   The nroniet would resuIt in nn pfficiet andenm
network structure.
Incremental Rate of Return

on the basis of the eash flow with 'rePn    t to t  eonom    asa  whole.   Ta es
are therefore excluded from costs but are included in revenues, since they
form nart of' the gross revenues from n hih t    cah flow is derivedl    T,he re-
sultant returns are therefore greater than the corresponding financial returns
earned by SRF,A but less than the full economic returns, -hich include bene-
fits normally recognized as being unquantifiable. The incremental rate of

derived from it, less operating expenses, over its life. The project is made
up of a very large number of different types of equipment; because the util-
ization of these within the existing anid likely future system is extremely
complex. it has not been nossible to senarate the revenueq attrihiifPhIp en
the project and calculate the return for the project as a whole. It has,
however, been nossible to estimate returns for parts of the projlect where
attributable costs and revenues can be determined i.e. for extensions of
eleetrieitv  upnnlies to the "harrios" or settlemepnts housing lower-income
families. Annex 11 gives details of the calculations. The present value of
,gross revenues less oneratina expenses attributable to the extension of sup=
olies to the barrios, equals the present value of the attributable capital
costs at a discount rate of 11% for the smaller (50 house) barrios and 18%
for the larger (500 house) barrios, on the basis of the present levels of
costs, electricn4fit, ra+es and +0>Yes
6.10      The average consumption of electricity in wellestablished barrios
is currently only about 70% of the average for all residential consumers.
When first co-nnected the barrio revenues to SEGB`rA are as low as -.abou  US$1.T86 'Jo
per customer per month and are likely only to double over the project's life.

expected revenues, barrio electrification is judged likely to be one of the
marginal parts of the pro-ect (i.e. likely to earn one of the lowest incre-
mental rates of return among the various parts of the project). On these
grounds the incremental rate of return on the project as a whole is probably
higher than 18%.

1969-1972 is attached as HAnex 7 along wi'th comparable actual data for 1967
and 1968.  SEGBA's construction expenditures for the four year period are
estimated at `,N115. 7 billion (US$330.7 miilon equivaient), consisting of (a)
the three-year 1970-1972 project totallinsz M$N86.6 billion (US$247.4 million

through the construction period of the project, in order to prepare itself
to finance its expansion beyond 1r972 wit  a JII.iimmI o  UfL LrOe hlfot
Bank and the Government. For the same reason, SEGBA expects, also with the
agreement of the Government, to start paying cash dividends in 1970, out OL
1969 profits, on preferred and common shares (see para 4.08). These policies
are reflected in the financingL plaur aove id were taken int,o account in de-
termining the amount of the proDosed loan. Though no sales of new shares
are contemalated in this financing plan, any cash raised from sale of shares
to the public could replace some of the assumed borrowings, since such sales
would further the same desirable obJectives.   Ample worki,ng capital provided
throughout the period would allow (particularly for the first issue) timing
Of the issues according to m,arket conditions~ and avoid conflict with the
Giovernment's own borrowing plans. It is expected that the first issue will
be Dlaced Drior to July 31 , 1970, market conditions permitting.
7.04      Cash dividends were assumed at 5% of par on preferred and 8% on
common shares. In addition, a 10% stock dividend would be paid on common
shares.   hle cash dividends payments would average US$10 million per year in
1970 through 1972 which is quite small; annual dividends would be less than
one-third of net profits and 2,Z of the dollar value of Government equity.
Such dividend payments should therefore be increased as availability of cash
allows (see also para 7.09 below).
7.05      Internal cash generation, net of debt service and dividends,
would amount to US$145 million equivalent, or about 44% of total require-
ments.  About Us$18 million equivalent would be contributed from excess

working eapital at the beginning of the period (see nara 4.11), Fnd about
US$,2.0 million would be paid by YCF as explained in para 5.02 and Annex 4.
7.o6      I'he proposed borrowings would total US$166 million equivalent,
cnis+,ng of, (a).  s+i  - isbursmern+s of US$6T.5 m4 il14ion in 1969 and
US$4.5 million in 1970 under Loan 525-AR, bringing total disbursements to

terest at 7% and a term of 20 years, including a 4 year grace period; (c)
suppliers' credits aggregating about USZI9'.L7 m I 4    .and (A) borrowings4-
from the market of about IJS$45 million.

billion).
7.08      Annual borrowings from the market of US$10 million in 1970, US$15
million in 1AJ71 and US620 million in 1972 have been ass-ned. Based general-
ly on an actual offer received by SEGBA, they were assumed to be in the form
of 8O SEGBA foreign currency bonds issued at a 06 discount, including costs,
and repayable in ten equal annual installments starting after one year.
Local borrowings wouid be equally satisfactory, provided a minimum term of,
sav, 10 years can be obtained, but this is not likely at present.
7.09      SEGBA's ability to borrow publicly has not been tested previously.
Consequently, despite the large borrowing potential that SECTBA's sound fi-
nancial condition and earnings indicate, only relativelv small amounts of
borrowings could be expected at this time. It would be desirable to in-
crease them later in the neriod in the light of actual favorable experience,
and any cash surplus so generated could be used to increase the cash dividend
now contemplated.   On the other hand, should market conditions prove unfavor-
able, the risk for the program would be minimal: the net cash to be con-
tributed in the four year period from the US$45 million gross issue amount
would only be about US$39 million, after discount and amortization in the
period are deducted, as compared with cash dividend payments of about US$31
million in the last three years of the period, SEGBA would pay dividends in
stock rather than cash and the net gap of US$8 million could be offset easily,
given the conservative working capital position and the availability of short-
term local credits.
Future Earnings
7.10      Forecast income statements for the four years 1969-1972 are shown
in Annex 6. Sales are forecast as indicated in paras 6.03 and 6.04. Ope-
rating expenses are estimated to be at current price levels, except for fuel
costs which would increase by 10% on January 1, 1970. Labor expenses would
remain at their 1969 level since expected increases in individual wages for



- 25 -
seniority and promotions of about 3%, would be offset by savings in labor
expenses due to labor reductions and transfers to ennstruction. The level
of power rates was calculated to produce a net income equivalent to the 8%
return provided in the concession, less, in 1969 and 1970, the amouLnts com-
pensating excess earnings at the end of the previous year (see paras 3.22,
3.29 and 7-11).
7.11      Net income for 1969 would be about M$N16 billion, equivalent to
a return of about 7.7% on the rate base, exceeding the permitted net income
in the concession by some M$N2.8 billion.   Sales and revenues in subsequent
years might increase faster than now estimated. Should higher revenues ma-
terialize, they would help postpone or limit the t-ariff increases that might
otherwise be needed on account of rising price levels.
7.12      The forecast coverages of interest by net income would be ample.
Net profits would increase from M$Nll.8 billion (US$33.6 million) in 1969
to M5tN15.2 billion (US$43.4 million) in 1972.
Future Financial Position
7.13      Annex 4 shows forecast balance sheets as at the end of each of
the years 1969 to 1972. TWh.ile the financing plan provides for new borrow-
ings of about US$166 million, the total debt, including current portion and
short-t-e.-. buank" credits, -woulAd on'ly increase by US$81U. million 'to US$'26i
million in the four years through 1972. The composition of the debt, how-
ever, would be sounder than a' aiy time in the past.   96% of the debt would
be long-term, with outstanding Bank loans of US$174.1 million representing
about 67%c of the 'otal.  hne current portion would be 7% of the debt, as
compared with 13% at the end of 1968.
7.14      Debt would be 28% of total canitalization (expressed in dollars -
see para 4.03) at the end of 1972, as compared with 24%o at the end of 1968,
which is low for a utility with a reasonably assured steady flow of earnings.
The increase in the debt component of the capitalization in the period is
small due to the factors pointed out above, and also to the rapid growth of
e'uity reflecting the small proportion of earnings paid out.
7.15      The forecasts provide for ample working capital.   This would
allow the assumed market issues to be delayed by a few months, if necessary,
to suit market conditions or the timing of the Government's own issues. All
existing financial covenants would be met with ample margins throughout the
period. By the end of 1972, and to the extent now foreseeable, SEGBA should
be in an optimum position to continue expanding without major assistance from
the Government and the Bank.

Up to 1967 the rapid depreciation of the peso was met by frequent rate
4ncreases of the order of 30% to 40e per annum, which were applied equally to
11 classes of consumers. The only change in the rate structure in the period
Twas the introduction of a reduced rate for night hour sales in 1965. As a
result of the change the average revenue per kwh for industrial consumers
(excluding sales taxes) became slightly lower than the average revenue per
lwh for res-dential consumers (Table 1 above).
In 1968, the Government allowed SEGBA to increase only the residential
rates by way of a new fixed charge (at present M$N95 per month for consumption
-up to 50 kwh a month and M$N190 per month for the rest).  This produced an
increase in the average revenue per kwh from residential consumers of about 142
t- N$N13.17 (Table 1), At the same time the average revenue per kwh from in-
dustrial consumers fell by about 3% to M$N11,20. Commercial rates have remained

Be  MARGINAL COST PRICING
A study of marginal cost pricing for the Greater Buenos Aires
system was made in 1967 by Alieto Guadagni of the'Instituto Torcuato
Di Telia", Buenos hires.   The material in this section has been put
together from Mr. Guadagni's report.
Load Patterns
Electric utilities have daily, weelkly and annual peaks in their sales of
electrical energy. Due to the random manner in which the consumers load can
be switched on, it is not possible to predict exactly when these peaks will
occur, particularly the annual peak,.
Daily load curves kept by SEGBA show the hourly rates of energy con-
3umptions for each 24 hour period in the year.    From these curves, load
patterns for the future can be predicted. Analysis shows that, for SEGBA,
the peak hour of loading might occur at any time between 5.30 pm and 9.30 pMI
and that the winter week-day load curve can be conveniently broken into three
semi-discrete periods:
peak 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm
night 9.30 to 7.00 am
day 7.00 am to 5.30 pm
The summer week-day is undergoing a transition due to the increase in
air conditioning load but the summer peak is still lower than the winter peak,
Summer weekdays can thus be conveniently divided into two periods:
night 1ll00 nm to 7.00 am
day    7.00 am to 11.00 pm

The system, peak load mnay occQur any week-day from abDout Mlay 20 to OctWber U&
This can be called the Winter season and the rest of the year the Summer season,
Corresponding to the levels oI demand there are levels in costs oI electricity
production,
Short Run Marginal Costs of Energy Production
These are basically the incremental energy costs i.e. the costs of
generating an additional increment of electrical energy at each level of
demand for electrical energy. They are made up of incremental fuel and
operating costs, Incremental fuel costs are continuously calculated in the
SEGBA central dispatching center because generating stations are called on to
give supplies in the order of increasing incremental energy costs.
Using a simple model developed for calculating the short run marginal
costs of production. the study arrives at the following figures at 1965 irmice
levels:

Night                           0,81                    0.90
;he incremental energy cost tso be cha-ged for each discrete period were
determined by taking a weighted average of the incremental costs corresponding
to each dilferent hour in that period.
Long Run Marginal Costs of Production Capacitv
At the time of the annual system peak, the marginal cost (i.e. the cost
of producing another kwh) is not limited to the cost of production of the
generating plant with the highest incremental energy cost which is brought into
operation last, Additional capacity (kw) to produce this energy is also re-
qaired, the fixed charges of which must be added to the incremental energy cost
at time of system peak. Should the additional capacity be other than peaking
type in nature then an allowance must be made for the savings possible to be
made off peak, in that the older plant on the system will operate less.
Spreading the net fixed charges over the hours of the year within which the
-:ystem peak might occur gives the following table:

Network Costs
Incremental load requires incremental network costs as well as incre-
mental production costs, Like the incremental production costs these have a
short-run (operating cost) and a long-run (capacity cost) aspect. That part
of the network which links together the generating stations by collective
transmission is best viewed as extending the facilities provided by the generatu-
ing stations. Its short-run marginal costs include incremental operating
costs and the costs of incremental transmission losses at various levels of
system demand. Its long-run marginal costs are the fixed, charges of extending
transmission capacity per kw of incremental demand spread over the peak hours
in a manner similar to those for generating capacity.
The determination of short-run and long-run marginal costs for the
distribution system is not easy in that it depends so much upon the un-
certainties of consumption of each customer. The capacity costs to be
covered can without much distortion be divided in proportion to the
customers' maximum demand at time of system peak.  In most cases in Argentina
'his can be taken as equal to the contracted demand. The capacitv costs of
extra distribution capacity is estimated at M$N404 per month per kw of con-
tracted demand. Adding this, the corresrndinr sho?t.-n (operating and
losses) costs and the incremental transmission costs to Table 4 gives
Table 5.

Besides indicating the proportionally high commercial rates, Table 7
indicates that more incentive should probably be given to off-peak sales for
commerce and small industry.
C. INCOME COST RATIOS
SEGBA has carried out an analysis of its incomes and costs for the year
1967 in order to attempt an allocation among rate classes of the total revenue
requirement under the concession.
Costs
The maximum demand on the SEGBA system was 1316 MWJ in 1967.  About
84 MW was consumed in the generating stations. From its records of system
operation SEGBA was able to calculate (a) the participation of each rate
class in the system peak demand and (b) the proportional use each rate class
made of the different parts of the network.
Technical costs of operation were apportioned to each rate class
according to the participation of the rate class in the peak. Depreciation
and the 8% financial return on net assets in operation were apportioned
according to the usage of   assets   by the rate class.  Commercial costs
and overheads were apportioned according to the use of personnel.
Income
The total revenues for 1967 in NTS for each rate class were used in
the calculation as income, Table 8 shows the income to cost ratio for each
rate class as calculated by the above method.

The imbalances shown in Table 8 have been rectified to some considerable
extent since 1967. For example, the average revenue per kwh from residential
sales increased by 14.8% in 1968 compared with an average increase of only
4,0% for all classes of sales.  Also in 1968 the average revenue per kwh from
both commercial and industrial sales decreased. There may, however, be room
fir further adjustment of imbalances.
D   GENERAL CORENTS
SEGBA should periodically carry out studies of the type shown in this
Pt -iex and also on the detailed structure of its rate classes. It should
boaisider restructuring rate number 5 to include loads of below 50 kw.
Besides a cost and revenue analysis the likely effect of rate changes on
consumers behavior should be studied e.go lowering commercial rates might
l:ad to little redistribution of load,

Notes on Ba lance Sheets
1.        SEGBA's accounts reflect historic costs.    Foreign exchange
iiabilities, however, are shown at current exchange rates.    The re-
sulting, partial, revaluation of assets is shown under "Exchange
difference" in Part 1, Historic peso values, of the tabulation.
Part  2    Df this ta',ulation shows SEGBA's balance sheets expressed in
dollars, on the basis of the dollar values actually used to determine
the level of power rates in accordance with the Concession. The effect
of this valuation of assets is reflected in a revaluation of equity
which is included in the corresponding values shown in Part 2 under
"Capital and Reserves, Total".
2.        SEGBA collects capital contributions from new customers (except
for residential service with an installed power of less than 2. kw
requiring extensions of up to 20 meters for underground cables and 100
rneters for overhead lines). The amount of these nontributionn is cal-
culated as the difference between the estimated total capital cost of
the necessary works and twice the estimated annnial revenuie to be deirive
from the customer. Such contributions are not repayable and are not
included in the rate baseA

3.        ifl line with the Governmen"ts policy of increasing the pro'uct,iul
of coal by Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF), and after consultation
w-ith the Bank, SEUGBA has agreed to increase its usage of coal from 151,000
tons in 1967 to about 745,000 tons in 1972.  Payment for coal will be on the
basis of tne cost of fuel oil having an equivalent heat content.   SEGBA will
purchase the equipment which is necessary to convert two boilers in its
Puerto Nuevo plant to coal firing and associated coal handling equipment,
with an estimated total cost of M$N3,382 million. This amount will be ex-
cluded from the tariff base, and will be partially financed as follows:
i. A ten year credit from Eximbank for US$3.1 million,
at 5-1/2% and foreign suppliers' credits totalling
M$N345 million equivalent, at interest rates between
6 and 8%, with maturities between five and six years.
ii. Ten year local suppliers' credits totalling M$N540
million with 8% interest.
The proposed arrangements for reimbursement of SEGBA by YCF are
as follows:
i. YCF will make Davments to SEGBA of M$N150 million
in 1969 and 1970, and M$N200 in 1971 and 1972.
ii. The balance of the cost of the equipment will be
reimbursed by making sinkinng fund payments over a
30-year period. YCF will pay interest at the rate
of R8% on the balance outstanding.

the Government has agreed to take all necessary
action to ensure prompt payment of amounts due to
SEGBA;
(c)  The item "Power supplied but not invoiced", M$N5
billion represents the estimated value of the
electricity consumed between the last meter reading
and December 31 (see Note 3 to Income Statements).
The amounts will be billed after the next reading
in January or February at the rates effective the
following year; because of SEGBAts bi-monthly meter
reading cycle they represent on the average one
monthts billings; and,
(d)  The item "Other Accounts Receivable", includes
an interest bearing short-term advance to Gas del
Estado of about M$Nleh billion which has been re-
paid in the first half of 1969.

SERVICIOS ELECTRICOS DEL GBAN BUENOS AIRES (SEGBA)
Notes cn Incom.e Statements
1.        Between the time of the first Bank loan in 1962 and 1967
substantial rate increases took place, primarily to compensate for
devaluations of the peso and cost increases (see Report No. TO-606a, Annex
3). The average revenue per kwh, excluding taxes, at the end of 1966 was
M$N 11.01 as compared with M$N 2.70 at the end of 1961. Increases of 7.3%
in 1967 and 4.0% in 1968 and a decrease of 6.1% in 1969 have taken place
as a result of the normal year end review of tariffs. The average revenues
per kwh in 1970, 1971 and 1972 were calculated so as to generate revenues
which would satisfy the requirements of the concession.
2.        These taxes, which are collected by SEGBA for the account of the
Federal, Provincial and Municipal authorities, consist of the following:
(a) A federal tax of 30 centavos (ctvs) per kwh. is used to
finance the National Fund for Electrical Energy (Law 15336
of September l. 1960).  An additional federal tax of 5%
on all sales to ultimate consumers, to finance the Chocon
hydroelectric project. was introduced by Law 16882 of May
19, 1966.  It became effective on January 1, 1969, (Law
1757h and Decree 8054 of Dece.mbpr 17- 1O68M
(b) Intil August. 31j 196(7j twjo i -tnypq on saleq in the Prnovinre
of Buenos Aires were used to finance DEBA, the Province's
(i)  Provincial LaZ 5880:  5 ctvs-,1-1h on residential and
20 ctvs/kwh on commercial, industrial and federal
industrial consumption (thus excluding residential).
Effective September 1, 1967 these two laws have been replaced
by   IJV L4I'.1 W..L.W f'7'. f of UU.ly 2- I , 1/967, w.LLichL in tar od UL C ed

(c) A  ax on sales Ln tLh Le cty- o Buenos Aires is co5 ecAe for
the Municipal budget. It was raised in 1966 to 1% for
residential, and 1) for commercial and industrial consumption.
3.        This adjustment is intended to report the revenues of the
fiscal year on the basis of consumption rather than billings. It
represents the difference between the estimated value oI energy billed

dur.ig the last part of the year, and tne correspondazg ,sttxmate at the end
of the previous year. The adjustment has not been projected in the fore-
cast for 1969 through 1972, since it would not materially affect the
forecasts.
4.        To compensate for the shortfall in revenues at the end of
1967 without a large tariff increase, tte Government providea SEGBA witn
a contribution of M$N 6,259 million.  This was paid through the National
Energy Fund during 1968 out of the proceeds of an increased tax on
gasoline.  The Bank agreed to this exceptional arrangement, which was
consistent with the stabilization program of the Government.
5.        In 1968, the total wage bill was M$N 26,282 million, of which
M$N 20,731 (79%) was charged to operations. M$N 18,350, which represent
the labor expenses of generation, distribution, maintenance and adminis-
tration, are shown under "Salaries, wages and social benefits". The
M$N 2,381 balance of wages charged to operations (labor expenses for
transportation, stores, etc.) is included in "Other expenses". A
wage increase of 8% for SEGBAIs personnel was authorized at the end of
1968. For the projections, it was assumed that there would be a transfer
of personnel from operations to construction, leading to a reduction in
wages charged to operation of 1.5% per annum. A further net annual re-
duction of 1.5% was assumed to be the result of SEGBA's rationalization
program. These reductions would offset the increase in the level of
wages due to seniority and promotion, estimated to be 3% per annum. No
increase in wage levels due to the cost of living was assumed, and any
increase would require a compensating rate adjustment.
6.        Fuel costs for 1969 are based upon the present average price
of M$N ,93 nper m-illion kiloca1ories, with an average heat rate of 2-800
Kcalories per kwh sent out.  An expected 10% increase in fuel prices
was assu.m.ed, effecjtive Janru,r  1 1070.
7.        Includes the cost of nower and enerszv bought from AvEE. CTAE
and others.  In 1968, SEGBA and CIAE operated under a central dispatching
arrangement which resulteAd in crpedit of MNN 121 mill in to SEflBA- which
supplied 88 Owh more than it received from CIAE.   In 1969, SEGBA expects
t,o purchase 430 r..h from AyEE at a cost of M$N 2 per ma  kwh and M$N 729
per kw per month; it will pay a charge of M$N 8,000 per kw per year
to rTAR on 19A Il. T. In the years 1070 +4-hv-.iigh 1072, i4t1 haQos a b Qr.smeid

6% on all sales except to railways and for public lighting, is set off
quarterly against the power bills of municipalities. The Provincial tax of 6>f.
on sales in the Province to the same categories of consumers as the Municipal
tax, is set off from time to time, by ad hoc arrangements, against the
Provincets power bills.
9.       Depreciation of utility plant in service is charged at one single
rate of 3%, applied to the dollar value of the aggregate plant, rather than at
different rates applying to the different classes of assets. Depreciation of
assets other than utility plant, which are also valued in dollars, and represee-A
together a relatively insignificant proportion of the fixed assets, is charged
at 10% for furniture and fixtures and 20% for automobiles, trucks, etc.
10.      Until 1968, SEGEA capitalized interest at the rate of 1% over the wor'.
in progress outstanding at year end. Starting 1968, this practice was changec
and interest is being capitalized at 8% of the average work in progress during
the year.
11.      The statutes of December 29. 1961. call for the following appropria-
tions of profits:
a. 2% to the Legal Reserve, until it reaches 10% of the
share canital: the corresnonding apnropriations are
included in the item "Reserves and surplus" in the

reflected in the Balance Sheet for the year to which they apply.
12.      The Government, as shareholder, granted personnel a share in the pruT.:s
of fiscal year 1967, which ranged from 17% to 119% of one month's wages (pl s
0.2% to 1.4% for each year of seniority) according to the employee's positi.cz   -
a five point rating scale. The Boord has not yet decLded how the M$$N 1,3,f.
million bonus for fiscal year 1968 will be distributed.
13.      Dividends have been paid in stock:   on preferred shares, at
s% 'very year, and on common shares, at 2CZ fcr 1967 and 357 ,r L9k5.

fL has been assumed that stock dividends at 10% on common shares would
c3 paid in the future, together with cash dividends on preferred shares,
.. 5%, and on common shares at 8%.
14.       This net income represents the sum of:
(a)  the amount of net income necessary to achieve in the current
fiscal year the required return of 8% on the net dollar
value of utility plant in service, plus notional working
capital of 5% of such value; and
(b)  the amount by which the actual net income of the previous
year exceeded or fell short of the required net income, which
amount should be compensated fully out of the current yearts
revenues.
15.       The return is calculated in accordance with the concession.

planied for connection by 1972 after which date few should r-(--
main unelectrified. The barrios vary in size ranging from
20 houses to over 500. All barrios must be reasonably compact
in area to qualify for connection. The small barrios (50
houses and under) tend to be within a defined compact area
normally with little room for expansion. All households tend
to become customers immediately in that the unit is compact
enough for all to want the same level of facilities. They de
not contain apartment houses and little sub-letting takes
place; thus each house has one connection and one meter. The
larger barrios of 250 houses and over show varying degrees o1
dispersion. All households do not become customers immediate!>-
Some sub-letting takes place giving rise to multiple-service
connections.
(ii) Sales
The average sales per month per residential consumer includirv-
those in barrios is just over 100 kwh.   Since 1964, the averCtw
growth per residential consumer has been under 2% per annum,
In 1968 the average consumer within established barrios uscz
about 70 kwh per month. However, when a barrio is first corn-
nected average consumption is normally lower, say 50 kwh per
month and this may double in about 25 years.






(iii)  Maximum Demand - Capacity Requirements
Residential sales are about 50c of SEGBA's total sales. Also
the time of the residential peak is not greatly different from
the time of the system peak. The maximum demands, for which
system capacity has to be provided from generation to the feed
point on the distribution system, can thus be estimated by us-
ing a typical load factor (say 25X) for barrio loads. This
gives maximum demand figures of about 0.20 kw per consumer at
time of first connection to double this in about 25 years.
(iv) Direct Costs of System Extension
The direct capital costs of extending serwrice to a barrio
consist of extending a medium voltage (13.2 kv) distribution
line to a step down transformer and erecting low voltage over-
head distribution lines within the barrio from which individuai
house-connection are made. In order to qualify for service
from SEGBA a barrio must collectively agree to finance directI.:f.
about half of the capital costs of the distribution assets jues,
described. In practice, SEGBA provides at its expense the
13.2 kv line extension, the step down transformer, the low
voltage distribution conductors and the house connections.
Barrio residents are required to pay directly for the low
voltage Doles and insulators and the erection of the low volt-
age lines. SEGBA has established this requirement primarily
to minimize its own canital investment. One result is that
SEGBA's rate base includes only that part of the capital cost
which is financed by SGBA itself'.  This obvious1y resu-lts in
savings to barrio customers on their electricity rates (cross
subsidization would oniv transfer the burden to other con-
sumers). These savings may be thought of as a 'cash flow"r
which justifies their nwn private investment. in the proient.
The US$ 100 (approx.) per barrio customer of consumer-provided
capital costs is financed in a variety of ways, often by
borrowing all or part of the sum. Barrio residents would not
he willin,g to incur such costs if they did not value electrici'r
service sufficiently to make their private investment "pay".
The minimulm benefit that ,,ust;4ies the U$ 100 of private in-
vestment is the saving (i.e. cash flow) in electricity rates

(v) Generation, Transmission and Primary Distribution
Incremental Investment Costs
The cost of extending supplies to a barrio must include an
appropriate portion of the cost of generation, transmission
and distribution facilities required to supply. transmit and
distribute the power to be utilized during the economic life
of the works covered by the direct extension costs i.e.3
25 years. Each incremental kw of demand by the barrios at
time of system peak reauires an increment of capacity in gene-
ration, transmission and primary distribution. The appropritc.
generation capacity cost is that of the m rnginal nlant in any
year (i.e. the generating plant which would not be installed
if the maximum demand Y7rp 1 kw lesst);  This r-2npaitv rn.st is

the residential load is a large proportion of the total load,
the total barrio load is only a small percentage of this.
Furthermore, although the residential load has been growing
at auuut fv per annum, the basic reason is because of new
connections. These facts plus the nature of the network
structure (a radial network) for future years, indicates thai:
only about 10% of the estimated average trend of expenditure
over future years per kw of demand should be attributed to
the barrio load.
(vi) Revenues
Barrios are charged by SEGBA according to Rate No. 1. The
level of this tariff and its components (fixed and kwh charge),
have been taken to be constant throughout the period considet c,.o
up to l995 because inflat±6n has been ignored in these cal-
culations (they are done at constant value) and the rectific:-
tion of any imbalances in the rate structure over future ye,r-
will have the tendency (if anything) to increase residential.
rates. The latter are therefore unlikely to be lower than at,
present.  From the point of view of cash flow to the economy
as a whole, the annual gross revenue from a barrio is equal
to (a) the annual kwh sales multiplied by the rate nlus (b)
the sales taxes (see Annex 6, page 2, note 2).   Annual net

revenue (i.e. cash flow) is equal to the annual gross re-

providing the exploitation of the resources in question.
(vii)  Operating Expenses
Operating expenses include the incremental costs of operation
applcable to supplying the barrios in three broad categories
(a) incremental fuel cost for the additional kwh (b) incremenrtel
operation and maintenance costs (c) incremental overheads:
ka)  The average cost of fuel per kwnh delivered to the
consumer's premises in 1968 was about M$N 1.56. The
average marginal cost of production over that part of the
load curve occupied by the barrio load, i.e. next to the
system peak, is about 20%o to 302, higher. Allowing for
this gives a figure of about I$N 1.90 per kwh for the
incremental f-uel cost to be charged to the barrio con-
sumption.  The effect of hydro energy during the peak
period in the late 1970's can be expected to lower this
figure to (say) 4s. 1.80 by about 1985.
(b) An examination has been made in some detail of the 1967
operating and maintenance costs. Treating them all as
kwh related costs gives a figure of !$N 2.90 per kwh
delivered to the consumer excluding depreciation. It
seems likely that, at worst, a slow rise will take place,
indicating a figure of about M$N 3.30 per kwh delivered
for operating costs in 1980 and about M$N 3.60 in 1990.
It could be argued that this over states the magnitude W
the operating costs in that it malces no division betwean
fixed operating costs (independent of kwh delivered) arO0
variable operating costs    (proportional to kwh delive-r-!c..)
The SEGBA accounts make an accurate division of operat. -
ing costs into components difficult.  Also a quick chec'kC
indicates that no great distortion seems likely to be ir.-
troduced bv taking all operating costs as kwh related.
(c)  A detailed analysis of overheads for 1967. together witl.
an allocation per class of overheads to residential
supplies. gives a figure of about MAN 3 ner kwh delivere&;
at residential consumers' premises. However, at least
half of this m-ut hp regardie 2S !tfijYp  in the sense
that it is independent of sales.  A figure of I$N 1.5

3.        The incremental rate of return of a representative smaii. type
of barrio (50 houses) is calculated to be 11%.   The return for a representatixve
large type of barrio (500 houses) is calculated to be 18%. These figur2s
apply to barrios under average conditions e.g. with respect to di.stance
from the nearest 13.2 kv distribution line, compactness of barrio, complexity
of transformer mounting, etc.
4.        Because barrio electrification is judged likely to be one of the
marginal parts of the project, i.e. likely to earn one of the lowest in-
cremental rates of return among the various parts of the project, then the
rate of return on the whole project is likely to be higher than 185.
