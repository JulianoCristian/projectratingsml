Investment in generating capacity will be\n            relatively small. The project thus marks SEGBA's\n            transformation from a utility supplying primarily\n            self-generated electricity to a distributor of large amounts\n            of energy generated by others outside the metropolitan area.\n            The proposed loan would cover (a) the cost of certain\n            equipment and material purchased abroad and 60 percent of\n            the cost of certain equipment and materials purchased in\n            Argentine, (b) the estimated foreign exchange content of the\n            cost of civil works and equipment erection, (c) the foreign\n            cost of consulting services, (d) interest during\n            construction and (e) contingencies."}, "docdt": "1969-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
