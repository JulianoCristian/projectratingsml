"The overall program development\n            objective of the Mexico Strengthening the Business\n            Environment for Enhanced Economic Growth Development Policy\n            Loan is to support economic policies that will strengthen\n            Mexico\u00b4s business environment and the micro-economic\n            foundations for enhanced economic growth and employment\n            generation. This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening the\n            conditions for competition in crucial markets, in particular\n            the telecommunications sector and public procurement; (ii)\n            streamlining business regulations that will lower trade and\n            other transactions costs and facilitate the adoption of new\n            technologies; (iii) improving the regulatory framework to\n            foster financial sector access, stability and market\n            transparency; and (iv) promoting public-private partnerships\n            in infrastructure to expand core infrastructure services\n            essential to the productivity of Mexican firms. The four\n            pillars are mutually reinforcing. Improving\n            telecommunication services is critical to support mobile\n            banking operations so as to expand access to finance and to\n            build the e-platform necessary to modernize business\n            regulations and public procurement. The streamlining of\n            business regulations together with the expansion of\n            infrastructure through greater private participation will\n            help reduce logistics costs of Mexican firms increasing\n            their competitiveness and facilitating their access to new\n            export markets. Modern business regulations and greater\n            access to finance will increase the incentives of becoming\n            formal, the former by reducing the costs of formality and\n            the latter by making it easier to exploit its benefits."}, "docdt": "2010-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
