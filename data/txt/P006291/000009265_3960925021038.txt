BRAZIL
SIXTH HIGHWAY PRWJECT (LOAN 1557-BR)
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on Brazil's Sixth
Highway Project, for which a loan in the amount of US$114.0 million was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 8, 1978. The loan account was
closed on January 31, 1986, about three years later than the appraisal
schedule envisaged. Loan funds amounting to US$9.8 million were cancelled.
The Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office and is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, staff project
appraisal and supervision reports, consultants' final reports, reports
prepared by the DNER and the State of Parana Roads Department (DER-PA), and
the Completion Report on the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR). The
Project Completion Report was sent to the Borrower, and their comments have
been annexed to the report as well as reflected in its text.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1557-BR)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was successful in achieving its principal objectives of
rehabilitating 2,530 km of important road links in Brazil; improving the
maintenance capabilities of the Highway Administration of the State of Parana
(DER-PR); developing criteria and norms for pavement evaluation and design
under Brazilian conditions, and helping the Federal Highway Administration
(DNER) in 'ts efforts to control axle-load limits at a cost below appraisal
estimates (para 7.01). The objective of increasing the efficiency in road
maintenance through the delegation of that task to the states, was only
partially achieved, because changing circumstances caused a revision of the
program (paras 6.01 through 6.07).
During the first eighteen months following loan effectiveness,
project implementation was relatively problem-free. However, starting in
1979, the Brazilian inflation rate experienced a dramatic acceleration which,
coupled with the Government measures to control public expenditures, resulted
in DNER's severe financial crisis (para 6.06). In mid-1980, DNER had to stop
all contracted work, and project implementation came to a standstill. For the
next year and a half, DNER worked on reformulating the project (para 3.01).
The reformulated project was based upon a reassessment of priorities
within DNER's road rehabilitation program and entailed Bank financing of a
time slice of all DNER's road rehabilitation ectivities. As a result, the
length of roads rehabilitated under the loan was substantially increased
(para 3.05). The rehabilitation of five road sections totalling 135 km, not
an original project item, was also included in DER-PR's program (para 3.13)
while the acquisition of maintenance equipment was scaled down (para 3.10).
The net increase of the physical works financed under the project
was possible because the large devaluation of the cruzeiro in 1979 reduced
significantly the costs of the project expressed in US dollars. However, a
further loss of value of the cruzeiro continued to erode the Bank's
participation in project financing and to slow down the disbursement of loan
funds. The Bank took a series of measures to restore its participation to the
initial levels and to accelerate disbursements. These included: (i) the
opening of a special account in the Brazilian Central Bank to reduce the time
lags between the dates when eligible expenditures were made and withdrawal
applications presented to the Bank; and (ii) the implementation, starting in
late 1983, of a Special Action Program which, inter alia, increased the Bank's
participation from 36% for civil works and 40% for maintenance facilities and
equipment, to 65% for both.



-v -
The technical assistance financed under the loan effectively
addressed the institution-building objectives of the project. As a result,
DER-PR experienced a substantial improvement in its organization as well as in
its planning, costing controlling and training capabilities. The agency was
reorganized under the program, and management was decentralized. The physical
maintenance capability was also expanded to accommodate the delegated roads.
The fact that delegation did not take place to the extent originally envisaged
did not result in excess capacity since the State of Parana's own paved road
network expanded from about 10,800 ktm in 1978 to about 13,100 km in 1984
(para 6.08).
The Phase II Weighing Station Program financed under the project was
revised during project reformulation to include the construction of 29
weighing stations. The implementation of this component was to start after
the completion of construction work on 44 stations financed under the Fifth
HI.ghway Project. However, because of delays in completing the program under
that project, construction start was postponed until early 1984 and, by the
loan closing date, only 15 stations had been completed. Thus, about US$6.4
million of loan funds allocated to this category were cancelled. DNER is
continuing the work on the stations with its own resources,
The project was very similar in terms of objectives and design to
the Fifth Highway Project. However, because the project was appraised when
its predecessor was at an early stage of implementation, its design was only
marginally influenced by the experience gained under the previous project.
Since in retrospect, both projects suffered from the same weaknesses, the
Project Completion Report offers the following lesson:  Bank support of
important institutional changes (i.e. delegation of road maintenance to the
states) and/or substantial investments (i.e. the weighing station program)
should be made only on the basis of a thorough assessment of possible
alternative policies and instruments. When such an assessment requires the
implementation of a pilot project, its experimental character should be made
explicit, and the criteria and resources to evaluate the results before
engaging in a similar operation should be available.



BRAZIL
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1557-BR)
PROJECT COMPLETIO REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Brazil's rapid economic growth throughout the 1960s and the 1970s,
including the development of widely spread agricultural and mineral resources
and the geographically concentrated industrial base, led to unprecedent
increases in transport needs and a rapid expansion of the transport
infrastructure. This expansion was partially financed by Bank loans
totalling US$1.6 billion for seven highway projects, three secondary and
feeder road projects, a port project, th,ree railway projects and a highway
project to support the Northwest Region Development Program.
1.02      Until 1973-1974, the largest share of the Federal investments in
transport was directed to the construction and paving of a network of primary
highways. The sudden increase in petroleum prices led the Government to put
more emphasis upon the development of rail and water transport. Construction
of the highway network slowed down considerably, and attention shifted toward
maintenance of the existing infrastructure,
1.03      In t1.e early 1970s, the Brazilian Government initiated measures
aimed at phasing out duplication of equipment, facilities and personnel by
the giadual transfer of maintenance activities from the Federal Highway
Department's (DNER) State Districts (DRFs) to the highway departments of the
States (DERs). However, the program of delegation did not keep pace with the
rapidly increasing maintenance requirements of the Federal network. One
reason was that the DERs lacked the necessary capabilities to absorb
delegation on a large scale; another reason was that the program was being
hindered by a substantial part of the network to be delegated having already
reached a stage of deterioration in which maintenance was no longer an
economic alternative. Thus, the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR;
January 17, 1975; US$103.9 million) supported the policy of increasing
delegation by financing a program for strengthening the state highway
departments of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, and feasibility studies
and engineering for road rehabilitation. The Sixth Highway Project, subject
of this report, was designed to continue the efforts started under the Fifth
Highway project in this respect, by strengthening the road maintenance
capability of the Roads Department of the State of Parana (DER-PA).
1.04      This Completion Report is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, staff project
appraisal and supervision reports, consultants' final reports, and reports
prepared by the DNER and the State of Parana Roads Department (DER-PA).
Also, because the Fifth Highway Project shared with the subject project
similar institutional objectives, this report draws heavily on the completion
report for Loan 1075-BR, issued on Nay 8, 1985.

I1. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Brazilian Second National Development Plan (1975-1979) outlined
the Government's policy for protecting past investments in the Federal
highway network by: (a) rehabilitating roads in poor condition;
(b) improving maintenance of state and Federal highways; (c) reducing the
damaging effects of tihe overloading of trucks; and (d) providing a
concentrated effort in research applied to the development of pavement design
standards applicable to Brazilian conditions.
2.02      The project was designed to support the Government's objectives
through four separate but interrelated programs comprising:
(a)  Engineering and civil works for rehabilitation of paved Federal
highways, and development of a pavement management system for
planning, programming and engineering of pavement resealing,
strengthening, and rehabilitation;
(b) Restructuring and strengthening the road maintenance organization
and functions of the Maintenance Directorate of Parana's State
Roads Department (DER-PR) in order to provide an efficient
organization capable of maintaining all state and Federal highways
in Pararia;
(c) Construction and installation of about 32 weighing stations needed
to complete the program begun under the Fifth Highway Project to
provide a basic coverage of vehicle weight control over Brazil's
Federal highway system; and
(d)  Extension of an ongoing UNDP-GEIPOT/DNER research study on the
interrelationship among transport costs, highway design and
maintenance standards, and implementation of a new program under
DNER's Road Research Institute (IPR) for review and development of
criteria and norms for pavement evaluation and design under
Brazilian conditions, in order to determine timing, structural
types, and thicknesses for asphalt pavement strengthening.
2.03      The selection of the 1,509 km of Federal highways to be
rehabilitated under the project, was based upon engineering and feasibility
studies carried out by Brazilian consultants and partially financed under the
Fifth Highway Project. The studies to support the Road Maintenance Program
for the State of Parana were also prepared by Brazilian consultants.
2.04      The project was appraised in November 1977 and negotiations were
conducted in Washington between March 13 and March 17, 1978. A loan
amounting to US$114.0 million was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on April 27, 1978. The approved project elements and their
estimated costs, as given in the appraisal report, are shown on the following
page.
2.05      Implementation of the project was expected to take four years
(1978-1982), and the loan closing date was set for December 31, 1982.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   General
3.01      During the first eighteen months following loan effectiveness,
project implementation was relatively problem-free, albeit with some delays.
However, starting in 1979, the Brazilian inflation rate experienced a
dramatic acceleration which, coupled with the Government's measures to
control public expenditures, resulted in DNER's severe financial crisis
(para 6.06). In mid-1980, DNER had to stop all contracted work, and project
implementation came to a standstill. For the next year and a half, DNER
worked on reformulating the project assisted, in part, by a Bank-financed
consultant. 1/
3.02      The reformulated project was based upon a reassessment of
priorities within DNEV's road rehabilitation program and entailed Bank
financing of a time slice of all DNER's road rehabilitation activities. As a
result, the length of roads to be rehabilitated under the loan was
substantially increased (para 3.05). The rehabilita,tion of five road
sections totalling 135 km, not an original project item, was also included in
DER-PR's program (para 3.13) while the acquisition of maintenance equipment
was soaled down (para 3.10),
3.03      The net increase of the physical works financed under the project
was possible because costs expressed in US dollars were reduced significantly
due to the large devaluation of the cruzeiro in 1979. However, a further
loss of value of the cruzeiro, together with the time lags between the dates
when eligible expenditures were made and withdrawal applications presented to
the Bank, continued to erode the Bank's participation in the financing of the
project and to slow down the disbursement of loan funds. The Bank took a
series of measures to restore its participation to the initial levels and to
accelerate disbursements. These included: (i) the opening of a special
account in the Brazilian Central Bank to reduce the above time lag and to
eliminate the corresponding foreign exchange loss; and (ii) the Bank's
approval on October 1, 1983 of a Special Action Program which, inter alia,
increased the Bank's participation from 36% for civil works and 40% for
maintenance facilities and equipment, to 65% for both. These steps
substantially improved the rate of disbursements; in addition, in 1984 the
scope of DNER's and Parana's road rehabilitation programs financed under the
project was again revised to include additional sections of roads in urgent
need of rehabilitation (paras 3.05 and 3,11).
B. Highway Rehabilitation Program
(i) Civil Works
3.04      This project element consisted initially in the rehabilitation of
about 1,358 km of Federal roads. Construction work was divided into 26 lots
I/ While the reformulation of the project was completed by the end of 1981,
the loan amendment was formalized only in late 1982, once the Bank had
received assurances that DNER had allocated in its 1983 budget sufficient
funds to continue the project.



to be contracted in two groups. Evaluation of the bids and contract
preparation were slow because of the large number of bids received, and work
started about ten months later than scheduled at appraisal. Progress was
satisfactory until July 1980, when DNER issued instructions to stop all work
because of the severe deterioration of its financial situation (para 6.06).
3.05      Work was resumed in mid-1981 at a very slow pace because of DNER's
lack of funds, a problem that prevailed throughout 1982. Meanwhile, the
project was reformulated and a third group of roads (970 km) was added to the
rehabilitation program, increasing the scope of work from 1,358 km to
2,328 km. In May 1984, DNER and the Bank agreed to include under the project
the rehabilitation of a further 202 km of roads and emergency works at 31
locations blocked or damaged by landslides due to exceptionally heavy
rainfalls.
3.06      Works were completed in mid-1985.  A total of 2,530 km of roads
were rehabilitated under the project at a cost of US$164.1 million (US$64,860
per km). The appraisal envisaged the rehabilitation of 1,509 km at a total
cost of US$219.7 million including contingencies (US$146,000 per km). The
lower cost per km expressed in US dollar terms is mostly explained by the
significantly devalued cruzeiro. In addition, after project reformulation,
DNER implemented stricter control over engineering design and concentrated on
essential improvements.
(ii) Detailed Engineering for Road Rehabilitation
3.07      The project included the preparation of detailed engineering for
the rehabilitation of about 3,000 km of roads. Work on the first
group, comprising 1,050 km, was carried out by 14 Brazilian firms and
satisfactorily completed by mid-1981. Engineering for the remaining roads
was postponed because of DNER's financial crisis; the contracting process was
only resumed in late 1983. However, cost savings also permitted an increase
in the scope of engineering work, and this project component eventually
financed the detailed engineering for 3,490.5 km of roads. These designs
served as the basis for the expanded rehabilitation program financed by the
project, and for work being performed under the ongoing Federal Highway
Sector Project. Total cost of this project component was US$6.3 million.
C. Highway Maintenance Delegation Program (Parana)
(i) Legal Framework
3.08      In addition to the financing of the rehabilitation of
infrastructure, procurement of equipment, and technical assistance, the Bank
supported the reorganization of DER-PR's Miintenance Directorate. In
compliance with the Project Agreement, the Government of the State of Parana
provided the legal framework for DER-PR's reorganization in early 1979. This
included legislation for the establishment of the organizational framework
of, and the issue of internal regulations for, the Maintenance Directorate.
The Directorate's organization comprised five Regional Maintenance Centers,
the Maintenance Support Division, the Equipment Division and the Highway
Safety Division. The Regional Centers, in particular, constituted DER-PR's



-6-
functional units in charge of maintenance activities, through their 18
subordinate districts. The centers were given a high degree of executive
autonomy. Each center overviews a group of nuclei consisting of workers,
equipment, materials and all the necessary support for carrying out
maintenance operations. Each nucleus has responsibility over about
100/150 km of roads. The increase in the level of decentralization in
executing maintenance activities within the State, has effectively improved
the operations of the Maintenance Directorate.
(ii) Civil Works
3.09      The project financed civil works for the construction or
improvement of facilities for the regional centers, districts and maintenance
nuclei, as well as the installation of traffic control stations in Curitiba.
This project component was completed in mid-1983 at a total cost of US$5.2
million.
(iii)  Procurement of Maintenance Equipment, Vehicles)and Equipment for
Offices and Field Depots
3.10      This project element was substantially reduced during the
reformulation of the Maintenance Program in 1982, on the basis of an analysis
made by the technical assistance consultants who concluded that DER-PR
equipment needs had been overestimated at appraisal. Thus, the acquisition
program was scaled down to 300 units, from the 750 originally programmed.
The total cost of this project element was US$3.73 million.
(iv) Technical Assistance and Training
3.11      DER-PR contracted with a joint venture of Brazilian and US firms
the technical assistance to help DER-PR's maintenance directorate in the
implementation of the Highway Maintenance Program in Parana. The 36-month
(US$1.86 million) contract started in July 1979 and was completed in December
1982, after a six-month extension. During the course of their assignment,
the consultants developed and implemented a maintenance management system
suitable for DER-PR's needs. Although the consultant's task was hampered by
a lack of adequate counterpart staff, brought about by Parana's low civil
service salaries, they were successful in transferring their know-how to key
professionals who still remain in their jobs. As a result, the system, six
years after its initial implementation, is still being used as the main tool
for the planning of maintenance operations.
3.12      With the assistance of the consultants, DER-PR prepared in February
1981 a Plan of Action for personnel training which covered: (i) training
policy; (ii) establishment of a Training Center 2/ for the Maintenance
Department; (iii) Mechanical and Roads Production T :aining Units;
(iv) physical and financial resources required for the implementation of
short- and long-term training; and (v) annual training programs.
2/ DER-PR already had a training unit, albeit poorly equipped and operating
in near obscurity. The action described conferred official status on it
within DER-PR's organizational structure.



- 7 -
Implementation of these programs was slow, and the actual training provided
was consistently below the planned performance criteria, The reasons for the
less-than-satisfactory results relate to the delays in making the Training
Center operational and a chronic shortage of instructors. Nevertheless, a
substantial number of employees (about 250 per year) was trained during the
project implementation period.
(v) Road Rehabilitation
3.13      At the ,ime of project reformulation, five road sections totalling
135 km were included in DER-PR's Bank-financed program. In 1983, the total
length of roads to be rehabilitated under this project component was
increased to 235.5 km. Works were completed in mid-1985 at a total cost of
US$24.2 million or about US$103,000 per km.
3.14      In compliance with the Project Agreement, DER-PR prepared a project
completion report assessing the achievements of the project. The report also
includes an opinion survey of DER-PR's professional staff on the technical
assistance and training financed under the loan. The general view conveyed
by the report is that the implementation of the Maintenance Program,
especially the reorganization of DER-PR and the implementation of the
maintEnance management system, had a substantial impact on the improvement of
maintenance operations in Parana. The report gives credit for the success of
this project element to the excellent working relationship that developed
between the local consultants and the counterpart staff. Regarding the
training component, the report concluded that, while the quality and quantity
of courses for managerial-level staff were adequate, there was a need to
improve the training of operational personnel. In particular, more
practical, on-the-job training was needed for lower-skill wolkers.
D.   Highway Research Program
3.15      The loan provided funds for a one-year extension of an ongoing
GEIPOT/DNER study on the interrelationship between highway design,
maintenance, and vehicle operating costs. The study, started in September
1975, employed a team of about 150 persons, ten of whom were expatriates
provided through a US-based private research institution. Completion of the
study took place in early 1982, about a year later than scheduled. The study
resulted in the empirical derivation of the functional relationships forming
the basis for the application of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Model (HDM) to Brazilian conditions. The Brazilian experience greatly
assisted the Bank in giving final shape to the HDM model. The model has
become a valuable tool for maintenance planning and is being widely used
throughout the world.
3.16      Another study, the Pavement Research Program, also financed under
the loan, was carried out by DNER's Highway Research Institute (IPR) with the
main objective of recommending a procedure adapted to Brazilian conditions
for flexible pavement overlay design. The nation-wide data collection phase
of the program started in May 1979 under a 28-month contract between IPR and
a Brazilian consulting firm, in association with a U.S.-based consulting firm
who were also the coordinators of the regional studies. Regional research,



-8-
which started in September 1979, was carried out by three Brazilian
consultants.
3.17      The research program progressed at a slower rate than scheduled at
appraisal because of delays in equipment acquisition, In the implementation
of DNER's highway rehabilitation works which included test sections, and
difficulties in finding road segments with suitable characteristics for
research. The study was halted in February 1981 because of DNER's financial
difficulties, but was reactivated in July 1981. IPR had to extend the
consultants' contracts twice. A final report on the improved methods for
pavement evaluation and design was released in late 1984. The study, based
upon field experiments and analyses, including the use of data from the
GEIPOT/DNER study, resulted in a new design code for pavement overlays and
surface treatment, based upon methodologies developed for pavement evaluation
and prediction of pavement performance.
E.  Weighing Station Program (Phase II)
3.18      At the time of project appraisal, the Weighing Station Program
included the acquisltion and installation of 127 scales and construction of
an equal number of stations, of which 95 were to be financed under the Fifth
Highway Project and 32 under the Sixth Highway Project. During project
reformulation, the orogram was reviewed taking into account DNER's shortage
of funds, uncertainties regarding the effect of extensive axle-weight
controls on total transport costs, and changes in traffic patterns caused by
the energy crisis. The program was therefore reduced to 73 stations, of
which 44 were to be constructed under the Fifth Highway Project and 29 under
the subject project. No scales were to be purchased under the loan as all 73
units required had been purchased under the Fifth Highway Project.
3,19      The implementation of this project component was to start after the
completion of construction work on the 44 stations financed under the Fifth
Highway Project. Substantial delays in completing the program under that
project kept forcing postponement of the start of the work under the Sixth
Project. Construction of the weighing stations finally commenced in early
1984. By the loan closing date of December 31, 1985, the program was
incomplete. DNER requested a further six-month extension of the Loan, in
addition to the two-and-one-half years' extension that had already been
agreed. The Bank did not agree to grant a further extension, on the grounds
that at the end of the extended period only four of the remaining 14 weighing
stations could have been completed. Thus, about US$6.4 million of loan funds
allocated to this category were cancelled. DNER is continuing the work on
the stations with its own resources. At the time of writing this report,
civil works were being implemented in six of the remaining 14 weighing
stations.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison between appraisal estimates and final costs is shown
in Table 1. However, as already explained in Chapter III, the project was



- 9 -
completely reformulated during implementation. Therefore, the costs for some
project elements are not readily comparable. The final cost of the project
was US$228.8 million, 27% below the appraisal estimate of US$312.0 million.
4.02      The cost figures presented in this report must be qualified.  Until
1980, cost estimates were a reasonable basis for project cost control and
Bank disbursement estimates. After that date, however, because of DNER
financial difficulties, payments to contractors were substantially delayed.
Also, major divergencies between inflation and the rate of devaluation of the
Brazilian cruzeiro occurred during the implementation period of most
contracts. These factors distorted the project cost. No adjustments were
made to the contractors' invoices, expressed in Cruzeiros, during the period
between their presentation by the contractors and their certification by DNER
and DER-PR for disbursement by the Bank. In dollar terms, therefore, the
costs at the time of presentation of the invoices by the contractors, were
substantially higher in US dollar terms than the actual amounts disbursed by
the Bank in foreign currencies. Because a criterion was not established to
determine the 'true' measure of project costs expressed in dollar terms,
there could be discrepancies among the figures appearing in supervision
reports vis-&-vis DNER and DER-PR reports.  For the puipose of this document,
costs are based upon DNER's project completion report.-/
4.03      As seen in Table 2, disbursements lagged behind appraisal
estimates. The main reasons for the lag were: (a) a slow start of
implementation of the project; (b) interruption of work due to inadequate
counterpart funds; (c) a substantial devaluation of the local currency; and
(d) excessive delays in the submission of disbursement requests to the
Bank.4/
4.04      Loan funds were reallocated three times (Table 3) in order to
accommodate revisions in DER-PR's maintenance program such as the reduction
of equipment acquisition and the inclusion of a road rehabilitation
component, the changes in the weighing station program, and the increased
participation of the Bank in IPR's research program. The disbursement
percentage for civil works were Increased from 36X to 652 in order to
reverse the erosion of Bank participation in project financing brought about
by the devaluation of the cruzeiro. The loan account was closed on
January 31, 1986, about three years later than the appraisal schedule
envisaged. Loan funds amounting to US$9,841,977.26 were cancelled.
3| The Borrower, in its comments, points out that DNER always had two
systems to register project costs: the first one based upon the dollar
value of the contractors' proposals at the time the proposals were made
and, the second one corresponding to the dollar value at the time of Bank
disbursements. These measures of project costs, however, may not
coincide with those reported by DER-Parana (Annex 1).
4/ The Borrower has two comments on this paragraph: (i) the Interruption of
work was also due to delays in payment of contractors' invoices; and
(11) the main reason for the delays in the submission of disbursement
requests was also the delay in paying the contractors (Annex 1).

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The appraisal of the project included an economic analysis of the
highway construction and upgrading works, the maintenance program in the
State of Parana and the installation of weigh bridges for axle-load
control. What follows is an economic reevaluation of the highway
construction and upgrading program and of the major investments carried out
under the maintenance program in the State of Parana. Regarding the
weighing stations program, DNER carried out an economic reevaluation.
However, the study does not fully capture the complexity of the type of
analysis required in order to obtain reliable results. The Bank has
requested, and DNER agreed, to undertake an in-depth evaluation of the
program and its related costs and benefits, including the impact of
axle-load controls on total transport costs.
Road Rehabilitation
5.02      The economic reevaluation of the road works was carried out by
DNER following a methodology agreed with the Bank during the preparation of
the Federal Highways Sector Project and based upon the quantification of net
savings in vehicle operating and infrastructure costs. The ex-post analysis
was performed with the use of the HDM-III model on a substantive sample of
Group I roads and roads in Groups II and III. No ex-ante or ex-post
evaluations were performed on the fourth group of roads (202 km) which
represented only about 8% of the total length of the Federal highway
rehabilitation program financed under the project.5/
5.03      The economic reevaluation confirms the economic merit of the road
rehabilitation carried out under the project and the higb rates of return
usually associated with this type of work on arterial rc.ds carrying high
volumes of traffic.  Tables 4 through 6 summarize the reh lts of the
reevaluation exercise and compare it with the original exoectatlons. As
shown in the tables, the economic reevaluation yielded economic rates of
return which, with few exceptions, exceed those originally estimated. The
difference in rates of return is largely explained by the rapid devaluation
of the cruzeiro, which resulted in the final economic costs of the works
being substantially below original expectations. However, the different
methodologies used in both analyses also introduce variations in the
results. (The ex-post evaluation was carried out using road conditions and
associated vehicle operating costs that are specific rather than aggregated
at the network level.)
Road Maintenance Program in Parana
5.04      The major physical work under this category was the rehabilitation
of eight road sections totalling 235.5 km. As mentioned in Chapter III,
this work was not part of the originally appraised project; therefore, the
results of the ex-post economic analysis are compared with the economic
returns estimated at the time the investments were evaluated for possible
Bank financing.
5/ The Borrower points out that there was an economic evaluation of the
resealing works in the fourth group of roads (Annex 1).



- 11 -
5.05      Both the ex-ante and ex-post evaluations were carried out by
DER-PR using a methodology which quantifies the benefits derived from
savings in vehicle operating costs due to improved road surface conditions.
The results of the analysis, presented in Table 7, confirm  the economic
viability of tie investments although with returns below those originally
expected. The main reason for these lower returns is that traffic growth
did not materialize to the extent originally envisaged, a develpment
attributable to the slowdown of Brazilian economic activities in the early
19808.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A.  General
6.01      The main institutional issue the project intended to address was
the strengthening of the road maintenance capabilities of DER-PR in order to
suplport the acceleration of the delegation program. However, during project
implementation, the program lost its momentum and only a mere 350 km were
delegated to DER-PR during the period 1979-1984. What follows is a
discussion of the substantial changes in the subsector during that period
which explain the diminishing interest of successive Governments in the
delegation program.
6.02      In the 1960s and 1970s, DNER established and maintained itself as
a strong autonomous agency responsible for the rapid expansion of Brazil' s
primary road network. DNER's construction programs were financed by the
proceeds of earmarked taxes. Federal highway funds for states and
municipalities were also channeled through DNER. DNER had a solid financial
basis and a clear leadership role in the sector.
6.03      In the late 1970s, the environment started to change.  First, the
transport policy and th.e role attributed to road transport underwent a
profound revision as it became imperative to reduce consumption of imported
petroleum products. The Government identified urban transport as the main
area in which such reduction could be obtained and directed investments to
this field. For freight transport, the Government turned to the railways
and also started to promote coastal shipping and intermodal services as
alternatives to long-haul trucking.
6.04      The second important factor that affected DNER was the gradual
dismantling of earmarked revenues. In an effort to control spending by
public agencies, the Government started to impose ceilings upon their
expenditures in 1976. DNER was slow to adjust its planning and programming
methods to the new system. It continued to prepare multiannual plans based
upon the projected receipts from earmarked revenues, disregarding the new
ceilings. The gap between the cost of DNER's action plans and its financial
capacity grew, and it had to be covered by borrowing and by supplemental
allocations. Accelerating inflation aggravated the situation.



- 12 -
6.05     lTird, prior-ties within the highway sector had changed.  The
network was aging; pavements built in the 1960s were supporting traffic
volumes well above those for which they had been designed, and they were in
need of strengthening and rehabilitation. DNER was also slow to recognize
the priority of this task and to set up an adequate engineering capability
to plan and design a pavement and rehabilitation program of adequate
scope.6/
6.06      In the second half of 1980, the crisis within DNER came to a
head. Construction work was stopped in mid-1980 because of the
much-higher-than-anticipated inflation and because DNER did not receive a
mid-year supplemental allocation. DNER had also used up a substantial part
of the resources intended for states and municipalities for its own
programs. In March 1981, the Minister of Planning replaced DNER's
management. It was then decided that rNER's resources would come from the
Federal budget. The Ministry of Planning undertook to reimburse the states
for the funds that DNER was supposed to have channelled to them in 1980.
From then on, Federal highway funds for states and municipalities were no
longer passed through DNER.
6.07      DNER emerged from this crisis with a reduced role.  It lost much
of its financial autonomy, and its relationship with the DERs was profoundly
changed. Meanwhile, the delegation program was being implemented without a
clear definition of the system by which the transfer to the states of road
maintenance responsibilities and the necessary funds was to be effected.
The compromise that only roads in maintainable condition would be delegated
was seldom fulfilled since DNER did not have the technical and financial
capability to implement the needed extensive road rehabilitation program.
Therefore, the states found themselves in charge of maintaining an
increasing network of roads in poor condition when the necessary funds were
not forthcoming. Furthermore, DNER was no longer the proper forum to air
state grievances; the interlocutor was now the Ministry of Planning which,
having to attend to other sectors of the economy, was less responsive to the
DERs needs. The latter soon lost interest in the delegation program, This
change in circumstances plus the different views of DNER's subsequent
management led to the adoption of the present policy of not delegating a
Basic Road System totalling about 40,000 km. of the federal network, which
are maintained by contract (about 30,000 km) and by DNER force account
(about 10,000 km).
B.   Developments Under the Project
6.08      The technical assistance financed under the loan effectively
addressed the institution-building objectives of the project. As discussed
in Chapter III, DER-PR experienced a substantial improvement in its
organization as well as in its planning, costing, controlling and training
capabilities. The agency was reorganized under the program, and management
was decentralized. The physical maintenance capability was also expanded to
accommodate the delegated roads. The fact that delegation did not take
place at the expected rate did not result in excess capacity since the State
6/ The Borrower is of the opinion that the last sentence in this paragraph
is debatable since, in 1974, DNER created the Directorates of Transit and
Maintenance (Annex 1).

of Parana's own paved road network expanded from about 10,800 km in 1978 to
about 13,100 km in 1984. During the project period, DER-PR also
implemented, with the consultant's assistance, a new methodology for the
physical and financial planning of maintenance. The system continues to be
used for managing road maintenance in Parana.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project was successful in achieving its principal objectives
of rehabilitating important road links in Brazil; improving the maintenance
capabilities of DER-PR; developing criteria and norms for pavement
evaluation and design under Brazilian conditions, and helping DNER in its
efforts to control axle-load limits. A broader underlying objective of the
project--to increase efficiency in road maintenance through the delegation
of that task to the states--was only partially achieved. As explained
throughout the text, changing circumstances caused a revision of the
Government's approach toward maintenance delegation.
7.02      The project was appraised when its predecessor, the Fifth Highway
Project, was at a very early stage of its implementation. As a result,
project design was only marginally influenced by the experience gained under
the previous project in the area of delegation of road maintenance.  In
general though, both projects suffer4td from the same weakness: lack of a
clear definition of the delegation piocess and, within that process, of the
mechanisms to transfer maintenance funds to the states.
7.03      There is one main lesson to be learned from this project:  Bank
support of important institutional changes (i.e. delegation of road
maintenance to the states) and/or substantial investments (i.e. the weighing
station program) should be made only on the basis of a thorough assessment
of possible alternative policies and instruments. When such an assessment
requires the implementation of a pilct project, its experimental charecter
should be made explicit, and the criteria and resources to evaluate the
results before engaging in a similar operation should be available.

Chief, Transportation Division, LCPTR
The World Bank - Washington                                                   Region's
Comments:
In reference to your letter of May 6, 1987, we have no objection to
the final report prepared by IBRD on the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1557-BR)
but for the following comments - qualifications which should be added:
1.   Cost estimates (para 4.02) regarding the main components--rehabilitation
works--DNER always registered the cost of the works: (a) in original See PCR
prices, that is, the value on the date of the contractors' proposals Footnote 3.
divided by the exchange rate on that date; and (b) the value in dollars
disbursed by the Bank corresponding to the exchange rate on the date of
payment/request for reimbursement of the contractors' invoices in nominal
values. DNER's final report includes both values (Table 1 in page 7 and
financial summary in page 129). The DER-Parana adopted another system.
2.   Cost estimates (para 4.03).  Add to item (b) "and the delays in payment  See PCR
of contractors' invoices."  Delete item (d) since the main reason for the  Foot-
delays in the submission of disbursement requests was the delay in paying note 4.
the contractors.
3.   Economic Reevaluation (para 5.02).  The last sentence of this paragraph
is incorrect. There was an economic analysis of the fourth group of See PCR
roads presented to the Bank where their inclusion for financing was   Footnote 5.
requested. This evaluation covered only the resealing works (202 km) but
there was no economic evaluation of the 31 improvements because of the
nature of the services. The feasibility report included several original
pictures.
4.   Institutional Development (para 6.05).  The last sentence is debatable. See PCR
In 1974, DNER completely changed its organigram to give increased    Footnote 6.
attention to those activities related to the operation and maintenance of
its network, creating at that time the Directorate of Transit and
Maintenance.
5.   Comments on the weighing scales and maintenance delegation programs were
sent to the Bank on the occasion of the analysis of the final report on
the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR). We have no further comments on
these subjects.
