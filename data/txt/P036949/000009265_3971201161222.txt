ENSVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Preface
The JYRB is located in the suburb of Wuhan, which is the extra large bridge in the line
of both JZNAH and HRNAH so that it is the key engineering indispensable to two
national highway construction.
The JZNAH and HRNAH is the two of the four proposed national highways with the
two of south-north direction and the rest of east-west direction, which are the key
highway construction engineering in the country's integrated transportation network
establishment. It is overwhelmingly significant to enhance highway transportation
capacity of China and improve the national integrated transportation layout.
Moreover, the JZNAH passes through the country's important economic centre from the
north to the south, and HRNAH goes from the east to the west along with the Yangtze
River, which could support the opening and development of Pudong New Area.
Therefore it will undoubtedly play an crucial role in speeding up the economic
development, readjusting the economic layout and promoting the development of central
and westem China.
The two highways are basically arranged as a Greek Cross type in the boundary of Hubei
Province, which forms the main highway framework of the province. Accordingly it is
significant to improve the layout of the provincial communication network, enlarge the
exchange outward and promote the further development of Hubei.
The construction of two national highways can be quickened and finally completed once
the bridge is set up. Accordingly, the function of the project in the integrated
transportation network can be described as follows: the project is not only the key
engineering in national arterial highway construction, but also it is the pioneer
engineering for out-ring way construction of Wuhan City, so that the completion of the
project will be greatly beneficial to the establishment of national highway framework,
alleviating the urban traffic pressure, mitigating the traffic accidents and pollution, the
bridge can also connect the Wuhan's existing inner road network and outer roads system
to become the important pathway which can link the whole province including the rural
areas, different counties and districts, it will consolidate the socio-economic
development of the areas along the route and promote the further opening of Wuhan

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
City.
In addition, it is important to the development of railway, navigation and aviation
transportation in the area after the bridge being completed. The coal and mineral raw
materials for industrial and domestic use in Wuhan mainly relies on railway
transportation, so does the products exportation. But for a long period of time, the input
of the railway development is far from enough, The Beijing-Guangdong Railway has
already seriously overloaded, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge suffered from
bottleneck limitation as well, its innovation seem to be very difficult and in fact no such
plan has been mapped out. For these reasons, the project will ease the insufficiency of
existing railway transportation capacity, on the other hand, it is able to share the railway
passenger and freight transportation so as to speed up the railway circulating rate.
The water transport in the area is very convenient, the proposed bridge will link all
concerning ports to strengthen the materials collecting and distributing capacity, and
benefit to develop a comprehensive and well-equipped ports system, as a result the
water transport can be developed more efficiently.
The aviation transport in the area is being developed vigorously, the existing airport is
planned to relocate in the suburban area, the Wuhan international airport is under
construction, the construction of the proposed bridge will provide a express pathway to
all directions, therefore it is going to play a promoting role in development of aviation
business in Wuhan.
In short, the construction of the project will play an important promoting role in
developing and perfecting the integrating transport network so as to stimulate the
provincial and even national economic development.
In accordance with Environmental Protection Management Guideline for
Construction Project issued by NEPA of China (No 86-003) and Environmental
Protection Management Methodfor Communication Construction Project issued by
MOC (No 90-17 Minister Decree), for large and medium scale construction project, the
environmental impact statement should be prepared in principle. For this reason,
Hubei Commurnication Plarning and Design Institute entrusted Shanghai Ship &
Shipping Research Institute(hereinafier referred to as the Institute) to undertake EIA
study of JYRB.

1.4    Environmental Protection Targets
There are two selection schemes of bridge site, one is in Weijiawan which is the
recommended site, the other in Houshan is the optional site.
The lands in both sides of the river at the recommended bridge site are mainly dry,
sloping low land and spare open space, so there are almost no sensitive environmental
targets except small amount of scattered houses.
On the contrary, several sensitive environmental targets are involved if the optional site
is considered. On the left bank of the river, there are the residential area of Junshan
Town and Junshan Primary School etc. The Water Purification Plant of Wuchang
County and the military camp is located on the right bank of the river. The identified
environmental protection targets are listed in table 14-1.

1.5.2  EIA Approaches
In the light of the features of bridge and highway construction (including the
connected road), the EIA is carried out by means of spots reflecting whole line, partial.
spots and whole line combination and finally feedbacking the whole line, the
prediction assessment is to identify the environmental impact to sensitive targets
and/or road sections caused by proposed project, so that the concerning environmental
mitigation measures can be stipulated to control the environmental pollution.
The prediction assessment of traffic noise, air quality, vibration is carried out by
means of mathematics model calculation, the assessment on socio-economy , public
participation and aquatic ecology and so on is conducted by means of survey and
analysis.

2.4   Resettlement and Land Requisition
The lands in both sides of the river at the recommended bridge site are mainly dry,
sloping low land and spare open space, so only a little resettlement is needed.
On the contrary, a large amount of resettlement is required if the houshan bridge site is
considered. On the left side of the river, the resettlement should be made to the
Junshan Town residential area, Junshan Primary School, vehicle ferry station and its
office building etc. Part of Water Purification Plant of Wuchang County and some of
the military camp and facilities have to be relocated on the right side of the river.
2.5   Investment Estimate and Fund Raising
It is estimated that 1,030 million RMB is needed for T type bridge construction. The
total investment is composed of two parts:
BOT loan                              815 million RMB
appropriation from government         215 million RMB

2.7   Environmental Impact Identification
The lands in both sides of the river at the Weijiawan bridge site are mainly dry,
sloping low land and spare open space, there are no villages with dense population. At
Houshan bridge site, the approach at the south bank will get through the adjacent part
of Wuchang Water Purification Plant and the     military camp, on the north
bank, the approach will get through the Junshan vehicle ferry station, Junshan Primary
School. The bridge construction will spend a long period of time and require large
amount of workers, living and working lands, materials and equipment transport as
well as kinds of extensive operation. After the bridge is completed and opened to
traffic, the impact on regional socio-economy and living condition will also be
tremendous.
The construction of the bridge can be divided into four phases, i.e. preparation phase,
foundation construction phase, bridge construction phase and operation phase. The
related environmental impacts are set forth in table 2-7-1.

INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
It suggested that the maximum annual mean wind velocity is 2.4m/s at the direction of
NNE and SW, while 1.6m/s is the minimum at W.
Seasonally, SW of 3.0m/s is-the quickest one in spring followed by NNW of 2.8m/s,
the slowest one is SSW of 1.4m/s.
In summer, SSW, SW and WSW are on the top with the velocity of 3.7m./s, 3.3m/s
and 3.2m/s respectively, N and W is on the bottom with 1.8m/s each.
In autumn, NNE of 2.6m/s is the quickest one, while WSW  of 1.Om/s is on the
opposite.
In winter, the top wind velocity is 2.2m/s of NNE, and 1.2m/s of S and SW is on the
other end. The mean wind velocity in summer is the quickest at various wind direction
in four seasons.

INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
It is shown that the maximum monthly wind velocity is 2.3mIs in July, while the
minimum one is 1.6m/s in October and December, annual mean wind velocity is
l1.9mIs.
Pollution Coefficient
The transference and diffusion of air pollutants are affected by both wind direction
frequency and velocity. The higher wind direction frequency, the more pollution
probability will be in that wind direction, on the contrary, the quicker wind velocity
companies with lower pollution possibility at its leeward, therefore the pollution
coefficient(PC) can be applied to represent the impact level of pollutants in the air,
which is:
wind direction frequency
Pollution Coefficient =
average wind velocity
Table 3-1-4 shows the coefficient calculated with the data presented in table 3-1-1 and
table 3-1-2, and figure 3-1-3 is the corresponding rose.
It is suggested that the maximum pollution coefficient in The Area is 7.00 at N
direction, while the minimum is 1.25 at W direction.
Seasonally, the highest PC in spring occurs at N and ESE leeward which are 5.71 and
5.45 respectively. While 1.25 at W is the lowest.
In summer, the highest PC is at SE and S leeward which are 5.65 and 5.51
respectively. While 0.63 at WSW is the lowest.
In autumn, the highest PC is at N and NE leeward which are 9.47 and 9.23
respectively. While 0.91 at SW is the lowest.
In winter, the highest PC is at N and NE leeward which are 8.00 and 6.50 respectively.
While 1.25 at SSW and W is the lowest.

The north bank of Weijiawan bridge site is mainly dry, slopy low land and spare
open space, where little resettlement is needed, however its dry land is main cotton
producing area of Junshan Town, so it will affect the cotton production and a part of
runal labours have to leave the land, for these reasons the proper resettlement is
indispensable by means of developing rural industries, diversified economy and
participating road construction to settle the surplus labour force. The dry and slopy
land is dominated in the south bank of Yangtze River with little resettlement.

3.2.3.1 Highway
There are 4 national highways in the boundary of Wuhan, i.e. No 106, 107, 316,
318, and another 10 provincial highways, all these highways constitute the traffic
network of Wuhan, see table 3-2-5. In addition, the network has connected with
many railways, harbours and airports in the country to conduct the medium and/or
short distance transport tasks. By the end of 1992, the total mileage of highway is
2712.88km including 234.9km national highway. However, the communication is
still week as compared with quick development of entire economy due to the
drawback communication facilities, irrational transport structure, poor transport
capacity and imperfect network layout.
JYRB is the independent project of JZNAH, which is in the line of both JZNAH
and HRNAH and meet the out-ring road plan. As a result, the implementation of
this project will greatly promote the socio-economic development in Wuhan, and
will benefit to establish and enhance the provincial highway network, city's out-
ring road construction, ease the urban traffic congestion and improve the transport
capacity. Therefore this project is significantly important and imperative.
3.2.3.2 Railway
There are several railways with all directions pass through the study area including
Beijing-Guangdong Artery Railway at NS direction, Wuhan-Dazhi Railway and
Wuhan-Dandong Railway in EW direction, it can reach Shanghai to the east while

INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
3.3.1.6 Analysis on Results of Monitoring
i       NOx
By five days monitoring, it is found that NOx concentration of any single
measurement ranged from 0.007mg/m3 to 0.109 mg/m3 with no value
exceeding the standard. The daily mean concentration is in the range of
0.008-0.088mg/m3, its exceeding standard percentage is zero. It suggests
that NOx concentration in the study area meets the Class II national air
quality standard. The possible reason for the high NOx values at the
Wuchang Water Plant is the effect of gas including nitrogen given off by
a matured compost site neaby.
ii CO
By five days monitoring, it is found that CO concentration of any single
measurement ranged from 0.6mg/m3 to 8.4 mg/m3 with no value
exceeding the Class II standard. The daily mean concentration is in the
range of 0.6-3.5mg/m3, its exceeding standard percentage is zero. It
suggests that CO concentration in the study area is commonly low and its
detection rate is low as well.
iii      TSP
By five days monitoring, it is found that TSP concentration of any single
measurement ranged from 0.016mg/m3 to 0.613 mg/m3 with no value
exceeding the standard. The daily mean concentration is in the range of
0.067-0.384mg/m3, its exceeding standard percentage is 6.7%.
The daily mean TSP concentration in the monitoring spots of Junshan
Primary School exceeded the standard occasionally, and its maximum
exceeding multiple is 0.28. The reason of high TSP concentration of
Junshan Primary School is the students' exercising on the playground.
The maximum exceeding multiple of Junshan Snail Fever Prevention
Station is quite low, no over standard occurs in the rest of the monitoring
spots.

exceed, while "Any Single Time" is the limit that concentration of any monitoring
time can't exceed
ii) Class II standard is the air quality that health of people animals and plants in city
and rural area can't harmed after long or short contacting. Class II standard is
suitable for the Class II Area of air quality, cultural areas, places of historic
interest and scenic beauty, and the vast countryside determined in city planning.

INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
From the above data, the following features on existing water quality in the study
area can be found:
i       Among five monitoring factors being investigated, pH, BOD3, and Oil
attain Class I water quality standard, the mean pH value at every
monitoring point is in the range of 7.93-7.99, while mean BOD5 is 0.64-
0.99mg/l, the mean Oil concentration is below the detective limit of
0.02mg/1. The mean value of permanganate index ranges from 2.40mg/i
to 2.98mg/i, which meet the Class II water quality standard.
ii      Among five monitoring factors being investigated, SS concentration at
all monitoring points is on a high level and the average valume is
between 186.6-395.5 mg/l which is related to high sand content in the
Yangtze River.
Together with the mono-index assessment method, the water quality in the study
area was assessed to determine the water quality status and classification.
Generally, the water quality in the study area is fair, PH,BOD5, Oil and PMI can
attain Class I or II water quality standard.

Yangtze River is the key habitat and pathway for river migratory fishes, the
proposed bridge is located in the boundary of Wuhan City and cross Yangtze River,
to identify the potential ecological impact on aquatic animals, the investigation was
undertaken by means of references review and visiting interrelated experts
complying to suggestion of World Bank. The expert opinion can be seen in the
appendix.
Lipotes Vexilliber Miller(L VM)
LVM is the featured precious aquatic animal in China, which belongs to beast class,
whale order, vexilliber miller general family and LVM family. LVM is the largest
mammal living in the river and use lung to breath. China has listed LVM as the
Class I national conservative animal, World Natural Conservative Association also
listed it as one of 12 most endangering animals. In 1950s, it was distributed in down

INVEST'IGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
reaches of Yangtze River and Fuchun River, but now along with the declining of
habitat, the number of LVM is descending seriously and LVM is facing the menace
of living.
i        Living Habits
LVM is a kind of social aquatic animal which move in groups, which
migrate along with the movement of backwater area. The large
backwater area with stable flow and soft flow velocity is helpful to their
rest, and what more important is: large arnount fertile soil settled on
islets and shoals with wild grass, settled organic materials in the large
backwater area where is inundated during the flood period, all these areas
possesses superior condition for growth of aquatic animal due to lots of
plankton and other species; The rich jelly animals, aquatic insects and
shellfish congregates in the silt area with sand substrate, which is good
for growth and reproduction of fishes, and offers LVMs abundant food
resources and cosy habitat condition.
Living Area
Originally, LVMs lived in the area from Yangtze River Estuary to The
Three Gorges, they also frequently entered several large lakes such as
Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, they also could be found in Qiangtang
River and Fuchun River. Since the Xinan River Hydraulic Power Station
had been constructed in 1957, the water level of Fuchun River decreased,
which resulted in the disappearance of LVMs in those areas. Owing to
the activities of mankind the number of LVM is descending seriously.
No many LVMs can be found now in the 1700km long water course
from Zhicheng of Yichang to Yangtze Estuary. According to the recent
investigation by some experts, there are about tens LVMs in the Yangtze
River now. The Yangtze River section in Junshan of Wuhan is in the
range LVMs dispersed, but not in the main region of activities. There are
little possibilities of LVMs passing the Junshan water course, and it
passes through once in a while even if one LVM appears.

INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS QUO
AciprmserSinensis Gray(ASG)
ASG is a kind of aquatic chordate, which is the only fish with hard scales. ASG
belongs to fish class, gray order and gray family. ASG is originally a large economy
fish with up to 400cm long, over 3501kg weigh, because of over catching for long
period, its resources is in reducing trend. ASG is quite famous in the world and is
Class I national conservative animal.
i        Living Habits
ASG is the large migratory fish living in the middle and lower layer of
waters, and prefer to live.in the area with sand pits and stable flow
velocity. It commonly lives in the offshore area of east coast of Asia, in
July-August ASG enters the river at Yichang waters for reproduction.
The baby ASG normnally eats plankton, aquatic insects, small fishes and
shrimps as well as jelly fishes, while the adult ASG takes benthon
animals and residues of animals and plants.
ii       Living Area
ASG mainly distributes in Pinshan at down reaches of Jinsha River,
Yangtze River and coastal area of China. The adult ASG distributes in
the waters from down reaches of Jinsha River to Yangtze Estuary, while
the distribution of baby ASG is in down reaches of Yangtze River to the
estuary.
Psephurus Gladius Martens(PGM)
PGM is a kind of the featured large economy fish in China ranked first among
freshwater fishes. It belongs to fish class, ,artems order and martens family. PGM is
over 4m long and 500kg weigh, which is the largest freshwater fish. Due to over
fishing, such kind of fishes is facing extinction. It is now listed as Class I national
conservative animal.
i        Living Habits
The habitat environment of PGM is similar to one of ASG but only
living in freshwater, it can live in the upper reaches or middle reaches of
Yangtze River at whole life period although the migration back to upper
reaches of Yangtze River for reproduction can also be found. PGM is a
kind of carnivourous fish which can catch shrimps and crabs at down
reaches of Yangtze River, the baby PGMs are fed themselves at Yangtze

Estuary. The reproduction period of PGM is in March and April.
ii       Living Area
PGM can be found in Jinsha River, Yangtze River, the mouth of
Qiantang River and coastal shadow water area of the East China Sea. It
mainly inhabits in middle aid down reaches of Yangtze River. The baby
fish got birth in upper reaches will swim down along the water flow and
appears in every May in the waterway of Yichang river section and the
river connecting with Dongting Lake, the baby PGM appears at its peak
in Yangtze River Estuary in the second half of June. For all living stages
from baby fish to sexual mature, PGM can always be found in Yangtze
River artery waters.
3.7.2     Terrestrial Ecological Environment
The area which the proposed engineering will pass through is a part of Jianghan
Plain, where soil is mainly violet soil, yellow lime soil and yellowish red soil, due to
the long history cultivation, soil layer is deep and fertile with high fertilization rate
and production capacity, which is the key area for grain, vegetables and cash crops
production.The vegetation in the study area belongs to Mid Asia green broadleaf
forest belt which is normally distributed in the area under an elevation of 1300m.
Unfortunately, the vegetation has suffered severe damage due to deforestation and
the vegetation coverage along the line is quite low, which will result in further soil
erosion at hilly area and become the bald rock irreversibly, on the other hand, the
soil is getting thin and infertile. Conclusively, the ecological system in the study area
is fragile.
3.7.3     Existing Soil Erosion
There are three patterns of soil erosion in the area, which are area erosion, gully
erosion, and gravity erosion.
The soil erosion in the proposed engineering area mainly attribute to area erosion
and gully erosion, the soil erosion occurs severely in the violet sand shale area, the
erosion for ViOiL. sand shale is quite strong, the alternate weathering effect and
erosion effect quickens the soil erosion rate. A large amount of soften fragments mix
in the runoff.
The gravity erosion in the study area is rare.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
4         Environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment
4.1       Environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment on Air Quality
4.1.1     Air Quality Impact Analysis in Construction Period
Main impact on the air quality in the bridge and road construction period is dust and
smog pollution generated in the asphalt paving period. The concrete pavement
mainly results in dust pollution, whereas main pollution of asphalt pavement are
asphalt smog and dust. The proposed bridge and connected road will be paved with
concrete so that-air pollution will mainly result from dust in the construction period.
4. 1. 1.1 Dust Pollution
There are three types of dust pollution: flying dust caused by concrete blending,
blowing dust caused by materials transport and dust pollution from the stock piles.
I         dust caused by concrete blending
There are two kinds of concrete blending in the construction stage: on-
site blending and station blending. On-site blending is conducted during
the roadbed construction along the newly built highway. Station blending
is the concentrated blending according to concerning standard and
regulation at blending station, the blended materials are directly
transported to construction site by vehicles. The characters are: dust
pollution.moves along with the construction road sections, yet the impact
scope is narrow; the pollution caused by station blending is mainly
focused in blending station, but the impact scope is broader than on-site
blending, especially in leeward of blending station, the pollution distance
will extend longer.
According to the monitoring undertaken by Highway Institute of MOC
fro several concrete blending stations of Jingjintang expressway during
its construction(monitoring result is shown in table 4-1-1), it is found
that:

_  reference point    0.40
Note:   the monitoring point is set at leeward, the reference point is set at 200m windward,
the data of Chouzhuang and Shibalidian are daily average values
TSP pollution caused by on-site blending is slight, it can meet the Class II standard
of GB3095-82 at the distance of 150m; Nevertheless, the pollution led by station
blending is heavier, which TSP still exceed Class II standard of GB3096-82 at 200m
distance in both leeward and windward.
In accordance with the construction plan, the concrete will be produced by means of
station blending. Therefore, the dust pollution to surroundings of roadside will not
be serious. However, the location selection of the blending station is quite important,
the station should be far from the residential area and sensitive targets( at least over
500m). In addition, dust pollution impact will be greatly mitigated by means of
strengthening the labour protection measures and providing dust removing facilities
at the blending station.
ii       Dust generated from materials transport
Heavy dust pollution will be brought about by transport, loading and
unloading of the construction matenals and by secondary road dust
caused by vehicles.
According to the monitoring results on vehicle fly dust in construction
stage of Jingjintang Expressway, (which is listed in table 4-1-2) the
monitoring was conducted by Highway Institute of MOC, the TSP

concentration is 5.039mg/mr3 at 150m of leeward(instant TSP of national
C;ass II standard is 1.0 mg/m3), which exceeded five times of the
standard, so the pollution was apparently serious.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
Gravel Materials
The rock resource is rich in the area, which is mainly distributed in hilly area of
Caidian District and Wuchang County, the quarries of calcareous rock are scattered
at Zhuru Mountain of Caidian District, Yunjin Mountain and Gezi Mountain of
Wuchang County, the quarries of quartzite rock are distributed in the eastem part
of Yongan of Caidian District, Little Fenghuang Mountain, Dingguan Peak and
Fenghuang Mountain of Wuchang County. These gravel material can meets the
requirement and is abundant along the line, which  transport distance is
short(mainly vehicle transport).
Sand Materials
The deposit of sand materials is rare in the local area, therefore it will mainly depend
on importing from other area, it is investigated that there are suppliers such as
Caidian District Huangsha River Transport Company and others in Tudidang and
Jingkou Town of Wuchang. The sand materials will mainly depend on the water
transport.
Clay
Clay is widely distributed in the area, the roadbed engineering can utilize clay along
the line and earthwork from slopes and wasteland on the premise of none or less
occupation of useful land such as farmland and orchard.
Cement
Large amount of cement is needed, there is no competent supplier in local area, the
engineering is planned to use the cement produced by Huaxin Cement Plant of
Huangshi City, water and road transport will be adopted.
From the above description, it is known that gravel and clay materials can be
obtained by local and transported by vehicles with a short distance, therefore dust
pollution will be brought about to surrounding area. Sand and cement will be taken
to the engineering site by means of water transport with little dust pollution, but
some prevention measures should be taken such as using covers and preventing
overload.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
iii      Dust Pollution at Construction Materials Storage Site
There are mainly gravel and sand material storage sites, The dust
pollution to surrounding area will be resulted from due to the quany
operation, loading and unloading, stack, transport, accordingly the
necessary dust reducing measures should be taken, such as watering the
site regularly which can reduce 70% of flying dust at dry weather so that
the notable results can be achieved.
4.1.1.2 Asphalt Smog Pollution
Asphalt smog mainly occurs in the process of melting and road paving, in which the
discharge amount in asphalt melting process is the largest. Harmful poisonous
substances released from hot asphalt are THC, TSP and Benzopyrene, etc. The
pollution of melting site is very serious if old open asphalt melting approach means
is applied. But with the development of highway construction technology, the sealed
plant blending technology with dust removing reduce is now employed, therefore the
pollution of asphalt melting will not be serious at the construction site of this project.
The smoke pollution in the process of asphalt paving is much lower than in asphalt
melting process.
Since this expressway is paved with concrete pavement, a little asphalt (only 345 ton)
is used and mechanized construction means is adopted(200-500m of construction
process per day), so the impact of asphalt smog on air quality is slight.
To sum up, it will have some impact on surrounding air quality in the construction
period, but along with new technology and necessary environmental protection
measures, the pollution in construction period will be reduced greatly. The impact in
construction period is to a certain degree, but it will be cleared up with the
completion of the construction.

In accordance with daily mean traffic volume and discharge coefficient
of individual vehicle (sunmed up according to the research
achievements of Shanghai Automobile and Tractor Research Institute
and Beijing Highway Research Institue of MOC), the pollutants
discharge amount from vehicles can be calculated. See table 4-1-5.

Pollutants emission source strength of peak hour is 1.536 times as much as that of
the average whole day, while pollutant emission source strengh of 16 hours in
daytime is 1.5 times as much as that of the average in whole day. forecast
concentration of pollutants is in proportion to source strength.
4.1.2.2 Selection of Air Pollutants Diffusion Model and Parameters
i        Diffusion Model
American CALINE-3 Model is adopted for air pollutants diffusion
prediction. CALINE-3 model was developed on the base of CALINE-2
model by American Federal Highway Administration. It can be applied
for diffiusion calculation on definite line source pollution and indefinite
line source. The line source diff-usion model of CALINE-3 is shown as
below:
C i=  1  {jZl(            )-L[exp(       , )+-(  ZH

The model can be applied under the condition of wind velocity over lm/s.
ii       Model Parameter Selection and Correction
i)       Diffusion Parameters
Diffusion near the road is influenced by disturbance of moving vehicles,
that is, the vehicle exhaust gas emission are in the patterns of the vertical
diffusion and horizontal emission, which reduce the function of air
stability to diffuision, but vehicle disturbance influence to the area away
from the road is getting weak. Therefore the actual vertical and
horizontal diffusion coefficient z and y should include initial vehicle
exhaust gas disturbance and environment disturbance. Overall vertical
diffusion parameter and horizontal diffusion parameter can be calculated
respectively by following two formulae:
C .(a  2-4-a  2) 1/2
, , = (aff ,2 + a  2) 1/ 2
in which:
az,      ordinary vertical diffusion parameter(m)
azo     initial vertical diffusion parameter
Wind Velocity
Wind velocity can greatly affect the predication results of pollutant
concentration, the larger wind velocity, the smaller concentration, and
vice versa is also true. The mean wind velocity at annual prevailing wind
direction has been taken to prediction calculation.
iii)     Height of Mixed Layer
Since non-continuous phenomenon of turbulent strength will be
generated between upper and lower layer in air boundary layer due to air
thermodynamic and dynarnic reason, it will cause the existence of mixed

layer. The thicker the mixed layer, the lower the ground surface
concentration, the mixed layer thickness can be determined according to
the stipulation of "Technical Guideline for Local Air Pollutants Emission
Standards"(GB/TI 3201-91)
iv)      Effective Emission Height of Air Pollutants
The exhaust gas diffusion is influenced by effective source height which
is composed by three aspects:
He =-Hr + Ha +H
in which:
Hr       highway height
Ha       vehicle exhaust tube height form pavement
AH       exhaust gas raising height
In the light of great height different exists at the proposed bridge and the connected
road, the road height is determined by the height of micro-line source in calculation
which is between 23.7 and 60.6 metres above sea level. As vehicle exhaust tube is
generally about 0.5m over pavement and the heat release rate of vehicle tail gas
exhausted is very small , the tail gas raising height is neglected.
4.1.2.3 Conditions of Prediction
the relevant parameters selection and correction  will base on
corresponding standard and local references
ii      prediction factors are CO and NOx, prediction duration are the short-
term of 2000, medium-term of 2010 and long-term of 2020.
iii     prediction will be made in the prevailing condition, which are daily mean
traffic load, D class air stability and the mean wind velocity at annual
prevailing wind direction.
iv      the prediction points are set in the road vertical sections where the
sensitive targets is situated along the proposed bridge and the connected
road.

4.2.1.2 Permissible Noise Value in Construction Site
Due to the loud noise of the construction machinery operation, there should be a
quite broad construction site to reduce the noise outside of the construction site.
The noise level in the construction should meet the permissible noise value defined
by GB12323-90"Permissible Noise Level in Construction Site", which refers to table
4-2-2.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
The traffic flow rate and running speed greatly impact the traffic noise
level, the prediction is made on the base of traffic load data supplied by
Hubei Provincial Communication Planning Design Institute.
In accordance with traffic flow rate and proportion of vehicle types
(traffic flow rate and vehicle types proportion are same as air pollution
impact assessment mentioned previously), the traffic flow rate of various
vehicles in different prediction year can be obtained, which is shown in
table 4-2-4.
Due to the prediction computation is based on traffic flow rate at peak
time, daytime and night, according to the references offered by the
design institute that the traffic flow rate at peak time covers 6.3-6.5% of
the total, the percentage of traffic flow rate during daytime of 16 hours
and night of 8 hours over whole day is listed in table 4-2-5.
The running speed is based on the different types of vehicles, which are
lOOkm/hr for light vehicles, 80km/hr for medium vehicles and 60km/hr
for heavy vehicles.

The road structure has some influence on the traffic noise, the proposed
bridge is design 6 lanes with concrete pavement and 3% longitudinal
slope, the detail influences are described as follows:
i)       Longitudinal Slope
Longitudinal slope has little influence on light vehicles, but
the noise of heavy vehicles is more serious whey they are
running up the slope than on the flat ground, refer to table 4-
2-6

ii)      Pavement Roughness
Pavement roughness does not have great influence on heavy
vehicles at low running speed, but has some influence on the
noise generated by the light vehicles at high running speed,
which refers to table 4-2-7

iii)     Noise Barrier Factor AS2
Noise barrier factor includes traffic noise attenuation by
acoustic shadow area formed by high flyovei crossing
bridge and high embankment, which refers to figure 4-2-1.
The noise attenuation amount is determined by the distance
difference of the sound wave propagation. Sound
attenuation arnount of the acoustic shadow area is obtained
by Fresnel diffraction principle.

a is an empirical parameter, a factor relevant to the
characteristic of the covering of earth surface between
measuring point and central traffic line.
The surroundings along the proposed bridge can impact the
noise propagation, such as land coverings, vegetation, green,
etc. Considering mainly farm land along the line with better
noise absorbing effect, a is taken as 0.5.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
From the results of traffic noise prediction, it is known that the noise level
generally decreases with the distance far away with the line, on the other hand,
due to the sound barrier effect, the noise level is getting lower with the increase of
bridge height.
Tle sensitive points and its traffic noise prediction results along the line of
Weijiawan bridge site(recommended site) and Houshan bridge site( optional site)
are listed in table 4-2-15.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PRED -TION AND ASSESSMENT
ii       Noise Prediction on Sensitive Points and Villages
Class II standard of GB3096-93"Ambient Noise Standard of Urban
Area" is applied as the basis of traffic noise impact assessment to
schools and large residential areas (Junshan Primary School, Junshan
Town and Military Camp) and Class IV standard is adopted to other
residential areas and mixed areas, the standard exceeding situation at
sensitive points along the highway refer to table 4-2-17 to table 4-2-21.
Table 4-2-17 shows the sensitive points with 5dB(A) or more over the
standard in 2005
Table 4-2-18 shows the sensitive points with 5dB(A) or more over the
standard in 2010
Table 4-2-19 shows the sensitive points with SdB(A) or more over the
standard in 2020
Table 4-2-20 shows the sensitive points with 5dB(A) or less over the
standard in 2020
Table 4-2-21 shows the sensitive points with OdB(A) over the standard
It is found that the noise level of three sensitive points at recommended
bridge site can meet the standard, accordingly it suggests that the
construction of the bridge will impose little impact on the surrounding
sensitive points. On the contrary, the noise level of sensitive points at
optional bridge site will exceed the standard to different extent, the
noise level at the military camp will be over the standard 9.8 dBA in
short term and 14.6 dBA in long term. Therefore the construction at
optional bridge site will result in relatively severe noise pollution to the
surroundings.
In addition, the sensitive points along Weijiawan bridge site is
relatively far from the proposed bridge and the scale of village is small,
so the noise impact on surroundings is comparatively slight.

4.3       Environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment on Vibration
4.3.1     Vibration Impact Analysis in Construction Period
4.3.1.1 Construction Facilities and Vibration Level
During the bridge construction stage, a large amount of various machines will be
employed, because the construction site is not far away from the residential area
and most of machines are operated or moved in the open air, as a result, the
vibration generated by some facilities will adversely impact the neighbouring
people and buildings. Table 4-3-1 lists the vibration level of some construction
facilities.

4.3.1.2 Survey on Piling Vibration
Piling vibration is a kind of shock vibration caused by long daily construction
activities, in order to further investigate and analyze the vibration impact caused
by piling practice, the vibration impact data of the diesel piling driver are collected
and shown in table 4-3-2.

4.3.1.3 Piling Vibration Analysis and Assessment
No matter the shock vibration or other kinds of vibration, its energy will disperse
to all directions through the surrounding media, and will weaken and disappear
gradually with increasing distance. the attenuation calculation of the shock
vibration is presented as below:
If vibration level at the place r(m) apart from the source is Vlzo(dB), vibration
level at the place r (m) apart from the source can be predicted by the following
formula:
Viz = Vlzo - IOlg(r/ro) - 8.7a(r-ro)
in which:
Vlz      vibration level at the distance of r(r3ro) (dB)
Vizo     vibration level at the distance of ro
a        coefficient relied on soil and frequency
To put the data of table 4-3-2 in above equation, a value can be obtained, which is
0.034.
Using a=0.034 substitute in the above equation:
lgr + 0.87axr = (Vlzo - Vlz)/10 + 0.87aro + Igro
SHANGHAI SHIP & SHIPPING RESEARCH INSTITUTE                                98



ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
Using Vlz=75dB(standard daytime value) and 72dB(standard night value) to
substitute in the equation respectively, r value can be worked out, which is:
at day time:                r = 40.Om
at night:                   r = 48.Om
Within the scope of r distance is the over-standard area, in this case, the
consideration is only attached to pleasure rather impact to surrounding buildings
because of no relevant standard.
There will be no explosive practices during the construction, so the consideration
of vibration caused by explosion is unnecessary.
4.3.2     Traffic Vibration Impact Analysis in Operation Period
Once the bridge is put into operation, the vibration generated by traffic will
disperse to the surrounding land surface due to the increase of traffic load.
Considering the character of traffic vibration, the traffic vibration level is not
only related to vehicle's running velocity and amount, but also to the pavement
levelling degree and dominated vibration frequency and will attenuate with the
distance. Based on the actual situation of the proposed bridge and our experience
on the vibration prediction to the similar bridge construction which we had
conducted, the vibration level generated by high grade pavement in the operation
period only has little impact on surrounding environment, the traffic vibration
level can meet the concerning standard, therefore, the further detail prediction is
omitted.
4.4   Environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment on Water Quality
4.4.1 Impact of Construction Camp During the Construction Period
Junshan Bridge will be constructed from July 1997 to December 2000, namely
three years ani five months. The construction period is long and it's a fairly
gigantic project. There are many workers and building materials on the
construction site, which will cause pollution problems. The domestic sewage and
domestic refuse of the workers at the construction site will cause water pollution if
they are directly discharged to river without centralised treatment. The building
materials (cement, sand, oil and embankment) will flow to river with rain and put

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
effect on surroundings nearby without being piled properly.
In this project the boring pile constraction process will be employed, and the
waste mud produced from boring will be shipped and piled up to appointed site.
The waste mud may drop to river and cause silt suspension because of some
operation means.
4.4.2 Storm Water runoff Management During the Construction Period
There is plenty of rain in this area, especially storm rain in summer. We put
forward some management measures according to the project characteristic to
mitigate the impact of the runoff. The management measures are as follows.
i  Establish and amplify rules and regulations to strengthen management and
supervision. Set up a storm rain responsibility team and make definite the duty
of everyone to give the responsibility into play when storm rain breaks out.
ii Pile the building materials (sand, cement and oil etc.) at appropriate site far
from the river in order to avoid the building materials being washed into the
river by the storm rain.
iii Someone must be put in charge of the management of the building materials
and must supervise them regularly. Problems must be reported to the
leadership and be solved at once when the accident sign is found.
4.4.3        Management of Emergency  Response  Capabilities  (the
emergency plan and measures avoiding the water area being
polluted by oil)
The emergency accident will endanger the surroundings greatly when it happens
even if its probability is small, so we must take it seriously. The emergency plan as
follows avoiding the water area being polluted by oil must be executed to control
the impact range and extend and reduce the losses and harm when the accident
breaks out which can protect the water resources and the living aquatic resources
in Yangtze river.
i  Organise a emergency setup led by the person in charge of Junshan Bridge
Project Company including the persons in protecting and safety department,
which can be organisation guarantee to promptly deal with the accident

suddenly appeared.
ii   Work out a emergency plan, make clear the duty of command setup, define the
emergency technology and treatment step, and provide and manage some
necessary facilities.
iii   The responsibility person, post and duty must be defined and the training of
emergency response capabilities must be strengthen in order to have a quick
response when the accident happens.
iv   Provide oil absorption materials and oil recovery equipment so as to take
emergency measures without delay when oil spilling breaks out. Some one
must put in charge of the storage of emergency facilities in normal times, and
the facilities must be examined regularly.
v    Report the accident to leadership at once and sound the alarm when oil
pollution accident breaks out. Give awards to person who reports promptly
and pay severe penalties to person who conceals the accident which he knows.
vi   Take notes of the accident scene accurately including time, space, cause,
condition, range and quantity etc.
4.4.4   Impact of Materials Transportation On the Navigation traffic
There are plenty of stones in the area where the proposed project will be
constructed especially in Caidian District of Wuhan and the hill land of Wuchang
County. The sand user in bridge and highway constructing mainly rely on buying
from other parts because of the small quantity in the locality.
the sand and other materials (cement, wood and steal, etc.) is transported mainly
by land and ship. So the navigation traffic in the Yangtze river will increase during
the construction period. It can cause the channel crowded and blocked up fcr the
large freight volume. Sometime it can take effect on the safety of navigation traffic,
and it can also cause environmnent pollution.

4.5       Eco-environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment
4.5.1     Aquatic Ecology Impact of Bridge Construction
4.5.1.1 Impact on Aquatic Animals during the Construction Period
As described in section of existing aquatic ecological environment, Yangtze River
is the key habitat and pathway of river-migratory fishes. The Junshan section of
Yangtze river is in the range LVM, ASG, PGM dispersing, but not in the main
region of activities. In recent year, the number and scale of such species are getting
diminished, some are in the edge of extinction, for years ecological investigation
at mid and down reaches of Yangtze River has shown that the people's activities
such as over fishing and high developed navigation are the main reason for such
unfortunate situation. For example, there are three abnormal death reason for
lipotes vexilliber miller(LVM), i.e. i) killed by hannful fishing facilities; ii) killed
by high developed navigation business; iii) killed by being stranded without any
effective protection.
For past decades, several bridge was established over the Yangtze River, no
evidence is available that the aquatic animals is hurt due to the bridge construction.
During the construction period, the management must be strengthen to avoid
water pollution accident breaking out and reduce the impact of bridge construction
on water quality and aquatic ecological to minimum extend.
Engage some interrelated experts to strengthen the observation to precious aquatic
animals. Take necessary measures of keeping away and protecting if by and case
some precious aquatic animals passing occasionally.
4.5.1.2 Impact on Aquatic Animals during the Operation Period
The main adverse impact on the aquatic animals during the operation period is
lead pollution to water body caused by vehicle's exhaust gas, and furthermore
impact the aquatic ecology.
The amount of lead contained pollutants discharging to water body can be
predicted on the base of traffic load prediction, table 4-5-1 refers to the predicted
traffic load.

It is found that on obvious lead pollution occurs even if lead contained pollutants
from all exhausted gas discharged by cars passing the bridge get into the river at
Weijiawan bridge site in 2020. In fact, part of vehicles passing through the bridge
are diesel engines without lead content, and some lead contained exhausted gas
will diffuse to the air rather than enter the river water, in addition, the lead content
data using for, the calculation is rather higher than the actual situation, it is
reported that only 50% of lead contained chemicals in gasoline will enter into the
water. For these reasons, it is believed that the amount of lead contained chemicals
entering the river water is far less than the predicted value, so that no adverse
impact on the aquatic animals will occur.
4.5.1.3 The Impact of River Silt Dredge and Discard on Aquatic Ecology
The substrate in river bed is resulted from long time substance settlement in the
river, which composition is closely related to the local climate, geology, hydrology,
soil characters and water pollution history. Along with the increasing water
pollution, the hazardous pollutants in water body will transfer partly into air and
the remains will get into the substrate along with water flowing towards down
stream in various ways.
During the submersed construction stage, some substrate silt will be stirred and
resuspended and the dredge practice may cause some dredged silt redrop into the
river, in addition water diffusion can also result in water stir and silt resuspension.
The substrate silt pollution status is the key factor to determine whether dredge
practice will cause adverse impact on water quality. In accordance with the data
drawn from the substrate silt survey for Wuhan section of Yangtze River, the
substrate silt condition near the Junshan bridge site is shown in table 4-5-4.

Note:    * there is no unified national standard on the substrate silt, the standard applied in
"The Integrated Investigation of Coastal Line and Tidal Zone Resources of China"
was cited.
From table 4-5-4, it is found that the substrate silt quality at Yangtze River Wuhan
section is fair and basically within the assessment standard except that Cu and Pb of
left section exceed the standard slightly, so the dredge practices will not cause
significant pollution.
On the other hand, the boring pile process is adopted during the underwater pier
construction according to JYRB construction scheme, which can greatly reduce the
adverse impacts caused by substrate silt resuspension and so on due to pier piling.
the boring pile process can isolate the practices by steel cofferdam form flowing
river water, the waste silt generated by drilling will be disposed at a designated site
by barge, therefore, little impact will be caused by the engineering dredge practises
and water silt disposal.
4.5.2     Terrestrial Ecology Impact of Bridge Construction
The total length of JYRB is 5km including main bridge body, approaches and
alignment, the land around the recommended bridge site is uncultivated land, waste
low-lying land and spare open space, while factories, schools and residential areas
are around the optional bridge site, no precious wild animals which belong to the
national conservative species are found around the bridge sites, even ordinary wild
animals are rare in the area, so no adverse impact on wild animals is existing.

4.5.3     Impact Analysis and Prediction on Soil Erosion
4.5.3.1 Soil Erosion Impact Analysis
Due to no enough existing data on soil erosion, so the theoretical and analogical
analysis is carried out instead.
i        Relationship between Surface Erosion and Slope
In regard with surface erosion, the souring intensity is not linear with
slope, if water souring capacity is presented with slope water layer
shearing stress xo, while xo is related with sloppy angle a and water layer
thickness ha, see figure 4-5-1.
to = 7y^xhaxsina
in  which yw is the special gravity of water, under the circumstance of
certan rainfall and slope length, the slope's rain-exposed area is related
with slope(figure 4-5-2), as land is level, the rain-exposed area is OA,
suppose the thickness of water layer is ho, when the land is sloppy with
slope a, the rain-exposed is getting reduced to OA'(OA' = OA°cosa),
therefore, water layer thickness ha at the sloppy land with slope a has
the relationship with water layer thickness ho at the flat land as follows:
ha = hox cosa
to combine the above two equation, thus
to = ywxhox (lI2sin2a)
in which slope function is f(s)=l/2sin2a, the limited slope value is 450,
under this value, the scouring capacity is in direct proportion to slope,
once over this value, the scouring capacity is in inverse proportion to
slope.

Relationship between Soil Erosion and Vegetation
The soil erosion amount is great difference between with vegetation and
without vegetation, which differ about 1000-10000 times, it is
demonstrated that vegetation is the only important element for borrowing
amount. the function of vegetation consists in:
a.       intercept rainfall;
b.      eliminate the attack by rain drop so as to protect the soil
particles from loss due to drop of rainfall and prevent from
the formation of poor infiltration layer;
c.       improve the soil composition and infiltration;
d.       intercept and scatter the surface runoff;
e.       consolidate the soil due to roots.
There are two group data presented in figure 4-5-3, with the similar slope
length and slope, but different vegetation, it is shown that the surface
runoff and scouring volume is decreasing greatly with increase of
vegetation, accordingly the soil erosion is related closely with the runoff
amount.

iii      Relationship between Soil Erosion and Rainfall Intensity
The rainfall intensity is the another important element to determine the
soil erosion amount, the big raindrops from stormn have greater impact on
soil consolidation and dispersion, while storm rainfall will surplus the
infiltration volume and produce surface runoff. A empirical equation by
Wisthmale and Smith defines the relationship among total soil erosion
volume, rainfall intensity and energy at medium slope with scattered
vegetation:

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
In accorc-..ce with the actual situation of the proposed area, the
Weshman empirical equation is applied to study the relationship between
local soil erosion and rainfall intensity.
the mentioned equation:
R=Y-1.735 X 10(IlgPip-O.8188)  (i=I to 12)
in which: P        rainfall volume(mm)
R       erosion capacity of rainfall, the high R, the great
energy of rainfall is, thus probability of soil
erosion is greater.
By calculation, R value for the proposed area is 200-300, although R is
related with rainfall volume, the variation trend of R and rainfall volume
is different, R value reflect the rainfall energy.
4.5.3.2 Engineering Impact Analysis
In accordance with the project feasibility study, the earthwork amount for the
recommended bridge site T structure scheme is 53414m3, masonwork amount is
2413m3, land requisition is 390mu, it will be favourable to farmland reservation and
avoid soil erosion if the borrowing practices are conducted at small barren hills.

4.6       Impact Analysis on Cultural and Historic Relics and Aesthetics
4.6.1     Impact on Cultural and Historic Relics
Full consideration has been taken during the project siting, it is investigated that
there is no important cultural and historic relics conservation sites along the
proposed 5km long construction line, therefore no such impact is existed. If there is
any cultural and historic relic discovered in the construction site, the prompt
notification should be sent to the concemning cultural department.
4.6.2     Impact on Landscape
4.6.2.1 Harmronization between Bridge and Existing Landscape
The construction of the bridge is the new scene for local area, the newly-built bridge
should harmonize with the surrounding landscape, JYRB is a modem construction
in different style with the local scenes which features natural and elegant, it is
believed that the JYRB will brighten the area up and improve the aesthetic and
tourism value of local landscape.
4.6.2.2 Impact of Side Slope and High Road Levee Approach on Landscape
Because the Height of side slope and approach of JYRB is higher than surroundings,
it is necessary to beautify the both sides of side slopes by means of greening which is
not only good for aesthetics.
4.6.2.3 Aesthetic Impact on JYRB to Local Area
Due to the existing landscape of the area is not outstanding, JYRB will undoubtedly
rich the scenes type and deployment, accordingly JYRB will create the incomparable
tourism value to the local and even whole province.

4.7       Socio-economic Impact Assessment
4.7.1    Consummating National Communication Layout and Matching National
Economic Strategy Development
JZNAH and HRNAH are two of four national artery highways , which are key
construction projects in "Eighth-Five Year" Plan. JZNAH starts form Beijing verse
Hebei and passes through Henan, Hubei and Hunan, finally end in Zhuhai of
Guangdong Province, which is the country's comnmunication artery at south-north
direction. HRNAH starts from Shanghai and passes through Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei,
Sichuan, and finally end in Chengdu of Sichuan Province, which is anther country's
communication artery at east-west direction. JZNAH and HRNAH passes through
the city and intercross at Junshan area, therefore JYRB is serving for both artery
highwvays, it %ill play an important role in quickening economic development.
4.7.2    Enhancing Existing Traffic Condition of Wuhan and Promoting Local
Economic Development
The existing road system in Wuhan is not only the hub of local road traffic, but also
connecting with railways, harbours and airports, which bearing a great burden due to
large amount of short and medium distance transport tasks. In recent year, although
annual 8% traffic progress is remained along with economic development and
opening, the technical condition of most roads can't match the increase of
communication load and has become a week loop of national economic
development. accordingly the construction of this project will benefit to alleviate the
traffic burden on Wuhan, promote the economic development.
4.7.3     Enhancing Living Condition and Improving Living Quality
The convenient communication will bring about prosperity to local economy, the
excellent chances will emerge along with the development of rural industry and
foreign investment, as a result, the agriculture productive capacity and industrial
output and quality will be improved greatly, the construction of JYRB will also be
helpful to perfect the public facilities, raise people's income and social benefits, thus
the living condition and quality will be enhanced gradually.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT
The construction of the proposed bridge .Nill cause some inconvenient to local
residents such as houses demolition and relocation and land requisition. it need a
long period of time to adopt themselves to new living conditions and plenty of time
and energy to build new houses and move furniture. Moreover, it will cause
inconvenient transportation to local residents by the road separation. department of
bridge construction must pay attention to the unfavourable impact as above and must
tak-e some measure during designing and construction to reduce it as far as possible.
4.7.4    Improving Investment Environment and Promoting Economic Development
Wuhan Economic Development Zone is situated in the boundary of Caidian District
with Wuchang County across the River to the east and downtown area to the north,
which is officially established in June 30,1992 with total area of 31.5 knm2, its
former is Wuhan Automobile Industrial Development Zone. Car manufacture is the
pillar industry in the zone. In addition, Jingkou Toxn in the study area is a satellite
city of Wuhan. Therefore the project will undoubtedly play a innumerable promoting
role in improving the traffic condition, investment environment, developing outward
economy etc.

5        Environmental Protection Mitigation Measures and
Cost/Benefit Analysis
5.1       Environmental Protection Mitigation Measures
5.1.1     Environmental Protection Consideration in Design Stage
5.1.1.1 Soil Borrowing for Bridge Connected Road Construction
The left side of the recommended bridge site just pass through the main cotton
production base in Junshan Town, where land utilization is advanced with high
output and it is the key agricultural revenue source of Junshan Town, meanwhile the
irrigation facilities in the area is manifold. On the other hand, the topography of the
area belongs to low hilly land, so it is unsuitable to borrow soil in this area , as a
result, the borrowing can be conducted in near small hills so that little farmland is
required. The hilly lands at left bank} are mainly located in Weijiawan and Junshan,
as far as bridge construction is concemed. the excavation and transport is relatively
easy and can basically meet the demands. The rich soil source is available for
borrowing at right bank of the bridge site such as Fujiawan, Simalin and
Huangiawan etc.
5.1.1.2 Rational Design of Crossing Passway
The bridge and its approach construction will bring about difficulties to the activities
of residents, animals and vehicles as well as the local mechanical cultivation
practices. So the design has fully considered these aspects, 11 passways (one
pathway per average 278m) are design along 3066m approach in order to make
convenience to all parties.
5.1.1.3 Drainage and Roadbed Protection
The well equipped drainage system and roadbed protectiori measures have been
designed, which cost has been listed in the project budget.

5.1.2     Mitigation iMIeasures in Construction Stage
5.1.2.1 Air Pollution Control Measures in Constructio.n Stage
i       The vehicles and boats loading fine materials in bulk should be covered
with canvas to prevent from dispersing, the ones loading stone and sand
must not be overloaded and fallen apart.
ii      According to the dust pollution analysis of construction stage, it is
known that the main construction materials such as sand and cement are
purchased from outside areas so no fly dust pollution impact. On the
contrary, the stone comes from local quarry, which will cause dust
pollution to some extent, therefore the watering cars should be equipped
at the quarries such as Zhuru Mountain and Little FengHuang Mountain
of Caidian District, Yunjin Mountain, Gezi Mountain and Dinaguan
Peak of Wuchang County. In addition, the watering cars should be also
equipped at the route of transport line to water regularly so that the fly
dust generated by quarrying, loading and unloading and transport can be
restricted effectively.
iii     Lime, cement, sand and stone should be blended in stations which
location must be carefully selected so that it is far from the residential
area and sensitive points( at least 250m), the blending stations are not
suitable to be located in the residential area and sensitive points such as
Zhangjiadun(kl 74+250),                Zhoujiagang(kl 76+350),
Huangjiawan(kl77+600), on the other hand, the effective duster should
be installed in the blending stations to improve the operation
environment, the labour protection measure should also be strengthened.
iv      Although asphalt demand in the construction stage is quite little, its
melting is quite harm.fiul, for this reason, the melting process should be
conducted in a sealed process with dust removing equipment and be
500m far away from residential area.

produce heaxy noise, which impose significant adverse impact on
operation personnel, accordingly, it is suggested that proper arrangement
should be made to protect wvork-ers from long time exposure to high noise
such as shift operation pattern and so on.
ii      It is indispensable to select the low noise construction machines,
approaches, sites, regular maintenance should be available to keep the
facilities in good condition.
iii     The facilities X ith noise over 100 dBA such as piling drivers should not
be operated at the area of village and at night. A reasonable operation
timetable should be mapped out.
5.1.2.3 Water Pollution Control Measures in Construction Stage
i       IlTe boring pile construction process will be employed for underwater
piers construction, which can deeply reduce the substrate silt
resuspension, the waste silt vbill be disposed at a designated site so that
the probability of water pollution caused by silt redrop is low.
ii      The domestic sewage of the workers at the construction site must be
centralisedly treated and reach the standard before be discharged to water.
iii    The building materials can't be piled near the river and must strengthen
the management and take necessary covering measures in order to avoid
the building materials being washed into river by the storm rain.
iv      Take effective management measures, set up a emergency organization
and work out a emergency plan to avoid oil pollution accident to water
area breaks out. Emergency actions must be taken to clear up the oil
pollution once the accident happens..
v       enhance the cooperation with the shipping management department and
intensify the management of ships passing through or used for
construction in order to maintain the unblocked channel and the safe
navigation.

5.1.2.4 Ecological Conservation in Construction Stage
The sewage generated by labour camp should not be discharged directly
into the river, which should be collected and treated on the bank to
prevent aquatic animals from water pollution.
ii      Engage some interrelated experts to strengthen the observation to the
precious aquatic animals in construction stage. Take necessary protective
measures to protect the precious aquatic animals if by any case some
precious aquatic animals are found passing occasionally such as breaking
off the construction having impacts on the aquatic animals, let the ships
passing through pass away, etc.
ii      Setting up national natural conservation area is the best way to protect
rare animals at present. The section of Yangtze river from Luoshan to
Xintankou has been established as the natural conservation area for LVM,
and some semi-natural breeding farm has been set up at Tongling of
Anhui and Tiane Islet of Shish. But there are no remarkable effects
because of thc insufficient funds. In order to protecting the rare animals
awvay from extinction, more manpower and material resources must be
thrown in.
iv      The area where soil borrowing practices is completed should be
reinforced in time, after the earthwork is finished, afforestation should be
carried out as soon as possible to restore vegetation and prevent from soil
erosion.
v       The excavation   and refill is staggered along the connected road, the
different protective measures will be taken to consolidate the roadbed
such as protection wall, side slope greening and so on.
5.1.2.5 Cultural relics Protection
If the fossils, ancient coins, valuable articles or antiquity and structures with
geological or archaeological interests are discovered during the construction stage,
the prompt information should be given to concerning department, the contractor
shall tak-e necessary steps to prevent his workers or any other persons from removing
or darnaging such articles, the construction activities should be quitted if necessary.

5.1.3     Environmental Protection Mitigation Mleasures in Operation Stage
5. 1.3.1 Air Pollution Control Measures in Operation Stage
i       The fundamental approach to eliminate the pollution caused by traffic is
to reduce the exhausted gas, which can be realized by means of
improving vehicle's quality, installing wast- gas purification facilities,
applying lead-free gasoline and so on.
ii      The canvas should be used to cover the vehicles loaded with dust
containing materials and control the spilling of materials.
iii     The service installations such as car park, gas station shall not be located
in  the  air  sensitive  area  such  as  Zhangjiadun(k174+250),
Zhoujiagang(k176+350)and Huangjiawan(kl77+600) to ensure the air
environment in fair quality.
iv      The exhausted gas can be absorbed by tree and grass, so it is suggested
that plantation of tree and grass at the sides of road and side slope is
quite helpful to protect air environment and beautify the surroundings.
v       In accordance with air prediction conclusions, a 100m long and 20m
wide  green  belt shall be set up  at the  Huangjiawan  road
section(k177+600) so as to reduce the adverse impact on air environment
and noise, which will cost 0.1 million RMB.
5.1.3.2 Noise Control in Operation Stage
i       Once the bridge is put into operation, the strict vehicle management
should be carried out on the aspects of speed limit, vehicle performance,
and surface level of the road.
ii      The traffic noise level is closely related with the performance of vehicles.
Accordingly, it is necessary to improve the technical level of vehicle
manufacture and repairing and develop low noise vehicles to reduce the

traffic noise sources and enhance the acoustic environment along the line
of bridge.
iii     In accordance with the noise prediction result, the noise in three sensitive
points at the recoimmended bridge site in short, medium and long term
can meet the standard, so no noise protective measure is necessary. The
noise at the optional bridge site is temporarily not considered.
5.1.3.3 Emergency Plan for Hazardous Chemicals Leakage in Traffic Accident
At operation stage, the main water pollution w ill result from hazardous chemicals
leak-aoe in traffic accident, Junshan Bridge Project Company should organize a
leading group handling with the emergency, and reinforce the management on
vehicles loading hazardous chemicals. The hanzrdous chemicals transport should be
registered in the public security department, and marked with dangerous article sign,
set time for getting through. Once the accident happens, the emergency arrangement,
such as personnel, vehicles, facilities, medicines, should be taken to limit the
accidental damage in minimum.
In order to avoiding the hazardous chemicals leaked in the accident directly flovNing
into water installation leading water to two sides of bridge should be installed on the
surface of bridge in design stage. And set up settling basins having proper capacity
on each side of the bridge, which can gather the hazardous chemicals flowing from
the leading-water installation when accident breaks out. If measures as above are
taken, the hazardous chemicals wouldn't flow to water directly and can be treated by
emergency department.
5.1.3.4 Afforestation along the Bridge
At operation stage, the bushes and grass shall be planted in central divider at the
connected road section to reduce dust, noise and beautify environment. it will cost

operation, the huge traffic volume wNill cause considerable environmental
problems such as air and noise pollution and undermine the local
productive and living resources. As long as proper environmental
protection measures are tak-en, the partial economic loss caused by
hi ehway construction can be retrieved. The retrieved part includes the
health cost ( loss of production capacity due to illness caused by
pollution, medical care expenses paid by social welfare funds and
medical care department), the loss on production and consuming articles
consists of devaluation of the real estate. As listed in details in table 5-2-
4, the total direct benefit for WVeijiawan bridge site is 47,16ORMB.

Note:    there are 30 household with about 120 residents who are influenced by the project at
the recommended bridge site in the study area.
ii      Indirect Benefit
The existing traffic condition is very crowded and chaotic because all
national highway and city road are intercrossed and pass through the
crowd downtown, the traffic congestion and accident are increasingly
upgraded. JYRB is just at the intersect of.JZNAH and HRNAH and
located in Wuhan City, which become the traffic hub naturally.
Accordingly, once JYRB opens to traffic, then

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MITIGATION MEASURES AND COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS
(i)     perfect the traffic hub function and development layout of
Wuhan, i.e. form the out-ring road which  will divert the
traffic flow, alleviate traffic congestion of downtomtn area
reduce the traffic accident risks.
(ii)    improve the traffic efficiency, save the transporting and
travelling time.
(iii)    because the construction materials of this project comes
mainly from local area, it is convenient to construction
arrangement such as concentrated borrowing, borrowing site
can be reused after proper reformation (used as fishing pond),
which can create some economic benefits.
iii     Social Benefit
Wuhan is divided into three Towns by the Yangtze River and Han River,
the municipal traffic system of three Towns is formed by natural axis of
the rivers, which is relatively independent and also reliance upon each
other.
JYRB is just at the intersect of JZNAH and HRNAH, which is the kev
engineering of national artery highways construction, moreover, it is also
the pioneer engineering for Wuhan out-ring highway construction, as a
result, the project is significant for national highway network forrmation,
perfecting the overall traffic layout of China, alleviate the urban traffic
pressure of Wuhan, mitigating urban environmental pollution and traffic
accidents. Meanwhile, by combining with the existing road network and
newly built outward highwvay, the overall road system connecting all
suburbs and counties can be established to make the Wuhan traffic
layout perfect.
The construction of JZNAH and HRNAH will connect all parts of Hubei
Province, which will play a remarkable promoting role in provincial
economic development. Wuhan is the political, economic and cultural
centre of Hubei Province and one of the extra large cities in China,
which "Dragon Head" function is increasingly powerful. As a result, the
construction of JYRB will connect not only all suburbs and counties of
Wuhan City but also other areas in or out of Hubei Province, it will
promote the local socio-economic development as well as the economic

ENVIRONMwIENTAL PROTECTION MITIGATION MEASURES AND COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS
relation vith the area outside of Wuhan, in addition, it is crucial to ease
the pressures on urban infrastructure and ecological environment,
improve the investrnent environment and promote Wuhan's further
opening.
5.2.2.2 Loss
The series effective measures will be tak}en during construction and open to traffic
periods of JYRB, wvhich will reduce the adverse environmental impacts to the
limited degree. Environmental protection input is the lump-sum investment for
pollution control facilities, in which the main part is the afforestation engineering
and air pollution control green belt establishmnent and so on, which is up to
850,OOORMB, it can be taken as capital investment. Accordingly, the actual
environmental protection economic loss is the annual facilities' running expenses
needed after the highway is put into operation, which is 44,000RMB.
5.23      Environmental Cost/Bcncfit Analvsis
i       Comparison of Environmental Protection Investment with Project
Inv estment
Total investrnent of JYRB(consecutive T type rigid structure proposal at
Weijiawan Bridge Site) is 1.146 billion RMB, while environmental
protection investment is 0.70 million RMB, only a very small proportion
of 0.07% of the total capital investment which indicates that the
environmental protection investment is not a main part.
ii      Economic Benefit of annual Environmental Protection Cost
economic benefit of annual enviromnental protection can be shown by
the ratio of retrieved economic loss due to carrying out certain
environmental, protection measures to annual environmental protection
investment, that is:
Ej = (I:Si)/H-F    (i = I to n)
in which:

Calculation result: After effective environmental protection measures are
tak}en, a direct economic loss of at least 47160 RMB can be retrieved
every year, fuirthermore, a lot of indirect benefit and unestimated social
benefit can be achieved. If the annual running cost of environmental
protection facilities is 44000RNIB as shown in table 5-2-3, thus the
economic profit of annual environmental protection input is
47160:44000, i.e. 1.07:1.

6.1.3     Environmental Training Program
Since the highway bridge like JYRB in China is quite few, and EP management
experience is poor, the personnel training programn should be prepared by Project
Company of Junshan Bridge. It is suggested that some selective technicians can be
sent to learn the latest EP management technology and experience from the
advanced country. Meanwhile, on-post training should also be undertaken to
improve the management level.
6.2       Environmental Monitoring Plan
6.2.1     Monitoring Objectives
The main environmnental impacts due to the construction of JYRB result from the
pollution caused by construction work-ers, water pollution caused by underwater
foundation construction, noise generated from various construction machinery and
blasting practices as well as soil erosion, flying dust and asphalt smog caused by
earthworks, paving operation. when the bridge is put into operation, the waste gas,
flying dust and noise caused by high speed vehicles running through the bridge will
pollute the surroundings. In addition, the pollution resulted from the traffic accidents
should also be considered. For these reasons, a overall environmental monitoring
should be carried out to identify the pollution level and local environmental quality
change timely and comprehensively, the monitoring is absolutely crucial to the
bridge's environmental management.

7.3       Public Participation Investigation
According to the statistics of the investigation results, the opinions and requirements
of the local people to the proposed bridge can be summarized as follows:
7.3.1     Opinion on the Bridge Site and its Design
i       most people along the proposed bridge have no objection on the design
ii      local government hope that the entrance and exit can be built at the
alignment of the bridge, in addition the grade separation can also be built
at intersect to facilitate the local people.
iii     people hope that design and layout will be reasonable and rational, which
should circumvent the existing buildings, hydraulic facilities and occupy
as less arable land and houses as possible.
7.3.2     Attitudes on Bridge Construction
rAmong the received 94 questionnaire sheets, 96.8% people support the
bridge construction, 3.2% people hold the indifferent attitude.

and opening, ti is beneficial to both country and the people.
iii     The construction of the proposed bridge will not only improve the traffic
system, but also bring about the regional economic prosperity.
iv      The public sincerely hope the bridge will be built and open to traffic as
soon as possible.
7.3.3     Impact of Project on Local Economy
All people think that the bridge construction will promote the local
economic development.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
ii      Although the construction activities will occupy some farmland and
influent agriculture production to some extent, the completion of the
project can improve the investment environment, attract foreign input,
promote the development of tertiary industry and speed up local
economy.
7.3.4     Impact of Project on Local Natural and Social Environment
i       Impact on Rural Eco-environment: some plants have to be cut, animals
have to be resettled; the natural environment including water source and
air will be polluted more or less.
ii      Impact on Social Environment: part of farnland will be occupied, the
kinds of crops have to be changed; the population in the region may
increase, the economic and cultural live quality of local people will be
improved.
7.4       Investigation on Sensitive Issues
7.4.1     Culture Background and Customs of People living along the Bridge
Wuhan City is situated at the convergence of Yangtze River and Han River, Jing-
Guang railway line passes through the city, which is the intersect of the proposed
JZNAH and HRNAH as well, the city is composed of three Towns, i.e. Wuchang,
Hankou and Hanyan by river separation. In ancient times, Hankou was called
Xiakou which is one of most famous cities in ancient China, Wuchang and Hanvan
was also well-known in history. At present, Wuhan has become the political,
economic and cultural centre in Hubei Province, as a result, the advanced
communication is desperately indispensable.
7.4.2     Opinion on Resettlement
Houshan bridge site get through Junshan Town in north bank, where is near the
vehicle ferry station, it is adjacent to No. 669 military camp and Wuchang Water
Plant in south bank, where large amount of resettlement is needed including
residents, houses, small factories and a prirnary school.
SHRANGHI SHIP & SHIPPING RESEARCH INSTITUTE                                  135



PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Weijiawaan bridge site is located in lkm down strearn from Houshan bridge site,
farmland is in its north bank and hilly area in south bank, which circumvents the
town and ferry station, the resettlement load is little, which mainly is the scattered
houses.
The affected residents have to leave their original neighbourhood where they have
been used to, and resettle in a new and strange environment. Even if they can get
some economic compensation to set up new houses, they need to spend much time
and efforts to restore production and life order. On the other hand, the original
friendlv neighbourhood relationship may be estranged due to get apart. However,
the investigation results is demonstrated that most people are cooperative willingly,
they hope the demolition and resettlement shall be reduced to its minimum and save
farmland and village as much as possible.
As for the resettlement problem caused by the project construction, both production
and living quality of residents should be taken into account, the detail plan should be
made in advance so that the resettlement can be finished well, fast in one batch.
Meanwhile, the careful ideological work should also be done.
the farmland occupation by the construction will undoubtedly interfere with the local
agriculture production, for instance Junshan in north bank of Weijiawan is mainly
the cotton land, the proper arrangement should be made to satisfy the impacted
fanners. Meanwhile, lots of rural labours will have to leave their job on fields, local
authorities shall develop rural enterprises so that this part of farrners can get new
occupation or participate in the project construction. This will alleviate the burden of
the country, and also enable the farmers to have a satisfactory prospects.
To those who need to build new houses, the economic compensation and house-base
field should be taken into account, enable them not to suffer losses and have a better
living quality as soon as possible.
7.4.3     Impact on water source, noise and landscape tourism site
The proposed bridge is on the Large Junshan section of Yangtze River, the impact
on water environment is mainly due to the pollution caused by pier construction
which is easy to result in oil leakage, substrate silt resuspension, water stirring, etc.
The contractor should draw great attention to mitigate the water pollution.
Meanwhile, the self-purification of Yangtze river is helpful to cure the pollution due
to its broad span and huge water volume. As far as water source protection is
concerned, the recommended bridge site is superior to the Houshan bridge site.
SHANGHAI SHIP & SHIPPING RESEARCH INSTITUTE                                   136



PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Noise pollution in this project mainly result from construction facilities operation
(such as concrete mixer, piling driver and so on) and quariy explosion practice as
well as traffic noise when the bridge is opening to traffic. As long as the contractor
formulate the strict operation regulation and require the workers to abide by it, the
impact of noise can be reduced to its minimum.
There are several scenic spots and historical sits scattered in Wuhan "Three Town",
such as Wuchang East Lakle Landscape Zone, Hanyan Guiyuan Temple, the original
address of Central Peasant Movement Lecture and representative office of No. 8
Army, Wuhan Yangtze River and so on, but all there locations are quite far from the
proposed bridge site, so no adverse impact will be caused by project construction.
On the contrary, after the bridge open to traffic, more tourists will come here due to
facilitation of traffic, as a result, it will bring about the tourism prosperity, promote
the development of tertiary industry and local economy.
7.5       Conclusions of Public Participation
To sum up, the social and environrnental impact caused by JYRB construction can
be summarized as following three aspects:
i        Impact on Economy
The easy communication is absolutely significant to the prosperity of
local rural economy, development of rural enterprises, attraction foreign
investment. improving rural production output and living quality as well
as income. The project is beneficial to reform agricultural structure,
develop secondary and tertiary industries, harmonize the economic
layout of Wuhan. it will play an promoting role in regional socio-
economic development.
ii       Impact on Environmental Quality
The project, regardless at the preparation stage, construction stage or
operation stage, will undoubtedly have some impact on environmental
quality, such as noise, dust, pollution of water, air and ecology.
However, provided enough attention is paid with the proper measures, it
is believed that the impact can be reduced to its minimum.
iii     Sensitive Issues on Land Requisition, Resettlement. Minorities and
Tourism Sites
SHANGHAI SHIP & SHIPPING RESEARCH INSTITUTE                                   137



PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The land requisition and resettlement can result in farmland reduction,
problems on employment and house demolition and rebuild, it is
believed that all these can be solved as long as relevant laws and
regulations is fully executed (such as land administration law) and proper
arrangement is made. In addition, the secondary and tertiary industries
will be developed vigorously and the economic structure will be built up
harmonically. there is no any minorities living the concerning area, so no
such impact is present. Along the line of proposed bridge, no tourism
sites are found, therefore the impact on this issue is zero, on the contrary,
the bridge construction uill promote the tourism development.
Generally, the attitudes and opinions of local people to the project have been
collected by means of broad enquiry. The proponent should fully take into account
these opinions and suggestions and guarantee the living quality of the people
concemed will not deteriorate owing to the project.

ALTERNATIVES
8         Alternatives
8.1       Alternatives on Bridge Siting
In accordance with reviewing conclusions of project pre-feasibility study, two
altemative bridge sites were set forth, i.e. Weijiawan bridge site and Houshan bridge
site. the followning is the comparison analysis of two bridge site in views of
environmental impact.
Weijiawan bridge site is located in lkrn doNvn stream from Junshan Town, the width
between two bank- levees is 1100-1200m, the bridge axis intersects the water flow
and main navigation line in right angle, the river bed is in U type with lowest water
level of minus 5.9m, the width of river is 800-1 00m at the normal water level, the
highest flood level is 27.64m, the h.ighest navigation water level(1/20 frequency) is
27.1 Om, the maximum flood peak flow rate is 78800m3/s with minimum one of m3/s,
ordinary annual mean flow rate is 20600m3/s, the maximum surface flow velocity is
3m/s.
Houshan bridge site is situated in Junshan Town and Junshan vehicle ferry station to
its left bank-, the approach and the connected road get through Junshan Town and
hilly area, its right bank} is 200m upper strearn from Longchuanji, which pass
through the adjacent area of Wuchang Water Plant and the military camp, the terrain
of both banks is higher than that in Weijiawan bridge site, while the hydrographic
and geological status is similar to one in Weijiawan bridge site. Because Houshan
bridge site is near Tieban Island of upper reaches, so water flow and navigation way
varies with water level greatly, especially the last end of Tieban Island is quite near
the bridge site, the navigation adjustment distance for ships is very short, it will
undermine the navigation. In addition, the river flow rate in Houshan bridge is
quicker than one in Weijiawan bridge site, and the bridge axis intersects the water
flow and main navigation line in a angle of 80 degree, it is difficult to be adjusted to
90 degree.
There are five altemative bridge sites put forward in pre- feasibility study stage, after
screening, Houshan bridge site and Weijiawan bridge site are selected to fiurther
study, at that time, Houshan bridge site was recommended, but after detail
investigation and study in EIA stage, the preference situation is changed:
The advantages of Houshan bridge site are: short bridge length, high terrain and
comparatively low construction cost, while its disadvantages is remarkable:
the alignment at left bank pass through Junshan Town with heavy
resettlement amount.

ALTERNATIVES
ii      impact the vehicle ferry station and its administration building at left
bank.
iii     at right bank, the military camp and Wuchang Water Plant as well as its
subsidiary facilities such as underground pipe lines will have to be
demolished and/or relocated, so the difficulty and compensation
expenses are high.
iv      an oil wharf will be impacted at right bank.
v       the geological condition of the right bank is bener than one of the left
bank-, but it is generally inferior to one in Weijiawan bridge site.
vi      the navigation and flood proof will be undermined due to the present of
Tiebangzhou and Longchuanji.
Apart from relatively longer bridge line and lower terrain of its connected road, the
Weijiawan bridge is obviously superior to Houshan bridge site in all other aspects.
the followings are the environmental impacts imposed by the bridge site:
Requisition and Compensation
The left bank of Houshan bridge site mainly concems Junshan Town of
Caidian District and Junshan Vehicle Ferry Station, the alignment of
bridge head will pass through the town centre, ferry station and its
administration building, lots of neighbourhood houses, some small
factories, one primary school, existing vehicle ferry left station and its
administration building as well as part of existing road need to be
demolished and/or resettled. On the right bank, part of Wuchang water
plant and non-important houses and facilities of military camp will be
resettled, a fuel wharf of military camp will also be affected.
The consultation was conducted with all conceming parties, although
most of them agree resettlement, it is quite difficult to settle the new
address and need a lot of compensation budget, the interference to
production and live is serious, some key requisition project require
overelaborate procedures, especially for military camp resettlement.
Weijiawan bridge site is located 1 km down reaches from Houshan
bridge site, which circunvent the Junshan Town, Junshan Water Plant,
the military camp and its fuel wharf, the left bank of it is mainly dry, low
and spare lands with little resettlement, the dry and slope lands are

ALTERNATIVES
dominated at the right bank, only small amount of residents need to be
resettled, therefore less requisition and compensation is required for
Weijiaxvan bridge site.
Conclusively, Weijiaawan bridge site is superior to Houshan bridge site
on the issues of requisition, compensation, impacts on production and
live, etc.
ii      Impact of agricultural and forestry layout and other planning on
engineering
The engineering area is located in the southwest of Wuhan City, it is
investigated that no agricultural and forestry plan is made for this area, in
addition, in views of natural condition of planning scope, the planned
Wuhan Jingkou Industrial Development Zone and its harbour will be
affected a little by Weijiawan bridge site, to Houshan bridge site, more
impacts may be occurred, because there is no any detail arrangement but
a overall development aims is set for the zone and harbour, it is difficult
to identify the detail impact.
iii      Impact on air, water and noise
Due to Houshan bridge site will pass through the Junshan Town centre,
neighbours to Wuchang water plant and military camp, therefore the
proposed bridge do have some impacts on surroundings.
In accordance with EIA, after the bridge is opening to traffic, the traffic
exhausted gas discharge will not cause serious air pollution to the area
closely near the two bridge sites, however, the air condition in the area of
Junshan Primary School and Junshan Town in long term at Houshan
bridge site will exceed the standard, while only Huangjiawan of
Weijiawan bridge site is over standard with small impact due to small
amount of villagers there.
According to the results of noise assessment, the sensitive targets along
the Weijiawan bridge site are far from the noise source, and the village
scale is small, so the impact caused by noise is quite slight, the noise
levels in short, medium and long termn all attain the standard. On the
contrary, there are several sensitive targets near Houshan bridge site, the
noise levels at the military camp and Wuchang Water Plant in medium
and long term exceed the standard to some extent.
As far as water environmental impact is concerned, Houshan bridge site

ALTERNATIVES
is quite near Wuchang Water Plant, the bridge construction will bring
about some adverse impact on the water intake.
From above analysis, it is demonstrated that Weijiawan bridge site is
superior to Houshan bridge site on the aspects of air, noise and water
impacts.
To sum up, a summary table can be drafted according to the results of
above engineering and environment comparison, which is shown in table
8-1 -1 .

8.2      Alternatives on Bridge Structure
Yangtze River is the largest river and the golden inland navigation waterway in
China, the bridge structure determination and its construction must consider in depth
including geology, navigation, waterways, hydrology, topography and so on.
According to the initial reviewing result of pre-feasibility study, three bridge

ALTERNATIVES
structure altematives are put fornvard for companson, i.e. consecutive rigid structure
bridge, cable stay bridge and suspension bridge.
The consecutive T type rigid structure bridge is featured simple construction process,
low cost, easy maintenance, but less beauty, more underwater construction,
interfering  with navigation during construction, and long construction period due
to climate reasons.
The cable stay bridge is featured moderate span, good navigation capacity, lower in
cost, beauty, few underwater construction, less construction difficultv, which can
represent China's engineering design and construction level of 1990s.
The suspension bridge is featured:
i        single span, the structure looks magnificent and harmony
ii      excellent navigation capacity without piers in the river, which is
favourable to levee stability and security.
iii      very few underwater construction operation
iv       large steel consumption, high construction cost
v         due to large span, difficult to construction
Among three altemative bridge structures, the consecutive T type rigid structure is
the ideal structure due to its low cost, simple construction process, easy maintenance,
however, the strict navigation management must be enforce during the construction
stage.
The cable stay bridge structure own the characters of large span, beauty, rich
experience in design and construction, but high cost and difficulty in construction
arrangement.
The suspension bridge structure is featured high construction cost, great difficulty in
construction, and relatively poor stability, the geological condition of bridge site can
match the requirement of such structure, therefor this proposal is on bottom of the
list.
As far as the environmental impact is concerned, it is mainly the impact on water
quality during the overwater construction. As mentioned in section of water quality
impact assessment, the cable stay bridge has wide span with fewer underwater
piers(Weijiawan bridge site, 460m of single span, 2 underwater piers), which impact
on water quality is less than the consecutive T type structure(Weijiawan bridge site,
240m of single span, 6 underwater piers). No underwater pier is needed for the
suspension bridge, so the impact on water quality is least, but for the reasons
mentioned above, this proposal will not be considered any more. Table 8-1-2 refers

migratory fishes. The Yangtze River section where the
proposed project located is in the dispersing range of Class I
national conservative aquatic animals such as LVM, ASG
and PGM, but not in the main region of activities.
(ii)    The area which the proposed engineering will pass through is
a part of Jianghan Plain, where is the key production area for
grain, vegetables and cash crops. The vegetation cover along
the line is quite low, most species are in the situation of
bushes and grassy hill. The soil erosion in the proposed
engineering area mainly attribute to area erosion and gully
erosion.
9.13      Environmental Impact at Construction Stage
i         Impact on Air Quality
During construction, the main air pollution results from short term dust
pollution which is due to concrete mixing, vehicle transport and quarry
operation. As long as effective measures are taken, the dust pollution can
be reduced to its minimnum.
ii      Noise
During construction, the noise level of the area 15m away from the construction

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
machines can reach 75-105dB(A), which will cause significant impact on
surroundings, so the effective measures is necessary.
iii      Impact on Water Quality
During construction, water stirring and substrate silt resuspension will
result in adverse impact on water quality, the boring pile construction
process is applied in this project with slight impact on water quality.
Provided the effective measures are taken, the water quality impact
caused by domestic sewage of work}ers and stormn rain runoff can be
reduced to minimum extend.
iv       Impact on Aquatic Ecology
(i)     For years ecological investigation at mid and down reaches of
Yangtze River has shown that human activities such as over
fishing and high developed navigation are the main reasons
for decrease of the precious aquatic animals such as LVM,
ASG and PGM. The bridge construction will not endanger
aquatic animals and their living environment so long as
necessary measures are taken.
(ii)     The boring pile process is adopted during the underwater pier.
construction, which can greatly reduce the adverse impacts
caused by substrate silt resuspension, the waste silt generated
by drilling will be disposed at a designated site by barge,
therefore, little impact will be caused by the engineering
dredge practises and water silt disposal.
The substrate silt quality at Wuhan section of Yangtze
River is fair, small amount of silt resuspension caused by
dredging practices will not result in serious pollution.
(iii)   No precious wild aniimals which belong to the national
conservative species are found around the bridge sites, even
ordinary wild animals are rare in the area, so no adverse
impact on wild animals is existing.
v        Impact on Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
No important cultural relics and historic sites are found along the
proposed JYRB, therefore no impact needs to be considered.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1.4     Environmental Impact at Operation Stage
i Impact on Air Quality
Once JYRB is completed and open to traffic, under the prevailing wind
condition, the air pollution caused by vehicle exhausted gas is limited in
short and medium term, the air quality can attain Class II air quality
standard, NOx may be over standard at some sensitive points in lonQ
term.
ii       Noise
As prediction, for recommended bridge site, the noise impact on the
sensitive points is quite limited due to the relatively long distance from
the bridge and small village scale, the noise level in short, medium and
long term can meet the relevant standard.
At Houshan bridge site, noise level at several sensitive points will exceed
the standard, especially at the military carnp and Wuchang Water Plant
in medium and long term.
iii      Impact on Aquatic Animals
It is believed that the amount of lead containing chemical emitted from
exhausted gas is low enough, so that no adverse impact on the aquatic
animals will occur.
iv       Impact on Socio-economy
JYRB is a part of JZNAH and HRNAH as well as planned Wuhan out-
ring road, which is combined with national artery highway construction,
city expansion and Wuhan out-ring road construction, so it is significant
to perfect country's overall communication layout, promote national
economic development. The construction of JYRB will greatly alleviate
the traffic congestion situation of Wuhan, improve the investment
environment and speed up economic development of Wuhan.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1.5      Environmental Protection Mlitigation Mleasures
To draw maximum socio-economic benefits from JYRB and mitigate its
adverse impact, the following evrnntal protection measures have
been considered at the planning and design stage of JYRB:
(i)     rational  soil borrowving  for  bridge  connected  road
construction
(ii)     set up enough crossing passway to easy local people
(iii)    set up well equipped drainage system and roadbed protection
system
ii  The following mitigation measures are set forth to reduce the
envirorinmental impact during the construction stage
(i)     the vehicles and boats loading dusty materials in bulk should
be covered with canvas to prevent from dispersing, the ones
loading stone and sand must not be overloaded and fallen
apart
(ii)    the watering cars should be equipped at the route of tranisport
line to water regularly so that the fly dust can be restricted
effectively.
(iii)    lime, cement, sand and stone should be blended in stations
which location must be carefully selected.
(iv)    the asphalt melting process should be conducted in a sealed
process with dusters.
(v)     it is indispensable to select the low noise construction
machines, approaches, sites, regular maintenance should be
available to keep the facilities in good condition.
(vi)    the facilities with high noise such as piling drivers should not
be -opemated at the area of village, and at night. A reasonable
operation timetable should be mapped out.
(vii)    the boring pile construction process will be employed for
piers foundation construction to reduce the substrate silt
resuspension, the waste silt will be disposed at a designated

site.
(viii)   the sewage generated by worker camp should not be
discharged directly into the river, which should be collected
and treated on the bank.
(ix)    Strengthen the observation to precious aquatic animals and
take necessary protecting measures such as keeping away if
by any case some precious aquatic animals passes through.
(x)     If any cultural relics and historic remains are discovered
during the construction stage, the prompt information should
be given to concerning department, the construction activities
should be quitted if necessary.
iii     The following environmental protection measures are recommended
when the bridge is opening to traffic
(i)     improving vehicle's quality, installing waste gas purification
facilities, reducing pollutants discharge and noise.
(ii)    the service installations such as car park, gas station shall not
be located in the air sensitive area, the lands should be
utilized rationally with different function zoning, plantation
of tree and grass at the sides of road and side slope should be
encouraged to reduce air pollution, noise and beautify the
surroundings.
(iii)   a 100m long and 20m wide green belt shall be set up at the
Huangjiawan road section where air quality may exceed the
standard.
(iv)    a leading group should be arranged to handle with the
unexpected accidents, once the accident happens, the
emergency arrangement, such as personnel, vehicles,
facilities, first aid, should be taken to limit the accidental
scope in minimum.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1.6     Environmental Mlanagement Plan and Environmental Monitoring Plan
A bridge environmental protection administration institute should be established to
implement the environmental protection plan and monitoring plan of each stage and
cope with the unexpected accidents.
9.1.7     Public Participation
By' means of extensive inquiry of all concerning authorities and local people, most
people hold a understanding and support attitude to the bridge construction, the
opinions and suggestions which is closely concemed by local people should be
considered properly and adopted reasonably.
9.1.8     Alternatives
In views of both construction condition and environmental protection, the
recommended Weijiawan bridge site is superior to optional Houshan bridge site. it is
reasonable to recomnmend the consecutive T type rigid structure bridge and the cable
stav bridge as two altematives at the stage of feasibility study, the fiurther
optimization is required in preliminary design stage.
9.2       Recommendation
JYRB of JZNAH possess not only the magnificent socio-economic benefits, the
bridge itself will also generate remarkable benefits. Although it may cause some
environmental impact, such negative impacts can be mitigated provided that
effective monitoring and environmental protection measures are carried out so as to
protect the living environment and improve the living quality of local people.
Conclusively, in consideration of either environmental protection, social benefits,
economic benefits, the JYRB construction is feasible.

APPENDIX
The Statement About the Present Situation of LVM
Due to the influence of.human activities, the quantity of LVM decreased
seriously. We think that there are about 1fiTLVMs in the Yangtze River by the
means of photo judging in 1989 and 1990. We found only one LVM three times
through the investigation from Wuhan to Yangtze River Estuary in the later
half of 1994. In recent years, catching operations are taken at the Tiane Islet
(the natural conservation area) and Tongling (the breeding farm) yearly, and
sometimes few LVMs can be found, sometimes no one can be found in several
months. According to these situations, we consider that there are tens of LVMs
living in Yangtze River.                                c 1o
"The Yangt7i  River section irK Junshan of Wuhan', is in the range LVM
dispersi but not in the main area of-activitie§--nhw. The possibility ofTLVVM
appearing is little, and it is passing through occasionally if someone is found.
Suggestion is that the observation must be strengthened and protection
measures must be taken when LVM is found.
To conserving the LVMs, the natural conservation area of 135 km long in the
Yangtze River section from  Luoshan to Xintankou and the semi-natural
breeding farms at Ton_ling of Anhui and Tiane Islet of Shishou have been set
up.
