3.5 Main Environmental Impact Analysis
Based on the engineering features and the current environmental status, the main
environmental impact caused by the project on the proposed road area can be
summarized as follows.
(1) For the links of Dawu and Huayuan, as newly built road, the impact in the
survey and route selection stage is the conflict of the road alignment with the local
city and township development program.
(2) The existing road will be used for the Xiaogan link, and the impact is mainly
in the construction period. Therefore daily traffic management will have to be
6



strengthened to reduce the impact on the to the minimum. The impacts caused by the
construction of the connection roads of Dawu and Huayuan are mainly those on the
natural environment and eco-environmental system, such as transformation of
landform, occupation of farmland and forest land, and the impact on water resources
and the irrigation system, etc.. The impact on social environment is mainly relocation
and resettlement.
(3) In the design of the alignment of the proposed connection roads, such noise
sensitive areas as resident areas, schools, hospitals, etc., have been taken into
consideration to be away from the road, and the traffic volune will be small according
the forecast. Therefore the environmental impact caused by noise and vehicle
emissions along the road area will be small.

CHAPTER 4  CURRENT ENVIRONMENT CONDITION AND
ASSESSMENT
To understand the current status of the environrnent along the proposed road, the
environmental sensitive areas of Lengpeng Center School of Guangshui, Liuwan
Primary School near the Dawu interchange, Huanshui were selected for the on-the-
spot investigations to be made for the Dawu link road project, with the noise level, air
quality and water quality being monitored and measured; and environmental sensitive
areas of Xiaohe, Jinfeng Primary School of Xiaochang county, Huayuanzhen were
selected for the Huayuan link road project, with the noise level, air quality and water
quality being monitored and measured; and the environmental sensitive areas of
Sancha, Xiaotianlu Caopu Primary School were selected for the Xiaogan link road
project, with the noise level, air quality and water quality being monitored and
measured. The current status environmental monitor work for the connection road has
been conducted by Xiaogan Environmental Monitor Station.

Notc: "-- stands for the measured noise level is below the standard level.
It can be seen from Table 4-2 that the measured noise level at all the sensitive
spots is below the standard limit, which show that the environment condition is good
for the local residents and the school students in terms of noise level. The low noise
level environment is favourable for the road project.
4.2 Current Status and Assessment of Air Environment
Table 4-3 shows the summary of the monitored current environmental conditions
along the proposed connection road areas in terms of air quality.
It can be seen from Table 4-3 that the environmental condition along the
proposed connection road area is good in terms of air quality, with the measured
concentrations of CO, NOx being below that specified in the air quality standard
GB3095-82, except for that of TSP, which is a little over the standard limit at
individual spot of Huayuanzhen. The good air environrment is favourable for the road
project.
4.3 Current Status and Assessment of Water Environment
Table 4-3 shows the summary of the monitored current environmental conditions
along the proposed connection road areas of Huanshui and Huayuanzhen in terms of
the surface water quality.
Comparing with the class II standard of the surface water quality specified in
GB3838-88 "Surface Water Quality Standard", the measured PH, BOD5, oil materials,
Pb are all below the upper limit of the standard, which show that the surface water
quality along the proposed area is good.

CHAPTER 5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FORECAST AND
ASSESSMENT
5.1 Ecological Environmental impact assessment
5.1.1 Impact on agricultural ecological environmental system
The impact of the proposed road project on agricultural production along the road
area mainly arises from the permanent land occupation and additional work for the
irrigation system.
Total land occupation by the proposed road construction is 1005.7 mu, with the
details shown in Table 5-1.
Table 5-1 Land occupation by the proposed road by land use (Unit: mu)
Road               Permanent land occupation by land use    Temporary use
Paddy   Dry   Fish  Lotus Fruit Vegetabl Resident Forest  Paddy   Dry
Dawu link  68.2  146.3  8.4    /    /    26.9   19.4   21.1   72.3  118.2
Huayuan link 259.4  112.2  23.3    /    /  /      /    47.3   26.6   11.4
Xiaogan link  210.0  57.9   1.9     /      /     3.3     /      /      /
It can be seen from Table 5-1 that the paddy and dry land account for most of the
land occupation of the total occupied by the proposed road. Occupation of the farm
land, paddy and dry, will cause direct loss of the agricultural output in the short term,
which will reduces farmer's income. However, the mileage of the road is short, the
proportion of the land occupied by the road to the grand total land area of the directly
affected area by the proposed road is very small. So the impact on the whole area in
terms of land occupation is very small. The loss of the agricultural output can be made
up by adjustment of land use or by making use of the compensation for new industry
development. Due to the improvement of transport system by the proposed road
project, there will be more land use development for uncultivated land. On the other
hand, the new road will give impetus to the area economic development, which is
good for marketing of the local farm and township enterprise products. The road
construction and operation will provide more employment opportunities for the local
people. Due to the improvement of the road network system the land use pattern will
be changed with added value, which will eventually increase the agricultural and
industrial output along the proposed road area.
To ensure proper operation and function of the water system and the irrigation
system, 3 large bridges, with total length of 508.05 m, 2 medium bridge , with total
length of 85.9 m, 8 small bridges, with total length of 160.3 m, 73 culverts, with
average 3.6 culverts every one kilometer (not including those of Xiaogan link), have
been designed for the road, based on great amount of on-the-spot investigation, taking
into considerations the flood discharge and control as well as the efficiency of the
irrigation system along the proposed road area.

5.1.2 The impact on the wild life and vegetation
(1) The impact on the wild life and vegetation caused by the road engineering
construction mainly includes the change of or interference with the wild life's habitat
environment.
(1) The noise during the construction period produced by the construction
machines and the noise during the operation period produced by the traffic will
disturb the living environment; and the damage to the local trees, shrubs and grasses
will drive the wild life migrated. In addition the road facility may change the wild
life's haunts of corridor and habitat area. The noise during the construction period will
disappear with the end of the construction, but the noise caused by the traffic will
exist for a long time. The wild life along the proposed road is small in quantity and
usually migratory, therefore the road project will have little impact on the wild life
along the proposed road.
(2) The impact on the vegetation mainly arises from stone and earth work and
limited in the land occupation area, without great impact on the overall green belt
coverage rate of the Xiaogan area. There is no impact on the vegetation distribution
along the road area. The damage of the vegetation caused by the construction may be
rehabilitated by plantation in the operation period.
5.1.3 Impact of water and soil erosion
The total land acquisition is about 1005.7 mu for the proposed road project, with
total earth and stone work of 734.7 km3, which is not great. Besides, the road will be
built by ordinary class II standard at slight hilly area, with only few deep cutting and
filling section. Therefore the water and soil erosion during the construction period will.
be small. There will be 3900 m2 drainage and protection facilities and the green belt
engineering measures implemented in the operation period, which will reduce or
mitigate the water and soil erosion impact arising from the construction period to
the minimum.
5.2 Social Environment Impact Forecast and Assessment
5.2.1 The road will promote rapid economic development along the road area
The proposed road is the major collection and distribution road link of the main
motorway of Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road, an important link of the old and new
national road 107 as well as part of the local and provincial transport network system.
Therefore the implementation of the connection road project will give great impetus to
the local and provincial social economic development.
5.2.2 Resettlement
The selection of the alignment of the road will follow the following principles, in
addition to the class II engineering standard.
(1) On the premise of being up to the second standard, it is necessary to reduce
12



the farm land occupation as much as possible, to reduce earth and stone work
reasonably;
(2) It is necessary to reduce relocation and resettlement work by keeping aloof
from the densely populated areas and built-up areas as far as possible;
(3) Pay attention to protection of cultural and historic relics by holding aloof from
the relics site;
(4) To keep aloof from such environmental sensitive areas as hospital, school, and
other cultural and public heath utility facilities;
(5) It is necessary for the road to be in harmony with the local city, county and
township development program, so as to bring into full play of the link road function
in social economic development;
(6) To pay attention to environmental protection and keep the balance of the eco-
system.
The total area of relocated houses will be 13327.0 m, of which 5407 m is for
Dawu link, 2711.0 m for Huayuan link, and 5129.0 for Xiaogan link. To ensure the
engineering progress by time schedule of the project and the proper resettlement for
the local relocated people, a special resettlement office has been established by the
Owner of the project, with detailed resettlement programn being made for the project.
The resettlement work will follow the principles of reaching unanimity through
consultation, unified and appropriate arrangement, without future trouble, for the
public interests as well as the overall project.
Compensations will be made for those who are to be relocated, according the
provincial local government policy and relative documents. The compensated money
will be used for the local land development under the collective leadership of the local
village, to improve farm work, to establish enterprise and to arrange employment. The
relocation and resettlement work is relatively small and the living standards for the
relocated people will not be affected conspicuously.
The relocated people will get the compensation for their houses and be resettled
by unified arrangement of new house under the leadership of the local government.
The living standard of the relocated people will not be affected.
5.3 Acoustic Environment Impact Forecast and Assessment
5.3.1 Acoustic environment impact during construction period
The noise during the road construction period mainly come from the road
construction machines and transport vehicles. Various construction machines will be
used for this road project including excavator, bulldozer, leveler, roller, etc., and also
the drilling and piling machines, explosion in earth and stone work, which will
produce noise during construction work.
Noise impact caused by construction machines is temporary or short term and
also inevitable. To protect the resident from being disturbed by the noise and the
13



construction workers' health, necessary measures will be taken to mitigate the noise
impact.
5.3.2 Noise forecast and assessment in the operation period
(1) Forecast model
According to the requirements of the terms of references for environment impact
assessment, by using the environrmental assessment specifications proposed by the
MOC, the traffic noise will be forecasted. The formula used for the forecast is as
follows.
N,
(LA.)i = L. i + IO1g( -)   -  ALDs+ AL     ALpv  -  13(dB)
V1T
where: (LA,)i - per hour traffic noise level, recorded by i-type vehicle through the
measuring spot for the daytime and nighttime forecast;
L.j i   - average radiation noise level of i-type vehicle, dB;
i       - large, medium, small vehicle;
N1      - daytime or nighttime average hourly traffic of i-type vehicle,
Veh./h.;
V1 - average speed of i-type vehicle, km/h;
T       - forecast time of (LA,), here it is 1 h, h;
ALDS    - noise damping of i-type vehicle at forecast spot in a distance of r
from the noise equivalent driving line, dB;
ALLG    - traffic noise correction caused by road longitudinal grade, dB;
ALp, - traffic noise correction caused by the pavement, dB;
The traffic noise level (LA,q){,,lC received by different types of vehicle at the
forecast spot in the daytime or nighttime can be calculated as follows:
(LA.q)taffic = 10 1g [l0O' (A`)L + 100.1(LAO)M + 1 OO (LAO.Iq ] -  AL, -  AL2
where: AL, - traffic noise correction caused by curve or limited length of road, dB;
AL2 - traffic noise correction caused by barriers between road and forecast
spot, dB;
(2) Based on the traffic forecast, the features of road engineering and the
landform along the road area, the parameters have been selected for the forecast by
using the model. Table 5-2, Table 5-3 and Table 5-4 show the road traffic noise
forecast in the operation period.

It can be seen from the forecast that in the operation period of the road the noise
level in the area at distance beyond 50 m from the road will below the class IV
standard limit specified in GB3096-93 (daytime 70dB(A), nighttime 55dB(A)).
(3) Impact assessment on the sensitive spot
The noise sensitive spots along the proposed road area are listed in Table 5-5. The
envirorunental noise level for each sensitive spot can be forecasted by summing up the
forecasted traffic noise and the current background noise level. Table 5-6 shows the
noise level at each sensitive spot in the operation period, in comparison with standard
noise level limit specified in the standard of GB3096-93 (average area applies to class
IV standard, and the area of cultural and education, hospital applies to class II
standard). The noise level needs to be reduced in the future for each sensitive spot is
listed in Table 5-7.

Note: "-" stands for no overage over the standard limit.
It can be seen from the Table above that there are some overage of the noise level
over the standard limit by the year of 2020 for some sensitive spots. Noise
environmental monitor work at the sensitive spots will be conducted, on the base of
which appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the noise level.
5.4 Air Environment Impact Forecast and Assessment
5.4.1 Environmental impact assessment for the construction period
Air pollution during the construction period is mainly caused by the dusts arising
from the construction machine operation at the worksite. So TSP will be major
assessment item.
(1) Dust pollution caused by earth mixing
There are two types of earth mixing plant: stationary mixing plant and road
mixing plant. The road mixing is mobile, which will cause pollution all the way along
the road, but the pollution impact area is small. If road mixing plant is used, the TSP
concentration in the air will be below the class II standard level at place 50 m from the
road. If stationary mixing plant is used there will be no impact on places 150 m from
the road.
(2) Dust pollution caused by transport vehicles during construction
16



During construction period, there will be TSP pollution caused by construction
materials transport, including loading and unloading of the materials. On-the-spot
investigation shows that the TSP concentration measured at places over 150 m from
the road will be over the class II standard level, which indicates that the TSP pollution
caused by materials transport can be serious along the road construction area.
(3) Impact assessment for Dawu link and Huayuan link bitumen pavement
construction on the air environmental
Bitumen pavement will be built for Dawu link and Huayuan link. The bitumen
smoke produced by bitumen concrete mixing plant will pollute the air around the area.
According to on site survey, the bitumen smoke produced by the MARINI company
made MV2A bitumen mixer, measured bitumen smoke at place in the leeward
direction 100 m away will be below the class I standard level specified in the Bitumen
Industry Emission Standard. Therefore the bitumen mixing plant should be
established at places, from which no sensitive spot should be within 200 m in the
leeward direction, such as hospital, school, or densely populated area.
5.4.2 Air environmental impact forecast for operation period
In the operation period the air environmental impact mainly comes from the
vehicle emissions. CO and NOx pollutants will be forecasted for the operation period
impact assessment, with forecast years of 2000, 2010 and 2020.
(I) Forecast model
The continuous vehicle emission forms a linear pollutant source. According to the
Gauss disperse system, the pollutants from the continuous linear source can be
calculated by integration, with its concentration being the sum of those of all the
contributing spot sources, and the dispersion of the linear source is related to wind
direction. The calculation model is as follows.
2           QL                     -He2
C(X, 0) = (-)l                       exp
7X    U - SinO [ozo + az (X)]    2 [ao + Cz (X)]2
where: C  -  pollutant concentration at spot x from the linear source (mg/m3);
X  -  vertical distance from the linear source to the leeward measuring
spot;
0  -  angle between wind direction and road (0);
QL -  linear intensity of the road (mg/m i    s);
U  -  wind speed over road (m/s);
He -  average effective height of the linear source (m);
cz -  vertical dispersion parameter (m);
szo -  initial vertical dispersion parameter (assuming 3 m).
(2) The forecast results
The forecasted air pollutants of CO and NOx caused by the proposed road traffic
are listed in Table 5-8 - Table 13.
17



According the analysis of the forecast, the air pollutants of CO and NOx
produced by the traffic during the operation period of the proposed road will be small,
which indicates that there will be enough bearing capacity for the air environmnent
along the road area. Table 5-14 shows the class II standard level specified in the Air
Quality Standard.
(3) Sensitive spot forecast
Table 5-15 shows the air pollution conditions at each sensitive spot along the road
area, which indicates that the concentrations of CO and NOx on both sides of the road
are all below the class II standard level specified in the Air Quality Standard.
Therefore, there will be no overage of the CO and NOx pollutant concentrations over
the standard level at the sensitive spots along the road area.

CHAPTER 6 ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Environmental Protection Measures in Design Period
(l) In the design stage the farm land occupation for the Dawu link and Huayuan
link should be as less as possible and it is necessary to keep the road aloof from the
environmental sensitive areas such as school, resident area, etc., to reduce the air
pollution and noise impact. Meanwhile it is also necessary to keep the road aloof from
the areas with poor geological condition and cultural relics as far as possible. As for
Xiaogan link, it is necessary to strictly control the land use along both sides of the
road.
(2) The route design should follow the principle of "near the city but not entering
into the'city" for the road, and should be combined with local area development
program.
(3) The bridges and drainage system should be designed taking into account of
flood discharge and control without damage to the local farmland irrigation system.
(4) Appropriate trees and plants suitable for the local climate should be selected
for the green belt, which should be conducted in the design stage.
(5) Land acquisition and resettlement should be properly arranged so that the
living standard of the resettled people and the production level should not be lowered.
(6) Quarry, earth borrowing site and wastes treatment site should be properly
selected and be kept far away from such sensitive areas as resident area, school, etc.,
to protect the people from being affected by dusts pollutant.
(7) High filling and deep cutting should be avoided to protect the existing
vegetation. The water discharged from the drainage system should not damage the
farm land.
(8) Compensations should be made for the ponds occupied by the proposed road,
based on the original function of the pond. For the fish pond near the road, the water
from the drainage system should not be discharged directly into the pond.
6.2 Environmental Protection Measures in Construction Period
(1) Noise during the construction period will disturb the local people living close
to the construction site, therefore when there is resident area less than 50 m away from
the construction site, night time machine work should not be arranged from 22:00 to
6:00 next morning.
(2) Appropriate work shift should be arranged for workers so that they will not be
26



affected by the noise too much. And the construction machines should be properly
maintained to keep the machine in good performance and the lowest possible noise
level.
(3) Construction machine noise will be detrimental to human hearing capability.
It is recommended that according to the labour healthy standard, when noise level
exceeds 90dB, every 3 dB increase of the noise level should result in half reduction of
the daily work time. Besides, necessary labour protection measures should be adopted,
such as wearing ear plug or cotton, etc..
(4) The cement mixing plant should be set up at the area, with no densely
populated area being found in a distance of 200 m in the leeward direction.
(5) The stationary lime mixing plant should be used as much as possible. Two
stage dust collection device should be provided for the mixing plant. The lime and
bitumen mixing plant should set up at the area, with no such sensitive areas as
resident area, school, and hospital being found in a distance of 200 m in the leeward
direction.. Totally closed mixer should be used when road mixing plant is adopted.
(6) The construction materials yard should be kept in a distance away from the
resident area, and should be covered. When the bulk materials to be transported,
totally closed loading system should be adopted to prevent spilling of the materials
over the road.
(7) Watering will be conducted on the road construction site in dry season,
particular attention should be paid to the lime soil mixing plant.
(8) To reduce temporary land occupation as much as possible and reduce the
occupation time, and return the land back to original use in time. Training for
construction workers is also necessary to protect the wild life and vegetation.
(9) It is better to select highland and uncultivated land as earth borrowing site.
Vegetation should be planted on the earth borrowing site and the spoil area soon after
construction, to prevent soil erosion.
(10) During bridge construction period the waste materials should be disposed
properly not to pollute the water body nor block the river.
(I1) The solid wastes and garbage should be treated regularly in good order.
(12) The public utilities should not be interrupted by the road construction.
Temporary electric supply facilities, wires, communication lines should be provided
whenever it is necessary.
27



(13) Pay attention to dietetic hygiene during the construction period, to prevent
the breeding of flies and mosquitoes, and to prevent epidemic diseases from
spreading.
(14) During the construction period, it is important to made known to the public
and the construction team to understand the significance of the cultural relics
protection. Once there is any underground cultural relics discovered, the cultural relics
administration bureau should be informed of the event, and stop excavating and
should not resume to work until proper treatment and procedures is finished.
(15) During the construction period for Xiaogan link, the construction worksite
traffic management should be strengthened, to prevent accident and traffic congestion.
Meanwhile the Contractor should make appropriate transport plan for construction
materials to reduce interference with the existing road traffic.
6.3 Environmental Protection Measures in Operation Period
(1) The forecast shows that the noise impact caused by the proposed road is small.
In view point of long term consideration, it is recommended that the land use planning
department should control the land use along both sides of the road. No more new
environmental sensitive buildings such as resident houses, schools, hospitals should
be built along both sides of the road.
(2) To strengthen traffic management and road maintenance work, so as to keep
the road traffic and the pavement in good condition.
(3) The noise level at three sensitive spots in Xiaogan link will be a little over the
standard limit in the mid term by the year of 2010, and will be more overage by the
year of 2020. Therefore it is recommended that monitor work should be strengthened
at these spots and appropriate measures should be taken based on the monitored
results.
(4) Enforcement of the regulations for dangerous goods transport should be
strengthened to prevent the accident.

CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITOR AND MANAGEMENT
7.1 Environmental Monitor
(1) Purpose and principles
The purpose of environmental monitor is to check the implementation of various
measures to mitigate pollution, to check the environmental forecast and to provide
basis for the time schedule and implementation scheme adjustment for environment
protection measures. The principle to set forth the monitoring plan is the major impact
in different period.
(2) Monitor item
The environment impact mainly happens in the construction period and the
operation period. During the construction period, the items monitored shall be the
TSP, and noise; the main environmental impact in operation period is noise.
(3) Environmental monitor organization
According to the administration system, it is recommended that the
environmental monitor work for the proposed road project be undertaken by Xiaogan
Municipal Environmental Monitor Station. To ensure the monitor plan to be
implemented, the Owner of the project should sign a contract with the monitor station
before the construction, for the monitor work during the construction period; and
before the road put into operation another contract should be signed for the monitor
work during the operation period. The cost for the monitor work during the
construction period is about CNY 0.1 million, and that during the operation period
CNY 0.1 million, with a total of CNY 0.2 million.
(4) Environmental monitor plan
Based on the forecasted impact, the environmental monitor plan has been made,
as shown in Table 7-1 and table 7-2.

CHAPTER 8 CONCLUSIONS
(I) Due to the earth and stone cutting and filling work, road engineering will
change the landform along the road area to some extent, the impact of which, however,
can be reduced to the minimum by appropriate protection measures in engineering
work, during the design, construction and operation period. Therefore the impact of
water and soil erosion along the road area will be small. There is little impact on the
farm land irrigation system along the road area. The bridges and culverts designed for
the road will ensure to bring into full play of the irrigation system.
(2) There is no wild life and primeval forest preservation zone, nor there is any
precious animal plant having been discovered or distributed around the area. The short
term impact caused by land occupation can be made up by industrial and farm
products processing development. The long term green beautification along the road
will compensate the damage to the vegetation to certain extent.
(3) The road project will produce great social economic benefit after the road put
into operation. It will give big impetus to the local and the provincial social economic
development .
(4) Land acquisition and relocation is the main social impact caused by the road
project, which can be reduced to the minimum by appropriate government policy and
proper organization of the resettlement. It has been recommended that appropriate
compensation be made to reduce the impact combined with well organized local area
development.
(5) The assessment shows that the air quality and the acoustic environment are
and will be good. The noise and air pollutant impact in the construction period is
temporary and small.
As mentioned above the proposed road project is feasible in terms of
environmental protection. There will be no significant pollution caused by the
construction and operation of the road project. So long as the environmental
protection and mitigation measures being taken in different stages of the road project
development, the road project can be developed in harmony with the socio-economic
development and the environmental protection development. Therefore, the proposed
road engineering project is feasible. Due to the great socio-economic benefit brought
about by the road project to the Xiaogan city and the whole Hubei province, it is
recommended that the road construction should be started and completed as early as
possible.
