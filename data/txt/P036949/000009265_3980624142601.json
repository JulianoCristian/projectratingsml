This\n            project's specific objectives are to 1) relieve road\n            transport congestion and improve the integration of\n            interregional trade and commerce; 2) strengthen\n            institutional capacity at the Hubei Provincial\n            Communications Department (HPCD) and related institutions;\n            3) develop a policy dialogue in the areas of commercializing\n            and corporatizing provincial expressway companies and\n            highway maintenance management; and 4) improve road\n            transport safety. The project has six components. The first\n            constructs expressway sections; constructs administration,\n            service, and maintenance facilities; and supplies and\n            installs electrical, electronic, and mechanical equipment.\n            The second connects the expressway sections to existing road\n            infrastructure. The third constructs supervision services\n            for all expressway sections and their interconnecting roads.\n            The fourth provides studies and technical assistance. The\n            fifth trains staff in all aspects of highway planning,\n            design, construction, operation, finance, and maintenance.\n            The sixth finances equipment that controls construction\n            quality and monitoring, operates and maintains expressways,\n            maintains the road network, and bridge information system as\n            well as the pavement and maintenance management systems."}, "docdt": "1998-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
