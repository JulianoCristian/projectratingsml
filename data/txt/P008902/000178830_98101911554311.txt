APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
SUMMARY
i.        Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) established in 1950 is
the oldest and one of the largest development finance companies assisted
by the Bank. As of June 30, 1972, TSKB's assets reached LT 2.2 billion
($158 million). Its local currency resources have been largely provided
by the Government and the foreign exchange resources by the Bank/IDA, USAID,
and KfW. The Bank and IDA have made nine loans and credits totalling
$128 million. IFC is presently holding 10.8% of TSKB's share capital.
ii.       TSKB continues to make a significant contribution to the Turkish
economy in providing long-term finance to the private manufacturing sector.
It has financed around 8% of total investment in private manufacturing
industry during the period from 1968 to mid-1972. Its financing would
have been greater if resources in lira and foreign currency had not been
the limiting factor. The level of commitments was about the same in 1969
and 1970 (approximately $30 million equivalent per year, including bond
issue guarantees), but declined in 1971 to $26 million equivalent due
mainly to the fact that the Government during the six month period from
May to October, 1971, completely suspended issuing industrial investment
certificates involving imported equipment. But this situation has now
changed. There is a considerable upswing in new investment demand. In the
first nine months of 1972, TSKB's commitments reached $ 37.9million, which
is 95% higher than the level reached in 1971. TSKB's equity operations
while not rising as much as expected, have been helpful in broadening the
securities in which the investors can invest. Its bond guaranteeing
and underwriting activities have contributed to the development of a
capital market in Turkey. However, much remains to be done in this field.
iii.      As a consequence of the devaluation of the lira in August 1970,
TSKB's arrears increased sharply. The situation has improved since then
and it is expected to return to the normal and satisfactory pattern early
in 1973. In the meantime, adequate provisions have been set up for possible
losses. TSKB's portfolio is well-diversified and sound. TSKB is a profit-
able institution. In 1971, the return on average equity reached 18.2%,
compared with 17.4% in 1970. In 1972, it is is expected to rise to 19%.
iv.       TSKB's management and staff are capable and experienced.  After
reorganization of the appraisal departments in early 1971, TSKB's appraisal
work showed further improvement. Follow-up procedures are thorough.
During the past two years, TSKB has given more attention than in the past
to its developmental role, and has taken steps to identify and finance
more projects in the under-developed regions in Turkey. In financing pro-
jects, TSKB has given priority to export-oriented projects.
v.        TSKB's business outlook is bright.  TSKB's commitments are
expected to rise from $43 million equivalent in 1972 to $112 million in



- iv -
1974 and $166 million in 1977. For the two calendar years 1973 and 1974,
TSKB would need LT 2.6 billion to finance its commitments. To meet its
foreign exchange needs of $120 million equivalent, TSKB expects to obtain
loans from EIB and KfW totalling $46 million. At the end of 1972, TSKB
will have uncommitted foreign currency resources amounting to $2 million.
TSKB is making an effort to raise funds in the Euro currency market and
partly with the help of IFC, TSKB expects to be able to raise at least
$25 million from such sources in the next two years, thus leaving a net
resource gap of around $48 million.  A Bank loan of $40 million will en-
able TSKB to meet the major part of the remaining gap and at the same time
provides an incentive for TSKB to raise even more funds elsewhere.
vi.       Local currency resources needs would be LT 900 million.  Net cash
generation for the two years would amount to LT 250 million and other firm
resources, including re-use of EIB loan repayments, would be LT 325 million.
The net local currency resource gap is around LT 325 million, of which
LT 175 million would be for tourism financing. This gap takes into account
industrial long term financing needs of Turkey's private sector which TSKB
would not realistically expect to finance by guaranteeing enterprises'
bond issues. However, TSKB's access to domestic resources, other than
capital on concessionary terms from the Government, is limited to bond
issues at a cost above TSKB's own authorized lending rate. Barring any
rapid changes of the policy of the Government which would result in a
better adjustment between certain interest rates and market forces. TSKB
should be prepared to float bond issues at a negative spread to the order
of LT 150-200 million over the next two years. These borrowings would
cover a substantial part of TSKB's resource gap. The balance of the gap, i.e.
about LT 150 million could be financed either with borrowings from commercial
banks which could become substantial and attractive for TSKB if the Government
agreed to forego the tax it charges on inter-bank transfers or, indirectly,
with a possible increase in bond guarantees.  The matter of the use by TSEB
of the interest earned on Bank funds to cover borrowings at a negative spread
and the waiving of the inter-bank transfers tax have been discussed during
negotiations. For the major part of tourism financing, TSKB has to rely on
resources to be made available by the Government on concessionary terms.
vii.      TSKB continues to be a suitable and creditworthy borrower from
the Bank. It has good business prospects. The bank should make a loan
to TSKB in the amount of US$40 million equivalent which would enable TSKB
to meet an important part of its resource gap in the two-year period
ending December 31. 197h. A loan in that amount will not meet all of the
forecast resource gap in this period and therefore should provide enough
additional incentives to TSKB to raise more foreign resources than it
currently plans to do.
viii.     The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to loans
to development finance companies, including the standard commitment
charge. In recognition of TSKB's recent upgrading of its project appraisal
work, an increase in the free limit appears justifiable. It should be set at



v 
$1 million, as compared to the $750,000 applicable to present Bank loans
to TSKB. Even with a $1 million free limit, the Bank could expect to
receive for approval sub-loans totalling about 65% of the proposed loan.
An aggregate free limit should be set at $12 million. TSKB's debt limit,
as now defined, should be set at five times equity.
ix.       W^Jith its present foreign exchange lending rate at 12% TSKB would
enjoy a spread of 4 3/h% on the proposed Bank loan.  During negotiations,
TSKB has agreed to forego some of the benefits it would receive from such
spread by undertaking to mobilize lira resources from the market as indicated
above, and to prepare and implement a special program, in consultation with
the Bank,designed to promote industrial enterprises in less developed
regions of Turkey and tourism projects. For the latter purpose, TSKB will
set aside annually not less than 25% of the spread earned on the propoLsed
loan for meeting promotional and other costs resulting from the execution
of the program.
X.        Within the framework of the Bank's economic work in Turkey, the
Bank intends to initiate a dialogue with the Government before the end of
1973 concerning the need to bring lending and borrowing rates into better
balance with a view to facilitating at an early date TSKB's and other
term financing institutions' resource mobilization efforts at home and
abroad. As part of this dialogue, there should be an examination of the
possible advantage of abandoning the 25 percent expenditure tax on
inter-bank borrowings.
xi.       Arrangements have also been made with TSKB to review in detail
with the Bank the findings of the Bank's Special Studies M4ission with
a view to reaching understandings concerning the operational conclusions to
be drawn from the Special Studies Mission's work.






APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      I'urkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (Industrial Development Bank
of Turkey, or TSKB) was established in 1950. It is the oldest and one of
the largest of the World Bank's clients among development finance companies.
The Bank and the Association have made five loans and four credits to it,
totalling "'128 million. IFC became a shareholder in 1963 and presently
holds 10.8% of TSKB's share capital.
1.02      This report reappraises TSKB in connection with its request for
a new Bank loan and focuses on developments since the previous Bank loan
was made in November 1970.  Because of the Bank's familiarity with TSKB,
history and general description of the institution are kept to a minimum.
Such information can be found in the preceding Appraisal Reports. A de-
tailed review of' the economy of Turkey is contained in "Current Economic
Developments and Prospects of Turkey", R-72-236, dated September 18, 1972.
1.03      In October and November, a Special Studies Mission visited TSKB
to revdiew in depth the actual economic merits and impact of the Bank support
of Turkish industry through TSKB. The conclusions of this mission are likely
to be available some time in March 1973.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
2.01      Chrer the past decade, Turkey has demostrated its ability to
sustain an ambitious rate of economic growth, but with continuing reliance
on external aid on favorable terms. Efforts have been made to transform a
predominantly traditional agricultural economy into one based to a much
greater extent on manufacturing. These efforts rested in part on Govern-
ment intervention and the activity of State enterprises. The devaluation
and stabilization program introduced in August 1970 reflected the Govern-
ment's aim to develop exports with a view to accelerating progress towards
external viability. Indeed, following the devaluation in August 1970,
exports and workers' remittances increased sharply. Exports were also favored
bv higher cotton prices and -textile exports to the EEC. In 1971, Turkey's
gross exchange reserves increased by about $350 million, bringing their level
to a record "772 million at the end of 1971.   They were around tl billion
at the end of September 1972.
2.02      Tn 1971, GDP increased by about 7.8% in real terms, compared with
4.9% in 1970 and an average growth of 6.3% during 1962-1971. Agriculture,



industry and transportation were the main growing sectors; construction
growth declined. While agriculture still accounts for 60% of total employ-
ment and 70% of the value of all exports, its contribution to GDP declined
from about 50% in the early 1950's to around 27% in 1971. During the same
period, the contribution of manufacturing increased from 11% to 23%. The
high share of manufacturing is likely to be maintained in 1972.
2.03      Turkey experienced its sharpest price rises in 1971 for more than
a decade. Wholesale prices rose 16% compared with 6% per year on the average
in the previous five years. The cost of living index showed a larger in-
crease, over 20%. This was principally attributable to demand pressures
resulting from higher incomes, and partly to cost increases resulting from
devaluation and from wage increases under collective bargaining agreements.
Moreover, major upward adjustments were made in the prices of various State
Economic Enterprises' products and in agricultural support prices. The
inflationary trend does not appear to have been arrested in 1972. In the
first half of 1972, wholesale price index rose 7%, and the estimated rise for
the whole year is around 15%.
Industry
2.04      During the first 5-Year Plan (1963-1967), industrial growth in
real terms averaged 11% per year. The second Plan (1968-1972) fixed an
annual growth target of 12%, which was nearly attained during 1968 and 1969.
In 1970, however, industrial growth slowed down sharply to 2%, mainly due to
curtailed imports of raw materials, spare parts and equipment resulting from
shortages of foreign exchange and delays in coming into production of
projects in the public sector. Value added in manufacturing industry in 1971
is estimated to have come 40% from the public sector and 60% from the private
sector. Although some Government-owned industrial enterprises (SEEs) have
shown good operational results, quite a number are considered inefficient.
Indeed, overall average annual rate of return for all SEEs including the large
deficit of the railways, was only 0.9% during the period of 1969-71.
2.05      Industry is highly protected through both quotas and tariffs.
(Customs duties on industrial products are about 40-60%, and 75% or more
for such commodities as artificial fibers and fabrics, glass, leather
products, machinery and vehicles, etc..) Protection measures coupled with
investment incentives 1/, available since the late sixties, have encouraged
private investments in industry, particularly in food, textiles, chemicals,
cement, non-metallic products, metals, machinery and vehicles. Recently,
1/   These include providing or guaranteeing foreign exchange for equipment
imports, deferral or exemption of import duties, rebates on import duties
and indirect taxes paid on products exported. Following devaluation in
August 1970, special funds were set up at the Cental Bank to promote
export-oriented manufactuturing activity.



-3-
and particularly since an Interim Agreement was signed with the EEC in 1971,
customs duties on imports from EEC have decreased by 5-10%, as a first step of
liberali.zation of duties. The Interim Agreement with the EEC provides that
over the next two decades, all tariff barriers on imports from EEC countries
will be eliminated and considerable reduction across the board will also
be applied to imports from other countries. In 1971, fixed investment in
manufacturing in the private sector was LT 4.9 billion, representing 53% of
total industrial investment. This amount is higher than the annual volume
achieved in 1970 (LT 3.9 billion), but is inflated because of the intervening
devaluation. Also, in the first half of 1971, there was some evidence of a
slow-down in new investment decisions due, in large measure, to the suspension of
investment incentives following the Government change in March 1971. Indus-
trial investment started picking up more recently since. in early 1972; investment
incentive schemes i/ were revived and expanded. Total fixed investment in
manufacturing in the private sector is estimated by TSKB to reach LT 6.7 billion
in 1972. Besides a general encouragement of private investment in industry,
these incentives aim at directing investments into large-scale projects, to
export-oriented activity, and into the under-developed regions.
2.06      Foreign private investments in industry have not been an important
element in the industrialization in Turkey because Government policy has not
encouraged such investments. It is accepted only when there is a demonstrable
need for transfer of technology and only in sectors which could not be
developed with local resources. Foreign direct investments in 1971 amounted
to $45 million, almost entirely for financing extensions of existing foreign-
controlled enterprises.
Industrial Finance
2.07      In the three year period, 1969-71, private fixed investment in
manufacturing totalled about LT 12 billion (about US$1.05 billion equivalent).
About 65% of the investment 2/ was financed by internally generated funds of
the companies and new share capital - which is a high percentage. These
figures have to be viewed with caution and the trend is towards an increasing
share of borrowed funds. The balance came 10% from tax credits, 5% from bond
issues and the remaining 20% from financial institutions including TSKB,
Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB) and commercial banks. TSKB's disbursements
during the period amounted to $85.7 million, corresponding to about 8% of the
total - a significant but declining share vis-a-vis earlier years. However,
TSKB share could have been considerably more if it had had access to more
resources, both local and foreign exchange.
1/   An important difficulty with the incentives, as now being awarded, is
that they are accorded on a case-by-case basis, leading to complaints
about the lack of objectivity and delays. A new bill is now being
considered by the Parliament which would represent a comprehensive
scheme for incentives, based on sectoral priorities making it possible
to grant incentives automatically without the need to evaluate individual
projects. This is a good approach.
2/   The source for this data is the State Planning Organization (SPO).

2.08      Financial Terms of the Market.  Annex 1 gives an indication of
current money market rates in Turkey. Maximum interest rates have been
fixed by the Government for both credits and deposits. Before the devalu-
ation, the maximum general interest rate was 10.5% and the maximum rate on
loans to specified industries was 9%. (TSKB charged 9% on foreign exchange
loans, 10.5% on free lira loans and 8% on loans financed by lira funds pro-
vided by the Government.) The rate on commercial deposits was 2% and the
rates on time deposits ranged between 4 and 6.5%. In September 1970, the
general maximum lending rate was increased to 11.5% and the rate on loans
for specified industries to 10.5%. Rates on time deposits over 12 months
were increased to 9%. Subsequently, the maximum lending rate on medium term
loans was set at 12%. TSKB has been charging 12% on all its loans since then.
2.09      The Capital Market.  There are few negotiable securities available
in the Turkish financial system and fewer still which represent means for
private industry to raise funds through intermediary channels. The various
financial instruments now issued to raise funds for public and private use
consist of savings bonds, government bonds, shares and bonds of private
corporations and banks. Savings bonds are negotiable instruments but
represent forced loans for finance of the public sector. In 1971, LT 1.1
billion of new savings bonds was issued, bringing the total to LT 7.4 billion.
There is a narrow market for government bonds, confined largely to social
security organizations and financial institutions which are required to
hold them. In 1971, the net increase in government bonds outstanding
amounted to LT 420 million, and total amount outstanding reached LT 3.2
billion at the end of 1971.
2.10      There had not been any bonds issued by private industrial corpora-
tions until 1967 when TSKB started to guarantee such issues. Up to end of
Sept. 1972, 78 issues totalling LT 922 million have been floated, 17% of
which was guaranteed by TSKB.
2.11      Share issues by private corporations to outsiders are very
limited in number. In 1969-71, the net increase in equity capital by
private corporations (other than financial intermediaries) amounted to
LT 350 million. Since most corporations are closely held family concerns,
only a small part of this sum would represent issues available to the market.
The stock exchange in Istanbul is playing an insignificant role since the
number of shares quoted is limited and the amount of trading is small (only
LT 7.7 million in 1971). Great obstacles to widening the share market seem
to be the aforesaid small supply of paper, and inadequate disclosure of data
on companies.
2.12      The Banking System.  Of the 43 commercial banks operating in
Turkey, by far the largest is the Turkiye Is Bankasi with total assets
two-and-a-half times larger than the next largest private bank, the Yapi
ve Kredi Bankasi. Between them, they account for over half the total assets
of private banks. In 1971, the commercial banks' liquidity improved con-
siderably due to the revised interest rate structure, taking effect in
September 1970. In early 1972, commercial banks were required to lend 10%



-5-
of their total commercial credits on medium term and since July, the Govern-
ment has taken some monetary measures to curb inflation by increasing the
reserve requirements of the banking system. Overall the record banking
liquidity of the earlier part of 1972 is likely to be reduced somewhat as
a result of these measures.
2.13      Besides TSKB, the only other institutional source of longer-term
finance for private industry is the Industrial Investment and Credit Bank
(Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi A.S. or SYKB) which was founded in 1963 by
six of the major commercial banks (five of them are also shareholders of
TSKB) to provide working capital credit on medium and long-term finance.
SYKB's long-term loans approved over the past two years amounted to about
LT 250 million. At the end of 1971, SYKB had a loan portfolio of LT 599
million, of which LT 373 million, or 62%, represent long-term loans to
industries. TSKB's portfolio was LT 1.7 billion. TSKB also has a far greater
endowment than SYKB with resources usable for import financing.
III. THE COMPANY - ORGANIZATION, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND RESOURCES
Shareholders
3.01      The list of TSKB's shareholders is contained in Annex 2a. There
has been little change in the ownership of the company. Turkiye Is Bankasi
remains the largest shareholder, holding 20.8% of the total; IFC holds 10.8%
of the total. Trading in TSKB shares has not been significant; only 854
shares were traded in 1971, totalling LT 541,095 and 169 during the first
half of 1972, totalling LT 91,250. Recent quotations over the counter were
at 160 - 180% of par (ex-rights).
3.02      TSKB is currently increasing its share capital from LT 110.5 mil-
lion to LT193.4 million(LT 55.3 million in the form of a rights issue and
LT 27.6 million as bonus shares). All the principal shareholders, including
IFC 1/, exercised their rights. The payments are to be completed by the end
of 1972. After the increase, the proportionate holdings of the principal
shareholders will remain unchanged.
Board
3.03      There have been a few changes in TSKB's Board.  Annex23 shows the
composition of the present Board. A significant change was the resignation,
in June 1971, of Mr. Bulent Yazici, TSKB's Managing Director. He became
Chairman of the Akbank, a large commercial bank. Mr. Yazici had been
1/   IFC aims at selling the newly acquired shares, and others from its
earlier holdings in TSKB. It has asked TSKB's support for sales in
Turkey, and is on its own endeavoring to sell to foreign purchasers.
It has just obtained indications of interest from a European and a
Japanese bank.



- 6 -
associated with TSKB since its founding in 1950 and was an important factor
in TSKB's growth to its present stature. There were two changes in the
Board since the last Bank loan in that Mr. Dicleli, former Minister of
Economics, was elected to the Board in July 1971, to fill the seat vacated
by Mr. Yazici. In March 1972, 8 of the 9 directors were re-elected for
another three-year term. The new Director is Mr. Nazmi Karakoc, formerly
Commander-in-Chief for Land Forces in Turkey. Mr. Basmaci, General Manager
of 3rkiye Is Bankasi, the country's leading bank, continues to be the
Board Chairman. The Board is an active one, meeting twice a month and
considers all applications above $50,000 equivalent. Traditionally, TSKB's
Board has paid particular attention to the financial soundness of projects
to be financed by TSKB. Less efforts however were made in the Board to
promote TSKB's developmental objectives which would have possibly implied
taking a greater risk. This posture is changing now.
Management and Staff
3.04      Upon Mr. Yazici's departure, Mr. Resid Egeli, General Manager,
became the top executive in charge of day-to-day operations. The position
of Managing Director was then abolished. Mr. Egeli has also been asso-
ciated with TSKB since its founding.
3.05      In January 1971, TSKB initiated organizational changes, especially
in its appraisal work. There were two important changes: a widening and
regrouping of the project appraisal set-up, the expansion of TSKB's Izmir
office and establishment of new departments to carry out tasks of promotion
and geographical diversification. The main effect of these changes is
discussed in paragraph 3.08. TSKB's organization chart is attached as
Annex 3.
3.06      TSKB's reorganization and its expectation that TSKB may in future
have to cope with more business, resulted in some staff increases. TSKB
has now a staff of 224, including 104 professionals, 80 non-professionals
and 40 general services personnel. Generally, TSRB has been able to attract
and to hold competent people; its staff turnover has been very low in the
past and is expected to remain so in the future.
Policies and Procedure
3.07      TSKB's Statement of Policies is shown in Annex 4.  TSKB has been
operating almost exclusively in support of industry and under the same
formally established policies for about five years, including all of the
original general guidelines, set in 1950. TSKB's Board and management have
in practice interpreted these policies by making, in general, prudent and
profitable investments. TSKB has observed its policy limits, including,
since share capital was increased, the maximum exposure it can take in a
single enterprise (about $7 million equivalent). Now there is a proposal
for TSKB to widen its operating scope: TSKB has never financed any tourism
projects in the past. Following a comprehensive staff study, TSKB's Board



-7-
decided on May 26, 1972 to start financing the tourism sector if TSKB could
mobilize resources on appropriate terms and in sufficient volume to that
end. This decision was influenced by the expectation that Turkey has a
large potential in tourism which can be exploited in the coming years, and
that the financing of this sector deserves more systematic efforts and action
than has been made by private or public sector financial institutions to date.
The sector's contribution has not yet, as far as we know, resulted in any signif-
icant action. Although TSKB Is organization will easily incorporate an appro-
priate section of tourism experts, the availability of resources for this
sector would at least for some time constrain TSKB's impact. Clearly, TSKB
is not likely to become an important tourism financier in the near future.
3.08      Project Appraisal.  TSKB's appraisal staff is performing competently;
indeed its effectiveness has even improved since the 1971 reorganization.
The earlier existing three appraisal groups (engineering, financial analysis
and economic analysis) which had been operating separately from one another,
though under one Assistant General Manager, now work together. For each
project, a working party consisting of one staff member from each group, is
formed. Instead of preparing separate reports covering the financial,
engineering and economic aspects of the projects - as was done in the past -
the working party now prepares a single integrated appraisal report for each
project. Though TSKB experienced a few teething troubles in setting up the
new system, there is already evidence that reports prepared since have shown
greater internal consistency in presentation, and that earlier encountered
shortcomings and duplications have been considerably reduced. In other words,
there are signs that TSKB's good appraisal standards have been upgraded further.
3.09      Since early 1968, TSKB has been making an explicit economic review
of the impact of the projects it finances. During negotiations for the 1970
Bank Loan, TSKB agreed to employ effective rate of protection calculations.
Though several features during much of the recent decade, such as protection,
the generous investment incentives available to Turkish industry, and relative-
ly limited export results, would lead one to believe that Turkish enterprises
would not be strongly compelled to operate efficiently, TSKB projects sub-
mitted to the Bank over the past two years showed only rarely an effective
rate of protection of more than 15% 1/. Consequenly, TSKB has, in recent
years, been financing reasonably competitive projects. Furthermore, TSKB
has rejected over the past two years four projects because of the level of
effective protection. But more importantly, TSKB has given considerable
assistance to sponsors to improve the competitiveness of their projects so
that their economic justification will become satisfactory. The Special
Studies Mission is to review thoroughly this aspect of TSKB's work.
3.10      Altogether, since about a year or two, TSKB has pursued its develop-
mental objectives in a more pronounced fashion. No statistical link can yet
be established between the two phenomena, but TSKB has opened branches in
1/   After adjustment to a notional maximum return on capital of 15% p.a.
A number of TSKB projects presented to the Bank have considerably
higher projected financial returns and therefore show higher rates of
ef feetiuv nrntpetinn.



- 8 -
Izmir and Adana and it also has increased the proportion of total financing
in these areas, as compared to earlier years. TSKB's management, at the
request of its Board, is now actively considering the possibility of opening
up another branch in the Eastern part of Turkey, for the sole purpose of
financing projects in backward regions. Also, since the end of 1971, TSKB
has been working on a systematic-promotion program in Anatolia: Some twenty
projects, in areas so far not served by TSKB, have already been identified
and TSKBis now trying to interest prospective investors in sponsoring these
projects; there are indications that TSKB will, in part, be successful.
Although there is no tangible action as yet, TSKB, as noted in paragraph 3.07,
has decided to finance tourism projects. And finally, there is an increasing
emphasis in TSKB's project selection, not only on the financial viability,
but also on the economic justification of its projects.
3.11      During negotiations in 1970, TSKB also agreed that it would give
special attention to the identification and financing of projects which are
export-oriented. In 1971, TSKB approved loans totalling '9 million corres-
ponding to 29% of its total loan approvals, for financing 10 export-oriented
projects. Eight of the projects will export more than 25% of their output
at full production. During the first six months of 1972, TSKB approved nine
export-oriented projects, calling for loans of $11.3 million which represent
L4% of its total approvals. All these projects are to export more than 25%
of their output. This is a welcome trend.
Project Supervision
3.12      TSKB's Follow-Up Department was not affected by the 1971 reor-
ganization. It continues to concentrate on the end-use work with a staff
of 8 financial analysts and 2 civil engineers. Apart from examining the
reports regularly submitted by the borrowers, the staff visits, at least
once a year 1/, all the borrowers and the companies in which TSKB holds
shares. The Department's reports are adequate in presenting the progress
of the projects and the conditions of the borrowers. They have been found
a useful tool to TSKB's management, as well as an important source of in-
formation about TSKB's clients and operations, particularly by TSKB's
creditors in the supervision of their loans to TSKB and in making sectoral
studies. The Department's work is an input in the appraisal of repeat
clients. This Department has served as a useful information source in the
preparation of the Bank's present Special Studies Mission to TSKB.
3.13      Disbursements.  TSKB has established disbursement procedures which
are intended to ensure that payments are made for only approved construction,
equipment and services, and against satisfactory evidence of procurement.
Since the Follow-Up Department follows the progress of each project, disburse-
ments on construction, machinery and installation are made after clearance
with that Department. For imports of equipment, letters of credit are usually
issued on behalf of the borrower by TSKB, after the pro-forma invoices have
1/   In 1971, a total of 540 reports were examined and 300 visits made,
including 23 visits to companies in which TSKB is a shareholder.



-9-
been approved by the engineers. Overall, TSKB has a carefully run disburse-
ment system.
3.14      Procurement.  TSKB's clients are not required to follow inter-
national competitive bidding procedures in procurement. However, they are
asked to submit offers (pro forma invoices) from different suppliers with
an explanation of the reasons for their choice. TSKB's engineers review
the offers carefully to ensure the procurement by its clients of suitable
machinery most economically. In a number of cases, TSKB advise the clients
as to the best sources of procurement, but the final decision is made by
the cliients. For expansion projects, the range of choice is much narrower.
Even in such cases, the clients are encouraged to compare offers. TSKB's
procurement procedures seem appropriate and there is considerable evidence
that it has contributed to the overall quality of TSKB's projects.

3.15      Annex 5 shows TSKB's resource position as of September 30, 1972.
Since its founding in 1950, TSKB has raised resources totalling $201.3 mil-
lion and LT 808 million. Calculated on the basis of the current rate of
exchange, the total resources amounted to $259 million equivalent, with
foreign currency loans constituting 78%, local currency loans 14% and equity
8% of the total. The Bank Group has provided 49% of the total resources of
the company. As of September 30, 1972 TSKB's resources invested or available
for investment were as follows:
LT million
Equity                                 286.0
Outstanding Loans:
Local currency                    477.9
Foreign currency  /             1,412.9
Loans not yet drawn down                536.4
2,713.2
3.16      Foreign currency resources.  Up to 1965, IBRD/IDA had been virtually
the only source of foreign currency funds for TSKB. Since then the European
Investment Bank, US AID and KfW have lent to TSKB. As of September 30, 1972,
the Bank's share has dropped to 63.6% of TSKB's aggregate foreign currency
borrowings as shown below.
Amount           Percentage
(US$ million)
IBRD/IDA                             128.0              63.6
European Investment Bank              29.9               14.9
AID/DLF (US Government)               22.5               11.1
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau        20.9               10.4
201.3              100.0
1/   As of June 30, 1972, the IBRD and IDA together accounted for 37% of
TSKB's long-term resources on a balance sheet basis.

3.17      USAID discontinued making loans to industry in Turkey in 1968.
In 1971, no new funds came from sources other than the Bank because of
normal delays in executing loan agreements between the Turkish Government
and the German authorities and EIB. In May 1972, a loan of DM 25 million
was extended to TSKB by KfW. TSKB has applied for a new loan of US$15 mil-
lion from EIB, but it is not expected to be available before mid-1973.
3.18      TSKB has had, since the last Bank loan, some discussions about the
prospects of tapping private sources overseas. During the past year, it has
contacted important banks in USA, Europe and Japan, as well as IFC, to raise
appropriate resources. Two possibilities now seem open to TSKB. First, it
could raise Eurodollar loans for 5-7 years at fluctuating interest rates from
large U.S. and European banks. Also, following an IFC initiative and ten-
tative offers from European and Japanese banks, TSKB might be able to raise
Euro currency funds with fixed interest terms. These proposals are now
under consideration by TSKB and the Government, and prospects are good that
TSKB could borrow at least $5 - 10 million, in this market in the next 2
or 3 months (see para 5.13).
3.19      Local currency resources.  The Government has been TSKB's prin-
cipal source of local currency resources. However, since the Administered
Funds totalling LT 368 million were converted into a subordinated loan in
1966, additional loans extended by the Government have been relatively small.
Therefore, TSKB relied mainly on internal cash generation to finance its
local currency operations. This situation has restrained TSKB's growth.
3.20      The only fresh local currency borrowing in 1971 was a new
Government loan of LT 45 million which is the re-use of local currency
counterparts of an EIB loan which TSKB had already repaid to the Government.
As of September 30, 1972, eight loans from the Government, totalling LT 497.3
million, were still outstanding, they constituted 61.5% of TSKB's total local
currency resources. By December 1972, TSKB will receive two-thirds, LT 55.3
million, of the share capital increase (see paragraph 3.02) which will then
be paid by its shareholders in cash. (The remaining one-third of this
increase will be in the form of bonus shares).
3.21      TSKB has also been trying to broaden its sources of supply of
local currency resources. However, the ceiling on TSKB's lending rate
has been a constraint to its  borrowings       in the domestic market.  Al-
though, following the change in the interest rate structure in 1970, TSKB's
maximum lending rate allowed by the Government on its long-term loans was
increased from 9% to 12% 1/, it is still lower than the cost of long-term
bond issues, which has a coupon rate of 15% at present 2/. In such circum-
stances, TSKB has not attempted to sell bonds on its own account. However,
it has endeavoured in recent years to mobilize resources for industry by
1/   The effective cost to TSKB's borrowers is 15%, because they pay 25%
expenditure tax on interest.
2/   If bonds are guaranteed by TSKB, the effective cost to the issuing
companies is 18% not including advertising expenses.

underwriting or guaranteeing bonds issued by industrial firms. For itself,
TSKB has raised funds by sales from its equity portfolio. As of June 30,
1972, the total bonds guaranteed amounted to LT 145 million (18 issues), while
cumulative sales from its equity portfolio totalled LT 130.5 million. Bond
issues guaranteed by TSKB dwindled since September 1971 until mid-1972 when
the bond market remained stagnant. Since June 1972 however, TSKB's business
in the field has picked up and TSKB expects to reach its LT 50 million
underwriting target for 1972. The interest rate matter is discussed fur-
ther in paragraphs 4.12 - 4.14 and S.16.
IV. OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Operations
4.01      Annex 6 contains a summary of TSKB's lending, equity investment
and guarantee operations in 1968-1971 and the firstnine months of 1972.
Equity operations are being discussed ahead of TSKB's lending activities.
They accounted for 8% of TSKB's total annual commitments in 1971.
4.02      Equity Investments.  On June 30, 1971, TSKB's equity portfolio
consisted of shares of 31 firms at a total cost of LT 133.5 million (Annex 10).
The largest investment, amounting to LT 31 million, is in the Karadeniz Bakir
copper mine complex. This is within the limit set in TSKB's policy for equity
investments in any one company - 5% of its equity and the Government subordinated
loan, or LT 32.7 million at present. The industrial distribution of TSKB's
equity investments is less diversified than its loans. Commitments in the
metal industry totalled LT 50.2 million, corresponding to 37.6% of the port-
folio. Commitments in the cement industry were the second heaviest, amount-
ing to LT 17 million or 12.8% of its portfolio.
4.03      In 1971, TSKB made investments in three new companies and four
existing clients, totalling LT 24.7 million, compared with LT 5.9 million
in 1970. In the first half of 1972, TSKB subscribed shares of only one new
company and exercised its preemptive rights in four existing companies, the
total equity investments amounting to LT20.9 million. One factor which has
tended to limit equity purchases is that TSKB will not give repurchase options
to existing companies; i.e. it will only take equities that it can sell to
the investing public later on.
4.04      TSKB's equity portfolio is somewhat less than one-half of its net
worth as of June 30, 1972. This is a low percentage. The low level of
equity investment is a reflection of industrial companies' preferences to
sell to family members. But it would be surprising if there were not room
for more TSKB equity purchases in a growing economy, were it not alone to
shore up tLe borrowing base of new companies especially in outlying regions.
The prospects for TSKB to operate more significantly in equity purchases are
limited in the near future at least until TSKB succeeds in convincing family
held corporations that its investment in their equity is to their advantage.
Equity purchases, however, should become now an important objective in TSKB's



- 12
financing. TSKB plans to intensify its efforts in this respect,-and there-
fore agreed during negotiations to determine its limit on total equity
investments in future as a percentage of its own net worth, rather than,
as in the past, at a fixed level (LT 175 million since 1966).
4.05      Lending.  Except for 1971, variations in the levels of TSKB's
approvals and commitments in recent years have been more a function of the
availability of funds to TSKB than the level of activity in the private
sector. In 1969, when the investment climate was good, lending volume
reached the lowest level in seven years. In 1970, foreign currency lending
increased substantially but local currency lending remained at a low level 1/.
In 1971, lira loan approvals increased sharply to LT 140.6 million, with the
availability of funds. Foreign currency loans in 1971 totalled $21.6 mil-
lion. While maintaining the level reached in the previous years, they were
40% below forecast, mainly because the Government then completely suspended
issuing industrial investment certificates requiring foreign exchange for
imported equipment. For the first nine months of 1972, foreign currency
loans amounted to $24.4 million and local currency loans to LT 170.5 mil-
lion. At an annual rate, this is 57% higher than the level reached in 1971.
4.06      Characteristics of lending operations.  Analyses of loans approved
in terms of industry, size and geographical distribution are included in
Annexes 7, 8 and 9.
4.07      TSKB's lending is well diversified among various industries and
reflects the pattern of investment activity of private industry. Given
the high demand for TSKB's financing, in past years it appears that TSKB has
merely reacted to projects coming its way and has chosen among them those it
considered to be the better ones. But TSKB has had an influence on the nature
of its projects. TSKB's technical staff have the expertise and experience
in assisting the sponsors of projects to make improvements. In a number of
cases, the sponsors revised their projects on the basis of TSKB's recommenda-
tions before financial assistance was made available to them. TSKB has also
conducted sector studies and such studies shed more light on the overall
conditions of various branches of industry. This has enabled the staff to
give useful advices to the existing clients for rationalization of their
plants as well as sponsors of new projects for installing the most appropriate
equipment to produce competitive products.
4.08      During the 4-1/2 year period from January 1968 to June 1972, the
textile industry received the largest amount of financing, about 30% of the
total. (In the first six months of 1972, 75Z of TSKB's foreign currency
loans and 18% of its local currency loans were made to finance textile
projects whose sponsors are investing heavily in view of good exports pro-
spects.) Glass manufacturers received the second largest proportion, about
1/   An important factor for the low lira loans in 1970 was TSKB's decision
to build up a LT 70 million cash reserve in anticipation of the effect
of a currency devaluation which was expected to strain its liquidity.



- 13 -
13;.D.  Metal smelting, metal goods, chemicals took up each between 7 and 8%.
Other industrial categories have each received less than 6% of TSKB's financ-
ing.
L.09      The average size of TSKB's loans approved increased from LT 2.4
million in 1969 to LT 5.6 million in 1971 and to LT 8.4 million in the
first half of 1972. While the effect of the 40% devaluation in August 1970
needs to be taken into account, it is clear that TSKB's loans are on the
average getting larger. In the past, the Bank had been concerned that
TSIN3's lending included a large number of small loans to relatively large
companies, mainly based on the need for foreign exchange to procure replacement
equipment rather than a legitimate credit need for increasing productive
capacities. Since the last Bank loan was made, TSKB has tightened its
criteria to ensure that its loans were in support of significant investment
projects with real financing needs, eliminating the piece-meal financing
as was done in a number of cases in the past. TSKB's efforts in this direction
have been reasonably successful. They were helped partly by the greatly
improved balance of payments situation in Turkey which enabled firms, just
seeking foreign exchange, to obtain required allocations from the Government
for importing capital equipment.
4.10      TSKB's business has been for years centered in the Marmara Sea
region which includes Istanbul. The Bank has viewed the Istanbul orienta-
tion with great concern, and during the 1970 Loan negotiations, has pointed
to Turkey's need for greater geographic dispersion of industry and urged that
TSKB take more initiative in finding and preparing projects in other areas of
the country. TSKB expanded its Izmir Office in early 1971 to enable it to
identify and appraise projects in the Agean Sea Region. This office has now
one full appraisal team. A second office in Adana has just been opened.
Moreover, TSKB set up two new departments, i.e. Research and Regional Devel-
opment and Promotion, which conduct studies and actively search for projects
in the less developed regions. Since 1971, significant geographical dis-
persion has been achieved. Loans approved in the Marmara Sea Region accounted
for 53.8% of total lending in 1971 and 57.7% in the first half of 1972 compared
with an average of 81% in the previous three years. The promotional efforts by
its expanded Izmir Branch appear already to yield results. During the first
six months of 1972, TSKB's lending to Agean Sea Region increased to 19% from
8.5% in 1970 and 4% in 1971. However, many projects identified by the Branch
are not big enough to be eligible for financing under TSKB's present policy
of not financing projects below $50,000 or LT 250,000. Given TSKB's objective
to diversify its geographic impact in Turkey, the policy limit of $50,000 may
be too high outside Istanbul. However, TSKB is likely to consider some excep-
tions for financing granted through its branches in Izmir and Adana and in
Turkey's backward regions.
4.11      In 1971, 68% of TSKB's loans were extended to eight new companies
or to existing clients for making new products, compared with 46% in 1970.
In the past three or four years, 3,500 - 4,000 new jobs have been created
each year by the projects financed by TSKB, and the capital employed for
jobs so created amounted in recent years to about $15 - 20  00equivalent
per job.  TSKB projects accounted for about 5% of the annual3 increase in
employment in the industrial sector.



- 14 -
4.12      Interest rates.  TSKB has been charging interest at 12% p.a. on
both foreign and local currency loans since early November, 1970. By
agreement -with the Government, TSKB is allowed to maintain certain spreads
on loans from the Government (4-1/2% on the subordinated loan and 2-1/2%
on other general purpose loans). Any increment on the spread resulting from
interest rate adjustment has to be passed on to the Government. However, no
Government agreement with TSKB in respect of Bank loans to TSKB include such
a condition. Thus, after the interest rate structure was changed, TSKB's
spread on the most recent Bank loan went up to 4-3/4%, compared with 2-1/2$
under the previous loan. There is therefore the question about the appropri-
ateness of a potentially very large spread earned by TSKB on a fresh Bank
loan if the present Bank standard rate were maintained. For reasons further
detailed in paragraph 5.16 it is proposed that TSKB be allowed to continue
earning the 4-3/4% spread because such spread would help TSKB to develop and
accelerate its promotional activities with respect to industrW in under-
developed regions and to tourism. On a weighted average basis, TSKB's
spread on all its resources outstanding as of mid 1972 was 3.4% p.a.
4.13      Another feature of TSKB's interest rate is the continuing
subsidy element in the cost of its long-term lira lending, even after
the upward adjustment in 1970. Although this rate adjustment has helped
to bring rates more in line with market conditions, the present regime
which curtails TSKB's lending rates is still not a reflection of market
forces. Considering the effect of the expenditure tax,I/ long-term funds
(local and foreign exchange) lent by TSKB have an effective cost of 15% as
against a cost of long-term funds in the Turkish market in the neighbor-
hood of 18-19%. (Annex 1e) In fact, the cost of TSKB lira funds is, in
the past two years, just keeping pace with general price increases. The
Bank should therefore continue its efforts to bring about a greater
reflection of domestic market forces in the Turkish interest rate structure.
1/ The tax system, which levies on the interest of loans to industry a 25%
expenditure tax, also applies to borrowings of banks or financial institu-
tions such as TSKB from other banks, thus preventing any sizeable
expansion of an inter-bank money market. If the Government agreed to
forego the tax on borro-ings, TSKB would be able to borrow medium-term
from commercial banks at a rate which -would leave TSKB a small positive
spread.
A withholding tax of 20% is levied on interest received by foreign
lenders, and TSKB may have to assume this tax burden in order to make the
yield to foreign lenders attractive. Given the lower rates prevailing
at present for term money from foreign banks, TSKB's earnings prospects
on euro-currency loans would be higher, if the Government permitted
TSKB access to these resources and were to forego the withholding tax,
and the incentives for TSKB to borrow in the euro-market at flexible
rates of interest would be enhanced.



- 15 -
4.1i4      In any event, the cost of funds lent by TSKB is an incentive
for industrial entrepreneurs to have recourse to term borrowings in liras.
But Turkey's entrepreneurs also continue to seek actively, for economi-
cally attractive projects, foreign currency term loans from TSKB, which
have an effective cost of 15% and for which borrowers have to carry the
foreign exchange risk.
Quality of Portfolio
4.15      As of June 30, 1972, TSKB had a portfolio of LT 1.9 billion con-
sisting of local currency loans amounting to LT 0.4 billion, foreign currency
loans of US$96.2 million (LT 1.4 billion) and equity investment of LT 0.1 billion.
Even taking account of a 21% exposure in textiles TSKB's portfolio is well
diversified and overall seems sound. (Annex 7b gives the sectoral distribution
of TSKB's portfolio.)
4.16      Loans in arrears.  (Annex 11).  After the August 1970 devaluation
arrears on TSKB's loans went up sharply because many of its clients, especially
the recipients of foreign currency loans, encountered liquidity difficulties.
At the end of 1970, total arrears of three months or more amounted to LT 48.9
million. The total outstanding amount of the loans in arrears over three
months was LT 240.7 million, about 15% of the loan portfolio. As of June 30,
1972, arrears in absolute amounts have worsened, despite TSKB's seemingly
intensive efforts in collections. Total arrears of three months or more
reached LT 77.7 million, including LT 48.7 million of principal arrears and
LT 29 million on interest arrears. However, the outstanding amount of loans
affected by arrears over three months was LT 181 million, representing 10.3%
of the loan portfolio, a lesser percentage than at the end of 1970. TSKB's
portfolio is sound and loans in arrears appear more than adequately covered
by collateral. Overall provisions for possible losses on loans, amounting to
LT 24.3 million at December 31, 1971, are adequate.
4.17      Equity portfolio.  (Annex 10)  Thirteen companies of the 31 com-
panies in which TSKB has invested paid dividends in 1971. The dividend
yield on the dividend-earning investments was 10.5% which does not seem
high considering the great profitability of Turkish companies. The average
dividend yield on the entire portfolio was 5%. As of June 30, 1972, invest-
ments in three companies totalling about LT 4 million were in difficulty.
Adequate provisions have been made for possible losses on these loans.
According to TSKB's estimates, the potential capital gains on other shares
acounted to approximately LT 60 million.
Financial Performance and Position
4.18      Profitability.  TSKB's earning performance has been good historically
and has further improved since the allowable maximum rate on long-term loans
was increased following the August 1970 devaluation. TSKB's profit and loss
statements in recent years are included in Annex 12. In 1971 profits after
tax and after provisions were equivalent to 18.2% on average net worth com-
pared with 17.4% in 1970 and 19.0% in 1969.



- 16 -
4.19      Administrative expenses have been rising in recent years.  The
overall increase in 1971 was 17%. Personnel expenses alone rose 25%, which
was attributable to salary increases taking effect on January 1, 1971 and the
employment of new personnel. In 1971 the administrative expenses represented
1.6% of average total assets. In the first six months of 1972, personnel
expenses showed an annual increase of 12.6%, due to further salary adjustment.
Every year 2-1/2% and 5% respectively of undistributed profits have been paid
to directors and employees as year-end bonuses, according to TSKB's Statutes.
4.20      TSKB has been paying a 12% dividend since 1954.  In 1971, this
amounted to a 38% distribution of earnings, compared with 43% in 1970. The
present dividend yield on TSKB's shares at a market price is low namely about
7%. Average yields over time have been much improved by bonus shares in 1969
and 1972 and rights issues at subscription prices below market prices in 1967,
1969 and 1972.
4.21      Financial position.  Balance sheets of TSKB in recent years are
given in Annex 13. TSKB's total assets increased sharply (51%) during 1970,
mainly due to the upward adjustment of foreign currency loans following the
devaluation. (Without the devaluation, the growth would have been 14%.)
Total assets further increased by 11% in 1971, and 3% in the first half of 1972.
At June 30, 1972, the loan portfolio made up 80% and equity portfolio 6% of
total assets. Liquid funds amounted to LT 149.5 million, or 6.8% of total
assets. These yield 6-9% interest income. At this date total long-term bor-
rowings and guarantees amounted to 7.3 times net worth, compared with 8.3
times at the end of 1971. The borrowing limit ratio calculated in accordance
with the definition in the last Loan Agreement was 3.0:1 as against 4:1 maximum
specified in the Agreement 1/. By the end of the year when the new shares
issued have been fully paid up, TSKB's debt/equity ratio will drop further.
Free reserves as of June 30, 1972, amounted to 8.0% of TSKB's total portfolio
and outstanding guarantees. The book value of a TSKB share is 218% of par.
V. TSKB'S PROSPECTS
Growth Perspectives of Private Industrial Investment
5.01      Since early 1972 investois'  interest has been resuscitated and
fresh industrial investment decisions have picked up. This comes as a re-
sult of the recent encouraging attitude of the Turkish Government to private
investments and the revival, early in 1972, of industrial investment incen-
tive schemes. The total amount of private investment proposals submitted
for approval to the Government increased from LT 5.5 billion at the begin-
ning of February 1972, to over LT 40 billion by mid-1972. This should lead,
1/   In calculating the debt/equity as defined in the Bank Loan Agreement,
the maturities of the Government subordinated loan due prior to the
last maturity of the latest Bank loan are treated as "debt" and the
balance as "equity".



- 17
according to preliminary estimates, to actual industrial investment in 1973
at a total of LT 8 billion, compared with an actual LT 4.9 billion for 1971
and an expected, and well supported, LT 6.7 billion for 1972. A new bill
covering the package of incentives to the private manufacturing industry
is now being considered by the Parliament and is expected to be passed soon.
Against this background, TSKB expects that there will be a rising trend
in Turkey of substantial private industrial investment over the next few
years.
5.02      Underlying TSKB's business projections is an expected increase in
private industrial investment in the area of about 15-20% per year in the
next few years. With better prospects for obtaining resources, TSKB expects
to increase its share of total private industrial investment (on a disburse-
ment basis) to 9.4% in 1973 and 13% in 1974 (compared with 8.5% in 1971 and
an estimated 8.9% in 1972). This prospect is reasonable, but to achieve
this growth TSKB would indeed have to have better access to resources than
in the past. In past years, TSKB financed about 20% of canital equipment
imported by Turkish industry, and plans on continuing as a principal insti-
tutional borrower of foreign credit lines for such purposes. TSKB expects
to have access to substantial borrowings in lira, some at a negative spread
and some from commercial banks particularly if the Goverunent
removes the tax payable on such borrowings. If TSKB obtains the resources
it believes it needs, TSKB's expectations to do business at the projected
level have good prospects. -
Projected Operations
5.03      Over the next five years, 1973-1977, TSKB expects its total com-
mitments to reach LT 8.6 billion. This figure includes LT 5.3 billion to
finance imports and LT 3.3 billion to finance construction of plant build-
ings and purchase of local equipment. The level of projected commitments
for the next five years represents an increase of 300% over the past five
years. A forecast of operations for the period 1972-77 is shown in Annex
14. Loan applications which TSKB actively considered on October 15, 1972
amounted to approximately $22 million of foreign currency loans and LT 184
million for local currency.
5.04      Assuming no serious resource constraint and taking into account
the possible up-surge in demand resulting from new incentive measures, TSKB's
foreign currency loan commitments are expected to reach $28 million in 1972,
$55 million in 1973 and $65 million in 1974. For comparison, the average
annual commitments in 1969-1971 was around $20 million and that in the first
nine months of 1972 was $25 million.
5.05      In the short run (1973-74), TSKB's program looks ambitious, but it
is well supported by several factors. First, the economy and particularly
manufacturing are expanding faster than in the past, thanks to good prospects
in export-oriented industries and the important incentive packages which are
likely to be approved by Parliament. Second, the curb that the Government in-
tends to put on suppliers credits would automatically, as evidenced already
in specific cases, benefit TSKB. Third, TSKB's decision to finance tourism



- 18 -
would bring it new business which would be responsible for about 10% of the
projected growth over the five-year period.   Finally, although the share of
such programs in TSKB's total forecast growth may not be very large in the
first one or two years, TSKB's development programs in backward regions and
through its new branches in Ismir and Adana would also provide a significant
share of business. During the years 1975-1977, TSKB expects its cormitments
to rise further, though not as sharply. Given sufficient resources, TSKB
should be able to increase its commitments by $10 million a year in this
period.
5.06      As to local currency loans, commitments are expected to rise from
LT 106.5 million in 1971 to LT 138 million in 1972, to LT 350 million in
1973 and then to rise to about LT 550 million in 1974 and to increase by
LT 100 million a year during 1975-1977. Under the arrangements proposed in
paragraph 5.15, TSKB should be able to raise starting 1973 lira funds in
the local market to accommodate the projected increase in lira lending. In
the latter, tourism financing is estimated to account for LT 75-125 million
a year during the projected period, constituting, on the average about 17T
of TSKB total lira commitments. J/ The average annual increase projected for
all loans would be about 18% for the five-year period, a percentage that
would find support in the expected growth rate for industrial investment.
5.07      Equity investments are projected to rise at an average of 7% per
year in the five-year period, reaching LT 40 million in 1977. The projected
growth appears low but TSKB considers the estimate realistic. During
negotiations TSKB has agreed to make particular efforts in this field.
5.08      Overall, in light of the volume of applications received in the
past few months, and of the general outlook, TSKB's overall forecast operational
volume appears feasible in terms of demand for TSKB's finance.
5.09      But a note of caution regarding TSKB's five-year projections is
indicated. This concern relates not to a lack of aggregate demand for term
lending, but to possibly competition from other sources of foreign exchange
and a potential shortage of local currency resources at measurable costs. As
for foreign exchange there is the potential of increased availability of
suppliers' credits. However, the Government has indicated that it would wish
to keep the annual inflow of such credits at about the same level as in 1972
($30-40 million); this is, therefore, not likely to contribute to a significant
decrease in demand for TSKB's foreign exchange lending. There is also, as
a result of the large foreign exchange influx in 1971 and 1972, a source of
foreign exchange for relatively short term loans extending from convertible
foreign exchange deposits with Turkish commercial banks which aggregate about
$200 million at present. But this capital is not available for long-term

- 19 -
fin'incing, needed nmst for industrial investment projects normally
financed by TSKB. As to local currency financing, both the: medium-term
financing from commercial banks as well as the long-term loans of SYKB
are likely to compete somewhat with TSKB. But the magnitutude of local
long-term credit, required by the industrial and tourism private
sectors suggests that TSKB would hve no real difficulty to meet its
project program if resources are forthcoming. Indeed, TSKB lira financing
at an effective cost of 15% would remain attractive, as compared to commercial
bank financing because of the longer term offered by TSKB on its loans.
Also TSKB straight loan financing would be attractive to a large fraction
of investors whose size and needs are not served by the bond market and
because of the recognized quality of its appraisals which are often con-
sidered in Turkey as an insurance against misconception of a project.
However, TSKB will have to increase its local borrowings at a negative
spread until the Government reviews the interest rate structure. The
volume of such borrowings, projected in Annex 17 (about LT 200 million at
a 3% negative smread over the next two years), would still allow TSKB to
retain a reasonable spread on the mix of its resources. On balance TSKB's
projections appear realistic and it should be encouraged in its attempts
to increase lending in new fields and further geographical diversifications.
Resource Requirements
5.10      lo finance the volume of operations projected over the next five
years, 1973-1977, TSKB would need a total of LT 8.6 billion, against which
it would have LT 28 million uncommitted as of the end of 1972. TSKB's total
resource gap, over the next five years, includes LT 5.2 billion to finance
imports and LT 3.3 billion to finance local currency expenditures. The fi-
nancing of these two resource gaps is considered in the following paragraphs.
c.11      Foreign Exchange.  By the end of 1972, the uncommitted balance of
foreign exchange resources would be approximately $2 million (USAID and
KfW funds only). In 1973-1974, TSKB expects to obtain two EIB loans of
$15 million each and two KfW loans of DM 25 M.($7.8 million) each.With pro-
jected commitments totalling $120 million for 1973 and 1974, the resource
gap in foreign currency would be around $72 million.
5.12      To finance the entire gap with Bank funds would be inadvisable.
The Bank's involvement in TSKB's foreign resources reached 64% at the end
of September 1972. It is advisable to reduce this exposure in TSKB
and to move TSKB more pointedly to private foreign financing sources.
During the 1970 loan negotiations the Bank pressed TSKB to en-
deavor diversifying the sources of its resources. TSKB has not yet succeeded
in this regard. However, TSKB's inability in the last two years to tap other
sources did not harm its business significantly because its operations were
affected by the general deterioration in Turkey's investment climate in 1971.
But now, the general outlook is for a considerable rise in industrial invest-
ment.  With foreign aid sources, other than the Bank, unlikely to come through
in substantial amounts, TSKB needs to go to the international market.



- 20 -
5.13      TSKB started serious discussions with the Government about raising
funds in the Eurodollar market more than a year ago. The Government
is now prepared to permit TSKB to seek Euro currency funds from various
foreign banks, either at a fixed or variable interest rates. IFC has
offered to help TSKB raise capital in this fashion from a European syndicate
of banks in which IFC plans to participate. Such financing in an amount of
about $10 million would seem to be available at fixed or flexible interest
rates for 5-10 years. Further operations of this kind
could be envisaged over the next two or three years. Overall, TSKB expects
to be able to raise $25 million from such sources in the next two years, thus
leaving a net resource gap of some $48 million. In fact, the gap could be
higher since there remains some uncertainty about the availability of the
EIB loan expected in 1974, in which case the resource gap could increase tD
$63 million. Still, the Bank should not consider a loan in excess of 840
million, because, TSKB's intention to put more effort in developmental
financing and to raise euro-currency capital have still to be tested Although
the outlook is bright, the economic progress accomplished over the past months
in large part following to Government's efforts to support industry, are still
to be firmed up. In many ways, both Turkey and TSKB are in a transition
period and while the Bank should maintain its support to TSKB, the proposed
loan should cover only part of TSKB's needs over the next two years. A $40
million loan should thus enable TSKB to meet the major part of its resource
gap in foreign exchange and to carry its foreign currency commitments through
the latter part of 1974.  Also,a loan of this size would put further pressure
on TSKB to make efforts to raise funds elsewhere, particularly in the Euro-
currency market, so that the potential foreign exchange resource gap can
be met.
5.14      Local Currency.  A major problem for TSKB continues to be to find
enough lira funds on a sustained basis.  Part of TSKB's role in financing
industry in local currency has been met, however, in underwriting and
guaranteeing bond issues of its clients. This type of financing is useful
and it is likely to continue (ranging on the average about LT 70 million
per year), but it is expensive to TSKB's borrowers.  Direct local currency
financing is important and TSKB needs to assure itself in the future of
untrammeled access to lira resources for that purpose.  The schemes reviewed
in paragraph 5.15 should go a long way to provide TSKB with such resources.
5.15      TSKB's available local currency resources were fully committed
by September 30, 1972. The share capital increase approved in May 1972
will this year result in new funds of about LT 55 million. Together with
net cash generation, this amount should cover TSKB's local currency commit-
ments in 1972. In 1973-74, TSKB expects to receive lira loans totalling
LT 150 million from the Government representing re-use of repayments of
EIB loans. Net cash generation for the two years would amount to LT 250
million.  Otherrelatively firm resources for commitment would be LT 175 million.
TSKB has already approached the Government for local currency borrowings
to meet specifically the needs for tourism financing (LT 175 million over
1973-1974). It is not clear whether this request will meet with success.
However, it is clear that without funds at concessionary terms for financing
the tourism sector, TSKB's operations in this sector will have to be considerably
curtailed because tourism projects are not yielding high profits, particularly



- 21 -
during the initial period while their return to the economy is attractive.
With projected commitments totalling LT 900 million for 1973 and 1974, the
resource gap in local currency would be around LT 325 million. To meet
the resource gap in its industrial financing, TSKB is prepared to float
bond issues to the order of LT 150-200 million in the next two years at a
cost which will be above its lending rate (approximately 15% p.a.). Given
TSKB's prominent position in the bond market, there should be no problem to
float its own bonds for the projected amounts.
Interest Rate
5.16      TSKB plans to mobilize a substantial amount of resources in lira
to meet the expected rise in demand for local currency borrowings over the
next two years. However, as TSKB's efforts to promote smaller, less foreign
exchange intensive industries, and to diversify geographically succeed,
resource needs in local currency must become very substantial indeed and TSKB
cannot reasonably be expected to borrow local currency ro3ources indefinitely
at a large negative spread. It is thus urgent that the Government complete its
review of interest rate structures in Turkey and adopt measures designed to
bring lending and borrowing rates into better balance, and thereby facilitate
TSKB's and other term financing institutions' resource mobilization efforts
at home and abroad. During negotiationsJthe Bank has expressed its concern
in this regard and intends to pursue this matter further with the Government.
A satisfactory interest rate structure, which would enable TSKB and other
institutions to mobilize the resources needed to accomplish their objectives,
would be an important consideration at the time TSKB may request further
financing from the Bank.
ProsDects for Promotion
5.17      Under the prevailing interest rate 2ptructure TSKB would be left
iith a substantial spread on the Bank funds.-   Part of such a spread could
either be turned away or earmarked for specific developmental purposes. The
use of the spread has been reviewed with TSKB during negotiations and TSKB has
agreed to set aside a substantial part it may earn on Bank funds for a special
effort to promote industrial development in Turkey's backward areas and invest-
ment in tourism. While there may well be some pressure on TSKB's interest
rates on foreign exchange, resulting in a possible reduction of the spread on
the proposed Banlc loan before it is fully committed, TSKB has nevertheless
agreed to earmark at least 25% of the spread3/ it would earn on the proposed
1/  Loans for hotel development granted by the State-owned Tourism
Bank are charging a maximum interest rate of 9% p.a. (less in
specific tourism development regions).
2/  For the Bank's position on interest rates of DFC's and profits derived
from spreads on Bank funds see SEC M70-140, particularly paragraph§
9/10.
3/ At the present expected spread of 14.75% p.a., TSKB would thus set aside

aside not less than 0.94% p.a.

loan to finance promotion expenses for specific and special development program;-,
these expenses would be in addition to TSKBts normal administrative and trom-
otional expenses.  The funds so set aside and used for nromotional activi4Jev
would be separately recorded in a memorandum account.
5.18      The program has yet to be formulated, but TSKB has agreed to revieo
the scope for promotion in Turkey and to identify areas where 4ts Dromotion
efforts would be most useful (e.g., identification of projects in Eastern
Turkey, creation of new branches, etc.).  TSKB would prepare a full reoort
to the Bank, including a detailed promotion program, and would seek the
Bank's approval of such a program within nine months after the proposed loa-
is signed.  This review iwould take place at a time when the finrirgs of the
Special Studies M5ission would be available, thus providing a better -ieasure
of TSK3's potential for an increased developmental orientation of its
activities.
5.1S      The agreement reached with TSKB during negotiations on the use of
the spread derived from the Bank resources provides a welcome opportunity to
reinforce TSKB's intentions to engage in new developmental efforts. ;hile
TSKB will continue to pursue its present objectives to seek profits and to
finance the large industrial companies in Thrkey it does nevertheless wish
to expand out of the Istanbul area, where it has been very successful, and
to apply its experience to other parts of Turkey where it is badly needed.
TSKB is prepared both to use part of the spread it would earn from 3ank funds
for said promotion and to finance said developmental investments, which are
likely to require less foreign and mo- local currency, by borrowing at rates
above its own lending rate. This is an encouraging indication of TSK3's
readiness to assume larger developmental responsibilities. Through further
consultation and review the Bank will closely follow implementation of the
promotion program.
Projected Profitability and Financial Position
5.20      Projected income statements for the years 1972-1977 are included
in Annex 15. TSKB projects that it will earn an average spread of >-a:,
on all future resources excluding the proposed Bank loan, and taking into
account borrowings in 1973 and 1974 of about LT 190 million at 15%0 p.a., i.e.,
at a negative spread to TSKB. TSKB's overall spread, which would take into
account resources acquired prior to 1973, would remain above 3% p.a. over
the next five years.
5.21      On this basis, TSKB's profits after tax and provisions are expected
to increase from LT 52.1 million in 1972 to LT 1L4.3 million in 1977. The
return on average net worth would range from 15.7% to 21.6% during the projected
period. Estimated capital gains increasing from LT 6.2 million in 1972 to
LT 12.9 million in 1977 are included in the projections. Administrative
expenses including retirement provisions, are forecast to increase at an
average rate of 16% but would decline as a percentage of average total assets
from 1.4% in 1972 to 1.1% in 1975 and to 0.9% in 1977. Special promotional
expenses to be financed specifically by the spread earned on the prop:sed 3ank
loan are estimated to be LT 2 million in 1973 and to increase by LT 1 million
a year thereafter. Annual provisions for possible losses would increase from
LT 1.7 million in 1972 to LT 23.1 million in 1977. Given the past experience
this should provide adequate protection.  Dividends on TSKB's ordinary shares
are forecast to remain constant at 12%. A 50% share capital increase, from



- 23 -
LT 193.L million to LT 290.1 million, is projected for 1976 but TSKB has agreed
to consider advancing the contemplated share increase by one year. The dividend
pay-out ratio would increase from 35% in 1972 to 48% in 1973, mainly due to
the share capital increase in 1972, but would decrease to 29S/ in 1977.  The book
value of a TSKB share would increase from  167% at the end of 1972 to 255% in
1977.
5.22       Projected balance sheets through 1977 are shown in Annex 10. Orn tiD
basis of the projected volume of business, TSKB's total assets would more th}an
treble in the period 1972-77, from about LT 2,366 million (4169 million equivalenm2)
at the end of 1972 to LT 7,912 million (N565 million equivalent) at the end r.f 1977.
TSKB's long-term portfolio is to increase from about LT 2 billion in 1972, 82%
of total assets, to LT 7.3 billion, 92% of total assets, in 1977. On its projections,
TSKB would exceed the present contractual debt limit of Lt:1 sometime in 1973.
The quality of TSKB's portfolio is sound and is covered by good glarantees as
well as by adequate provisions.  In addition, TSKB's follow-up of its projects
is connnendable and allows TSKB to keep on top of its clientsr financial situation.
Finally, TSKB is liquid and will be able to maintain a reasonable debt-service
coverage. Therefore, a relaxation in the present debt limit woould be justified.
A prudent limit will be 5:1 as defined in the Loan Agreement, 713-TU. A limit
of that level would require TSKB to add about LT 100 million to ita net worth in
1975, the equivalent of the amount by which it now plans to increase its share
capital in 1976.TSKB's present and projected profitability should ensure that such
an issue will meet with success.  TSKB's ratio of long-term debt to net worth
would then reach a potential maimum of between 8 and 10 in the years 1973-77.
An increase in share capital earlier than planned would still maintain the present
iLvidend ratio of 12%.
5.23      Provisions for possible losses would amount to LT 31.3 million
at the end of 1972, representing 1.6Z of TSKB's total portfolio. By the
end of 1977, such provisions would have reached LT 116.6 million, and the
percentage remains about the same; at that time free reserves would have
reached LT 450 million, about 6X of TSKB's portfolio and guarantees.
5.24      Projected cash flow statements for the second half of 1972, and
the entire years 1973 through 1977, are given in Annex 17. These and the
projected income statements show that the debt service cover would be ade-
quate during the forecast period. Annual interest payments throughout the
period range from 60% to 70% of TSKB's annual profits before financial ex-
penses. Principal repayments by TSKB range from 73% to 80% of its annual
collections. The overall debt service cover will be 1.4s times in 1972-77.
-Principal repayments by TSKB in respect of the Government subordinated loan
will start in 1981. The annual repayment of this loan will range from
LT 6.11 million to LT 7.6 million during the first 10 years. It i s expected
that the debt service cover would not fall below 1.2 times by the time the
Droposed Bank loan is fully repaid in 1987, if TSKB maintains in the future
the financial balance it, has traditionally adopted.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      TSKB continues to play an important role in Turkey for financing
the private industrial sector. It has been financing about 8% of total
private industrial investments and about 20% of imported equipment needed
by private enterprise. Since the latest Bank loan was made, TSKB has given
more emphasis in identifying and financing export-oriented projects, and in
seeking geographical diversification of its activities. TSKB has moved
forward in the right direction but continued efforts appear necessary.
Equity purchases were modest, however.
6.02      The company made further efforts to improve its organization, aim-
ing at increasing internal coordination among staff members responsible for
project appraisal. As a result, the appraisal work has been further upgraded.
With a competent staff, the good standard is expected to be maintained in rthe
future. TSKB's portfolio is sound and adequate provisions have been made
over the years to cover possible losses. Although TSKB has had higher ar-
rearages since the August 1970 devaluation, it has been making progress in
improving the situation. TSKB's earnings performance has been satisfactory.
It has a good dividend record, and it has been able to build up its net worth
base by periodic share issues.
6.03      With the improvement of the industrial investment climate in 1972,
TSKB's outlook to carry a substantial volume of operations is bright. To
diversify its operations TSKB has also decided to finance the tourism sec-
tor; TSKB also expects to do more underwriting and guaranteeing of corporate
bond issues. Regarding its equity investments, increases will likely be
gradual and no dramatic change is expected in the near future, but TSKB
should be more active in this field than in the past. This aspect has
TSKB's attention. The Bank should in any event put pressure on TSKB to
provide an adequate contribution to this objective.
6.04      In order to do business on a substantial scale, TSKB needs fresh
resources. To date, TSKB's resource mobilization has always been a difficult
problem. TSKB has been successful in raising new equity capital and has
mobilized some funds through sales from its equity portfolio. But these
are not too significant compared to needs. TSKB continues to look to the
Bank for a substantial portion of fresh resources, but the Bank's exposure
in TSKB is already great and should be reduced as TSKB now seems to be able
to diversify its resources. Since other official foreign sources will
provide part of the needed amounts, TSKB has decided, following Bank advice,
to move forward toward tapping private foreign sources. With the help of IFC
and the approval of the Turkish Government,   chances of obtaining credits
in the Euro-dollar markets are good. These private foreign credits may be
more costly than Bank funds but the projected financial position of TSKB
is such that it would be able to pay market rates for foreign financial
borrowings, particularly if the government agrees to waive the witholding
tax on such borrowings. The picture is more bleak as to raising new local
currency resources because market costs of long-term funds in Turkev are
considerably higher than TSKB's lending rate which is fixed by the Government.
Until this constraint is removed,or unless the Government provides
funds at concessionary terms,TSKB will not be able to tap Turkish banking
sources unless it can blend lower-cost foreign exchange borrowings, in-
cluding a high spread on the proposed Bank loan, with lira bond issues
and local borrowings at a negative spread.



- 25 -
6.05      With a lesser resource constraint TSKB should be able to increase
its lending and equity investments considerably. TSKB expects its commitments
nn the next two calendar years, 1973-1974, to about double the level reached
in the two years - 1971-72. To finance the resulting foreign exchange resource
gap of '73 million, TSKB expects to raise at least 825 million in the Euro-dollar
markets. A proposed Bank loan of $40 million will enable TSKB to meet the major
part of the remaining resource gap, and provide an incentive for TSKB to raise
more of the needed funds elsewhere.
6.0      TSKB continues to be a suitable and creditworthy borrower from the
Bank.  It has good business prospects.  A Bank loan to TSKB in the amount of
US$'4o million equivalent is proposed which would enable TSKB to meet an
important part of its resource gap in the two-year period ending December 31,
197h. A loan in that amount will not meet all of the forecast resource gap in
this period and therefore should provide enough additional incentives to
TSKB to raise more foreign resources elsewhere than it currently plans to do.
6 .07     The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to loans to
development finance companies, including the standard conmitment charge.
In recognation of TSKB's recent upgrading of its project appraisal work, an
increase in the free limit appears justifiable. It should be set at $1 million,
as compared to the 3750,000 applicable to present Bank loans to TSKB. Even
with a ;1 million free limit, the Bank could expect to receive for approval
sub-loans totalling about 65% of the proposed loan. An aggregate free limit
should be set at $12 million. TSKB's debt limit, as now defined, should be
set at five times equity.
6.0S      While TSKB would have the use of the relatively high spread on the
proposed new loan, the Bank has obtained TSKB's assurance to undertake special
efforts to expand their development activities and to endeavor to mobilize
lira resources from the market either in direct borrowings, or in guaranteeing
bonds amounting to at least LT 350 million in 1973 and 1974. Under the present
interest rate regime, TSKB will have to incur a loss in lending out their lira
resources raised at market rates. TSKB has also agreed to initiate, within
nine months of the date of the Loan Agreement, in consultation with the Bank,
a program for the promotion of industrial enterprises in less developed
areas of Turkey, and tourism projects, and review this program with the Bank
yearly thereafter. TSKB will set aside annually not less than 25% of the spread
earned on the proposed new loan for meeting promotional and other costs result-
ing from the execution of the program.
6.09      Within the framework of the Bank's economic work in Turkey, the
Bank intends to pursue the dialogue with the Government concerning the need
to bring lending and borrowing rates into better balance with a view to
facilitating at an early date TSKB's and other term financing institutions'
resource mobilization efforts at home and abroad. As part of this dialogue,
there should be an examination of the possible advantage of abandoning the
25% expenditure tax on inter-bank borrowings.



- 26 -
6.10       Arrangerents have also been made with TSKB to review in detail
with the Bank the findings of the Bank's Special Studies Mission with a view;
to reaching understandings concerning the operational conclusions to be drawn
from the Special Studies Mission's work.

Statetents of Po :ic-ies
I.        Statement of Operational Policies A2oted in June l950
1.        The Industrial. D3tlTh  -is a private institution which, though it will
consider the Governuijent's plans for the nztional. economy, Jill make decisions
on the basis of' what is best for the health and activity of private enter-
prises.
2.        The factor of primary importance in the Industrial Bank is not its
financial resources but the technical services through which its financial
aid will bc made effcctive.
3.        The Bank should have a first-class technical staff iwhose head and
iiuc1.eus TrmusC be sought, abroad.  it sill navaae investments only after full
exa-ination of applications by this staff.
4.        In selecting enterprises to be financed, the Bank will observe the
fol.lowing criteria:
a.  Production of goods of benefit to the Turkish economy;
b.  Soundness of the enterprise;
c. Quick realization anid profitableness of the enterprise; and
d.  Desirability of geographical distribution of investment.
5.        The Bank will keep Its interest rate as low as possible consistent
with the paymant of its dividends and the accunmulation of necessary reserves.
It may also charge a percentage of the profits of the financed enterprise in
return for the services of its technical staff.
6,        The Bank's financing may be in the form of loans, participations,
or both; the last is preferable in appropriate circumstances.  v,herever
possible, the client should provide at least 50 per cent of his capital.
7.        The Bank uill lend foreign exchange only for imports of equipment.
In order to make best use of its foreign exchar.ge, it should seek, insofar
as possible, to apply for use of the Government's ovn foreign exchange re-
sources,
8.        The Bank will obtain adequate security on its loans; require the
keeping of adequate records and the use of sound accounting procedures; and
obtain rights of inspection and audit and, in the event of faulty manage,rent,
of interverntion in the enterpri3es it finances.
9.        The Bank will seek to sell its participations to the tiidest public
and at the earliest mromzent practicable.

10.      zTe Bank will seek to interest foreign capital in investment in
YThrkey.
1l,       The Banik should use its influence in trying to improve government
adrministration relating to business so as to better the working conditions
and so the confidence of all-private enterprise.
II.       Policy Resolution Adopted in ilarch 1963 and Amended on October 28,
1966

in the public and private sectors the Bank will keep regular and continuous
contact with the State Planning Organization through the Economic Research
Departrment.

risks the Bank will follow the followi:ng policies:

1966.
(c)  The Bank shall not purchase the shares of any company corre-
snonding to mroe than 25' of its subscribed capital; provided, however, that

company cannot be sold ,hen the Bank acts as an underwriter shall constitute
an exception to the provislon of thi-s paragraph.
(d) The total of the Bank's capital participations 2t cost price
si.all not at any time exceed TIL 175 million.
(e)  The Bank will try to find partners such as D'C or similar in-
vestors to participate in the financing of large manuf'acturing projects to be
realized by private sector.
The provisions of b, c, andi d, do not apply to shares received in
exhnlige for debit in a liquidation or reorganization or to conversion of
debt into shares necessary to protect th, Bankj  s it_--rests.
This resolution will not be ameneded without the prior consent of
3.        The economic criteria to be applied on investm3nt loans is ar,ended

(c) promise reduction in costs and selling prices and-or improve-
mont in the quality of products, or
(d) are of importance from the standpoint of the realization of
the production targets set forth in the Development Plan.
3m1.      Policy Resolution adopted November 9, 1967 Amending the 1963 Re-
solution on Economic Criteria to be applied in Investigating
Applications for financing
1.        In order to avoid the creation of idle capacity in the economy and
hence, a waste of capital, priority be given to projects with high rates of
using the productive capacity.
2.        Efforts be made for ensuring a harmony with the annual programs of
the Development Plan in the outlines of the distribution of our resources
among the branches of industry.
3.        In the processing of the projects, the cost of the finished products
which would be calculated at the rate of exchEnge as applied by the State
Planning Organization in project evaluation be compared with tne world prices
and priority be given to those projects wJhich show an export potential, which
can survive without protective measures, and t.hich can compete with the
minimnm protection, respectively.

1.    Interest rates on new sub-loans (both foreign exchange and local currency loans)
starting November 9, 1970 is 12% per annum.
2.    An average 24  spread on aU  future resources is assumed, with the exception of

a negative spread of 3% is assumed for bond issues and a spread of 1% for other
LT funds.
3.    Administration expenses were increased by LT 1 million in 1972 and hence will
increase 7% per year, while salaries will increase by 15%.  (This takes into con-
sideration the cost of living adjustment.)
4.    Foreign exchange and Turkish Lira commitments for the years 1972-77 are assumed
to be as follows:
$ million            LT million

1976                         125
1977                         125
6.    50% of approvals will be committed in the current year;  the remaining 50% will
be committed in the following year.
7.    50% of commitments will be disbursed in the current year;  the remaining 50%
will be disbursed in the following year.
8.    Foreign currency operations will be financed by (1)  IBRD loan, (2)  KfW loans,
(3) E.I.B. loans and (4) funds from other sources.
9.    Local currency operations will be financed by (1)  repayments, (2)  retained
earnings, (3)  share capital increase (It is also assumed that the share capital
will be increased by 50% in 1976 and fully paid at the end of the year.) and
(4)  Ministry of Finance loan (E.I.B. and KfW LT loans).
10.   Tourism projects will be financed by (1)  AID, KfW, E.I.B., LT loans, (2)
TSKB's own resources and (3) funds from other sources.
11.   Provisions for losses to be made in 1972-1977 will represent around 1.5% of the
loan portfolio at the end of each year.
12.   Provision for retirement and dismissal were considered to be 1.5 times of the
total amount of monthly salaries.
