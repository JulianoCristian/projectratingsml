strengthening the economic viability of its\n            investments in the port subsector; and (c) encourage\n            policies and institutional measures.  The project consists\n            of an investment component and an institutional development\n            component.  The investment component finances: (a) selected\n            subprojects of the Office of Port Operations (ODEP's)\n            investment program for the period 1991-1993; (b) a portion\n            of the investment and maintenance program of the Ministry of\n            Public Works (MPW) for the period 1991-1993; and (c)\n            construction of a radar control tower for marine security.\n            Selected subprojects specifically include:  (i) a new\n            container terminal at Casablanca; (ii) a coal handling\n            facility at Jorf Lasfar; (iii) improved Ro-Ro facilities at\n            Tangier; (iv) equipment for port security; and (v) technical\n            assistance and training.  MPW's program focuses\n            entirely on rehabilitation of breakwaters and dredging.  The\n            Development Programs of the port provide a comprehensive\n            time-bound framework for monitoring the key institutional\n            development objectives with particular reference to: (a)\n            quality and efficiency of port services; (b) trade\n            facilitation; (c) investment planning; (d) environment and\n            safety; and (e) finance."}, "docdt": "1990-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
