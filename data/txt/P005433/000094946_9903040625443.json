overall outcome of the project is\n            rated as satisfactory. The lessons drawn from the\n            implementation of the project: 1) Good preparation, and\n            identification of the Borrower's implementing and\n            financial capacity, were key to the success of the project.\n            In addition, direct lending to a well-structured\n            institution, Office for Port Management (ODEP) rather than\n            on-lending to that institution by the Government, enhanced\n            ODEP's ownership of the project and facilitated\n            cooperation between the Bank and ODEP. 2) Close cooperation\n            between the Bank and the Borrowers during identification,\n            preparation, and supervision of the project ensured that the\n            project responded to the Borrowers' needs, that the\n            process of problem solving enhanced Borrowers' skills,\n            and that it reinforced their ownership of the project. 3)\n            Regarding the outcome of the Vessel Traffic Service\n            component, it can be concluded that the budgetary and\n            technical responsibility for a subproject involving several\n            departments should preferably be assigned to a single\n            entity, and the project unit and its manager should be\n            identified at appraisal stage. 4) Trade facilitation is too\n            complex to be handled in a sub-sector project, unless a\n            process is defined at appraisal, responsibilities are\n            clearly apportioned, the objective is actively endorsed by\n            key players, and private sector constituencies already favor\n            the reforms."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
