In a country with weak capacity in the public\n            service, it is important that the project designs are kept\n            simple with well defined components. In a post conflict\n            country where capacity is very weak, it is essential to\n            provide a short term capacity building support whilst a long\n            term strategy is developed build institutional capacity.
