The project implementation was delayed by\n            insufficient budgetary allocations, limited capacity within\n            the commission for the preparation of final designs and\n            bidding documents, lack and poor performance of contractors\n            in the remote project area, and declining government support\n            during the first years of project implementation. At\n            completion, three years behind schedule, only about half of\n            the original project components were implemented and 48\n            percent of the Bank loan was cancelled. Although the project\n            was not completed by the closing date, project objectives of\n            increasing food production and improving living conditions\n            in the Papaloapan Basin have been partly achieved. Despite\n            the reduction of the project scope, the productive and\n            production-support components have been successful,\n            resulting in significant increases in yields, cropped areas\n            and agricultural production both in irrigated and rain-fed\n            areas. This favorable outcome is mostly due to the\n            suitability of technical packages and efficiency of\n            extension services. The social infrastructure program, which\n            benefited about 560,000 people, was adversely affected by\n            uneven quality of construction, lack of integration with\n            productive components, and poor interagency cooperation."}, "docdt": "1985-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
