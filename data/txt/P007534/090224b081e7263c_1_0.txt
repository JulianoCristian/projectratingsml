For purposes of this paragraph, expenditures for construction of civil works
include, where appropriate, expenditures for engineering, design and supervision
of construction, which in no case shall exceed 10% of all other construction costs.
2.    The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compliance with the
policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan shall be disbursed on account
of payments for taxes levied by, or in the territory of, the Guarantor on goods
or services, or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof;
to that end, if any such taxes shall be included in the cost of any item to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,
correspondingly adjust the disbursement percentage then applicable to such item.
3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals shall
be made in respect of expenditures: (i) prior to the date of this Agreement; (ii)
for land acquisition; and (iii) for household plumbing and electrical wiring.


﻿10
4.    Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan or the disbursement
percentages set forth in the table in paragraph I above, if the Bank has reasonably
estimated that the amount of the Loan then allocated to any Category will be
insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Category,
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate to such Category to the
extent required to meet the estimated shortfall proceeds of the Loan which are
then allocated to another Category and which in the opinion of the Bank and
the Borrower are not needed to meet other expenditures; and (ii) if such reallocation
cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then
applicable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under such
Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
5.   If the Bank, after consultation with the Borrower, shall have reasonably
determined that the procurement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with
the procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures for
such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may,
without in any way restricting or limiting any other right, power or remedy of
the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such
amount of the Loan as in the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount
of such expenditures which would otherwise have been eligible for financing out
of the proceeds of the Loan.
