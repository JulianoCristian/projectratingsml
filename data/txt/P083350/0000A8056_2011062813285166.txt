                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has progressed well towards the goals set up for the Project Development Objectives (PDO). Important progress was noted in the reduction of child and maternal
                         mortality. The project contributed to improving (i) the contraceptive prevalence coverage (modern methods), which increased from 5% in 2006 to 16% in 2010; (ii) the decrease of the
                         under-five mortality (from 198 to 131 per 1,000); (iii) maternal mortality (from 700 per 100,.000 to 554 per 100,.000): and (iv) infant mortality (from 81 per 1,000 to 63.2 per 1000). The
