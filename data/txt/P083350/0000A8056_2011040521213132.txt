                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards the goals set up for the Project Development Objectives (PDO). Important progress has been noted in the improvement of the Contraceptive
                         prevalence coverage (modern methods), which increased from less than 5% in 2006 to at least 12% and perhaps even 16% in 2010. The reproductive health activities continue to be
                         at the center of the efforts made by the country in order to reduce the mortality levels of women and children.
