1. 
This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Vice President of the Middle East and North Africa 
Region to provide a grant in an amount of US$ 10 million to the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) for an 
Emergency Banking Sector Reform Project.  The objective of the Project is to strengthen the supervisory 
framework for financial intermediation and to build capacity of financial institutions to support 
implementation of Phase I of the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy.
2
2. 
Specifically, the proposed operation will focus on four main components: (i) institutional and 
operational restructuring of the two main state-owned commercial banks (Rasheed Bank and Rafidain 
Bank); (ii) financial restructuring of the two main state-owned commercial banks; (iii) strengthening of 
the regulatory and supervisory functions of CBI; and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation.  
Overall, this operation would assist Iraq in implementing Phase I of their program, covering the period 
from 2009 to 2010.  It will thereby foster more efficient financial intermediation, resource mobilization 
and risk management, and, in the medium-term, it will permit an increase in private participation in the 
provision of financial services. 
 
3. 
The project is financed through the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF), which is administered by the World 
Bank. The grant will be for CBI
—the recipient and implementing agency. The Bank is also working 
closely with the Ministry of Finance, the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA), the two state-owned 
commercial banks, the Executive Restructuring Committee, and the Restructuring Oversight Committee 
(ROC). There has been strong collaboration with development partners, namely, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU), the US Department of Treasury, and the Financial 
Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC) funded by the US Department of State-Near Eastern Affairs.  In 
addition to the regular coordination, monthly donors meetings are being held to ensure synergy and 
delivery of quality services to the Iraqi counterparts. Donors have been instrumental in moving the 
restructuring process forward.

A. Country 
Context 
4. 
The Republic of Iraq—with an area of about 437,000 square kilometers with an estimated 
population of 27 million in 2006—has been adversely impacted by internal and external shocks.  A series 
of wars, international sanctions and misdirected economic policies have left the country’s economy and 
especially its financial sector weak and underdeveloped. The last two decades have also witnessed a 
worsening in a number of human development indicators. Iraq’s economy remains dominated by the oil 
sector, which provides about 95 percent of foreign exchange (FX) earnings. From 2003 to 2007, violence 
in Iraq has impeded economic recovery and reconstruction. Although significant risks remain, recent 
political and security developments have improved Iraq’s economic outlook for the medium term. 
 
According to recent reports total security incidents have fallen to their lowest level in over four years. 
Nonetheless, the security situation remains fragile in certain areas. A poll conducted in March 2008 
shows that 62 percent of those polled say security in their own area is good—up from 43 percent in 
2007—but half of all Iraqis still rate security as the biggest problem for the country overall. 
 
2
Phase I of the Government of Iraq Banking Reform Strategy covers the period 2009-2010. Additional funding, such as local 
government fund
ing and donors’ financial support, will be considered to support the second phase, covering the period of 2011-
2012.

5. 
Macroeconomic performance has improved considerably since 2007. Monetary policies have 
been tight and sound fiscal policy and under-spending of the capital budget have kept the fiscal balance in 
check. As a result, inflation was brought down to 5 percent by end 2007, from 65 percent at end-2006. 
The overall consumer price level in 2008 is projected at 12 percent, reflecting inflationary pressures 
stemming from increasing food and fuel prices in the earlier part of the year.  
 
6. 
Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to increase to almost 10 percent in 2008, 
up from only about 1.5 percent in 2007, driven largely by the ongoing expansion of oil output. Provided 
the recent reduction in violence takes hold, crude oil production is expected to reach on average at least 
2.3 mbpd and exports 1.8 mbpd, both higher than initially targeted. Although agricultural output in 2008 
is likely to be affected by drought, other non-oil economic activities are expected to recover significantly. 
CBI has maintained a prudent monetary stance in order to stave off inflationary pressures. 
 
7. 
Iraq has been hit hard by the recent decline in oil prices. After reaching a substantial fiscal surplus 
in 2008, the Iraqi government had to readjust downward the 2009 budget in order to reflect falling oil 
prices. The 2009 budget was built on a budget oil price of US$ 50 per barrel, with total revenues of about 
US$ 42.5 billion in 2009, down from US$ 70.1 billion in 2008.  Aggregate fiscal expenditures for 2009 
are projected at US$ 59.5 billion, of which US$ 12.2 billion (or about 20.5 percent of total expenditures) 
represent total investment spending.  The preliminary projected deficit is in the order of US$ 17 billion.  
Overall growth is still forecast to be about 8 percent and inflation should be contained at 10 percent in 
2009. 
The deterioration in Iraq’s fiscal situation has increased the interest by the Iraqi authorities in 
finding alternative sources of financing, including non-concessional funding.  Under the new ISN, an 
IBRD envelope of US$ 500 million can be committed for investment projects over the next two and a half 
years. 
B. 
Financial Sector Overview 
8. 
The Iraqi financial sector is dominated by the banking system. As of June 2008, the banking 
system comprised 29 banks, of which two are state-owned commercial banks, 23 are private banks, and 4 
small state-owned specialized banks. Capital markets, besides government debt instruments, are almost 
nonexistent. Iraq had a nascent stock exchange but it was closed after the privatization program ended, 
following the imposition of sanctions, and it has recently resumed operations. However, trading on the 
Iraq Stock Exchange has remained thin. State-owned insurance companies, which had been largely 
inactive during the previous regime, are small compared to the size of the economy. Nevertheless, the 
financial system in Iraq has considerable potential for further development and growth. 
 
9. 
The banking system in Iraq is dominated by state-owned banks that account for more than 90 
percent of the banking system’s total assets.
 3
 
Their consolidated assets total about US$ 26 billion 
(equivalent to 51 percent of GDP). The system has a total network of 550 branches, of which 450 are for 
state-owned banks. The state-owned Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank are the largest commercial state-
owned banks in Iraq (accounting for 70 percent of the system’s assets), and the only ones with a national 
network of branches (147 and 142 branches respectively). In addition to these two large state-owned 
banks, there are four small state-owned specialized banks, namely Agriculture Co-operative Bank, 
Industrial Bank of Iraq, Real Estate Bank of Iraq, and the Ishtiraqi (Socialist) Bank—the latter was 
3
Iraq nationalized its commercial banks in 1964. In 1974, four commercial banks were merged into one
—Rafidain, which had a 
commercial banking monopoly in Iraq until Rasheed Bank was established. Along with its normal commercial banking 
operations, Rafidain Bank also conducted some transactions for the Government of Iraq that are part of central bank activities in 
most countries. Rasheed Bank has a large domestic branch network but no foreign branches.  Before the first Gulf war, Rafidain 
was the Arab world’s largest commercial bank with total assets of US$47 billion and a branch network outside of Iraq, notably in 
Beirut, Cairo, Amman, Bahrain, and Sanaá.

recently renamed Iraq Bank and will soon be folded into Rafidain Bank. The state-owned specialized 
banks have 69 branches in total, and have about 2,000 employees in aggregate. 
 
10. 
Most of the private banks are small and their activities are limited to provision of transactions 
services to a select clientele. Their operation began in 1993, when private banks with nationwide branches 
were established in Iraq.  Despite the proliferation of private banks, their contribution to the banking 
sector remains minor.  There are also several foreign banks in Iraq, and some have invested in Iraqi 
private banks that
—once the security situation settles down—will bring new expertise and competition 
into the system.
4
11. 
Financial intermediation in Iraq is weak. Although the banking sector is the main component of 
the Iraqi financial system, it offers few credit facilities, despite the fact that many of the branches have 
resumed operations after the 2003 turmoil.  The credit culture is poor with very little extension of credit to 
the private sector. Total bank lending to the private sector is equivalent to only 3.6 percent of GDP in 
December 2008 (Table 1).  Bank lending is heavily skewed towards government securities. Very few 
banks offer loans with more than one year maturity and most banks lack the expertise to offer appropriate 
credit facilities or assess risks. Compared to some other countries in the region the deposit base and loan 
portfolio of Iraqi banks is small relative to GDP.

12. 
Correspondingly, the asset structure of state-owned commercial banks is heavily tilted toward 
government securities and involves little credit to the corporate sector, be it public or private.
5
Government in turn financed itself in issuing debt in the form of Treasury Bills subscribed by the banking 
sector—mostly Rafidain and Rasheed, but also the central bank, using the high reserve requirement. As a 
result, government securities directly account for a sizeable share of the two state-owned commercial 
bank’s assets, and indirectly, through their reserves in the central bank. This process means that the 
government effectively acts as intermediary between banks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). At the 
same time, SOEs placed their deposits with state-owned commercial banks. Given the limited financing 
extended by banks to the SOEs sector, the latter appears to be, in aggregate, a net creditor of the state-
owned banks, though some enterprises are, of course, net borrowers. 
 
13. 
Despite the political situation, the state-owned commercial banks are trusted names and continue 
to increase deposits in terms of volume and number of depositors. They are also the backbone of the 
payments system and are the only instrument the government has to make social security and other 
nationwide payments. While, the state-owned banks have wide name recognition, a reasonable level of 
public trust and are fairly liquid, they need a clear strategy and an effective governance and managerial

structure for their activities to make a contribution to development. This would require the adoption of a 
comprehensive reform strategy for the banking sector. 
 
14. 
The Government of Iraq must move quickly to reform the financial sector, particularly the state-
owned commercial banks, which are the largest component. These two banks require assistance to 
strengthen corporate governance, establish a strong management structure, develop a clear business 
strategy, and improve skills in the critical areas of payments, risk management, and controls. They also 
require an overhaul of policies and practices to address portfolio, and operational problems, so as to put 
the banks on the road towards satisfactory and sustainable performance. They are encumbered with long 
overdue non-performing loans (NPLs) and have weak operational capacity, outdated systems and 
ineffective controls. The state-owned banks must be reformed to enable them to better serve the market; 
operate in a more competitive market as new entrants expand, and enhance their franchise and market 
value should their ownership structure be opened up to private interests. Only then can these banks 
operate and grow in what, once peace is restored, is likely to be an increasingly open and competitive 
environment. 
C. 
Progress Made in Banking Sector Reform  
15. 
Banking sector reform is a key item on the Iraqi government’s reform agenda and a key 
component of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF. The Deputy Prime Minister in February 
27, 2008, announced that 2008 is the “Banking Reform Year”.  Over the past years, the Government of 
Iraq has been focusing on reforming the banking sector with a special emphasis on the state-owned banks 
and CBI.  These efforts have been supported by various donors.  In February 2009, the Government of 
Iraq endorsed a comprehensive two-phase Banking Reform Strategy—Action Plan for the period 2008-
2012 with the World Bank support.
6
16. 
The Iraqi authorities have made considerable progress over the past years in starting the reform 
process of the banking sector.
 
Various steps were taken to establish a conducive institutional 
environment.  On December 2006, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Rafidain Bank and 
Rasheed Bank was signed between CBI and the Ministry of Finance regarding the steps for and 
sequencing of operational and financial restructuring.
7
A
Restructuring Oversight Committee  consisting 
of the Minister of Finance, the Governor of CBI, and the Chairman of the Board of Supreme Audit has 
been established to ensure that restructuring is executed in accordance with the MOU.  The Restructuring 
Oversight Committee oversees the work of the Executive Steering Committee, which is in charge of the 
implementation of the restructuring program.
8
The latter committee is chaired by the Deputy Governor of 
CBI. 
 
17. 
To ensure effective implementation, more than ten Restructuring Working Committees have been 
established within the two state-owned banks. Each of these working committees is dedicated to effective 
implementation of different components of the reform program. They include committees focusing on 
developing business plans; improving policies and procedures; drafting job descriptions; institutional 
reorganization; human resources; accounting and financial management (FM); IT; and; branch 
administration.  In addition, CBI has set up a task force to develop a comprehensive set of prudential 
regulations for commercial banks. 
6
This World Bank Banking Sector Reform project supports the first phase of the Government of Iraq Banking Reform Strategy, 
covering the period of 2009-
2010. Additional funding, such as local government funding and donors’ financial support, will be 
considered to support the second phase, covering the period of 2011-2012. 
7
The MOU sets the stage for the financial and operational restructuring of Rafidain and Rasheed as it provides for the owner to: 
(i) assume the large foreign debt liabilities of Rafidain; (ii) stand behind the state-owned banks, and honor all their liabilities until 
such time as their capital structure is in full regulatory compliance; and (iii) develop and carry out a credible time-bound 
medium-term plan for both operational and financial restructuring of the banks. 
8
This institutional set up has been supported by the US Treasury and the IMF.

18. 
Independent financial and operational audits of the two state-owned commercial banks were 
conducted in early 2008 and completed in July 2008 by an international audit firm
—Ernst and Young 
(E&Y) according to terms of reference (TOR) which the World Bank contributed to.
9
Although the 
audits were affected by the loss of information on branch loans and credit files during the war, and by 
limited access to documentation from branches outside Baghdad; they still provide adequate basis for 
developing restructuring action plans for both banks. 
 
19. 
There were several key operational shortcomings the financial and operational audits revealed, 
including: (i) operational rules and regulations are not clear for all employees, and reporting requirements 
and responsibilities are not clearly allocated; (ii) information technology and other financial infrastructure 
is inadequate and outdated and so are risk management models; (iii) product offering is limited; and 
(iv) the internal audit function’s methodology follows a compliance-based and not a risk-based approach. 
 
20. 
The World Bank has provided technical support and guidance to the Iraqi authorities for the 
development of a comprehensive, action-specific Banking Reform Strategy (2008-2012), which was 
endorsed by the Iraqi Authorities in February 2009.
10
 
The strategy includes a detailed Action Plan, and is 
divided into two phases, identifying key starting points for various activities with clear timeline and 
benchmarks.  The following are the seven key priorities of this plan: (i) organization structure; (ii) 
capacity building; (iii) finance and accounting systems; (iv) IT infrastructure; (v) risk management; (vi) 
internal audit and compliance with laws and regulations; and (vii) strengthening the banking supervisory 
and regulatory authority.  The Action Plan outlining the strategy to implement reforms in these seven key 
areas (contained in detail in Annex 12) was drafted and will be implemented by the Government of Iraq, 
ensuring ownership of the reform program. 
 
21. 
There have also been some developments in the implementation of the banking reform program. 
Considerable progress has been witnessed in the institutional, operational and financial restructuring of 
the two state-owned banks—Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank, through capacity building and training of 
staff. Moreover, a significant number of the prudential regulations required for banks have been prepared 
by CBI—including key regulations on licensing, capital adequacy, credit risk, large exposures, and 
liquidity—while the remaining regulations are expected to be completed soon. The introduction of several 
reforms and updated technology at CBI has allowed banks to conduct business on a more efficient and 
transparent basis. 
 
22. 
A Financial Restructuring Committee has been formed to address the problem of NPLs. 
Decisions have been made with regard to the resolution of many NPLs, especially those of SOEs. It is 
worth noting that recapitalization needs arising from NPLs are relatively modest despite the high share of 
NPLs (56 percent in value terms), because both banks’ loan portfolios are very small.  The government, 
represented by the Ministry of Finance is committed to address these issues. 
 
23. 
The government has insisted that the banks sort out and reconcile assets and liability accounts, 
before providing any new capital.  The state-owned banks have already begun the verification of their 
obligations toward foreign creditors under the Paris Club and discussion of other, related issues with the 
Ministry of Finance, and are making appropriate accounting adjustments to their books. Such adjustments 
will be verified for accuracy by qualified, independent, external auditors. The necessary recapitalization 
will then go hand-in-hand with the progress on the operational restructuring.  
 
9
Based on the 2006 financial accounts. 
10
 A benchmark of the IMF stand-by program with the Government of Iraq is the adoption of operational and financial 
restructuring program for Rasheed Bank and operational restructuring program Rafidain Bank based on the findings of the audits 
by end of 2008. 
Page  11
-

-
24. 
Modernization of the IT infrastructure of the state-owned banks is a crucial component of the 
financial sector reform action plan.  The Ministry of Finance selected the contractors to modernize the IT 
architecture in 2008.  A contract was signed between Rafidain Bank and the B-Plan Company to 
imple
ment “Core Banking System” that would automate bank operations.  Rasheed Bank is in the process 
of finalizing the selection of a vendor.  The mandate of the selected firms is to undertake gap analysis of 
the IT environment of the two banks with the objective of developing a comprehensive technology 
modernization strategy, prioritized development plan, an optimizing/standardizing application systems 
plan, and implementation of data warehousing capability plan.  
 
25. 
The legal and regulatory framework is also being modified to spur the development of an open 
and competitive financial sector. This work includes the review and overhaul of Iraqi banking laws—with 
the goal of adjusting the central bank and the commercial bank laws to the new market led conditions. 
One expected outcome is to put the private and public sector banks on a level playing field.  The new 
unified Iraq Commercial Banking Law of 2004 sought to provide a framework conducive to an open, 
market-based and well-regulated domestic banking system. It addresses the provisions for bank licensing 
while defining the rules on entry and exit (eliminating for instance existing requirements for majority 
Iraqi control of bank assets). It also suggested prudential guidelines related to capital adequacy and 
exposure limits to borrowers as a share of equity. 
 
26. 
The foundations of banking supervision, which involve both on-site and off-site supervision, have 
been improved over the past two years. Technical assistance (TA) provided by IMF has encouraged CBI 
to move from a rule-based to a risk-based system. The framework for and legislation on banking 
supervision are being modernized with a view to building a strong supervisory system; this is critical to 
ensure that the public has confidence in the financial system, and that banking activities are conducted 
with proper oversight from financial authorities. To this end, the approach to the development of the 
banking supervisory function has been based on an institutional development plan, identifying the critical 
areas for improvement, along with the expertise, resources, and training programs needed to build the 
required skills. 
D. Recovery 
Strategy 
27. 
One of Iraq’s main challenges is to build political legitimacy and credible, inclusive institutions 
needed for stability and sustainable economic prosperity.  In this context, restoring and improving basic 
services are essential for improving the quality of life, increasing government credibility, and restoring 
stability.  This would be achieved through development of institutions to regulate the market and business 
environment to encourage private investment, and broaden access to financial intermediation. 
 
International experience with reconstruction in conflict-affected countries has shown that a sound and 
efficient financial sector is essential for economic growth and development. 
 
28. 
The United Nations/World Bank Joint Needs Assessment of October 2003 identified support for 
Iraq’s transition from a centralized, state-dominated economic system to an open, market-based economy 
as one of the key development objectives for donor support.  Iraq enjoys two strong advantages as it 
attempts this transition: its natural endowment of oil resources, and its human capital, which reflects a 
long tradition of education, scientific and commercial skills, and entrepreneurial spirit.  As the security 
situation improves, the development of sound macroeconomic policies and a business environment 
conducive to private investment is key to spur growth and create jobs.  A well functioning financial sector 
is critical to supporting this growth. 
 
29. 
The International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) was endorsed at the 2003 Madrid 
Conference, to help donors channel their resources and coordinate their support for reconstruction and 
development activities in Iraq, and to ensure that activities financed by IRFFI are aligned with Iraq’s 
priority program.  IRFFI encompasses two trust funds: the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF), 
Page  12
-
7
-
administered by the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Group Iraq Trust Fund, 
administered by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).  As of end 2008, 25 donors have 
committed about US$ 1.85 billion to IRFFI, and deposited US$ 494.4 million to the ITF.  The ITF 
finances 15 active grants, valued at US$ 420.3 million.  The Banking Sector Reform Project, amounting 
to US$ 10 million, will be the nineteenth grant financed by the ITF. 
E. 
Rationale for Proposed Emergency Project 
30. 
Enhancing the performance of the banking system, and improving its capacity to provide sound 
and
 efficient financial services will make a critical contribution to Iraq’s economic growth and prosperity 
as well as poverty reduction. A sound banking system is of great importance to economic growth and 
macroeconomic stability, as numerous studies and empirical evidence have shown.  Moreover, there is a 
large body of research findings within and outside the World Bank showing that financial sector reforms 
are demonstrably linked to growth and poverty reduction.  For these reasons, building sound, efficient and 
inclusive financial systems that work for all members of society is central to the growth and poverty 
reduction agenda. 
 
31. 
The proposed operation aims at supporting the Iraqi government in building such a sound and 
efficient banking system, able in the medium-term to provide efficient financial service competitively.
1
1
This in turn would ensure efficient mobilization of funds and allocating them to the most productive 
investments—promoting private sector development.  Of primary importance is to build the capacity of 
the two largest state-owned commercial banks—Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank—with their huge 
branch network, accounting for more than 70 percent of the banking system,
12
 play an effective role in 
financial intermediation, able to provide the resources needed for Iraq’s growth and offer good deposit 
and payment systems for the business and household sector.  This would in a later stage allow private 
banks to also contribute to the financing of Iraq’s development. Underpinning the modernization of the 
state-owned banks would be the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the central 
bank.

ESPONSE AND 
S
TRATEGY
 
32. 
Bank restructuring is a politically difficult and long term task, which needs sustained Bank 
support.  Through this project, the World Bank has been playing a key role in the reform dialogue.  The 
World Bank has worked closely with the Iraqi counterparts; CBI, Ministry of Finance, Board of Supreme 
Audit, and the two state-owned commercial banks in developing the comprehensive “Iraq Banking 
Reform Strategy,” endorsed by the Iraqi authorities in February 2009.  The Bank is also engaged in 
ongoing discussions with the Executive Steering Committee, and the Restructuring Oversight Committee 
(ROC) regarding the implementation of the strategy. 
A. 
Collaboration with IMF and other Donors 
33. 
The Bank has been coordinating all efforts in partnership with all development partners actively 
involved in the banking reform in Iraq, namely, IMF, EU, US Treasury, and Financial Services Volunteer 
Corps.  Over the past five years, donors have been participating in seminars and workshops on banking 
restructuring, with the objective of supporting CBI, the Ministry of Finance, and the state-owned banks.  
This Banking Sector Reform Project will provide technical and financial assistance to support the 
11
 This World Bank Banking Sector Reform project supports the first phase of the Government of Iraq Banking Reform Strategy, 
covering the period of 2009-2010. Addit
ional funding, such as local government funding and donors’ financial support, will be 
considered to support the second phase, covering the period of 2011-2012. 
12
 Although the non-bank segment of Iraq’s financial Industry—capital markets and insurance—eventually needs to be addressed, 
a
precondition for this development is the resumption of effective banking operations.

-
restructuring process.  This project will build on the previous efforts undertaken and at the same time 
complement work being undertaken by other development partners.  The World Bank project will be 
focused on the two state-owned commercial banks to help them develop into healthy financial institutions 
following modern banking practices, and on upgrading CBI’s regulatory and supervisory capacity.  In that 
regard, there are various activities that are cross cutting among donors, such as the institutional, 
operational and financial restructuring where joint activities (capacity building workshops and training-of 
trainers) would be organized jointly. 
 
34. 
The donor community has been playing a vital and active role over the past few years in 
restructuring the banking sector.  There has been good collaboration between the World Bank and the 
IMF and other donors in Iraq in banking sector reform, namely, EU, US Treasury, and Financial Services 
Volunteer Corps (FSVC).  The donor community has been playing a vital and active role over the past 
few years in restructuring the banking sector.  The World Bank has been coordinating donors’ initiatives 
to avoid overlap, ensure complementarity, and address key issues on a timely and priority basis.  To this 
end, an ‘Iraq Banking Reform Donors Group’, chaired by the World Bank has been formed to coordinate 
efforts related to both technical and financial support provided to the Government of Iraq in the area of 
banking reform (see Annex 11).  Periodic meetings are being held to ensure synergy in the 
implementation of the reform program. 
 
35. 
The IMF has taken the lead in monetary activities, through the provision of TA with the objective 
of rebuilding the capacity of CBI, and other government bodies with a view to supporting financial and 
monetary stability.  IMF provided considerable assistance in: (i) the drafting of the central bank, payment 
and banking laws; (ii) supporting the introduction of a new currency and the implementation of the real 
time gross settlement (RTGS) system; (iii) 
improving accounting and financial reporting; and 
(iv) developing a banking regulatory and supervisory system, in line with best international standards and 
practices.  The medium-term objectives for TA in the monetary and financial sector will be to support the 
implementation of the program under the SBA, particularly the restructuring of the state-owned banks, 
and to bolster CBI’s capacities with regard to core central bank functions.  However, it is unlikely that the 
IMF will be able to provide as much assistance over the coming two years as it had during the past two 
years. 
 
36. 
Among the bilateral donors working closely with the Bank is the US.  The work undertaken by 
the U.S. Department of Treasury mainly focused on the financial restructure and completion of the 
financial and operational audits of two state-owned commercial banks—Rafidain Bank and Rasheed 
Bank; in addition to the development of a draft strategic and operational restructuring plan in accordance 
with the audit recommendations.  The U.S. Treasury had two resident advisors in Iraq since 2007 and 
expects to have four full time resident advisors before mid 2009.  The U.S. Treasury also provided 
assistance in the following areas: (i) organization structure; (ii) IT; (iii) human resources, assisting in 
developing new salary and pay for performance program; and (iv) reforming the existing policy and 
procedures.  The future plan—over the coming two years—will focus on providing assistance in the 
following areas: (i) strategic planning, formulation of business plans and budgets; (ii) job descriptions, 
policy and procedures of HR, human resources activities, and refining a new table of organizational 
structure; (iii) accounting systems, and information technology; (iv) operations and branch administration; 
and (v) credit and collection. 
 
37. 
In addition, the Financial Services Volunteer Corps will be providing technical assistance to CBI 
during 2009 and the most of 2010. Financial Services Volunteer Corps’ work plan includes advice to: (i) 
strengthen the internal operations of the central bank, including work to strengthen the banking 
supervision department; (ii) strengthen the management of state reserves; (iii) enable the CBI to broaden 
its network of counterparty financial relationships and; (iv) assist the CBI formulate a plan for addressing 
outstanding financial claims and judgments against it.  FSVC has offered to assist in the restructuring of 
Page  14
-
9
-
Rashid Bank and Rafidain Bank, but recognizes that other donors are either already working on that, or 
may be working on that at some time in the future.  Similarly, FSVC has been asked by the Governor for 
assistance on monetary policy issues, and is willing to provide such advice provided that it does not lead 
to duplication.  
B. 
Brief Description of Bank’s Strategy of Emergency Support  
38. 
The Bank has prepared a third ISN for Iraq, which was presented to the Board of Executive 
Directors in March 2009.  The ISN acknowledges Iraq’s unique circumstances and emphasizes the 
importance of providing an appropriate blend of financial assistance and knowledge support through 
analytical and advisory services.
13
 
Activities under this ISN would fall under at least one of three 
thematic areas of engagement: (i) continuing to support ongoing reconstruction and socio-economic 
recovery; (ii) improving governance and the management of public resources, including human, natural 
and financial; and (iii) supporting policies and institutions that promote broad-based, private-sector-led 
growth,
 
with the goal of revitalizing the private sector and facilitating job creation. 
 
39. 
While this proposed project will support the financial and operational restructuring of the two 
state-owned banks, its ultimate goal is to support private-sector-led growth through broader access to 
finance and financial services, in view of the importance of these two banks in Iraq’s financial sector. 
Therefore, the project is expected to directly contribute to the third thematic area, although its support to 
improving the payments system and strengthening the financial system will also contribute to ongoing 
socio-economic recovery efforts (as per the first thematic area) as well as public resource management 
improvements (as per the second thematic area). 
C. 
Eligibility for Processing under OP/BP 8.0 
40. 
The Government of Iraq has requested that the proposed project be financed from the ITF. The 
Second ISN for Iraq stipulates the use of OP/BP 8.50 for all ITF-funded projects.  OP/BP 8.00 (Rapid 
Response to Crisis and Emergencies), issued March 2007, now replaces OP/BP 8.50.  The proposed 
Banking Sector Reform Project is fully consistent with OP 8.00 criteria. 
 
41. 
Thus, the proposed project will clearly address the following priorities (as defined in Paragraph 4 
of OP 8.00): (i) restoring the means of production and economic activities; (ii) preserving or restoring 
essential services; (iii) establishing and/or preserving human, institutional, and/or social capital, including 
economic reintegration of vulnerable groups; and (iv) assisting with the crucial initial stages of capacity 
building for longer-term reconstruction, disaster management, and risk reduction.  The design of the 
project is benefiting from the flexibility allowed under OP/BP 8.00 to support more effective and rapid 
implementation, particularly with regards to procurement methods to be used. 
D. 
Consistency with Country Strategy  
42. 
The proposed project is fully consistent with the Bank’s engagement strategy in Iraq, which 
includes state-owned bank restructuring as a priority area.  The Iraqi National Development Strategy and 
the International Compact with Iraq also give priority to bank restructuring.  The Joint Management 
Action Plan (JMAP) for Iraq also indicates that while the Bank and IMF will cooperate closely on the 
financial sector, the Bank will take the lead in supporting the process of restructuring state-owned banks 
upon completion of the SBA.  The World Bank is making efforts to support policies and institutions that 
promote longer-term broad-based, private-sector-led growth.  This operation intends to contribute to the 
outcomes under this area of the Bank’s strategy moving forward.  The operation would help alleviate one 
of the impediments to a more efficient functioning of the financial system, and its ability, in the medium-
term, to improve financial intermediation in support of real sector growth.

Project Development Objectives 
43. 
The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the supervisory framework for financial 
intermediation and to build capacity of financial institutions to support implementation of Phase I of the 
Iraq Banking Reform Strategy.
14
 
F. 
Summary of Project Components 
44. 
In agreement with the Iraqi authorities, the proposed project would support the Iraqi authorities in 
implementing Phase I of their Banking Reform Strategy (2008-2012) and its Action Plan.  Table 2 
outlines the various phases of the reform program, indicating what would be accomplished every year 
throughout the coming four years.  This project comprises four main components: (i) assist in the 
institutional and operational restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks (US$ 5 million); 
(ii) provide TA for the financial restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks (US$ 1.0 
million); (iii) build capacity at CBI to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory functions of CBI 
(US$ 2.75 million); and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation (US$ 0.75 million).
1
5
A
detailed description of the project components is outlined in Annex 1, cost allocations in Annex 3, and 
TORs for the specific activities in Annex 13. 
 
i. 
Institutional and Operational Restructuring of the two State-owned Commercial Banks 
45. 
Under institutional and operational restructuring, this project would provide capacity building and 
training to the two state-owned banks staff, covering the following components of Phase I of  the Banking 
Reform Strategy: (i) 
reorganizing the organizational structure and implementing the changes; 
(ii) improving HR processes;
16
 (iii) conducting risk management, both credit and non-credit risk 
management; and (iv) IT infrastructure, covering all operational aspects, security system of information 
and management of information systems.  A detailed framework on institutional and operational 
restructuring of state-owned banks is provided in Annex 9. 
 
46. 
As far as institutional and operational restructuring is concerned, the World Bank project will 
coordinate training with all stakeholders (IMF, US Treasury, Financial Services Volunteer Corps, and 
other private companies involved in banking sector reform).  Various workshops will be held in 
coordination with other donors for the capacity building of the management and staff of the two-state-
owned banks, along with staff from the Ministry of Finance (owner), CBI (regulator), and the Board of 
Supreme Audit. These workshops will provide the participants the best practice in terms of organizational 
structure of commercial banks, helping them in establishing new units, such as Risk Management Units, 
and in identifying the required caliber.  This would also entail sharing with them means for improving HR 
processes. 
 
47. 
Training on risk management will include support for establishment of a well-functioning, 
adequately managed and completely staffed risk management organization in line with international and 
regional best practices; changes in the organizational structure, especially the set up of a risk control 
department; and development of manuals for risk management.  This will also entail amendments to 
existing credit approval procedures on the basis of accepted best practices; improved measuring and

15
 There are US$ 0.5 million unallocated. 
16
 This includes support for: (i) establishment of a well-functioning, adequately managed and completely staffed risk 
management organization in line with international and regional best practices; (ii) changes in the organizational structure, 
especially the set up of a risk control department; (iii) development of manuals for risk management; (iv) amendments to existing 
credit approval procedures on the basis of accepted best practices; (v) improved measuring and monitoring capabilities that will 
enable the banks to produce comprehensive and accurate reports on a bank-wide basis, including the ability to identify “single 
obligors” and aggregate such exposures; and (vi) training in human resource management.

monitoring capabilities that will enable the banks to produce comprehensive and accurate reports on a 
bank-
wide basis, including the ability to identify “single obligors” and aggregate such exposures; and 
training in human resource management. 
 
48. 
In addition, capacity building will also involve actual training of the banks’ branch staff in 
handling basic deposit-taking transactions, using computers, and loan officers’ capacity to assess credit 
risks.  Unless training can be held in Iraq, the training will focus initially on a cadre of selected bank staff 
outside Iraq to act as trainers of the staff (“training of the trainers”) in Iraq.  Following the training of 
these cadres, training programs will be set up in Iraq, if possible linked by video conference to the 
original trainers of the trainers so they can continue to provide just in time support.  This is likely to entail 
travel to a centralized training center in Iraq.  Indicators of performance for the grant will be the numbers 
of staff trained and growth of loans and deposits.

Based on the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy
—Action Plan (2008-2012). 
**
This World Bank Banking Sector Reform project supports the first phase of the Government of Iraq Banking Reform Strategy, covering the 
period of 2009-2010. Additional funding, such as local government funding and donors’ financial support, will be considered to support the 
second phase, covering the period of 2011-2012. 
 
49. 
This training is critical to ensure that the basic staff can handle deposits and start making sound 
loans, thereby attracting depositors and beginning to finance private sector growth.  
Specifically, the 
grant will help the banks' staff take deposits and make loans efficiently, and, eventually allow 
transactions across bank branches using an interconnection of branches.  
The interconnection of the 
Page  17
-
12
-
branches will make possible for bank managers in the banks' headquarters to monitor and limit risks, 
using the training provided by the IMF as well as the training under the grant.  At the moment, training 
has focused on improving the functions of Rafidain Bank’s head and foreign offices but will need to be 
extended to staff in the rest of Rafidain Bank and in Rasheed Bank. 
 
50. 
The project will fund TA to help develop the operational capacity of the two state-owned 
commercial banks based on the findings of the audits, the Action Plan, and the optimum use of the on-
going automation. The next steps will be to help the two institutions adopt modern banking practices and 
systems. Adherence to the restructuring and business plan would remain under close supervision of CBI 
throughout. The plan will entail defining, in light of country circumstances, the mandate of the state-
owned commercial banks with an initial focus on mobilization of savings and payments. Thus, the banks’ 
activities are likely to be narrowly limited on deposit taking and payment transactions. As their capacity 
increases, they will move into other core banking operations including the extension of credit to the 
corporate and household sectors. 
 
ii. 
Financial Restructuring of the two State-owned Commercial Banks 
51. 
This component would focus on capacity building and training in the following areas: (i) finance 
and accounting—restructuring the balance sheets of these two banks and developing the accounting 
systems; and (ii) internal audit and compliance, focusing on the process, audit framework, methodology, 
and effectiveness of internal audit.  The project will support in organizing workshops and provide 
technical assistance on the best means of addressing the problem of NPLs by sharing the experience of 
other developing and developed countries in cleaning up the balance sheets of their state-owned banks, 
and will also guide the Iraq authorities in choosing the most suitable approach to the Iraqi circumstances.  
In addition, the project will also ensure that the new accounting systems lead to balance sheets that reflect 
net asset values and the banks' financial position, through capacity building in the area of finance, 
accounting, internal audit and compliance.  For details see Annex 12, Section VI 
 
52. 
Following the recommendations of the audits of Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank, the Bank will 
assist, and advise the government in financial restructuring, and in choosing the best way to reduce NPLs 
and foreign debt. Financial restructuring would help state-owned banks to restore their ability to comply 
with minimum capital adequacy and other prudential requirements of CBI, and to restore their full 
credibility with their business counterparts, but will depend on the government’s activity to a large 
degree.  Audit recommendations 
inter-alia
 regarding build-up in provision levels at state-owned 
commercial banks need to be implemented
.
The Bank will monitor the process of recapitalization with the 
evolution of the capital adequacy ratio. 
 
53. 
The financial restructuring process would entail two steps: First, the government’s cleaning up of 
the institutions’ foreign liabilities (taking over the borrowings made at the behests of the former 
government) and SOE’s NPLs and second, meeting the needed regulatory capital requirements.  This 
process would involve the government’s resolution of the public enterprise NPLs; and possibly 
government funding to replace part of the non-recoverable loans of the small private sector NPLs (taking 
account of provisioning needs, recoverability and market value of collateral, as well as the potential for 
rescheduling selected problem loans).  It is worth mentioning that the settlement process of outstanding 
private claims as part of the liquidation of the London branch of Rafidain Bank is well under way and the 
process to liquidate fixed assets has begun and expected to conclude by end of 2009. 
 
iii. 
Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Functions of the CBI 
54. 
The project would provide capacity building to CBI to enhance its supervisory and regulatory 
authorities.  Under this component, support would provide in reviewing the existing banking supervision 
process, assessing the effectiveness of its supervisory apparatus to the adherence to international codes 
Page  18
-
13
-
and standards, and preparing a detailed action plan to address any deficient, gaps and needs in 
coordination with the IMF. 
 
55. 
Capacity building and training of the staff of the supervision department at CBI would include 
setting up the underpinnings of a strengthened regulatory and supervisory framework, focusing on on-site 
and off-site processes.  CBI needs to implement the corrective actions required to close the gap between 
existing practices at CBI and international accepted best practices.  Also, it could be focusing on 
developing and implementing appropriate supervisory tools and methodologies in addition to a 
comprehensive training program to enable staff members to cope with the new supervisory approach.  
Given that the Board of Supreme Audit will continue to play a key role in auditing and fiduciary oversight 
of the two state-owned commercial banks, the project would also provide support to the Board of 
Supreme Audit on its auditing role over banks.
17
 
CBI should embark on a comprehensive program of 
capacity building covering extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, as it should be 
seeking to move from compliance to risk-based supervision.  An assessment of banking supervision at 
CBI needs to be carried out.  A detailed plan for banking regulation and supervision is in Annex 10. 
 
iv. 
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation 
56. 
This component of the project covers all costs related to the management, monitoring and 
evaluation of the project.  It will include the costs associated with the establishment of PMU, along with 
salaries of PMU staff, that would include: (i) maintenance of office equipment; (ii) office supplies, 
utilities, and office administration costs, including translation, printing and advertising; (iii) 
communication costs; (iv) costs associated with the production of bidding documents; and (v) commercial 
bank charges.  Costs will also include: (i) transportation and travel including per diem allowance for PMU 
staff in travel status to attend supervision missions; any other project implementation related expenses as 
agreed by CBI and the Bank.
18
 
This operation aims at establishing a competent PMU capable of 
managing, monitoring and evaluating project implementation, acting as a technical secretariat for the 
authorities restructuring committees.  The PMU will also be responsible for preparing Project Reports on 
the basis of the indicators agreed upon. Each Project Report shall cover the period of one calendar 
quarter, and shall be furnished to the World Bank not later than one month after the end of the period 
covered by such report. 
G. Expected 
Outcomes 
57. 
Overall, the World Bank proposed project is expected to lead the two state-owned commercial 
banks (Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank) to adopting a comprehensive restructuring plan as spelled out 
in the Banking Reform Strategy, mainly implementing the first phase of the action plan.  Since the project 
would be for less than two years, where the closing date is October 31, 2010, the expected outcomes 
would be limited to what would be achieved within this timeframe (Annex 2).  Expected outcomes under 
each project component is as follows: 
ƒ
Institutional and operational restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks.
 
Expected outcomes under the first component include: (i) in depth improvement of the 
functioning of the two state-owned commercial banks, as evident in the capacity building of staff 
(number of staff trained in banks operations
—making new loans and deposits); and (ii) the two 
state-owned commercial banks resuming lending and taking deposits (as evident in the loan-to-
GDP ratio). 
17
 The State 
Audit’s responsibilities include state-owned banks, their subsidiaries, and public enterprises in which Rafidain Bank 
and Rasheed Bank have stakes and shareholdings. 
18
 The procurement of these items would follow the Recipient’s administrative procedures, satisfactory to the Bank. The project 
would not finance the salaries of the Recipient’s civil servants.

ƒ
Financial restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks.
 
Expected outcomes 
include: (i) implementation of audit recommendations 
inter-alia
 regarding build-up in provision 
levels at state-owned commercial banks and reducing NPLs. In that respect, it is hoped that the 
government will recapitalize the two state-owned commercial banks by the government to the 
extent feasible under fiscal constraints; (ii) balance sheets reflect bank net asset values and 
financial position; and (iii) recapitalization of the two state-owned commercial banks by the 
government to the extent the government agrees and given fiscal constraints. 
ƒ
Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory functions of CBI.
 
This component is 
expected to lead to: (i) capacity building granted to the supervisory and regulatory bodies of the 
CBI; and (ii) CBI strengthened the effectiveness of its supervisory apparatus. 
ƒ
Project management, monitoring and evaluation.
 
Expected outcomes under the fourth 
component are: (i) recruitment of qualified staff capable of effectively managing the project; 
(ii) capacity building granted to the Executive Steering Committee, supporting the reform 
program; and (iii) efficient and smooth execution of the project. 
 
58. 
In support of Phase I of the Government’s Banking Reform Strategy and its Action Plan, the 
project components, and expected outcomes for the operation are summarized in Annex 2.

CTIVITIES
 
59. 
Bank restructuring is a long term and politically challenging task.  If there is not strong support 
from all parties involved, the operation will not be successful.  In this case, the Government of Iraq and 
all of the relevant agencies, as well as, individual banks are supportive of the restructuring process.  The 
financial sector dialogue conducted over the past year has allowed for a common view to emerge on a 
number of sector policy issues, embodied in the Banking Reform Strategy.  An appraisal mission was 
conducted in November 22–25, 2008 (Annex 7 provides project preparation and appraisal team 
members).  With the available data and information, the following, which is quite limited, is a summary 
of the economic, financial, institutional, fiduciary, environmental and social aspects of the proposed 
project: 
 
60. 
Economic and Financial Aspects.  
Iraq has been hit hard by the recent decline in oil prices, 
although macroeconomic performance has been considerably improved since 2007.  After reaching a 
substantial fiscal surplus in 2008, the Iraqi government had to readjust downward the 2009 budget in 
order to reflect falling oil prices.  Overall growth is still forecast to be about 8 percent and inflation should 
be contained at 10 percent in 2009.  The deterioration in Iraq’s fiscal situation has increased the interest 
by the Iraqi authorities in finding alternative sources of financing, including non-concessional funding.  
Successful implementation of the Banking Reform Strategy would ensure that the overall financial system 
and the banking system specifically, would contribute better to economic development and growth.
 
61. 
The Government of Iraq is committed to implementing the reform strategy, and has requested 
Bank’s support in the implementation process.  There has been a broad agreement on the substance and 
design of the operation components, the scope of World Bank assistance, and the need to proceed 
diligently with the reform program.  Actions on these components are, overall, progressing satisfactorily.  
Bank staff will also continue the policy dialogue with the institutions involved in the implementation of 
the operation, as well as coordinate effectively with donors. At the same time, the Bank will ensure the 
deployment of staff and consultants able to advise the government in all of the policy and technical areas 
pertaining to the reforms. 
 
62. 
There is also a shared understanding among development partners actively involved in the 
financial sector reforms, in particular US Treasury and IMF that are supporting the objectives of the 
Page  20
-
15
-
proposed operation and have indicated their intent to continue their financial and technical assistance to 
the authorities in the financial sector, all of which would ensure effective completion of the reform 
program.  Many other donor agencies and private groups are involved in the financial sector and it is 
necessary to closely coordinate activities with other major players such as the IMF, US Treasury and UN 
to ensure all advice and assistance are coordinated.  Moreover, the Bank along with the development 
partners will monitor the overall status of the government’s Banking Reform Strategy to ensure that it is 
well on track. 
 
63. 
Institutional Set-up. 
Iraqi authorities’ readiness to execute the reform strategy and the project is 
evident in setting up the adequate legal, regulatory and institutional framework by forming entities, such 
as ROC, the Executive Steering Committee, and working committees (See Para. 16) to ensure effective 
implementation of the Banking Sector Reform Strategy.  Representatives from those committees have met 
the Bank team during appraisal and ensured their commitment.  This has been reinforced by the 
establishment of a PMU equipped with qualified expertise (Para. 70).  Detailed TORs for the specific 
activities to be undertaken under this project is provided in Annex 13 in order to help the implementing 
agency move forward with project implementation. 
 
64. 
Progress with the implementation of the reform program has been made by the Iraqi authorities 
during the appraisal mission, which is evident in: (i) the signing of MOU for Rafidain Bank and Rasheed 
Bank between CBI and the Ministry of Finance regarding the steps for and sequencing of operational and 
financial restructuring; (ii) the establishment of restructuring committees (Restructuring Oversight 
Committee, Executive Steering Committee, and Working Committees) to ensure the effective 
implementation of the program; and (iii) the completion of the independent financial and operational 
audits by Ernst &Young for Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank (for details refer to Para. 15-26). 
 
65. 
Procurement and FM Arrangements
.
The procurement and FM arrangements proposed for the 
project are acceptable to the Bank in providing reasonable fiduciary assurance that the proceeds of the 
ITF grant are used for the purposes for which they were granted with due regard to economy, efficiency 
and the sustainable achievement of the project’s development. More details are disclosed in Annex 4 and 
Annex 5.  Staff in the PMU will be trained in terms of procurement and selection of consultants and 
consultancy firms.  Moreover, selection of consultants will be subjective to prior review by the World 
Bank to ensure compliance with regulations and guidelines. 
 
66. 
Environmental and Social Aspects
.
The project is rated as a category “C”. This operation will 
not have significant effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources.  There are 
no expected adverse social or environmental effects, since the upgrading of the state-owned banks 
network will be implemented on existing sites and will use existing buildings—as confirmed by the Iraq 
Telecommunications and Post Company (ITPC). 
 
67. 
There are various lessons learned that are reflected in the project design.
 The World Bank has 
developed substantial experience with investment projects in Iraq and bank restructuring projects around 
the world. A number of important lessons can be learned from this experience, including:  
ƒ
Successful project implementation in Iraq requires that there be a PMU, with capable staff 
dedicated to implement the project.  Communications are difficult with Iraq and it is difficult to 
closely supervise operations in Iraq.  Thus, it is important to have a stable PMU dedicated to the 
project that understands and can effectively carry out the procurement and FM responsibilities as 
well as moving ahead the implementation of the various components of the financial sector 
reform strategy.  The project will include funding to build this capacity.  Moreover, the Bank 
supervision team will be supported by the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) that will help the 
team in project supervision, monitoring implementation, and ensure compliance with Bank 
policies.

ƒ
The security situation in Iraq is still fragile and volatile, so it will be necessary to provide 
much of the training and TA outside of the country.  The poor security also substantially raises 
costs.  
ƒ
Modern banking is a highly technical field and requires years to develop skills.  Thus, the TA 
must be provided on a long-term sustained basis in various phases.

68. 
The project will be implemented under OP. 8.0. Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, and 
hence, the operation was processed on a fast track basis.  The project closes on October 31, 2010.  
Implementation and monitoring arrangements are provided in details in Annex 6. 
A. Institutional 
Arrangements 
69. 
The Bank’s approach has been flexible in terms of design to permit a quick response to a 
changing security environment. The CBI is the grant recipient, and the entity responsible for project 
implementation.  CBI has previous experience in executing World Bank projects, including the Private 
Sector Development Project, which included a component to develop an intra communications network.
19
 
70. 
In terms of implementation arrangements, the operation would rely on: (i) capacity building of 
the PMU (residing in CBI) which has been staffed with qualified full-time Iraqi staff and consultants 
located in Baghdad; (ii) periodic World Bank supervision missions and team members located in the field 
to monitor progress made in project implementation; (iii) a network of videoconference facilities set up in 
the International Zone, the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, CBI, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Board of Supreme Audit, and the state-owned commercial banks to make the monthly 
meetings with counterparts feasible; and (iv) monthly donors meetings through videoconferencing and 
audio bringing together various development partners (IMF, EU, US Treasury, USAID) to ensure 
effective coordination. 
 
ƒ
Capacity building of PMU.
 
In agreement with Iraqi authorities, actual project 
implementation would be carried out by PMU.  The PMU would act as the Technical Secretariat 
of the Executive Steering Committee, which is chaired by the CBI Deputy Governor.  A PMU 
was selected as the best mechanism to implement such a complex operation that requires on the 
ground close supervision and high technical skills.  The current entities do not have adequate 
internal capacity to implement restructuring and take over the task; therefore, an autonomous unit 
with a full-time dedicated team is established for project management and implementation.  
PMUs are associated with a strong degree of autonomy, special management arrangements, 
independent staff and reporting, pay and employment outside the civil service, and parallel FM 
and procurement systems.  Detailed TORs for the four main positions (PMU Head, FM Officer, 
Procurement Officer, and Program Assistant) in the PMU were discussed and agreed on with the 
World Bank during the appraisal mission.
20
 
In addition, detailed TORs were provided to PMU to 
support its implementation of the project main components (See Annex 13).   
 
19
 The IIBN, which is expected to be operational by June 2009, would allow the CBI to set up an electronic payment and 
settlement system to interconnect with 26 private and state-owned banks, including Rafidain Bank, in Baghdad and other areas.  
The IIBN would enable availability of important applications such as government security registration system, real-time gross 
settlement system, automatic clearing house, and check-enabled system. It would also allow tracking of financial capital flow and 
hence provisioning of anti-money laundering applications.  
20
 Detailed TORs were attached to the Appraisal Mission Aide Memoire of November 22-25, 2008, which was transmitted to the 
Iraqi authorities. 
Page  22
-
17
-
This complex operation would require hiring a Head of PMU who has international expertise with 
banking restructuring.  In other ITF projects, where there was project management team (PMT), 
the standard government remuneration has often been cited as insufficient for the type and 
amount of work done, and has been a disincentive to do more for Bank projects.  The PMU will 
be an autonomous organization and will permit staff under independent employment conditions 
and salary scales.  The Bank will support considerable capacity building to allow it to implement 
the project according to World Bank procedures. 
 
The PMU will assist with final designs, tender documents, tendering, FM and supervision of 
works.  Consultants would assist in completing the project briefs and in carrying-out initial 
analysis and due diligence on all the proposed components.  The Bank will work closely with the 
Iraqi authorities in the selection process of the referred consultants to ensure compliance with 
Bank’s guidelines and procedures.  The Bank will also provide TORs for the PMU staff and will 
support CBI in the selection process.  This will involve: 
 
ƒ
Periodic World Bank supervision mission and day-to-day monitoring by Bank staff located 
in the field.
 This operation will entail that the Bank conduct several supervision missions, mainly 
to provide TA and advisory work to the Iraqi authorities in the banking sector restructuring 
program.  Based on the cross country experience, and international best practices, the World 
Bank banking sector experts will guide the Iraqi authorities in the areas of operational and 
financial restructuring, as well as on the capacity building of the central bank supervisory and 
regulatory authority, ensuring relevance to the Iraqi circumstances. 
 
ƒ
A
network of videoconferencing in the International Zone with high senior officials and 
donors.  
The Bank will coordinating closely with the various counterparts through a network of 
videoconference facilities set up in the International Zone, which would ensure regular 
communication with the central bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Board of Supreme Audi, and 
the two state-owned banks.  This videoconference facility would also make the monthly meetings 
with donors possible.
 
ƒ
Monthly donors meeting to ensure effective coordination.
 
Videoconference facilities have 
also allowed the monthly donors meeting possible.  These have provided a good platform for 
development partners to share progress with other colleagues in work programs, and challenges 
confronting them in implementation.  These meeting will continue during the lifetime of the 
project and beyond to ensure effective coordination, and efficient delivery of quality work to the 
Iraqis. 
 
71. 
Institutional setup.
 The institutional and regulatory setup is conducive to effective project 
implementation, and adequate implementation of the Iraq Banking Sector Reform Program.  In addition to 
the PMU mentioned above, there is: (i) the Restructuring Working Committees at individual banks; (ii) 
the Executive Steering Committee, and (iii) the ROC—all of which have clear mandates and 
responsibilities, ensuring implementation of the reform program.  Institutional setup and distribution of 
responsibilities is as follows: 
 
ƒ
Ten Restructuring Working Committees at Individual State-owned Commercial Banks
.
Restructuring Working Committees have been established for the operational restructuring of the two 
state-owned commercial banks.  More than ten working committees have been formed for each bank 
to support the operational and institutional restructuring, focusing on developing business plans; 
improving policies and procedures; drafting job descriptions; institutional reorganization; human 
resources; accounting and FM; IT; branch administration and operations.  In addition to the regular 
meeting with the Executive Steering Committee, which is coordinated by the PMU, to discuss 
progress and key challenges in implementation; the committees provide progress reports on 
achievements in the execution of the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy, namely components related to the 
operational, institutional and financial restructuring of these state-owned banks.
 
Page  23
-
18
-
ƒ
Executive Steering Committee
.
This committee is in charge of the implementation of the 
restructuring program for the banking sector, as outlined in the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy.  
The committee is chaired by the Deputy Governor of CBI, and 
comprising of representative from 
the Ministry of Finance; and Board of Supreme Audit; as well as two CBI experts.  The PMU will act 
as the Technical Secretariat of the Executive Steering Committee to support effective implementation 
(See Para. 68
–71).  The Executive Steering Committee comes under the ROC, which is established to 
guide and monitor the implementation of the restructuring plans of all state-owned banks in Iraq.
 
ƒ
ROC
.
The Restructuring Oversight Committee is the decision making authority with regard to 
the restructuring and reinforcing of reforms in the banking sector.  This is a high level decision 
making body that consists of the Governor of the CBI (Chairman), the Minister of Finance, and the 
Chairman of the Board of Supreme Audit.  The Restructuring Oversight Committee is responsible for 
the design of the strategy and for setting the vision for a sound and inclusive financial system in Iraq.  
Their main priority currently is restructuring the banking sector.  Key decisions made by the ROC are 
transmitted to the state-owned banks through the Executive Steering Committee. 
B. 
Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 
72. 
The PMU will be responsible for planning and coordinating all project activities, FM (payment 
authorization, disbursement, accounting, reporting and audit), procurement of works, goods and 
consulting services (and related contract management) from the private sector, and monitoring and 
evaluation.  Training was provided to PMU staff during the preparation and appraisal of the project. Upon 
the signing of the Grant, a substantive project launch would be held with PMU to provide further training 
in project-specific management, procurement and FM, and strengthening the fiduciary capacities. Also, a 
Project Implementation Manual (PIM), in English and Arabic, has been prepared to provide a 
comprehensive set of standards and procedures for PMU to ensure compliance with the requirements for 
project management, procurement and FM.  The PMU will have a competent financial officer on board to 
undertake the agreed-upon project FM responsibilities, including maintaining project accounting records, 
having the interim unaudited financial reports timely generated and submitted, and provide the needed 
support for the project external auditor to submit an annual audit report and audited financial statements. 
The project’s implementation, procurement and FM performance and compliance with the required 
guidelines, will be monitored by the FMA.

 by means of reimbursements, special 
commitments and direct payments. The supporting documentation will be retained by the PMU, will be 
made available to the Bank during its supervision missions, and will be reviewed during the annual audit 
of the financial statements. The project is budgeted for US $10 million, with components as listed below 
in Table 3.

C. 
Procurement Arrangements  
74. 
Procurement subject to Bank tendering requirements will consist principally of consultancy and 
training services, which shall be carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s 
“Guidelines: Selection 
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers”
 dated May 2004 and revised in October 
2006. A relatively small amount of essential office, IT and communication equipment, and software may 
also be procured under the project, which shall be subject to the World Bank’s 
“Guidelines: Procurement 
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits”
 dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006. Any additional 
provisions stipulated in the grant agreement will equally guide procurement under the project. Detailed 
arrangements, including thresholds for procurement methods and prior review by the Bank, are presented 
in Annex 5. 
75. 
Consultancy and Training services.
 
The project will finance mainly consultants’ services to the 
Central Bank of Iraq and other entities and publicly owned banks.  It is expected that many of the services 
will be contracted to individual local and international consultants for whom the selection will follow the 
procedures stipulated in Section V of Bank’s Consultant’s Guidelines. However, where appropriate, firms 
will also be expected to be contracted to provide services for a range of activities.  
76. 
Goods.
 Any goods essential to the success of the project may also be financed. It is expected that 
these would be procured through National Competitive Bidding or shopping for off-the-shelf products. 
77. 
Project management, monitoring and evaluation.
 
To support the PMU, the project will finance 
project 
operating costs which would include: (i) maintenance of office equipment; (ii) office supplies, 
utilities, and office administration costs, including translation, printing and advertising; (iii) 
communication costs; (iv) costs associated with the production of bidding documents; and (v) commercial 
bank charges.  
These include: (i) transportation and travel including per diem allowance for PMU staff in 
travel status to attend supervision missions; any other project implementation related expenses as agreed by 
CBI and the Bank.  
The procurement of these items would follow the Recipient’s administrative 
procedures, satisfactory to the Bank. The project would not finance the salaries of the Recipient’s civil 
servants.
 
78. 
Procurement process.
 The PMU, under the oversight of its project manager, would be responsible 
for the procurement of goods and services financed by the grant. A procurement officer will be 
specifically recruited to the PMU to manage the process, including the preparation and updating of the 
procurement plan, managing expressions of interest and requests for proposals (RfP), evaluation of 
proposals, and contract award and management. The PMU project manager will send to the Bank all 
requests for “no objection” on contracts, which are subject to prior review (as defined by the procurement 
thresholds in Annex 5), before contract signature. 
 
79. 
In procurement, the great majority of the activities will constitute Selection of Consultants.  
Consultants' services procured under this project will include selection of consultants to provide services 
related to the activities outlined above. Services will include TA to support procurement and FM 
functions in the PMU, training of staff on procurement, FM, contract management, and other technical 
fields as needed. The selection methods will mainly be Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) and 
Quality Based Selection (QBS) for values above US$200,000.  For values less than US$200,000 other 
methods can be envisaged such as selection based on Consultants Qualifications (CQ), selection based on 
Fixed Budget, Least Cost selection.   
 
80. 
For QCBS and QBS, and any other selection process of international consulting firm, Bank’s 
standard request for proposals (RFP) and standard evaluation forms will be used.   For the selection of 
local/regional consulting firms, RFP and evaluation forms included in the ITF MIM will be used.  The 
different selection methods will be indicated in the PP with clear indication for activities subject to prior 
Page  25
-
20
-
review by the Bank.  Shortlist of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provision 
of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.  The selection of individual consultants will be done in 
conformity with Section V of the 
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank 
Borrowers
.
Support will also be provided by FMA, specifically in monitoring implementation and 
compliance with Bank policies. 
 
81. 
The CBI, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides 
the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Recipient and Bank’s 
Project Team on November 24, 2008 and is available in Annex 5: Procurement Arrangements.  It will 
also be available in the Project’s database and in the Bank’s external website. The Procurement Plan will 
be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project 
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. 
 
82. 
The overall procurement risk for the project is High, due to the overall situation in Iraq and the 
low capacity of the implementing agency to implement procurement.   
D. 
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation 
83. 
Through the proposed operation the World Bank will continuously be engaged with the 
authorities as the process moves forward.  The Bank team will closely monitor the project.  Though the 
team is not located in Iraq and it is difficult to travel there, the team will make full use of video 
conference facilities to communicate frequently with the PMU.  In addition, the team will be able to 
obtain information from the US Treasury advisors who are resident in Baghdad.  The Bank team will 
continue to attend conferences and other event organized by the IMF to work with the Iraqi counterparts.  
In addition, the project will earmark funds to pay for travel and meetings to help the Bank team maintain 
contact with the PMU. 
 
84. 
This operation aims at establishing a competent PMU capable of managing project 
implementation, and monitoring and evaluating progress, in addition to acting as a technical secretariat 
for the authorities restructuring committees.  The PMU will be producing quarterly Project Reports and 
will be reporting to the Executive Steering Committee, which operates under the ROC.  The authorities’ 
restructuring committees, namely, the ROC, its Executive Steering Committee, and the Working 
Committees in state-owned banks are already overseeing, supervising, and monitoring the progress of the 
banking reform program.  They currently have the necessary capacity to conduct accurate supervision, 
monitoring and evaluation.  The operation will strengthen this capacity and assist them further in 
conducting more thorough monitoring and evaluation. 
 
85. 
To mitigate any implication arising from the weak public financial management system and to 
ensure that the project’s funds are spent as intended, efficiently and economically, the following FM 
arrangements were put in place in the project: competent financial officer as part of the PMU to take FM 
responsibilities; close support and frequent capacity building initiatives from the Bank; simplified clear 
procedures documented in a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) prepared based on the Master 
Implementation Manual; simplified parallel accounting and reporting systems; independent external 
auditor acceptable to the Bank to provide an independent opinion of the project financial statements; the 
FMA regular monitoring of projects’ FM performance and physical checks; and simple flow of funds 
arrangements mainly relying on direct payments.

Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants”, dated 
October 15, 2006 (“Anti-Corruption Guidelines”).

Monitorable indicators
 were identified and agreed on by the Bank and the Iraqi authorities to 
help in assessing progress made (Annex 2).  The performance of the two state-owned banks and the 
effective implementation of the 
operational and institutional restructuring
 program would be closely 
supervised through progress made in two main indicators: (i) number of staff trained for using new 
computers for making loans and taking deposits; and (ii) state-owned commercial banks under 
restructuring show some improvement in human resources, risk management, and IT infrastructure.  In 
terms of assessing financial intermediation and improvement in access to finance, indicators to be 
monitored include loan-to-GDP ratio. 
 
88. 
Indicators to be used to monitor progress made in 
financial restructuring of the two state-owned 
banks
 
and assess bank solvency and quality of assets include: (i) the quality of the portfolio through the 
reserve-to-NPLs on new loans ratio; and (ii) capital through measuring improvements in the capital 
adequacy ratio as provided by the government.  The recapitalization and removal of sovereign debt will 
be easily monitored by reviewing the bank’s financial statements and with the continuous policy dialogue 
the Bank will remain well informed.  The speed of improvement by the end of 2010 is in the hands of the 
authorities as many financial issues are related to state-owned entities (NPLs and foreign debt settlement).  
Achievements in 
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory functions of CBI 
would be monitored 
through reviewing its adherence to international codes and standards as specified in the Basle Core 
Principles.  For each indicator, a baseline was identified as of December 2006, along with expected ratios 
the project aims to achieve by December 2010 (Table 4).

This project is subject to substantial risks that could hinder the effective implementation of the 
Banking Reform Strategy, and in turn the execution of the Banking Sector Reform Project and the timely 
disbursement of the grant.  These risks, including those emanating from security issues in Iraq, the 
operational, governance, and political and security risks.  Also, the overall operating environment does 
not favor a strong implementation and procurement performance.

A. Operational 
Risks 
91. 
Iraq has had a long tradition of strong public and private institutions, a capable cadre of civil 
servants, and a sound basic legal infrastructure.  However, years of conflict, mismanagement, and 
sanctions have isolated the country from international experiences and practices, both technologically and 
in most areas of governance.  The limited capacity of the staff of state-owned banks may make it difficult 
to actually undertake the restructuring plan and to comply with the timeline set.  Moreover, it could be 
difficult to attract good caliber staff to these banks because of the politically unstable and insecure 
situation in Iraq, and the low public sector salary scale.  In addition, it would also be difficult to get rid of 
redundant staff (a huge number of administrative staff, and a limited number of qualified credit officers).  
Other challenges that are bank-specific include the fact that Rafidain Bank does not currently control the 
financial and administrative affairs of its Kurdistan Region branch.
2
1
92. 
This operational risk could hinder achieving one of the project’s main objectives, which is 
improving and strengthening the operational capacity of the two state-owned banks in order for them to 
provide adequate quality financial services for their customers and to the economy at large.  To reduce 
these risks, the World Bank, IMF, US Treasury and other interested parties maintain a constant policy 
dialogue with the members of the ROC to maintain reform momentum.  This includes regular meetings to 
assess progress. 
B. Governance 
Risks
—State-owned Bank Restructuring and Recapitalization without 
Privatization 
93. 
The challenges associated with restructuring state-owned financial institutions are well 
documented.  Therefore, the risk of suboptimal use of funds to shore up their balance sheet structure 
should not be underestimated.  Experience has shown that contributing fresh funds to a public financial 
institution before an adequate governance and incentive structure is put in place, and new, reliable and 
effective managerial, operational and financial policies and practices have taken hold may provide 
perverse incentives to public bank managers to revert to lax lending habits.  In this instance, the case may 
be made, regulatory orthodoxy notwithstanding, that new capital injections in state-owned banks would 
have to follow a step-wise approach, in line with the specific institutional and operational reforms being 
introduced and defined on attainment of quantitative and qualitative indicators and benchmarks. 
Moreover, the issue of fiscal affordability should be addressed, as the pace at which financial 
restructuring can be effectively implemented will have to be assessed against the fiscal resources 
potentially available to support the restructuring program.  
 
94. 
To mitigate such risks, it is crucial to ensure that lending transactions between state-owned banks 
and SOEs (especially defaulting ones) are conducted on a market basis to prevent the reoccurrence of past 
poor performing assets.  This 
approach is predicated on the Ministry of Finance’s commitment, as owner 
of the state-owned banks, to resolve foreign obligations of the bank, and to define the bank’s new 
business strategy and restructure its operations in line with such strategy, as a basis for its longer-term 
financial viability and competitiveness. Regarding private sector NPLs, setting a national policy for 
dealing with NPLs, and setting up an NPL data base and monitoring recovery efforts is vital.  This 
component of the project would cater for the inefficiencies that affected the financial system in Iraq due 
to the change in currency, robbery, fraud, and war damage. 
21
 This has also affected the audits of the Rafidain Bank as the audit firm did not receive the financial statements of its branches 
in Kurdistan Region and does not have access to their accounting records. 
Page  28
-
23
-
C. 
Political and Security Risks 
95. 
Implementation of the reform program is hindered greatly by the current poor security situation in 
Iraq.  This has prevented regular missions from visiting the state-owned banks, interacting with staff, and 
conducting on-site assessments.  Accordingly, most of the training and TA takes place outside of the 
country.  In addition, the poor security also substantially raises costs.  Donor coordination and joint field 
visits will reduce security and administrative costs to donors, in addition to reducing the burden on Iraqi 
officials. 
D. Implementation 
Risks 
96. 
The state-owned banks and their restructuring committees will not necessarily have the 
experience and the knowledge to implement the required reforms and policy measures.  A key challenge 
would be the ability of the project to attract qualified international consultants and consultancy firms with 
the required technical expertise to work in Iraq due to the security situation.  In addition, the decision 
making process might also take time, as this often requires effective coordination between the key policy 
makers
—the CBI (regulator), the Ministry of Finance (owner), the Board of Supreme Audit (auditors), 
and the state-owned banks themselves.  To address these risks, the project has been phased and the Bank 
team will monitor closely the progress made in project implementation and execution of the restructuring 
strategy. 
 
97. 
Regular communication needs to be maintained between the various committees in charge of 
implementing the reform program—the Restructuring Working Committees, the Executive Restructuring 
Committee, and the ROC.  Managing operational risk and ensuring effective implementation of the 
project would be enhanced through the daily dialogue of the World Bank Office and the team member 
located in Baghdad with Iraqi authorities and donors.  Moreover, an Interim Office in Amman supports 
Iraqi missions.  There will also be coordination through a network of videoconference facilities set up in 
the International Zone, the Ministry of Planning, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance—to make 
the monthly meetings with donors possible. Moreover, the Bank supervision missions would also support 
enhancing the policy dialogue among the various counterparts, as was conducted in the Beirut Roundtable 
where consensus was reached among all counterparts on a unified Banking Reform Strategy (2008–2012).  
The Bank will also be working closely with donors operating from the field. 
 
98. 
On fiduciary aspects, it is important to strike a balance between providing timely and quality 
service to the clients and at the same time ensuring that fiduciary requirements of the Bank and the donors 
are not compromised.  While one can develop minimum standards and procedures, the final structure of 
an assistance program is a ‘softer’ expert judgment, which takes into account many factors including the 
overall environment, the capacity to carry out a full assessment, and the ability of Bank staff to visit the 
country and supervise projects.  In addition, close attention will be paid to introducing more flexibility in 
implementation arrangements and business process.  Also, bulk of institution building activities would 
focus on strengthening core functions of key organizations, which has been based on an institutional 
assessment.

1. 
In agreement with Iraqi authorities, the proposed project would cover four main components, in supporting 
the Iraqi authorities in developing the Iraqi Government’s Banking Reform Strategy, and its Action Plan: (i) assist in 
the institutional and operational restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks; (ii) provide TA in the 
financial restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks; and (iii) capacity building and strengthening the 
regulatory and supervisory functions of CBI, and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation. 
2. 
The World Bank will provide technical support and guidance to the Iraqi authorities with regard to the 
government’s comprehensive, action specific banking reform strategy, and its Action Plan, based on the findings of 
the audits that aims at reestablishing the overall financial system by enhancing the soundness of the banking 
sector.
2
2
The Action Plan identifies the key pillars of the reform program set by the Iraqi Government, focusing on 
operational and institutional restructuring of the state-owned banks, including building an IT infrastructure, 
developing human resources, risk management, accounting and auditing procedures, policies and compliance with 
international standards.  The Action Plan also covers financial restructuring and addressing problems of NPLs.  A 
timeline with key milestones will also be identified.  To ensure ownership, the Action Plan is led by the Government 
of Iraq. 
 
i
Institutional and Operational Restructuring of the two State-owned Commercial Banks 
 
3. 
The operational and institutional restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks is crucial for 
ensuring a sound and efficient banking system, which would contribute effectively to economic development. 
Operational and institutional restructuring of the two state-owned commercial banks will start by defining the 
mandate of the state-owned commercial banks, including their focus on mobilization of savings and payments 
especially in light of country circumstances. The project will fund TA to help develop the internal capacity of the 
two state-owned commercial banks based on the findings of the audits and the optimum use of the on-going 
automation.  The next steps will be to help the two institutions adopt modern banking practices and systems, and 
training of their staff to operate the new IT hardware that is being installed.  This will entail a substantial training 
program for the staff, beginning with the training of a large number of Iraqi trainers (probably one per branch) who 
can then train the staff.  The training of trainers may take place inside Iraq or abroad, as is feasible.  As their 
capacity increases, they will move into other core banking operations including the extension of credit to the 
corporate and household sectors. 
 
4. 
Full implementation of the plan would call for the involvement of resident banking advisors along-side 
bank board and management.  Grant financing from ITF has been secured to this effect to assist the Rasheed Bank 
and Rafidain Bank in the restructuring process with focus on the critical components related to human resources, 
risk management and controls, and IT.  Adherence to the restructuring and business plan would remain under close 
supervision of CBI throughout the restructuring period. Bank recapitalization and financial support as needed would 
be provided by the owner in line with the satisfactory implementation of the operational restructuring plan.  
Moreover, the mandate of the restructured state-owned institution is strictly defined under its proposed business plan 
to preclude lax lending policies and focus on the bank core business.  A pre-condition, duly highlighted in the 
government program, for the implementation of financial reforms and for ensuring a level playing field for all banks, 
private as well as state-owned, is the existence of a supportive legal environment and a high degree of transparency.  
 
5. 
The operational and institutional restructuring—a key component in the operation—would be focusing on 
developing four critical areas: (i) organizational structure, processes, procedures, and policies; credit and risk 
management functions, including NPLs management;
23
 (ii) human resources functions, and alignment of 
22
 A benchmark of the IMF stand-by program with the Government of Iraq is the adoption of operational and financial 
restructuring program for Rasheed Bank and operational restructuring program Rafidain Bank based on the findings of the audits 
by end of 2008. 
23
 This includes: (i) advise on establishment of a well-functioning, adequately managed and completely staffed risk management 
organization in line with international and regional best practices; (ii) propose changes in the organizational structure, functions 
and responsibilities of the risk control department; (iii) assist in developing manuals for risk management; (iv) amend existing 
credit approval procedures on the basis of accepted best practices; and (v) recommend measuring and monitoring capabilities that

organization and general management functions;
2
4
(iii) information technology and management of information 
s
ystems (IT/MIS); and (iv) accounting, reporting and auditing policies and procedures
—without which reforms will 
have no direct benefit to the public and financial markets that the Government of Iraq is trying to build. 
 
ii.  
Financial Restructuring of the two State-owned Commercial Banks 
 
6. 
Financial restructuring would help state-owned banks to restore their ability to comply with minimum 
capital adequacy and other prudential requirements of the CBI, and to restore their full credibility with their business 
counterparts.  Audit recommendations 
inter-alia
 regarding build-up in provision levels at state-owned commercial 
banks need to be implemented
.
The financial restructuring process thus would entail schematically two steps.  The 
first would be to fill the gap (for those institutions that need to restore assets value to that of debt liabilities); the 
second, to contribute needed regulatory capital in compliance with prudential requirements.  Restoring the value of 
bank net assets would entail the resolution of the public enterprise NPLs; and possibly government funding to 
replace part of the non-recoverable loans of the private sector portfolio (taking account of provisioning needs, 
recoverability and market value of collateral, and potential for rescheduling selected problem loans).  Initially the 
banks activities may have to be narrowly limited and focus on deposit taking and payment transactions. The 
government must put the banks on a sound financial footing by addressing the problem of borrowing undertaken at 
the behest of the government that appears today as part of their liabilities, and shoring up their capital base as needed 
to meet regulatory requirements and prudential standards. However, this effort will depend on the government’s 
willingness to take over the debt and recapitalize the banks and correspondingly, fiscal constraints.  
 
7. 
Effective implementation of the formal agreement between owner (Ministry of Finance) and regulator 
(Central Bank of Iraq) whereby the owner has committed to: assume the large foreign debt liabilities of Rafidain; 
stand behind the state-owned banks, and honor all their liabilities until such time as their capital structure is in full 
regulatory compliance; and develop and carry out a credible time-bound medium-term plan (2008-2011) for both 
operational and financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks.  It is crucial to ensure that any 
financial support from the state (owner) proceed only in line with the satisfactory implementation of the operational 
restructuring program. 
 
8. 
The authorities need to tread carefully with the pace of financial restructuring, a potential magnet for two 
conflicting sets of issues. On the one hand, a quick pace of reform – rather than long, protracted periods during 
which restructured institutions are exempt from prudential standards, particularly in terms of level of provisioning 
and capital adequacy – promptly putting back an institution on a sound financial footing would, in itself, be more 
likely to achieve the bank restructuring objectives in: freeing management from the angst of administering ageing 
arrears to focus on future growth; and providing management the adequate financial base needed to develop the 
business in increasingly competitive markets. On the other hand, experience has shown that contributing fresh 
capital to a public financial institution before an adequate governance and incentive structure are put in place, and 
new, reliable and effective managerial, operational and financial policies and practices have taken hold may provide 
perverse incentives to public bank managers to revert to lax lending habits, rather than prompting the discipline 
needed for their eradication. In this instance, the case may be made, regulatory orthodoxy notwithstanding, that 
financial support with new capital injection in state-owned banks would have to follow a step-wise approach in line 
with specific institutional and operational reforms being introduced – defined by quantitative and qualitative 
indicators and benchmarks. 
 
iii. 
Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Functions of CBI 
 
9. 
The regulatory and supervisory framework is in the process of being strengthened but remains weak, with a 
pressing need to enhance further the regulatory environment and the supervisory functions and capabilities at CBI. 
Indeed, building an effective legal and regulatory framework is a necessary condition and a critical pillar for a sound 
enables the banks to produce comprehensive and accurate reports on a bank-
wide basis with the ability to identify “single 
obligors” and aggregate such exposures. 
24
 This includes: (i) develop a business driven HR strategy based on effective performance management indicators; (ii) 
recommend and implement selected policies and procedures for recruitment, re-deployment and promotion that will identify 
abilities in key competencies; (iii) design and implement a performance appraisal procedures that will identify individual 
strengths and weaknesses; (iv) draft a management development scheme; and (v) review existing job evaluation methods and 
identify appropriate systems.

and modern financial sector. This is especially true for the banking system which is the core component of Iraq 
f
inancial industry.  One of the main priorities is to re-establish a functional central bank able to carry its critical 
functions as regulator, supervisor, provider of liquidity and lender of last resort to the banking sector; another is a 
normally operating branch system to sustain a reliable payment process in the country.
 
10. 
The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking industry is a critical part of 
any financial reform program.  A credible, independent regulator is the necessary anchor of an effective and resilient 
financial system, especially in an environment where state ownership of financial institutions is expected to remain 
significant in the medium term. The CBI has been working on developing a banking regulatory and supervisory 
system, in line with best international standards and practices, with the support of the IMF, the US Treasury, and the 
World Bank, as noted.
25
 
The work conducted in Iraq over the past few years focused on the sector’s legal and 
regulatory aspects with a particular focus on rebuilding the banking system through the: (i) preparation and 
enactment of a new central bank law and commercial bank law; and (ii) creation of an effective operating structure 
for banking supervision.
 
11. 
Since the end of July 2008, as part of the SBA with the IMF, Iraq has completed a first set of prudential 
regulations
2
6
for commercial banks. In line with the new regulation underway, banks, especially public sector 
banks
2
7
would have to improve their credit risk policies and develop systems for extending credit, reviewing and 
classifying loans, and defining realistic provisioning needs. Regarding connected and directed lending, measures 
should be taken to ensure that banks have in place an independent decision making process that would preclude 
conflicts of interest and enforce arms length lending policies. Under the second set of the prudential regulations, 
efforts should be directed to implement a new framework for addressing operational risk and related issues, and 
market risks. 
 
12. 
Capacity building of the supervision department at CBI would include setting up the underpinnings of a 
strengthened regulatory and supervisory framework, focusing on on-site and off-site processes. CBI needs to 
implement the corrective actions required to close the gap between existing practices at CBI and international 
accepted best practices. Also, it could be focusing on developing and implementing appropriate supervisory tools 
and methodologies in addition to a comprehensive training program to enable staff members to cope with the new 
supervisory approach.  Given that the Board of Supreme Audit will continue to play a key role in auditing and 
fiduciary oversight of the two state-owned commercial banks, the project would also provide support to the Board of 
Supreme Audit on its auditing role over banks.
28
 
13. 
The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking industry is a critical part of 
any financial reform program.  A credible, independent regulator is the necessary anchor of an effective and resilient 
financial system, especially in an environment where state ownership of financial institutions is expected to remain 
significant in the medium term. CBI should embark on a comprehensive program of capacity building covering 
extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, as it should be seeking to move from compliance to risk-
based supervision.  An assessment of banking supervision at CBI needs to be carried out. A detailed plan for 
banking regulation and supervision is in Annex 10.  
 
14. 
To be effective the TA should be based on a thorough and comprehensive review of on-site and off-site 
processes at the CBI. An organizational restructuring of the banking supervision function should be carried out to set 
up or enhance the core functions in banking supervision such as On-Site Inspection, On-Going Surveillance, 
Licensing, Macro-prudential Analysis and Regulation and Enforcement. As a result, the banking supervision in Iraq 
would move from compliance to a more proactive and modern risk-based supervision. 
25
 Training workshops were conducted to promote the emergence of a core group of professional banking supervisors among the 
existing CBI staff since June 2004. 
26
 This included: (i) licensing requirement processes; (ii) minimum capital requirements; (iii) loan classification and provisioning; 
(iv) large exposures; (v) connected lending (transactions with related parties); (vi) investment in securities and real estates; (vii) 
lending policy; (viii) internal control; (ix) compliance function; and (x) risk management. 
27
 A banking restructuring action plan would support Rafidain and Rasheed banks in redesigning and implementing a new risk 
management process.  
28
 Responsibility include state-owned banks, their subsidiaries, and public enterprises in which Rafidain and Rasheed have stakes 
and shareholdings. 
Page  33

15. 
The CBI should start new recruitments to rejuvenate the work force. Notwithstanding their good education 
background, these newcomers would need training and incentives, while a new culture based on efficiency and 
achievements needs to be built. To this effect, the entire banking supervision training policy and process would be 
e
valuated to assess if the training programs are congruent with and responsive to the needs of the banking 
supervision. Training would also be useful for management to enhance leadership capacity.  
 
16. 
When security permits, on site inspection should focus on risks. Increased attention should be directed to 
credit organization and policy, concentration of credit, source of funding, risk management system, IT system and 
internal controls.  The CBI should also develop guidelines to conduct standardized on-site examinations. The CBI 
should provide the inspectors with new IT tools giving them access to databases from On Going Surveillance. On-
site examiners should use those tools to run their credit risk controls and the inspection teams will have to update the 
database with the data collected on the field. This type of feedback will help strengthen and improve the On-Going 
Surveillance reports credit institutions along a CAMELS based approach. Inspection teams need more trained 
personnel, particularly in the fields of IT and on a medium term basis market risks.  
 
17. 
A
new IT system should help On Going Surveillance focus on critical issues for an enhanced decision 
making process.  A new IT system would need to be implemented on a timely basis to increase efficiency and 
productivity. More specifically, the CBI would analyze the IT supervisory needs (hardware, software, protocol for 
data collection and data administration, etc.) including the possibility to store all official banking financial 
statements. In addition, both on site, and off site supervision must work together to create a continuous, seamless 
supervisory cycle. The off site supervision must also develop new tools to focus on critical issues for an enhanced 
decision making process (peer comparison
 analysis, Camels’ model analysis, Early Warning System, etc.). To this 
purpose, the CBI has to redesign the framework of the supervisory information flow and build a new MIS. With a 
new IT system being implemented at the CBI, a risk-oriented report regarding the strategy and the overall 
performance of a credit institution could be worked out. This CAMELS typed approach report would constitute a 
comprehensive review of the banks.  
 
18. 
A
macro-prudential surveillance unit should be set up in a financial stability perspective.  The key 
deliverable for this unit would be an annual Banking Sector Review. This review would deliver a comprehensive 
analysis of the banking sector in dealing with macroeconomic and financial markets developments, banking sector 
structure, earnings and profitability, capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity and other risks, and regulatory and 
supervisory developments.  
 
19. 
Since the end of July 2008, as part of the new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, Iraq has 
completed a first set of prudential regulations29 for commercial banks. In line with the new regulation underway, 
banks, especially public sector banks30, would have to improve their credit risk policies and develop systems for 
extending credit, reviewing and classifying loans, and defining realistic provisioning needs. Regarding connected 
and directed lending, measures should be taken to ensure that banks have in place an independent decision making 
process that would preclude conflicts of interest and enforce arms length lending policies. Under the second set of 
the prudential regulations, efforts should be directed to implement a new framework for addressing operational risk 
and related issues, and market risks.

The project will finance the operating costs that would include: (i) maintenance of office equipment; (ii) 
office supplies, utilities, and office administration costs, including translation, printing and advertising; (iii) 
communication costs; (iv) costs associated with the production of bidding documents; and (v) commercial bank 
charges.  Operating costs will also include: (i) transportation and travel including per diem allowance for PMU staff 
29
 This included: (i) licensing requirement processes; (ii) minimum capital requirements; (iii) loan classification and provisioning; 
(iv) large exposures; (v) connected lending (transactions with related parties); (vi) investment in securities and real estates; (vii)

his operation aims at establishing a competent PMU capable of managing, monitoring and evaluating 
project implementation, acting as a technical secretariat for the authorities restructuring committees.  The PMU will 
also be responsible for preparing Project Reports on the basis of the indicators agreed upon. Each Project Report 
shall cover the period of one calendar quarter, and shall be furnished to the World Bank not later than one month 
after the end of the period covered by such report.

 The procurement of these items would follow the Recipient’s administrative procedures, satisfactory to the Bank. The project 
would not finance the salaries of the Recipient’s civil servants.

Country Financial Management Context 
 
1. 
A
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) has not yet been undertaken for Iraq; however, 
the Bank had prepared an internal report
3
2
that had been designed to inform the Bank’s project teams on the 
structural weaknesses of the Iraqi public financial management system and to assist them in anticipating problems 
that could occur during the implementation of the Bank-financed projects. Overall, the public financial management 
difficulties in Iraq are similar to those in many other countries and had been very well known by the Bank. These 
include weak budgeting and fragmented accounting, accompanied by incomplete and inaccurate financial reporting. 
Government employees’ financial management capacities are weak and internal controls are poor. Internal and 
external audit functions are in a nascent state, and cannot realistically be relied upon to redress the situation. The 
uniqueness of the Iraq situation is that these are all present at once, complicated by the country’s security conditions 
and the lack of a functioning financial sector that is capable of providing routine financial services. Each deficiency 
potentially can adversely affect the implementation of the Bank financed projects. The Government of Iraq has 
started to take measures, including through a planned Bank’s financed operation, to reform the public financial 
management system; however this reform is a long term activity that will be finalized over number of years. 
 
2. 
Many other assessments and reports
33
 had been undertaken by the Bank and the other donors over the last 
four years that confirmed that assessment and led to defining Iraq as one of the “high risk-weak control environment 
countries” that requires special attention, from the Bank, at various levels.   
 
Portfolio Context 
 
3. 
Overall, the ITF finances 18 grants (US$481.6 million), of which 15 grants are active (US$420.3).  Of 
these 15 active grants, 13 are implemented by Iraqi agencies 2 are implemented by the Bank on behalf of the 
Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.  The ITF was originally scheduled to terminate in December 
31, 2007 and was extended to December 31, 2010.  In February 2009, the IRFFI Donor Committee confirmed its 
intention to extend the termination date to December 31, 2013 to allow the completion of projects in the pipeline, 
including the Banking Reform Project.  Formalization of such extension is still pending.  All projects are 
implemented within the framework of the Iraqi public sector regulations complemented by the Bank policies and 
procedures as agreed on in the related legal agreements. 
 
4. 
A
Master Implementation Manual (MIM) was developed by a consulting firm hired by the Bank to 
document the general implementation, procurement, and financial management policies and procedures applicable 
to managing projects in Iraq. As the Bank staff had limitation in being able to functionally be in Iraq to regularly 
supervise the projects, a FMA was hired to help the Bank in supervising the projects’ (ITF-financed and recently the 
IDA-financed) implementation, including the monitoring of the procurement and FM performance and compliance 
with the required procedures.. The FMA is guided by agreed Terms of Reference (as per the ITF donor agreements 
for ITF-financed projects) and has received training from the Bank on procurement and FM guidelines and 
procedures.  To perform its responsibilities, the FMA visits project sites and project management teams (PMTs) and 
reports (monthly and quarterly) issues to the Bank’s task teams as they arise, and recommend actions to be taken by 
the PMTs and the task teams. 
 
Portfolio Financial Management Arrangements 
 
5. 
To mitigate any implication of the weak public financial management system and to insure that the projects 
funds are spent as intended, efficiently and economically, the following FM arrangements were generally put in 
32
 “Financial Management Accountability Assessment”  
33
 IMF-World Bank “Enhancing Sound PFM-Short- to Medium-Term Reforms report, “Public Expenditure and Institutional 
Assessment”, and the “Sub-national Public Financial Management”, and the Corruption Perception Index

place in projects: competent financial officer as part of the project management (PMT) to take FM responsibilities; 
c
lose support and frequent capacity building initiatives; simplified clear procedures documented in  a project 
implementation manual (PIM) prepared based on the MIM; simplified parallel accounting and reporting systems; 
independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank to provide an independent opinion of the project financial 
statements; the FMA regular monitoring of projects’ FM performance and physical checks; and simple flow of funds 
arrangements mainly relying on direct payments  
 
Portfolio FM Performance and Disbursement Status 
 
6. 
The main issues that are being monitored very closely by the Bank to improve the portfolio FM 
performance are: the weak capacity, instability, and turnover of the projects’ staff; the weak audit profession and 
reliance on one auditor; and the general weak control environment affecting the degree of assurance provided. On 
the disbursement part, the projects have been experiencing delays in getting payments to Iraq due to the inefficient 
banking system. 
 
Project Implementation Arrangements 
 
7. 
Organization
.
The project is financed through an ITF grant of US$10,000,000. The Central Bank of Iraq is 
the Grant recipient and the CBI will have primary responsibility for overseeing project implementation and ensuring 
compliance with the Bank’s guidelines and procedures on fiduciary aspects, monitoring and evaluation, as well as 
the reporting to the World Bank and other relevant agencies.  To facilitate this day-to-day Project implementation, a 
dedicated PMU has been established.  It would operate under the Executive Steering Committee chaired by the 
Deputy Governor of CBI.  
 
8. 
Staffing.  
A
financial officer (FO) will be hired as a member of the PMU to overtake the project FM 
responsibilities, as agreed during project preparation. These include maintaining financial records, reviewing, 
processing and ensuring duly authorization of consultants and vendors’ payments, submitting duly signed 
withdrawal applications to the Bank to claim disbursements, and preparing periodic reports and financial statements. 
Adequate training will be provided to the financial officer on World Bank FM and Disbursement guidelines and 
procedures during the supervision missions. 
 
9. 
Risks and Mitigation Measures
.
The assessment of the financial management (FM) arrangements proposed 
by CBI was undertaken during meetings held in Amman and Beirut and based on a number of documents provided 
by the CBI. The purpose of the assessment is to confirm that the FM arrangements for this project are acceptable in 
providing reasonable fiduciary assurance that the proceeds of the Grant are used for the purposes for which it was 
granted with due regard to economy, efficiency and the sustainable achievement of the project’s development 
objectives. In addition, it helps in defining the areas that need additional arrangements or enforcement of controls.  
The documentation of the assessment is available in the project files. Based on the result of the assessment, the FM 
risk, as a component of the fiduciary risk, and which is a combination of country, entity and project specific factors 
is 
high
.
The following are the identified FM risks and the relevant mitigating measures. With these measures in 
place, the project would have acceptable project FM arrangements; however, in Iraq the residual risk will remain 
high.

High Risk; S = Substantial Risk; M = Modest Risk; N = Low or Negligible Risk 
 
10. 
Internal Controls.
 
The project’s financial controls will be documented in the project implementation 
manual (PIM) that will customize the Iraq Master Implementation Manual to the needs of the project. This PIM will 
clearly disclose each PMU member responsibilities, the payment verification, authorization and execution processes, 
authority limits, physical receipt and control of equipment, as well as relationship lines with the different 
stakeholders, such as the ROC, Secretariat, CBI, SOE-banks, MOF, and the World Bank. The expenditure cycle will 
follow controls specified in the manual and will include the following steps: (i) technical approval by the spending 
department of each entity; (ii) administrative approval by the PMU Manager; (iii) issuance of payments will be 
made upon receipt of supportive documentation and written requests signed by authorized officials; (iv) the accuracy 
and consistency of the payment requests will be verified by the financial officer. The project will finance mainly 
consultants’ services. These can be classified either as delivering a set of output, or as supporting the delivery of an 
output. Payments will be made against the delivery of outputs for the first category, as detailed in their contracts. 
While for the second category of consultants, payment will be made against the submission of a time sheet and a 
summary of activities performed during the period invoiced.

Independent Verification
.
The Iraq FMA will monitor the performance of the project implementation, 
procurement and FM periodically and share reports with the Bank and CBI. The external auditor will report as well, 
in his management letter, on any deficiency in the FM system and controls that is considered pertinent, and will 
provide recommendations for its improvement.  
 
12. 
Budgeting
:
The PMU will maintain a project budget and detailed disbursement plan per quarter.  This plan 
will be developed based on the initial procurement plan, implementation schedule and estimated payments cycles, 
and revised upon need.  It will be used as a monitoring tool to analyze budget variances and manage cash. 
 
13. 
Accounting
:
Based on the number of the contracts and the frequency of payments, spreadsheet 
applications will be used to record the project’s financial transactions and generate reports. Procedures for protecting 
the data and preventing losses will be maintained.  
 
14. 
Financial Reporting
:
The PMU will be responsible for preparing the following:
 
ƒ
Quarterly 
Interim un-audited financial reports (IFRs) as part of the quarterly project progress reports, 
and submitting them to the Bank within one month from the quarter then ended. The format of the 
reports will be agreed upon during the negotiations. These reports consist of a statement of sources and 
uses of funds by component; statement of uses of funds by category of expenditure, both comparing 
actual and planned expenditures; and a list of cumulative contracts’ commitments. 
ƒ
Annually
 Project Financial Statements (PFS) and submitting an audited PFS with the independent 
auditor opinion to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each FY. The PFS include: (i) 
statement of sources and uses of funds by component; (ii) statement of uses of funds by category of 
expenditures, both comparing actual and planned expenditures; and (iii) list of contracts’ 
commitments. 
 
15. 
Auditing Arrangements
:
An external independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, will be engaged to carry 
out the annual financial statements audit in accordance with international standards of auditing, issue the required 
independent opinion, and prepare the management letter. The auditor will be granted access to the project 
documents at the PMU and CBI. The audit TORs include performing a Statement of Expenditure (SOE) review for 
the audit period covered.  The audit report and management letter will be submitted by the PMU to the Bank not 
later than six months after the end of each FY. An escrow account will be used to pay the auditor after the project’s 
closing date.

Funds Flow. 
The project disbursement methods are disclosed under the Disbursement arrangements and in 
the Disbursement Letter. In addition to some equipment and small operating cost, the project will finance mainly 
consultants’ services.  A variety of international and local individual consultants and firms will be hired as part of 
t
he project activities. Based on the experience so far with flow of funds performance of current Iraq projects, and to 
achieve the needed efficiency, the Bank will pay directly beneficiaries with bank accounts outside Iraq. For the 
beneficiaries with bank accounts inside Iraq, CBI will provide a sufficient project-life advance to be deposited in a 
project account, from which the PMU will make payments and periodically claim reimbursement from the Bank. 
 
17. 
Supervision.  
Where security conditions make travel to Iraq impossible for Bank staff, supervision 
missions will be undertaken from an alternative location. Close monitoring of FM arrangements will be conducted 
throughout the project life.  Supervision will be conducted about 2-3 times a year, in addition to regular video and 
audio conferences. The project FM team will continue to get periodical training on FM arrangements. 
 
18. 
The FMA will monitor the project implementation, procurement and FM performance and compliance with 
the required procedures. It will visit the PMU periodically and will offer advice and on-the job training in addition to 
reporting periodically issues  to the Bank task team as they arise, and recommend actions to be taken by the PMU 
and the task team.. To perform its responsibility, the FMA will be granted regular access to the project documents at 
the PMU and different relevant entities.

administered projects. For the past four years, the Bank has chosen to have the projects implemented though the 
I
raqi Ministries (rather than stand alone units outside government structures), ensuring that appropriate and effective 
financial controls are in place over the use of funds provided by the Bank, while at the same time working together 
to strengthen the Ministries’ own financial control processes and procedures. While this strategy has worked for 
some ministries, it had caused considerable project delays for others, due to the limited capacity and the existing 
inefficient systems. To timely and effectively implement and manage this project, a dedicated PMU will be 
established, composed of competent full-time consultants.  Taking into consideration the high risk environment 
assessed for the project, including the assessed high FM risk, the disbursement arrangements will compensate by 
continuing to use appropriate disbursement methods. The disbursement methods used will be:  
 
ƒ
Direct Payments
 These payments will be made to accounts at commercial banks capable of receiving 
funds transferred from the international banking system. 
 
ƒ
Reimbursement
 to the CBI for eligible expenditures paid from the CBI resources. The CBI will submit 
reimbursement applications once per quarter. 
 
ƒ
Special Commitments
 to facilitate payments under Letters of Credits for prior review contracts for the 
importation of goods as agreed in the procurement plan.  
 
20. 
Continued training on Bank disbursement arrangements will be provided to the existing CBI PMU and 
financial counterpart at CBI, if needed. Supporting documents, e.g., copies of invoices and receipts, or SOE are 
required to be provided with all requests to disburse funds. These documents, including the SOE thresholds are 
detailed in the Disbursement Letter. The original copies of the supporting documentation will be maintained by the 
CBI and made available for review by Bank representatives upon request.

Country Financing Parameters (CFP) were approved for Iraq in September 2005. The CFP allow for the

A.  General  
 
1. 
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006; and 
“Guidelines: 
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers”
 dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006, 
and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of various items under different 
expenditure category is described below.   For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement 
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, 
and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan (PP). The 
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs 
and improvements in institutional capacity.  A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in UNDB on-
line and in its printed version as well as in dgMarket online in January 15, 2009. Specific Procurement Notices 
(SPN) will be published for all ICB procurement and Consulting contracts as per Guidelines as the corresponding 
bidding documents and RFPs become ready and available.    
 
2. 
Procurement of Works: no procurement of works is envisaged under this project. 
 
3. 
Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: IT and communication equipment 
and office furniture. The procurement will be done using Bank’s SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed with the 
Bank and included in the ITF MIM.  Shopping procedures and will also be carried out following MIM forms for the 
Request for Quotations.  The Project Implementation Manual will extract and group the procurement procedures and 
methods applicable for the project.   
 
4. 
Procurement of non-consulting services: 
no procurement of non consulting services is envisaged under this 
project. 
 
5. 
Selection of Consultants:  
Consultants' services procured under this project will include selection of 
consultants to provide services related to: (i) Institutional and Operational Restructuring of the two State-owned 
Commercial Banks, (ii) Financial Restructuring of the Two State-owned Commercial Banks, and (iii) Strengthening 
the Regulatory and Supervisory Functions of CBI.   Services will include TA to support procurement and FM 
functions in the PMU, training of staff on procurement, FM, contract management, and other technical fields as 
needed.   
 
6. 
For consulting firms, the selection methods will mainly be QCBS and QBS for values above US$200,000.  
For values less than US$200,000 other methods can be envisaged such as selection based on CQ, selection based on 
Fixed Budget, Least Cost selection.  For individual consultants, the selection will follow the procedures explained in 
Section V of Bank’s Guidelines for the selection and employment of consultants.   
 
7. 
For QCBS and QBS, and any other selection process of international consulting firm, Bank’s standard RFP 
and standard evaluation forms will be used.   For the selection of local/regional consulting firms, RFP and 
evaluation forms included in the ITF MIM will be used.  The different selection methods will be indicated in the PP 
with clear indication for activities subject to prior review by the Bank.   Shortlist of consultants for services 
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in 
accordance with the provision of paragraph 
2.7 
of the Consultant Guidelines.  The selection of individual 
consultants will be done in conformity with Section V of the 
“Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants 
by World Bank Borrowers”
.
8. 
The establishment of PMU:
 
The project will finance the operating costs which would include: (i) 
maintenance of office equipment; (ii) office supplies, utilities, and office administration costs, including translation, 
printing and advertising; (iii) communication costs; (iv) costs associated with the production of bidding documents; 
and (v) commercial bank charges.  These include: (i) transportation and travel including per diem allowance for

PMU staff in travel status to attend supervision missions; any other project implementation related expenses as 
a
greed by CBI and the Bank.  The procurement of t
hese items would follow the Recipient’s administrative 
procedures, satisfactory to the Bank. The project would not finance the salaries of the Recipient’s civil servants. 
 
B.   
Assessment of the agency’s capacity to implement procurement 
 
9. An 
Operation 
Proc
urement Report (OPR)” was prepared June 2005. The main findings and 
recommendations of the OPR are: 
ƒ
Uncertainty of public procurement laws and regulations after suspension of all procurement regulations 
enacted under the former regime and replaced by the CPA Order No. 87 on Public Contracts in May 2004. 
This new law provides for the creation of an Office of Government Public Contract  
ƒ
Lack of implementing regulations and administrative instructions for the new law. 
ƒ
The procuring entities continue to use pre-existing regulations that lack a clear legal basis. 
ƒ
This situation of legal uncertainty and lack of adequate regulations creates opportunities for corruption 
and substandard practices in public procurement.   
 
Table A5.1: Summary Risk Assessment  
Description of risk 
Rating of 
risk 
Mitigation measures 
Rating of 
residual risk 
CBI lacks experience in Bank 
procurement procedures  
H
Recruitment of seasoned procurement officer 
with the appropriate experience to assist the 
PMU implementing the activities financed by the 
Project.  TORs for these positions have been 
communicated to the CBI to start selecting key 
staff.  FMA to provide on job trainings when 
needed  
M
Lack of applicable laws and regulations  
H 
Follow the ITF MIM which would provide 
aligned and explicit methodology consistent 
Bank’s procurement and selection procedures. 
M
Lack of law enforcement which would 
increase risk of looting and the 
damaging of facilities 
H
H
Inability of World Bank procurement 
staff to supervise project in the field 
because of security situation  
H
Prior review of all activities.  Review outcomes 
by technical experts within Bank task team.  The  
use of the FMA to help the Bank monitor the 
implementation progress of the project as well as 
the recipient's compliance with Bank 
procurement, financial management and also 
provides on-the-job training, TA, and support to 
the project management staff.     
H
Corruption in procurement 
H 
Lowering threshold for prior review. Frequent 
review of files by the FMA as well physical 
verification by the FMA. Close monitoring of 
corruption indicators in procurement and 
implementation. 
 
H
Average H 
 
H 
H: High; M: Moderate and L: Low. 
ƒ
Current procurement procedures and practices reflect the regulations issued by the former regime have 
number of features that are not in line with generally accepted sound public procurement practice. These 
features include: (i) inadequate requirements for registration of suppliers and contractors that are obsolete and 
inefficient and may lead to lack of fairness; (ii) insufficiently transparent and fair debarment procedures; (iii) 
Page  46

41
-
continued use of obsolete methods and procedures for procurement of goods and works and selection of 
c
onsultants, (iv) undue  restrictions on access to bidding documents, (v) insufficiently transparent bid 
submission, opening and evaluation procedures, and contract award procedures, (vi) use of Kurdish language 
in the northern regions and Arabic language in the other parts of country; and (vii) lack of effective bid 
protest mechanisms and publicity on contract awards.    
ƒ
Risks related to poor contract administration practices and security concerns are a major issue.   
 
10. 
An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the 
project has been carried out by Procurement Specialist on November 17, 2008.  The assessment reviewed the 
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project’s staff responsible for 
procurement Officer and the Ministry’s relevant central unit for administration and finance. 
 
11. 
The CBI does not have any experience in implementing projects using Bank procurement and selection 
procedures or any different norms of acceptable international practice.   Therefore, procurement will predictably 
bear a high level of risk.   The risk lies essentially in the lack of applicable laws and regulations, modern standard 
documentation, insufficient training of concerned staff in procurement using World Bank guidelines and 
international sound procurement practice, the lack of law enforcement which would increase the risk of looting and 
the damaging of facilities, and the inability of World Bank procurement staff to supervise project in the field. This 
risk would be mitigated by the recruitment of seasoned procurement officer with the appropriate experience to assist 
the PMU implementing the activities financed by the Project.  To address the ambiguity of regulations, the 
implementation arrangements as agreed between the Bank and the Government of Iraq will follow the ITF MIM 
which would provide aligned and explicit methodology consistent Bank’s procurement and selection procedures. 
 
12. 
The overall project risk for procurement is 
High.
 
C. Procurement 
Plan 
13. 
The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides the 
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Recipient and Bank’s Project Team on 
November 24, 2008. It will also be available in the Project’s database and in the Bank’s external website. The 
Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual 
project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.  A General Procurement Notice will be 
advertised on-line UNDB and dgMarket on March 30.  However, Specific Procurement Notices will be advertised 
according to the timing established in the procurement plan and for each activity soliciting expressions of interest of 
international consultants.   
D.  Frequency of Procurement Supervision 
14. 
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment of the 
Implementing Agency has recommended 2 supervision missions annually. 
E.  Independent Verification 
15. 
The Iraq FMA will monitor the performance of the project implementation, procurement, and FM 
periodically and share reports with the Bank and CBI

RANGEMENTS
 
1. 
The project will be prepared under the OP. 8.0. Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, and hence 
processing the operation will be on the fast track.  The proposed schedule for the project preparation and 
delivery was shared and discussed with Iraqi Delegation.  The project is scheduled to be delivered in the first 
quarter of 2009, with a closing date of October 31, 2010 (20 months).  The project was approved by the Iraq 
S
trategic Review Board Meeting (ISRB)
35
 
on December 4, 2008. 
 
N
egotiation of the project is planned in early 
2
009. 
 
2. 
The Bank’s approach has been flexible in terms of design to permit a quick response to a changing 
security environment. In terms of implementation arrangements, the operation would rely on: (i) a PMU with 
qualified full-time Iraqi staff and consultants located in Baghdad; (ii) capacity building and training of state-
owned banks’ staff actively working on banking reform; (iii) regular World Bank supervision missions to 
monitor progress made in project implementation; (iv) team members located in the field in Baghdad for day-to-
day updates; (v) a network of videoconference facilities set up in the International Zone, the Ministry of 
Planning and Development Cooperation, CBI, the Ministry of Finance, the Board of Supreme Audit, and the 
state-owned commercial banks to make the monthly meetings with counterparts feasible; and (vi) periodic 
meetings through videoconferencing and audio with the various development partners (IMF, EU, US Treasury, 
USAID) to ensure effective coordination. 
 
3. 
This operation will entail that the World Bank conduct several supervision missions, mainly to provide 
TA and advisory work to the Iraqi authorities in implementing the Banking Sector Reform Strategy—Action 
Plan (2008-2012).  Based on the cross country experience, and international best practices, the World Bank 
banking sector experts will guide the Iraqi authorities in the areas of operational and financial restructuring, as 
well as on the capacity building of the central bank supervisory and regulatory authority, ensuring relevance to 
the Iraqi circumstances.  In addition to the regular supervision missions, a team member in the field in the 
Baghdad World Bank Office will provide day-to-day support to PMU to ensure smooth implementation. 
 
4. 
The World Bank has supported the Iraqi authorities in developing a comprehensive Banking Sector 
Reform Strategy--Action Plan.  The Bank would help develop the banks capabilities in the areas identified in the 
operational audits.  
 
5. 
To ensure effective implementation, Restructuring Working Committees have been established for the 
operational restructuring of the two state-owned banks.  More than 10 working committees have been formed 
for each bank to support the operational restructuring, focusing on developing business plans; improving 
policies and procedures; drafting job descriptions; institutional reorganization; human resources; accounting and 
FM; IT; branch administration and operations. The ROC will ensure that the bank committees execute the 
restructuring in accordance with the MOU signed between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. 
 
6. 
In agreement with Iraqi authorities, actual project implementation would be carried out by a PMU.  In 
the case of this project, a PMU is the best solution as there is no internal capacity to implement restructuring and 
take over the task; therefore, an autonomous unit with a full-time dedicated team is established for project 
management and implementation.  PMUs are associated with a strong degree of autonomy, special management 
arrangements, independent staff and reporting, pay and employment outside the civil service, and parallel FM 
and procurement systems. The PMU will require considerable capacity building to allow it to implement the 
project according to World Bank procedures. 
 
7. 
PMU is responsible for planning and coordinating all project activities, FM (accounting and 
disbursements), procurement of works, goods and consulting services (and related contract management) from 
the private sector, and monitoring and evaluation.  Training would be provided to PMU staff during the 
preparation and appraisal of the project. Upon the signing of the Grant, a substantive project launch would be 
held with PMU to provide further training in project-specific management, procurement and FM. Also, a MIM, 
in English and Arabic, will be prepared to provide a comprehensive set of standards and procedures for PMU to 
ensure compliance with the requirements for project management, procurement and FM. 
35
 A committee consisting of the minister of planning and development cooperation, the minister of finance, a representative of

The PMU will assist with final designs, tender documents, tendering, FM and supervision of works. 
Consultants would assist in completing the project briefs and in carrying-out initial analysis and due diligence 
on all the proposed components.  Capacity building will be provided to strengthen the fiduciary capacities of 
PMU, support compliance with the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards, and conduct reviews and 
inspections as agreed with the Bank.

E
stablishing a PMU would ensure smooth and effective implementation of the project. PMU’s policies 
and procedures will be harmonized with standard government practices. It will serve the Executive Steering 
Committee in charge of banking restructuring, which is headed by the Deputy CBI Governor, comprising of: 
Ministry of Finance representative; Board of Supreme Audit representative; and two CBI experts.  The 
Executive Steering Committee comes under the ROC, which is established to guide and monitor the 
implementation of the restructuring plans of all state-owned banks in Iraq. The ROC consists of the Governor of 
the CBI (Chairman), the Minister of Finance, and the Chairman of the Board of Supreme Audit.  The ROC is the 
decision making authority with regard to restructuring/reinforcing state-owned Banks. 
 
10. 
The Bank will work closely with the Iraqi authorities in the selection process of the referred to 
consultants to ensure compliance with Bank’s guidelines and procedures.  The Bank will also provide TORs for 
the PMU staff and will support CBI in the selection process. 
 
11. 
Supervision, monitoring and evaluation
.
The Bank team will closely monitor the project.  Regular 
Supervision Missions will be visiting Baghdad to meet with the main counterparts and the PMU to supervise 
and monitor progress made in project implementation and execution of strategy.  In addition, a team member is 
located in the field in the World Bank Baghdad Office to provide day-to-day support. The team will also make 
full use of video conference facilities to communicate frequently with the PMU, CBI and the two state-owned 
commercial banks. Moreover, the team will be supported by FMA that will help the team in project supervision, 
monitoring implementation, and ensure compliance with Bank policies.  The team will also coordinate closely 
with development partners, such as the US Treasury advisors who are resident in Baghdad.  The Bank team will 
continue to attend conferences and other event organized by the IMF to work with the Iraqi counterparts.  In 
addition, the project will earmark funds to pay for travel and meetings to help the Bank team maintain contact 
with the PMU.

I.  
General Scope of the Program 
1. 
This note defines the overall framework of the program of operational and institutional strengthening 
w
hich will enable the Bank to function successfully as a modern, competitive commercial bank.  Due account is 
b
eing taken of the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank's accounting, financial, administrative and control 
procedures and their upgrading.  The Iraq authority has commissioned a comprehensive independent audit
—to 
assess the Bank’s performance, outline the main areas of institutional weaknesses and present recommendations to 
address the weaknesses detected.  The next step would be a set of detailed measures aim at implementing an 
operational and institutional action plan under the scrutiny of the Restructuring Committee headed by the Vice 
Governor of CBI. The US Treasury is assisting the two state-owned banks in drafting this detailed action plan. But 
more technical help (consultants) should be needed to assist the two state owned banks in the institutional and 
operational restructuring focusing on management functions, human resources, and IT and MIS, as well as, 
strengthening accounting, reporting and auditing policies and procedures in compliance with international best 
practices. 
2. 
More specifically, the objective of the program is to support the CBI,  the state-owned bank's board of 
directors and management team efforts in developing a detailed, credible business strategy and plan, and to 
recommend, inter-alia, steps that should be taken to streamline operations, optimize the branch and distribution 
network, and strengthen organizational, operational and management structures. The plan proposed under the 
program should include a candid and detailed assessment of needed professional skills in critical business areas 
(front, middle and back office), as well as staffing and staff training. The strategy of the public banks would 
need to be strictly defined under its proposed business plan to preclude lax lending policies and ensure a level 
playing field for all banks with private as well as public ownership. The proposed scope of work under the 
program should cover – as detailed in the following sections – the specific areas of: (i) strategic and business 
planning; (ii) organization structure; (iii) budgeting and performance measurement; (iv) management information 
system and management accounts; (v) operations; (vi) automation and technology support; (vii) internal audit; (viii) 
credit analysis and portfolio management; (ix) asset and liability management; (x) market development and 
marketing; and (xi) human resource management and training. 
 
A. Strategic and Business Planning 
3. 
The public banks should consider creating a strategic and business plan. Given the need to build and 
develop the Bank in a changing economic and market environment, the completion of a comprehensive strategic 
plan is a priority as it is the necessary foundation for building a program of institutional change. The banks’ mandate 
from the owner would provide the basis for formulating the strategy. The strategic plan must clearly define the 
Bank’s mission and objectives, target markets, products and services, financial goals, resource requirements and 
action plans for executing its strategy and achieving its goals and objectives.
36
 
4. 
One of the program’s outcomes will be to support the board of directors and management design and 
implement a formalized strategic planning process for the Bank as a whole and the individual business and staff 
units.  That process must establish how the task of planning is organized, conducted and monitored on an on-going 
basis.  The role of various departments (including, if necessary a specialist strategic planning unit within the banks) 
in the planning exercise must be established and the steps in the process with appropriate deadlines for completion of 
tasks must be outlined and agreed with the banks’ management. 
 
5. 
The preparation of the strategic plan will be based inter-alia on the analysis of the external environment, the 
competition, current and potential markets, and the banks’ current market position. To this end, there would be a 
need to conduct relevant internal analyses to identify the banks’ strengths and weaknesses in relation to the market, 
the competition and future business opportunities. These internal analyses should include profitability analyses of 
existing businesses such as corporate and consumer lending. It is expected under the program, that the banks’ board 
of directors and senior management would then address and define the banks’ mission and strategy, and prepare 
business and action plans to execute that strategy. This corporate strategy will then be extended into a series of plans, 
each covering a major business of the banks – defining specific goals, target markets, products and services, resource 
requirements, and actions programs as needed to provide practical guidance to each business unit and tools for 
36

49 - 
monitoring and evaluating performance. 
 
6. 
In the frame of the program, it wou
ld be expected to train banks’ staff in strategic and business planning in 
the course of the work, so that the banks have the ability to continue the planning process in the future.  Any 
i
dentified gaps in critical skills within the banks should be reported to management. 
B. Organization Structure  
7. 
Once the strategy and business plans are developed, the banks must review their organizational setting so 
that it may execute its strategy successfully.
37
 In this regard, the banks’ Board and management will work together to 
develop and document the organization structure of the head-office and their specific relationships to the branch 
offices. This would entail a definition of each organizational unit (including permanent committees), its mission, 
main responsibilities, key functions to carry out each responsibility, and required staffing levels. 
 
8. 
To build the new organization structure, the Bank’s board and management will define the specific 
requirements and will be expected to prepare a plan for implementing the new organization indicating 
implementation actions and responsibilities, schedule and support requirements. 
C. Budgeting and Performance Measurement 
9. 
The budgeting functions in the public banks are at a very early stage.
3
8
The banks do not have a Budgeting 
Committee, which is a key internal body to oversee this core function. In the current situation, the budgeting 
functions are part of the finance department and report to the management. It would be best practices to establish 
such an independent committee within the banks. The budgeting process within the banks suffers from major 
weaknesses (no information system to prepare, compile and monitor the function’s processes, There will be a need 
to strengthen the banks’ existing capital planning and budgeting systems. The objective will be to ensure that the 
capital planning (in terms of economic rather than regulatory) and budgeting systems are sufficiently comprehensive 
to meet fully the needs of the banks, including as a basis for providing incentives for, and controlling, management 
and staff performance throughout the institution. The banks will have to revise their system which should be 
formally linked to the strategic planning process to ensure that the annual financial plan for the banks truly 
represents and reflects the strategic objectives.   
 
10. 
Beyond the necessity to close those gaps
39
,
the budgeting process will have to ensure that individual 
branches and units within the banks prepare budgets for all income and expenditure items over which they have 
responsibility. The process should ensure in particular that: (i) annual budgets for the banks and its departments and 
branches are linked to the strategic planning process and objectives; (ii) budget targets are agreed to between head-
office and individual department and branch managers to ensure challenging but realistic targets and secure good 
motivation and performance from managers; (iii) detailed and relevant variance analyses take place on a regular 
basis and all significant variances from the banks’ targets and objectives are highlighted and explained as necessary 
and corrective actions are initiated; and (iv) the management accounts for the banks and its constituent parts are 
designed to report actual performance against budgets and strategic targets.. 
 
11. 
In addition to variance analysis, the banks will have to ensure that they have a comprehensive system of 
measuring performance against targets through the use of a well defined set of management accounts and reports and 
through a system of individual performance management (they will also have to state the milestones at which they 
will measure their performances). The banks will train a core staff in the utilization of the new systems and 
processes that may be developed. 
D. Management Information System and Management Accounts 
12. 
There is a need to define the information required to manage the banks, measure their performances and 
control their risks.  On completion of the banks’ strategic plan, a detailed plan of the management information 
required to execute the strategy will need to be completed, including management reports at each managerial level. 
The new management information requirements must be integrated into the automation strategy of the banks. 
 
37

 Page 31 of the Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank reports. 
39
 Page 32 to 37 of the reports. 
Page  55
-
50 - 
13. 
In assessing the adequacy of the existing management information system and recommending adjustments 
as needed, the Bank will ensure that the management information plan would cover all the key areas of Bank 
operations and management, including: (i) credit and portfolio status; (ii) treasury including liquidity, interest rate 
and FX risks, funding, asset and liability management, and deposits management; (iii) operations (front, middle and 
b
ack-office), head-office and branches; and (iv) strategy, budgeting and performance measurement including the 
d
esign and implementation of an appropriate management accounting system.  A key item will be improving the 
interconnection of bank branches with the banks’ headquarters. 
 
14. 
This will cover the accounting system needed to provide management with reliable and timeliness financial 
information for each of the operational units and product lines, as well as for the banks as a whole. The accounting 
system should include information on a profit and cost-center basis with appropriate transfer pricing for inter-unit 
transactions.  The management accounts should also be designed to give revenue, cost and profitability information 
by product, customer, branch and business line.  
 
15. 
The banks’ management will ensure that the new management information requirements, including the 
management accounts, are integrated into the automation strategy and technology support framework of the banks. 
Rafidain Bank and Rasheed bank will also need to train a core staff in the utilization of the new systems and 
processes that may be developed. 
E. Operations 
16. 
In light of the strategic plan – which would have addressed the systems requirements for new business 
units—the adequacy of the banks’ operating systems and procedures will be assessed, together with the need for 
their strengthening to ensure their effectiveness. There will be a need to ensure that any strengthened or revamped 
systems would take into account the banks’ planned businesses, methods of operations, service and control 
requirements and the automation strategy.   
 
17. 
New operations systems and procedures would need to cover both head-office and branch operations and 
other product/service production and distribution networks/systems, and the interconnection of the branches with 
headquarters. Indeed, with intensified competition for products and services, and pressure on margins, it would be 
necessary to strengthen operations at the branch level.  These efforts will involve substantial training of the banks’ 
branch staff in handling basic deposit-taking transactions, using computers. They will also involve development of 
loan officers’ capacity.  Unless training can be held in Iraq, these efforts will involve training of a cadre of selected 
bank staff outside Iraq to act as trainers of the staff (“training of the trainers”) in Iraq. The numbers trained at this 
stage are projected to be at least one from each branch of the two banks. Following the training of these cadres, 
training programs will be set up in Iraq, if possible linked by video conference to the original trainers of the trainers 
so they can provide answers to more complicated questions. This is likely to entail travel to a centralized training 
center in Iraq. Finally, the project will support better use of information technology and inter-connection of branches 
of the banks. At the moment, efforts have been made to improve functions of Rafidain Bank’s head office and 
foreign offices but efforts are needed to train staff in the rest of Rafidain and in Rasheed. 
 
F. Automation and Technology Support 
18. 
The current information systems within the public banks run on an antiquated environment.
40
 There is no 
information security function in the banks or formal information security policies and procedures in accordance with 
international standards. In the same vein, the banks have not developed any disaster recovery site or disaster 
recovery plans.  
 
19. 
Moreover, there is no IT governance or IT strategic planning in the public banks and information security 
as well as IT operations is currently managed on an ad-hoc basis. To ensure that IT systems (i) support efficiently the 
key current banking operations, (ii) meet the current and future business needs and user’s expectations and (iii) 
effectively manage, maintain and control data availability, integrity and confidentiality, banks’ management should 
consider defining an IT strategy development framework at short notice and have a formal information system 
strategic planning document in place. This IT strategic plan will have to support fulfillment of the overall operational 
banks’ strategies and enable business growth. 
 
20. 
Once the management information needs have been defined, the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
hardware architecture and system engineering in the Bank will be reviewed and evaluated (taking into account any 
40
 Page 43 to 85 of the Operational diagnostic review reports. 
Page  56
-
51 - 
contingency plans relating to business continuity risks).  In so doing, due account will be taken of the need for 
congruence between the banks’ strategy, business goals, and existing technology. The work would require more 
specifically: (i) an assessment of the information and processing requirements, and a definition of a set of additional 
application needs for the banks; (ii) an analysis of the information and processing effectiveness of existing systems; 
(
iii) an estimate of the cost of additional hardware, software (especially for the basic banking functions related to 
c
ustomer accounting, portfolio analysis and management, FX operations, etc…); (iv) an outline of the management, 
organization, manpower and training requirements needed to implement the program; and (v) an implementation 
schedule together with critical milestones. Due attention will be needed in integrating any new initiative: internally, 
with regard to a compatible system of hardware, software and communications from branch to head-office; and 
externally, with any new payments system and inter-Bank arrangements. 
G. Internal Audit 
21. 
The Ernst & Young audit concluded that the internal control system of both banks does not meet the 
international standards. Several major flaws are flagged. Chief among these, (i) the banks do not have an active audit 
committee;
41
 (ii) the internal audit functions are not independent and (iii) the internal audit functions’ methodology 
is based on compliance testing rather than a risk-based approach. Banks’ internal audit schemes will have therefore 
to be strengthened. 
 
22. 
In line with the strategic plans and the implications of these plans – in terms of organization structure, 
financial instruments, operations, systems and procedures, and automation – there will be a need to propose 
adjustments as required to the internal audit system and process with appropriate corresponding manuals. 
 
23. 
There will be specifically a need to: (i) advise on improvements to audit methodologies, and adequacy of 
audit coverage in terms of scope (e.g. credit, operations, assets and liabilities management), depth and reporting 
standards; (ii) suggest required follow-up and monitoring; (iii) define the audit organization; and (iv) identify 
complementary audit skill requirements. The Bank auditing staff will need to be trained in the utilization of new 
methodologies (risk-based versus compliance-based).  This sub-component – which requires specialized skills - 
would call for interaction with/involvement of the external auditors.  
H. Credit Analysis and Portfolio Management 
24. 
Long standing problems of portfolio quality have taken a heavy toll on the banks’ operations and financial 
position. The Ernst & Young asset quality reports show that loan loss reserves are largely underestimated (239 
billion IQD for Rafidain Bank and 138 billion IQD for Rasheed Bank).
42
 In terms of capital adequacy, regulatory 
capital shortfalls –based on Basel II requirements and worldwide practices in terms of classification and provisioning 
of bad assets- may vary between 359 billion IQD for Rasheed Bank and 15.3 trillion IQD for Rafidain Bank).
43
 With 
regard to the credit administration process, several weaknesses were identified within the banks: (i) the Credit 
Committees do not have a charter spelling out 
inter alia
 their mission, objectives, authorization matrix;
44
 (ii) the 
banks credit functions do not forecast the cash flows generated from loan collections and do not perform a 
reassessment of the collateral value; the banks do not collect customers’ financial statements.
45
 
25. 
A formalized and thorough management and operational structure delineating credit policies, procedures 
and systems must be developed as a matter of priority. Special emphasis should be given to portfolio control and 
problem loan management. The revised structure should bring up-to-date market skills and techniques to the process 
of credit management, especially in the context of the asset quality problems faced by the banks. The banks’ 
management will need to enhance credit management policies, procedures and systems, regarding both aspects of 
credit analysis and portfolio management, and problem loan management. 
26. 
(a) Credit analysis and portfolio management
.
There would be a need for improvement in policies and 
procedures regarding: (i) target market guidelines; (ii) portfolio limits; (iii) risk tolerance criteria; (iv) credit approval

—the 2008 GDP would reach IQD 83.6 trillions, ie. 
US$ 71.2 billion). The capital shortfall of US$ 13.1 billion (Rafidain Bank) is based on a number of adjustments which are 
likely to be required. Chief among these is a difference arising from the reevaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies. IQD 8.33 trillion (US$ 7.1 billion) are currently recognized as an asset due from the Ministry of Finance 
and are included within “other assets” of the Rafidain Bank. This amount relates to 2006 and may be recognized as an 
expense in the income statement.

authorities; (v) credit analysis, structuring and pricing; (vi) loan documentation, contracts and security; (vii) loan 
disbursement procedures; (viii) loan follow-up and monitoring; (ix) credit recovery and legal enforcement; (x) credit 
administration and controls, including disbursement, amendment to terms and other sanction authorities, credit audit 
and policy exceptions; (xi) organization of credit within the context of the strategic plan; and (xii) automation of 
r
eports needed to monitor asset quality.  
 
27. 
(b) Problem loan management
.
There would be a need to optimize policies, procedures and organizational 
arrangements [including if warranted, special workout unit for certain types of problem assets) related to: (i) problem 
loan definition and identification; (ii) problem loan reporting; (iii) problem loan follow-up; (iv) delinquent loan 
recovery; (v) viability analysis and loan restructuring options; (vi) repossession and legal recovery actions; and (vii) 
provisions and interest accruals. 
 
28. 
There will be a need to train a core staff in the utilization of each of the new processes that may be 
developed. 
I. Asset and Liability Management  
29. 
For both public banks, the Ernst & Young asset quality reports show that the banks do not have a formal 
ALM function.
4
6
There are no centralized treasury departments to perform treasury function related processes and 
there is no documented policy and procedures manual to govern ALM processes.  
 
30. 
The banks management will have to design and activate an ALM function as part of the revised 
organizational structure of each bank. The skills, policies and systems required to manage these risks must be 
strengthened, so that comprehensive risk management policies be developed or improved to govern interest rate, 
liquidity, FX and other non-credit related risks. In this regard, the management will be responsible for the 
implementation of the processes, the organization, and the information systems required managing the range of 
ALM risks c
urrently facing the banks and any additional risks inherent in the execution of the banks’ strategic plan. 
The management will have the responsibility of developing and documenting processes to cover, at a minimum, 
such ALM areas as liquidity, interest rate and duration gap and pricing, and FX. Further, the management will put in 
place an organization structure that will execute the proposed, upgraded ALM processes - defining specific 
responsibilities, authorities, and functions of each unit, as well as required staffing skills. In addition, it will be 
necessary to define the information required to support the ALM processes (e.g., external and internal information, 
formats and time-frames). . 
 
31. 
There will probably be important needs to train key staff (treasury staff and management, and other senior 
managers who will participate in, or contribute to, ALM decisions) in utilizing the ALM system and implement the 
practical day-to-day functions. 
J. Market Development and Marketing 
32. 
There will be a need to assess the adequacy of the banks’ formal marketing function and strategy and the 
degree to which these are aligned to its activities and to the requirements of the market. This would include an 
assessment of staff marketing and sales experience. In this regard recommendations, as needed, regarding 
adjustments to the marketing function and strategy would need to be developed as part of the banks’ strategic and 
business plan. In this context, a market analysis might be critical to the success of the strategic plan and vital for the 
proper execution of the business plan. 
 
33. 
In each bank, in conjunction and congruent with the strategic plan, the management would need to 
complete a detailed marketing plan and each of its business units covering, as the case may be, new product 
introductions, service innovations and improvements. These plans should include: (i) a definition of market 
objectives; (ii) an analysis of market targets, products, and growth rates and shares; (iii) an analysis of customer 
needs, and marketing image of the Bank and its services; (iv) a marketing “strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats” analysis for the Bank; and (v) a plan of organization of marketing and sales at head-office and branch levels.  
 
34. 
In particular, the banks’ management will have to make sure that business units are defined to meet the 
requirements of customers and the achievement of the banks’ strategic goals. For instance, the assessment could be 
made as to whether there is a need for relationship or account managers to handle major clients, the different 
organizational arrangements required for retail, small corporate, private sector clients or the possible requirement to 
46
 Page 113 of the Operational diagnostic review reports. 
Page  58
-
53 - 
set up specialist units for individual product areas. 
 
35. 
The banks’ management will have to ensure that skills needed for market analysis and planning, and help 
institute a formalized market planning and development process within the framework of the banks’ strategic 
p
lanning process are in place. The management of the banks will have to define: (i) a training program regarding the 
b
anks’ marketing strategy and methods of sales and customer service; and (ii) an advertising and public relations 
program. 
K. Human Resource Management and Training  
36. 
For both public banks, the operational diagnostic review report show that the current situation raised major 
issues in terms of human resources practices. There is no clear manpower plan (recruitments are conducted 
spontaneously based on number of authorized vacancies) and no consistent selection criteria
47
,
no performance 
management system.
48
 There will be a need to assess the banks’ human resources and their adequacy for commercial 
banks operating in a competitive environment.  Following the assessment of the adequacy in terms of staff skills, 
recommendations may be needed to address identified deficiencies in light of the banks business strategy and 
business focus and plans. To this end, a comprehensive training needs analysis will be required and a formalized 
training (and as needed recruitment) plan
49
 should be established.. 
 
37. 
A human resource management system will have to be put in place in both banks to meet both current and 
future human resource requirements. There will be a need to address: (i) first the banks’ immediate needs for 
building critical skills and efficiently deploying the work force to staff its new organization, and support the 
execution of its strategy and business plan;  then (ii) the banks’ medium-term needs for developing and managing its 
human resources.  
 
38. 
Rafidain Bank and Rasheed Bank will need  to implement a first set of high-priority human resource 
management systems consisting specifically of: (i) a training needs analysis; (ii) a training and development master 
plan, including a prioritization and planning of how all training needs will be met, and the launching of highest 
priority programs; (iii) a performance appraisal system, including the assessment of the performance and potential of 
employees, and the identification of major development needs; and (iv) a staffing program which entails the 
effective matching of people to jobs in the revised organization structure. 
 
39. 
The banks’ next order of priority is to build, implement and train staff in applying the human resource 
management systems, related to: (i) manpower planning, covering supply and demand analysis, projection of 
manpower gaps and excesses (over 2 to 4 years) by major skill and rank level, and plans to fill the gaps and deal 
with the excesses; (ii) recruitment, with pro-active methods for finding and selecting key talents; (iii) rewards 
management, along a compensation scheme that will attract, retain and motivate managers, technical personnel and 
staff; (iv) management development, with methods for developing general and technical managers; (v) performance 
management, through an effective  system for managing individual performance (e.g., goals, standards, monitoring, 
evaluation); and (vi) work culture development, under a program for building a competitive, commercial work 
culture throughout the organization. 
 
40. 
These steps will include documentation of each system in the form of an operating manual, as well as pilot 
implementation and training of implementation staff. In particular, as needed, the management of the banks will be 
responsible of conducting on-the-job training for the staff so that the banks have the full ability to carry on the work 
in the future. The management may set  as a priority – although this would have to be based on the training needs 
analysis –  the focus on two selected and critical groups of managers: (i) branch managers, where training should 
cover 
inter-alia
,
business planning, profit and cost management, human resource management, management control 
and marketing; and (ii) head-office department directors, where training should cover 
inter-alia
,
business and 
staffing planning, profit and cost management, human resource management, change management, performance 
monitoring and measurement.

II. Output 
 
41. 
The management will work with the board of directors of the banks to develop, along the specifications of 
the framework outlined in this note, the following program: (i) a strategic plan; (ii) business plans for individual 
b
usiness units; (iii) an organization structure; (iv) a budgeting and performance measurement framework; (v) 
i
dentification and framework design of required management information systems; (vi) automation and technology 
support program; (vii) accounting and internal audit processes; (viii) implementation of a credit risk management 
process with emphasis on management of problem loans; (ix) implementation of asset and liability management 
systems for significant non-credit related risks; (x) development and initial implementation of plan for marketing of 
the Bank's products and services; and (xi) human resource management and training program including the 
implementation of priority human resource management systems. 
 
42. 
It is recommended within this framework that performance indicators be established to assist in monitoring 
achievements.

1. 
The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking sector is a critical 
part of the banking reform program. 
A
credible, independent regulator is the necessary anchor of an effective 
and resilient banking system, especially in an environment where state ownership of banking institutions is 
significant (state ownership accounts for nearly 90 percent of the banking sector assets at the end of 2006).  
2. 
Since 2004 the CBI has embarked on a comprehensive program of capacity building covering 
extended areas of the regulatory and supervisory functions, as it is seeking to move from compliance to 
risk-based supervision.
 The IMF has been providing assistance to the CBI since end of 2004 and has done 
considerable work in helping Iraq develop a banking regulatory and supervisory system, in line with best 
international standards and practices. In coordination with the Federal Reserve System, training workshops were 
conducted to promote the emergence of a core group of professional banking supervisors among the existing 
CBI staff. Between June 2004 and January 2006, the IMF carried out an initial cycle of classic training 
workshops aim at acquiring basic knowledge in banking supervision. Then the capacity building exercise shifted 
replicating the work of a resident advisor in reviewing the actual work and outputs (on site inspection report, off 
site analysis note etc..) produced by Iraqi supervisors, and in providing them with feedback and guidance for 
off-site and on-site supervision. This is closely coordinated with, and complements the work of, the Baghdad-
based U.S. banking supervision experts and the METAC experts based in Beirut. Now, the IMF TA is evolving 
to be demand-driven and consisting of specific issues identified by the CBI. The next workshop is scheduled in 
January 2009 and will focus on topics to be selected by the CBI supervisors. 
3. 
To be effective the TA should be based on a thorough and comprehensive review of on-site and 
off-site processes at the CBI.
 An organizational restructuring of the banking supervision function should be 
carried out to set up or enhance the core functions in banking supervision such as On-Site Inspection, On-Going 
Surveillance, Licensing, Macro-prudential Analysis and Regulation and Enforcement. As a result, the banking 
supervision in Iraq would move from compliance to a more proactive and modern risk-based supervision.  
4. 
The CBI should start new recruitments to rejuvenate the work force
.
Notwithstanding their good 
education background, these newcomers would need training and incentives, while a new culture based on 
efficiency and achievements needs to be built. To this effect, the entire banking supervision training policy and 
process would be evaluated to assess if the training programs are congruent with and responsive to the needs of 
the banking supervision. Training would also be useful for management to enhance leadership capacity.  
5. 
When security permits, on site inspection should focus on risks.
 Increased attention should be 
directed to credit organization and policy, concentration of credit, source of funding, risk management system, 
IT system and internal controls.  On site process should be upgraded to meet the risk-based supervision 
requirements: (i) before the mission in sharing information with off-site supervision and the macro-surveillance 
unit; during the mission in staffing the team with relevant people (especially regarding IT); and (ii) after the 
mission in setting up a collegial body for reviewing the inspection findings, and dealing in full transparency 
with inspection follow-up and enforcement. The CBI should also develop guidelines to conduct standardized on-
site examinations. Generally, on-site surveillance also gained greater efficiency by sending to the concerned 
parties an “introductory letter” that aims at gathering the relevant data and information before the on-site 
examinations start. 
6. 
The CBI should provide the inspectors with new IT tools giving them access to databases  from 
On Going Surveillance
.
On-site examiners should use those tools to run their credit risk controls and the 
inspection teams will have to update the database with the data collected on the field. This type of feedback will 
help strengthen and improve the On-Going Surveillance reports credit institutions along a CAMELS based 
approach. 
7. 
Inspection teams need more trained personnel, particularly in the fields of IT and on a medium 
term basis market risks.
 This new working environment would make significant progress on credit risk 
analysis which is the main risk of the banking system in Iraq. However old habits die hard and it will take some 
more time to move from a compliance approach to a fully risk-oriented banking on-site monitoring where 
qualitative assessments on bank’s functioning complements the compliant approach. Continuing training 
sessions should be planned for the next months in various aspects of the on-site examinations and especially to 
better assess bank strategies and risk management systems. 
Page  61

8. 
A
new IT system should help On Going Surveillance focus on critical issues for an enhanced 
decision making process
.
A
new IT system would need to be implemented on a timely basis to increase 
efficiency and productivity. More specifically, the CBI would analyze the IT supervisory needs (hardware, 
software, protocol for data collection and data administration, etc.) including the possibility to store all official 
b
anking financial statements. In addition, both on site, and off site supervision must work together to create a 
c
ontinuous, seamless supervisory cycle. The off site supervision must also develop new tools to focus on critical 
issues for an enhanced decision making process (peer comparison analysis, Camels’ model analysis, Early 
Warning System etc…). To this purpose, the CBI has to redesign the framework of the supervisory information 
flow and build a new MIS. With a new IT system being implemented at the CBI, a risk-oriented report regarding 
the strategy and the overall performance of a credit institution could be worked out. This CAMELS typed 
approach report would constitute a comprehensive review of the banks. Produced on an annual basis, those 
reports will cover all risks inherent in the bank’s activities, including both quantitative (key figures regarding the 
bank’s financial position, based inter-alias on the yearly balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, along with 
peer comparisons, market shares) and qualitative information (facts about main shareholders, description of the 
main business activities, corporate governance, analysis of the earnings sustainability, solvency, liquidity and 
market risks). In a nutshell, this annual report is designed to convey the banks’ overall risk profile.  
9. 
A
macro-prudential surveillance unit should be set up in a financial stability perspective.
 
.
The key 
deliverable for this unit would be an annual Banking Sector Review. This review would deliver a 
comprehensive analysis of the banking sector in dealing with macroeconomic and financial markets 
developments, banking sector structure, earnings and profitability, capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity and 
other risks, and regulatory and supervisory developments. Its purpose is to address the key developments, risks 
and vulnerabilities, as well as the assessment on the resilience of the Iraqi banking sector. This initiative, in line 
with the Basel best practices aims at enhancing the market discipline, thanks to a greater disclosure of the 
banking sector issues. 
10. 
All those elements should, in the long run, help the CBI develop an Early Warning System 
enabling an adequate, proactive framework to deal with problem banks.
 In particular, it should help the 
CBI in determining the levels of capital ratios as well as best suited remedial measures to address particular 
events or risk profile of credit institutions. In addition to the work already accomplished, a broad range of 
analysis may be needed to assess the banks capital and their ability to sustain non expected losses, assuming that 
their provisions would be sufficient to cover the expected losses. The CBE should also formalize transparent 
guidelines on crisis management to deal with problem banks. It would include taking control of a bank in 
distress, imposing a moratorium, restructuring the bank’s liabilities, transferring all or part of its business to 
another bank or to a special purpose entity, and providing lender of last resort facilities. 
11. 
Since the end of July 2008, as part of the new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, Iraq 
has completed a first set of prudential regulations
50
 for commercial banks
.
In line with the new regulation 
underway, banks, especially public sector banks
51
,
would have to improve their credit risk policies and develop 
systems for extending credit, reviewing and classifying loans, and defining realistic provisioning needs. 
Regarding connected and directed lending, measures should be taken to ensure that banks have in place an 
independent decision making process that would preclude conflicts of interest and enforce arms length lending 
policies.  
The main issues are reviewed thereafter. 
12. 
(a) Lending policy
.
The CBI has to vet fully the implementation by the banks of their lending policies. 
These lending policies have to be comprehensive, prudent, and consistent with a sound management of bank’s 
activity. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess the skills and knowledge of the staff in charge of credit approval, 
and check if banks have adequate systems to control and monitor the implementation of such policies.  
13. 
(b) Loan evaluation and loan loss provisioning
.
The new classification will improve the accurate 
knowledge of the bank loan portfolio.  For the implementation of the new classification of loans, training 
sessions are needed for credit officers and banking supervision examiners. This implies also that banks have in 
place a credit organization and credit management systems in compliance with the new regulation (in particular, 
50
 This included: (i) licensing requirement processes; (ii) minimum capital requirements; (iii) loan classification and 
provisioning; (iv) large exposures; (v) connected lending (transactions with related parties); (vi) investment in securities and 
real estates; (vii) lending policy; (viii) internal control; (ix) compliance function; and (x) risk management. 
51
 A banking restructuring action plan would support Rafidain and Rasheed banks in redesigning and implementing a new 
risk management process.  
Page  62
-
57 - 
a
good credit administration). As a result, banks have to improve their systems for granting credit, for reviewing 
and classifying loans, and for determining realistic provisions. The main outstanding issues relate to how to get 
from companies accurate, and up-to-date financial statements with all needed information.  
14. 
(c) Large exposure
.
The aggregation of all the large exposures must not exceed eight times the capital 
base. It is necessary to provide banks with an extensive definition of close related parties. Banks must in a 
comprehensive way identify and monitor credit exposures to closely related groups on the basis of such specific 
guidelines. 
15. 
(d) Connected and directed lending
.
Procedures must be set up to prevent persons benefiting from a 
loan from participating in the preparation of the loan assessment or in the related decision-making process. 
These loans have to be approved by the Board of directors. Banks have to develop risk management rules, 
procedures and information systems for lending to connected parties in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The 
new regulation should also address directed lending with regards to state-owned banks in particular. In addition, 
specific guidelines should be issued to improve corporate governance in public banks and ensure that loans are 
made on the basis of borrower creditworthiness and debt service capacity 
16. (
e) Internal control and audit
.
As CBI cannot rely only on the external auditors since the quality of 
their report is uneven, internal control regulation system appears to be critical. CBI would need to enhance the 
quality of internal control and audit in banks and ensure bank’s top and middle management commitment to the 
process. CBI would need to support through specific guidelines what is an accurate and comprehensive internal 
control system based on risk management. Consolidated supervision would also need to be enhanced and 
brought in line with international standards. The setting up of a legal and regulation unit with particular skills in 
the legal and accounting fields would be instrumental. 
17. 
Under the second set of the prudential regulations, efforts should be directed to implement a new 
framework for addressing operational risk and related issues, and market risks.   Currently, there are no 
guidelines from CBI to ensure that banks have in place procedures and systems for identifying, managing and 
monitoring operational risk. In this regard, the CBI has to develop specialized IT examinations focusing on 
areas such as information system management, computer operations, computer security, system development 
and networking, for fighting against fraud and keeping safe the business activity. Existing policies and practices 
for inspection should be updated to become forward-looking and risk-based with a focus on new issues such as 
operational risk and internal controls. On a medium term basis, developments of financial markets would call 
for taking steps to control market risks. There are still no limits to equities trading and investment, and no 
guidelines for banks to deal with these risks, notably in stress testing. Capital adequacy ratio does not take into 
account market risks. Regarding the FX and interest rate risks, CBI has to ensure that banks have in place 
adequate information systems to identify accurately these risks. In coordination with IMF banking supervision 
experts, CBI has to propose regulation amendments or new rules when appropriate.

A. Objectives 
1. 
The objectives of the Fund’s monetary Technical Assistance (TA) activities for Iraq are to rebuild the 
capacity of the CBI and other government bodies with a view to supporting financial and monetary stability.  
The medium-term objectives for technical assistance in the monetary and financial sector will be to support the 
i
mplementation of the program under the Stand-by Agreement (SBA), particularly the restructuring of the state-
owned banks, and to bolster the CBI’s capacities with regard to core central bank functions, such as bank 
supervision, monetary policy implementation and reserves management. The delivery strategy will take into 
account the findings of the evaluation. There will be regular workshops focused on improving core functions of 
the CBI, geared towards the production of key outputs by CBI staff. This will be augmented by ongoing support 
from headquarters.
52
 
2. 
Assistance is now being provided on the restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks. A phased 
approach is being taken, with the initial emphasis on preserving the existing institutions, which provide the bulk 
of banking services in Iraq. Memoranda of understanding have been signed between the authorities and each of 
the banks, and a Fund-designed restructuring has been endorsed by the Council of Ministers. The next phase 
involves securing resources for the restructuring plan, including from external donors. Finally, the Fund will 
support the implementation phase of the plan with a continuing program of workshops.
53
 Modernization of 
financial intermediation in Iraq will require, as a first step, the adoption of restructuring programs for Rafidain 
and Rasheed banks, and the completion of a set of prudential regulations for commercial banks. 
3. 
Future IMF financing for Iraq is uncertain.  It is unlikely that the IMF will be able to provide as much 
assistance over the next two years as during the past two years. 
B. 
Past Technical Assistance 
4. 
Technical assistance on monetary policy implementation and the provision of an advisor to the 
Governor of the CBI facilitated the move to greater exchange rate flexibility. Further, the advisor to the 
Governor was instrumental in helping the authorities negotiate the restructuring of debt with the Paris and 
London clubs during 2005 and 2006.  The practical focus of the banking supervision workshops has led to a 
substantial improvement in the quality of on site supervision reports. Similarly, the bank restructuring 
workshops provided the basis for the agreement on MOUs for restructuring of the Rafidain and Rasheed banks, 
and the establishment of a committee to oversee this process.  Fund TA also supported the introduction of a new 
currency and the implementation of the RTGS system. 
5. 
A Fund expert in currency reform provided off-site assistance in the successful banknote exchange in 
2004. The Fund provided considerable assistance from headquarters in the drafting of the central bank, payment 
and banking laws. The Fund provided assistance to the CBI to strengthen internal organization through a 
workshop which covered an assessment of existing departments, evaluation of existing human capital resources, 
and formulation of restructuring priorities. In addition, the Fund is providing advice on amending the central 
bank legislation in response to a request from the CBI. These amendments are aimed at addressing issues related 
to: the primacy of the CB's inflation objective; the appointment process CBI’s Board of Directors, its 
composition and powers; and the CBI's relationship to the legislature and Board of Supreme Audit. 
6. 
Progress has been made in improving accounting and financial reporting. The Fund conducted a 
workshop on accounting and financial reporting of the CBI. It covered the CBI balance sheet, and safeguarding 
that current CBI transactions are correctly booked and reported. The Fund, through multiple workshops held in 
conjunction with the Bank of England, has assisted the CBI in developing the institutional capacity to conduct 
monetary policy, and designing the appropriate instruments for its implementation. The CBI is steadily 
improving monetary operations, in close consultation with the Fund, and further work is expected in this area in 
the form of workshops and meetings.  
7. 
The Fund has done considerable work in helping Iraq develop a banking regulatory and supervisory 
system, in line with best international standards and practices. In coordination with the Federal Reserve System, 
training workshops were conducted to promote the emergence of a core group of professional banking 
supervisors among the existing CBI staff. The delivery of this initial training cycle started in Bahrain in June 
2004 and was concluded in Istanbul in January 2006. This second phase of the capacity building exercise aims 
at replicating the work of a resident advisor in reviewing the actual work and outputs produced by Iraqi 
supervisors, and in providing them with feedback and guidance for off-site and on-site supervision. This second

phase is managed by the METAC based in Beirut and is closely coordinated with, and complements the work 
of, the Baghdad-based U.S. banking supervision experts.  
8. 
The Fund has worked closely with the CBI in its successful reforms of the payment system. Payment 
system regulations, prepared with the assistance of the Fund, have been adopted. A real time gross settlement 
system for large value payments and an automated clearing house for retail transactions have commenced 
operations. Both projects are well ahead of schedule. The next steps involve extending the payment system to all 
bank offices and establishing the securities settlement system. 
9. 
Fund TA has resulted in: (i) the production of a monetary survey; (ii) replacing an obsolete paper-based 
system with modern electronic payment systems; (iii) improving banking supervision; and (iv) initiating the 
restructuring of the two largest state-owned banks. 
10. 
Past IMF TA covered the following areas: (i) monetary and financial systems areas, July 2003; (ii) 
market policy and operations, November 2003; (iii) accounting and financial reporting, December 2003; (iv) 
central bank reform, January 2004; (v) banking supervision, June 2004, July 2004, April 2005, January 2006,

22. During
 FY ’07 & ’08, the U.S. advisors have been assisting Rafidain and Rasheed (R&R) banks 
restructuring in accordance with the MoU that was signed on December 2006 by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) 
a
nd the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) as directed by the IMF.  The main focus of the U.S. Treasury assistance was 
t
he financial restructure and completion of the financial & operation audits of both banks; and the development 
of draft strategic & operational restructuring plan (SORP) in accordance with the audit recommendations.   
23. 
The U.S. Treasury provided assistance in the following areas; organization structure, information 
technology (IT), human resources (assisting in developing new salary and pay for performance program), and 
r
eform the existing policy & procedures.    
ii 
Rafidain & Rasheed (R&R) Banks Restructuring Achievements To date: 
24. 
Since the signing of the MOU in 2006, the Banking Advisory Treasury Team has been meeting with 
Rafidain & Rasheed Banks Committees on a regular basis (each bank established ten Restructuring Working 
Committees). The following are the major achievements for (R&R) Banks: 
ƒ
The international independent auditor (E&Y) conducted financial & operational audits of R&R Banks 
that would result in a revised, clean balance sheet and Strategic Operational Restructuring Plan.  We 
have attended meetings between the bank and the auditor to discuss the draft report. 
ƒ
The amount of foreign liabilities was determined and has been working on the Settlement (Create an 
Account Called “Counter to Inherited Foreign Liabilities for Settlement and Release” on the asset side 
as part of account receivable-adjusted accordingly). 
ƒ
Other liabilities and assets were determined (Create an account called “Counterpart to Inherited 
Losses” on the asset side as part of account receivable-adjusted accordingly), 
ƒ
Re-evaluation of the Bank Fixed Assets (Buildings & Lands) was completed for Rafidain Bank and 
Rasheed Bank is in the process of completing the task. 
ƒ
On March 15, 2008, Rafidain Bank Signed a contract with the B-Plan Company to implement a “Core 
Banking System” that would automate bank operations and is a main milestone in the reform.  As a 
part of Phase one, the international branches were connected.  Rasheed Bank is in the process of 
selecting a vendor for its Core Banking System. 
ƒ
Drafted a new Table of Organizational Structure (TO) that addresses the reporting relationship between 
the Departments and the R&R DGs (i.e. separate the reporting relationship of the Internal Audit 
Department from the DGs to reporting directly to the Board of Directors).  
ƒ
Human Resources Team is working on a draft to develop a Pay-for-Performance Incentive (PPI) 
Program that addresses the current bank workforce and future needs.   
ƒ
Rafidain &Rasheed Banks entered into a partnership with the International Smart Card Company (ISC) 
to provide electronic banking to its clients through its extensive branch network.  A main goal is to 
provide electronic payment and credits to the retirees, pensioners, military, Ministerial employees, etc. 
(estimated 6 million will be covered).  Current goal is to provide this service to a 100,000 card holders 
in three months (2 million within one year & 6 million within 2 years).   
ƒ
Rafidain & Rasheed Banks issued a draft of its “Strategic Operational Restructuring Plan-SORP”. The 
SORP identified; recommended restructure in each department, responsible team leader, expected time 
of completion, and estimated cost. 
25. 
We are very pleased about the progress made thus far in the restructuring of R&R Banks.  The 
activities described above have taken the two banks one step further to provide profitable, viable and efficient 
banking services to the Iraqi people. 
iii Future 
Plan 
26. 
U.S. Treasury Assistance in the Following 2 years will focus on the following areas: 
1. 
Strategic Planning/Business Plan/Budget
 
27. 
The bank’s Board of Directors requires a formal strategic planning process to direct the institution’s 
future activities and to avoid vulnerability to changes in the local, regional, and national economy. The strategic 
planning process is strategic management and goal setting. The general objective is to manage the bank’s 
exposure to unexpected changes arising from interest rate fluctuations, changing competition, etc. The strategic 
planning efforts will also affect other policies such as capital, asset/liability management, and fixed-asset 
expansion, while identifying banking sectors to generate expected revenues and expenses. Formulation of 
operating budget provides a road-map
.
Treasury advisors have worked on the initial draft “Strategic 
Operational Restructuring Plan-SORP. 
28. 
Action.
 Assist Rafidain Bank to refine and implement its draft “Strategic Operational Restructuring 
Plan-SORP”.  The SORP presented the role of management and focus requirements in increasing income and 
Page  66

61 - 
minimizing expenses and identified recommended restructure in each department, responsible team leader, 
expected time of completion, and estimated cost. . 
2. 
Policy & Procedures
/
Job Descriptions 
29. 
Each unit of the Bank should develop and have written steps to achieve the goals of the bank.  These 
steps should be standardized and in accordance with International Accounting Standards and good internal 
controls. Every position in the organization should be identified and written in such manner as to clearly reflect 
duties and assignments, with pertinent expectations.  Treasury advisors have begun work in this area which is 
heavily labor-intensive. 
30. 
Action
:
Work with all Senior Managers on detailed policy, procedures and job descriptions based on 
sample formats to ensure consistency in product results.   
3. 
Human Resources/Table of Organization
 
31. 
The structure of the bank should reflect the business sectors and its support structure. Lines of authority 
should be charted and delegated.  The table should provide clarity of staff’s role. The main challenge for HR is 
to provide to its management skilled, qualified and productive staff. The HR effort must provide compliance 
with authorities.  Included in this area are: Compensation, General Services, Training, Special incentive 
programs and Legal Personnel Actions.  Treasury advisors have undertaken initial work on a Table of 
Organization Structure and a pay for performance program. 
32. 
Action: 
Work with the Director General and Senior Managers on developing and refining a new Table 
of Organizational Structure (TO) that clarifies and streamlines the reporting relationships between the 
Department and the Bank DG (i.e. separate the reporting relationship of the Internal Audit Department from the 
DG to reporting directly to the Board of Directors). In this process, work with the Director General to authorize 
downstream decision making. Work with bank staff to develop further a pay-for-performance program which 
updated and increased salaries (Salary and Pay-for-Performance (SPP) Program).
 
4. Accounting/Information 
Technology 
33. 
The life-line of an institution is to be made available and functional to all business sectors. I.T. is to 
provide hardware and software so that the bank can survive in the highly competitive banking community. 
Accounting, utilizing good IT techniques, must maintain accurate and balanced income statements and balance 
sheet items while providing technology support to the management of the bank.  This would include compliance 
with International practices, compliance and reporting. Treasury advisors have attended meetings with the 
auditors and bank staff to discuss issues and their possible resolution. Treasury advisors have also been 
supporting work on a core banking system and will have a full time IT expert assigned to this task. 
34. 
Action. 
 Follow up on issues raised in the audit.  Provide advisory support in the implementation of a 
core banking system including system conversion.  Rafidain Bank Signed a contract with the B-Plan Company 
to implement a “Core Banking System” that would automate bank operations and is a main milestone in the 
reform.   
5. Branch Administration/Operations 
35. 
The role of managing and providing client services, in the form of product offerings, is critical to the 
bank. This function is tied in with other business units and provides general support to the banking effort.
 
36. 
Action.
 Advice senior managers on developing a client services work plan and assist in its 
implementation.  
6. 
 Credit and Collections 
37. 
 Necessary for the viability of the banks is the establishment of a credit capacity to generate significant 
revenue for the banks.  This effort will be guided by a task force approach to perform an assessment of the 
Credit departments. Treasury advisors have presented a first phase of a credit program to senior managers. 
38. 
Action.
 
Provide advice on developing and implementing a credit program that could take effect as 
soon as financial restructuring is completed.   
7. 
Staff Training and Development 
39. 
The need for training programs and courses is agreed to be a high priority by R&R’s (the ‘Banks’) 
executive management and the MoF. As a result of a variety of factors, all levels of the Banks’ staff have fallen 
behind in their exposure to modern commercial banking products, policies and methodologies. To overcome 
these deficiencies comprehensive training programs should be developed in accordance with the Banks ’needs, 
budgets and available internal and external resources. (Twinning and shadow arrangements with major 
international institutions should also be explored). Initially, the following areas are considered priorities for staff 
training: risk mgt., asset/liability mgt., internal audit, branch operations, IT and HR. 
Page  67
-
62 - 
40. 
Action.
 
Work with and assist the Banks’ DG’s and Senior Managers (and the MoF ‘ Training 
Coordinator’) to identify training needs, develop priorities, establish candidate selection criteria, research and 
r
ecommend training courses and facilities in country and in the region .Develop an Action Plan and Time-Line 
t
o
guide the training initiatives. Provide ongoing advisory support in the implementation and monitoring of the 
training programs.

41. 
Strengthening the internal operations of the CBI. FSVC arranged for CBI officials to meet with 
officials from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to discuss optimal internal structures and work 
processes. The first engagement took place in early February 2009 and it is expected that this will be the first in 
a
series of consultations between the Kansas City Fed. and the CBI.  
42. 
Enabling the CBI to expand its network of counterparty financial relationships. FSVC has written a 
short report for the CBI explaining what commercial and central banks look for when deciding whether to 
establish counterparty relationships with another institution. FSVC plans to hold in-person discussions with CBI 
officials to explain in detail the contents of the report. 
43. 
FSVC plans to work with METAC to provide advice to the CBI on how to strengthen the banking 
supervision department. FSVC’s advice will focus on the policy and organizational issues related to banking 
supervision. 
44. 
FSVC will provide advice to the CBI on how to efficiently manage state reserves entrusted to it. 
Advice cover issues of policy and well as operational issues related to reserves management.  
45. 
FSVC has offered to assemble senior legal experts to advise the CBI on how to develop a strategy for 
addressing claims and judgments outstanding against it.  
46. 
FSVC may provide advice on the restructuring of Rashid Bank and Rafidain Bank. FSVC can deploy 
high-level experts with experience of the legal and operational aspects of recapitalizing and restructuring bad 
banks, however, FSVC recognizes that others may be providing advice of a similar nature and is keen not to 
duplicate.

A. Organization 
Structure
1.  Overview 
Project Understanding. 
To establish an Organization and Job Profiling Platform where it came to identify the 
following project objectives: (i) supporting the bank’s business reform strategies; (ii) paving the way for the 
implementation of the bank's job profiles including families and levels; and (iii) facilitating working relationships 
between various divisions. 
Execution Overview
.
A
High Level Organization Structure exercise will be carried out to achieve the required 
Organization and Job profiling Platform. The project is recommended to pass through the following phases: 
ƒ
Organization Baseline Study through the following: (i) study available documentation covering history, plans, 
and reports; and (ii) meetings with Bank officials to understand the reform requirements, the current bank’s 
structure, the bank’s nature of core functions, defining key business drivers, norms of operations (what is 
working & what is not, etc…). 
 
ƒ
Meeting with the selected bank officials to confirm the organization concepts and each of the banks’ 
fundamental areas.  
ƒ
High Level Organization Charts will be developed for level 1 and level 2 in the bank based on EBI’s experience 
guided by the business strategy, reform requirements and driven by the best practice in the banking sector. The 
Organization Structure would reflect: (i) reporting relations within the bank; (ii) bank’s headcount; (iii) the 
different organization levels; and (iv) key results areas and key performance indicators. 
ƒ
Upon confirmation on the outcome of the High Level Organization Structure, a draft  of the Job Profiles will be 
developed through the following job analysis of the different functional areas followed by approval of the draft 
and final job profiles outcome; and transfer of knowledge to the bank’s officials on writing and managing the 
job profiles.  A typical job profile reflects: (i) job purpose; (ii) key results and corresponding duties; (iii) key 
performance indicators; (iv) required core competencies and level-specific competencies; (v) communication; 
(vi) financial responsibility; and (vii) job specifications.  The same methodology will be applied on the rest of 
the organization levels in the banks (level 3 and level 4). Further details on the methodology and execution will 
be provided upon agreement on the project concept.
