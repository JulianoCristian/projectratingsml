                         The operation comes as a response to the request by the Government of Iraq to the World Bank for supporting the implementation of Phase I of the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy.
                         The project (US$ 10 million), is provided through the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance the costs and activities associated with the restructuring of the banking sector in Iraq.

                         Specifically, it would support the restructuring of the two state-owned banks--Rashid bank and Rashidan Bank, as well as develop their activities in the financial sector in parallel with
                         on-going efforts to strengthen the banking sector✇ s regulatory and supervisory framework of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), the implementing agency.

                         Good progress has been made over the past months in the implementation of the banking sector reform program. The Bank has been providing technical support and advisory

                         services to the Iraqi authorities to implement the First Phase of the Banking Reform Strategy, which was done in consultations with the Ministry of Finance, the CBI, the Board of
                         Supreme Audit (BSA), and the senior management of the two state-owned banks. This has been evident in the developments made in the institutional, operational and financial
                         restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks--Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank through the capacity building of these banks at the head quarters and branch level in the
                         different governorates. Moreover, at the CBI, the Supervision Department has been restructured and its capacity has been built, especially in the area of risk management. These
                         developments have been reflected in improvements in numerous monitoring macroprudential indicators, including the rise in reserves-to-non-performing loans (NPLs) from 10% to
                         21%, the rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio from 4% to 7.5%, and capital adequacy ratios from zero to 4.5% during the same period from June 2006 (baseline) to June 2012. In addition,
                         a recent major development is the decisions made by the Banking Restructuring Oversight Committee (ROC) on April 3 and 8, 2012 regarding the settlement of NPLs, and the
                         overall financial restructuring of Rashid Bank and Rafidain, as well as the endorsement of the Organizational Structure of these two state-owned banks, aiming at improving their
                         governance structure, and their overall performance.

                         On another note, CBI has requested a reallocation of the proceeds among the expenditure categories, as per the letter from the Governor of CBI dated July 8, 2012. This request is
                         mainly due to the fact that during project implementation, additional training and advisory services were identified as needed based on consultations with the CBI, the Project
                         Management Unit (PMU), the two state-owned banks—Rashid Bank and Rafidain, and the bankers’ association. These demands were also consistent with the needs assessments
                         conducted, and the recent recommendations of the Iraq Financial Sector Report. This proposed reallocation is also necessary to allow the PMU to carry out its mission effectively in
                         the remaining period of implementation. This reallocation of funds for this project is the first of its kind, and has been approved by the World Bank on July 27, 2012.

                         It is worth noting that the replacement of the Governor of CBI by the Head of BSA, could affect project implementation, and possible delays with the change in management. The
                         team is planning to hold a midterm review mission, to ensure irreversibility of the reform program, and smooth implementation of the project.
