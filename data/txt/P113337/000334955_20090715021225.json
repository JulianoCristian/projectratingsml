           Sector Reform Project in Iraq is to strengthen the\n            supervisory framework for financial intermediation and to\n            build capacity of financial institutions to support\n            implementation of first phase of the Iraq banking reform\n            strategy specifically, the operation will focus on four main\n            components: (i) institutional and operational restructuring\n            of the two main state-owned commercial banks (Rasheed Bank\n            and Rafidain Bank); (ii) financial restructuring of the two\n            main state-owned commercial banks; (iii) strengthening of\n            the regulatory and supervisory functions of Central Bank of\n            Iraq (CBI); and (iv) project management, monitoring and\n            evaluation. Overall, this operation will assist Iraq in\n            implementing first phase of their program, covering the\n            period from 2009 to 2010. It will thereby foster more\n            efficient financial intermediation, resource mobilization\n            and risk management, and, in the medium-term, it will permit\n            an increase in private participation in the provision of\n            financial services."}, "docdt": "2009-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
