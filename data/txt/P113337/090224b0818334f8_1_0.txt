                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The operation comes as a response to the request by the Government of Iraq to the World Bank for supporting the implementation of Phase I of the Iraq Banking Reform Strategy.
                         The project (US$ 10 million), is provided through the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance the costs and activities associated with the restructuring of the banking sector in Iraq.

                         Specifically, it would support the restructuring of the two state-owned banks--Rashid bank and Rashidan Bank, as well as develop their activities in the financial sector in parallel with
                         on-going efforts to strengthen the banking sector✇ s regulatory and supervisory framework of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), the implementing agency.

                         The Bank has been providing technical support and advisory services to the Iraqi authorities to implement the First Phase of the Banking Reform Strategy, which was done in

                         consultations with the Ministry of Finance, the CBI, the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA), and the senior management of the two state-owned banks. This has been evident in the
                         developments made in the institutional, operational and financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks--Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank through the capacity building
                         of these banks at the head quarters and branch level in the different governorates. Moreover, at the CBI, the Supervision Department has been restructured and its capacity has
                         been built, especially in the area of risk management.

                         On another note, CBI has requested a reallocation of the proceeds among the expenditure categories, as per the letter from the Governor of CBI dated July 8, 2012. This request is
                         mainly due to the fact that during project implementation, additional training and advisory services were identified as needed based on consultations with the CBI, the Project
                         Management Unit (PMU), the two state-owned banks—Rashid Bank and Rafidain, and the bankers’ association. These demands were also consistent with the needs assessments
                         conducted, and the recent recommendations of the Iraq Financial Sector Report. This proposed reallocation is also necessary to allow the PMU to carry out its mission effectively in
                         the remaining period of implementation. This reallocation of funds for this project is the first of its kind, and has been approved by the World Bank on July 27, 2012.

                         There has been a major change in CBI management with the appointment of a new Governor. On October 14, 2012 an Iraqi judiciary issued an arrest warrant against the Governor
                         of CBI, Dr. Sinan Al-Shabibi. Consequently, the Iraqi government appointed Dr. Abdul-Baset Turki, the Head of BSA, as an Acting Governor of CBI, after the court ruling ordered the
                         removal of Dr. Shabibi from his post. The World Bank has received an official letter dated October 21, 2012, notifying management of such a change, since the CBI is the
                         implementing entity of this project. Dr. Shabibi, who is currently out of the country, and more than a dozen other officials at the institution are being investigated for misleading
                         monetary policies, as well as alleged improprieties involving capital requirements for local banks and foreign-currency auctions overseen by the central bank.It is worth noting that the
                         replacement of the Governor of CBI by the Head of BSA, could affect project implementation, and possible delays with the change in management. Following this decision, the team
                         has met the Iraqi authorities, to ensure irreversibility of the reform program, and smooth implementation of the project.
