                         Specifically, it would support the restructuring of the two state-owned banks--Rashid bank and Rashidan Bank, as well as develop their activities in the financial sector in parallel with
                         on-going efforts to strengthen the banking sector✇ s regulatory and supervisory framework of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), the implementing agency.

                         The Bank has been providing technical support and advisory services to the Iraqi authorities to implement the First Phase of the Banking Reform Strategy, which was done in

                         consultations with the Ministry of Finance, the CBI, the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA), and the senior management of the two state-owned banks. This has been evident in the
                         developments made in the institutional, operational and financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks--Rasheed Bank and Rafidain Bank through the capacity building
                         of these banks at the head quarters and branch level in the different governorates. Moreover, at the CBI, the Supervision Department has been restructured and its capacity has
                         been built, especially in the area of risk management. Following the change in CBI management, the current Acting Governor has put banking sector reform as his top priority. In that
                         context, he meets on a regular basis with all stakeholders to address challenges hindering reform implementation (internal CBI staff, BSA, state-owned banks, private banks, and the
                         Banking Association). Concrete results are expected to be achieved over the coming months, in that regard.

                         The project closing date is approaching in June 30, 2013. The Bank team discussed progress achieved to date toward the Project Development Objectives and their completion prior
                         to the project closing date with the Iraq authorities, as well as on-going reforms in the banking sector after the conclusion of the project period. The World Bank team also presented
                         to the Iraqi authorities and the different counterparts; namely the Prime Minister's Office, Prime Minister’s Advisory Commission (PMAC), the CBI, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
                         Planning and International Cooperation, Office of the Deputy of the Speaker, Parliament—Finance Committee, Rafidain Bank, and Rasheed Bank; the Financial Sector Reform
                         Strategy—Action Plan, which highlights key recommendations on moving forward to ensure the soundness of the financial sector in Iraq, and enhance the role of the banking sector
                         in economic development.
