The project indicators show encouraging\n            improvements and progress. Significant lessons were learned\n            during the implementation of the project in the following\n            areas: 1) strong analytic underpinning and building on other\n            operations; 2) consultations with stakeholders for building\n            consensus; 3) effective cooperation with development\n            practices for ensuring good coordination, and leveraging in\n            pushing reforms; 4) strong and sustained partnership; 5)\n            difficulties in finding international experts to travel to\n            Baghdad because of the security situation; and 6) the\n            importance of a combination of on-site and off-site missions\n            for operations in conflict countries."}, "docdt": "2013-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
