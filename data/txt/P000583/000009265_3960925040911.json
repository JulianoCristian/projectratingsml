This was the first International Development\n            Association (IDA)-finance agricultural project in the\n            Comoros. It aimed to extend and improve coconut and copra\n            production on the three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan,\n            and Moheli, through rodent control, increased productivity\n            of the existing stands from replanting and new planting, and\n            improvement of copra processing and marketing. Improvement\n            was necessary on all islands either because of poor\n            maintenance of plantations, poor genetic quality and age of\n            palms, or limited marketing, and processing facilities. The\n            project aims fitted well with the need for the Comoros to\n            increase the income level of its people through increased\n            agriculture production and also with government's\n            objective to meet present and future coconut demand for\n            domestic consumption and to re-establish the previous export\n            levels of copra. The project, to be implemented by the\n            ministry of production over a period of five years, included\n            the establishment of a rodent control unit, the creation of\n            a copra processing and marketing service, the establishment\n            of seed gardens and nurseries for the production of\n            high-yielding coconut planting material, training and\n            technical assistances, studies and the creation of a project\n            management, and administrative service."}, "docdt": "1992-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
