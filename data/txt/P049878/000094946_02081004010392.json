Private\n            Sector Operation Project will support the Government's\n            program of consolidating macroeconomic stability, and will\n            lay the foundation for sustained private sector-led growth\n            over the medium term. It includes measures to: extend budget\n            coverage, and conduct a public expenditure review; resolve\n            the financial difficulties of two banks, and reduce\n            Government ownership in the financial sector; strengthen\n            supervision in the financial sector; and, liberalize the\n            telecommunications, and air transport sectors, opening these\n            sectors to further, private participation. The project is\n            designed to support the objectives of the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper, and is part of a continuing set of reforms,\n            designed to consolidate a stable macroeconomic environment,\n            sustain growth, and reduce poverty through improvements in\n            the sustainability of public sector delivery. However,\n            categories of risk include: political risks due to the\n            diminishing electoral margins of the ruling party, which\n            creates a climate of risk aversion, and a possible slowdown\n            in the implementation of reforms; macroeconomic risks, due\n            to diminished private sector confidence in the wake of\n            financial difficulties of the two partly, state-owned banks;\n            and, high fiduciary risks. The project will seek to diminish\n            macroeconomic risks, through reforms designed to lead\n            increased transparency, and reducing state ownership in the\n            banking sector; and, to mitigate fiduciary risks, the\n            Government is already following the agreed action plans."}, "docdt": "2002-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
