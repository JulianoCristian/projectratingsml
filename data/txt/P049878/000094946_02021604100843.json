One of the components is to make progress\n            with the privatization of the petroleum company PETROMOC.\n            The objectives of this environmental pre-audit is to: carry\n            out a pre-audit of a representative number of the facilities\n            of PETROMOC, and to develop a ranking to determine which\n            types of facilities will need a full, partial, or no\n            environmental audit or environmental assessment before\n            divestiture; measure the environmental conditions of the\n            facilities against risk of being held responsible for\n            damages after divestiture; use the baseline information to\n            assist the borrower in preparing guidelines to ensure the\n            necessary audits be taken according to the ranking study;\n            and review the national legislative framework to ascertain\n            whether the government or the new private investors will be\n            legally responsible for clean-up measures. The pre-audit\n            recommends that a full audit be done for the three main and\n            five smaller facilities as well as partial audits for at\n            least 20 representative retail outlets and a representative\n            sample of the 19 depots."}, "docdt": "2001-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
