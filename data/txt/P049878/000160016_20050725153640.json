The most significant lessons\n            pertain to the project's consistency with the\n            government's development priorities and the Country\n            Assistance Strategy; the skill mix and the continuity of the\n            teams assigned to the preparatory phase that led to\n            delivering a good design of the project's content; and\n            the need for a comprehensive assessment of the legal\n            capacity of the Borrower to coordinate the implementation of\n            the reforms. Besides shortcomings that were mentioned, the\n            evaluation considered the financial package of EMPSO\n            appropriate and the amount lent was regarded as adequate.\n            The suitability of the lending instrument is \"beyond\n            question.\" Seen from the point of view of the Borrower,\n            EMPSO represented an advance compared to previous operations\n            since in this case there was an immediate conversion of the\n            amounts of each of the two tranches into local funds for\n            budget support as soon as each tranche was released."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
