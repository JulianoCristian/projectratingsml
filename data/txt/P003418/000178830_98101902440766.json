funds to\n            subborrowers in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to finance\n            investments for the development of citrus orchards and other\n            tree crops, aquaculture, livestock and agro-processing.\n            Project funds would be channelled through the Agricultural\n            Bank of China (ABC) to subborrowers comprising collective\n            units, individual farmers and households, and state-owned\n            enterprises. The project would also include a technical\n            assistance conponent for the institutional strengthening of\n            ABC, comprising overseas fellowships, local training, expert\n            services for planning an improved information and data\n            management system, and future project preparation, and\n            supporting equipment. A major objective of the project is\n            strengthening the project appraisal capability and\n            methodology of ABC. The project would increase the\n            production of higher value foods which are in short supply\n            and for which demand is growing rapidly. Increased annual\n            production would be about 430,000 tons of fruits and 11,000\n            tons of aquatic products, mainly fish. In addition, lending\n            for the establishment or expansion of animal breeding and\n            fish nurseries would help satisfy the growing demand from\n            individual households for improved stock, while increasing\n            the supply of red meat, poultry and eggs. The project would\n            provide funds to sub-borrowers in Hubei Provinc finance\n            investments for the development of aquaculture, livestock,\n            and crops.
