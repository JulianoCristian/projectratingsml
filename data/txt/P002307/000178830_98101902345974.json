The project would include: (i)\n            a study to determine the optimal organization of the power\n            sector; (ii) financial studies and external audits of the\n            existing companies for fiscal years 1979, 1980 and 1981;\n            (iii) a design study of headquarters for the future national\n            entity, to be followed by architectural specifications,\n            preparation of bidding documents, and analysis of bids; (iv)\n            the feasibility study of the expansion of power generating\n            facilities, to be followed by detailed engineering,\n            preparation of bidding documents and analysis of bids; (v) a\n            tariff study which would make recommendations on the\n            structure and level of electricity tariffs; (vi) technical\n            assistance to develop a national energy plan and improve\n            power sector planning; and (vii) scholarships for energy\n            planning.
