Project development objective
:
Refer PAD IV and Annex 5 
 
The objective of the Yogyakarta and Central Java Earthquake Roof Structure Project is to respond to the most basic 
needs of the households affected by the earthquake through the provision of roof structures that transition to 
permanent housing.
 
Project description 
Refer PAD V , Annex 5 
The project shall help close the remaining gap of needs for Roof Structure, as required during the ongoing efforts to 
construct a sufficient number of permanent houses for all households that have become homeless as a result of the 
disaster. The project shall provide an estimated 8,000 additional eligible households with “Roof Structure Kits”. 
The project has five components: 
Page  6
(i) Set-up of the prefabrication facility
.
The fabrication facility will subcontract five prefabrication teams of 15 
people and will operate for one shift per day producing 110 Shelter Structure Kits per day; or 660 kits per week, 
based on a 6-day (Monday to Saturday) production week.  Workers are specialized along the different aspects of the 
production to optimize speed and quality of construction. 
 
(ii) Preparation of Roof Structure Kits
.
This component involves prefabrication of the most labor intensive and 
structurally crucial elements of the building including: roof trusses, columns, tarpaulins for the roof, bracing and pre-
cutting of wall components. In addition, roofing elements (the frame that holds tiles) will be precut to facilitate 
transportation of materials and improve on-site construction efficiency. Roof Structure Kits include a construction 
manual, to serve as a reference during the construction process. The Roof Structure Kits include clay roof tiles
to be 
installed over the roof tarp, which will increase the life expectancy of the shelter. 
 
(iii) Targeting and distribution of kits to beneficiaries
.
The Implementing Agency will undertake selection of end-
users/beneficiaries according to the following procedures:  (a) Site identification
:
Using the SCG database, Outreach 
staff will identify those locations with heavy and total damage that do not receive any assistance from other 
organizations.  This information will be reviewed and crosschecked with various other sources including local 
government. CHF aims for full coverage in each targeted village. Once an area is selected, Outreach staff meets with 
the community leaders (RTs) to introduce the program; (b) Beneficiaries list and awareness
:
in consultation with the 
RT heads, CHF will establish a list of eligible household prioritized order of vulnerability.  Potential beneficiaries 
will then be surveyed by a team of student volunteers under the supervision and guidance of CHF Volunteer 
Coordinators and Outreach Staff to verify eligibility for assistance.  Volunteers also carry out detailed community 
mapping documenting the damage sustained by each household.  Following the volunteer assessment, the RT 
beneficiary list is vetted with the entire community through a community-wide meeting; and (c) Ex-post 
distribution/monitoring
:
after delivery of the Shelter Kits, CHF volunteers are in the communities daily to provide 
technical support to volunteer construction crews from the villages and beneficiaries’ households.  Additionally CHF 
technical staff will conduct a technical audit of approximately 30% of beneficiaries to verify structural quality. CHF 
will also conduct household level audits to evaluate beneficiary satisfaction. 
 
(iv)Assistance to beneficiaries during construction
.
In the field, the Implementing Agency will oversee and provide 
technical guidance for the construction of Roof Structure, in cooperation with volunteer students from local 
universities, mainly the Department of Architecture, and Civil Engineering of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) 
and recruited skilled construction workers who are pre-trained.  The construction process will use volunteers and a 
community-based approach using 
gotong royong
 labor groups, organized by the community.  The Implementing 
Agency’s outreach department and field construction manager will coordinate assistance to 
gotong royong
 
(community self-help) teams to ensure adherence to work plan, material control requirements and construction 
standards.  The Implementing Agency’s craftsmen will work with the self-help teams, through allocation of one hired 
skilled carpenter to serve on each 
gotong royong
 team. 
 
(v) Quality Control and Reporting.
 The Implementing Agency has a quality control system for the input and the 
output.  The tracking procedures cover incoming material, production, field distribution, end-user tracking and 
community handover of the structure kits, quality control during the construction and certification upon completion of 
the construction.  The Implementing Agency will also continue to distribute awareness raising material and safe 
building manuals, which will complement the assistance provided by CHF technical volunteers.  In addition, CHF 
will be responsible for day-to-day management, including procurement of materials, operation of the prefabrication 
site, distribution of Roof Structure Kits, provision of technical assistance for assembly on site, logistics, and all other 
operational details of the Project, in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures.  CHF will report on its activities 
and their outcomes to IBRD.

TECHNICAL REPORT 
 
I.  
BACKGROUND 
 
On May 27, 2006, an earthquake registering 6.3 on the Richter scale damaged surrounding areas of 
Yogyakarta and Central Java (the “Affected Areas”).  A significant number of houses were destroyed or 
damaged by the earthquake; societal coping mechanisms have also been severely disrupted, with 
widespread trauma and the means of earning a living buried in the rubble.  The scale of the disaster is 
much greater than first thought, owing to a traditional building culture that was complacent about 
earthquake risk.  Masonry walls made of burnt bricks connected with weak mortar – a reality exacerbated 
by unwitting negligence and poverty – were no match for the strong earthquake.  In addition, a lack of 
adequate anchoring, poor workmanship, and minimal compliance with building codes, all contributed to 
the extent of the damage. 
 
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, in response to the GoI request for housing assistance and in 
cooperation with government, local and international stakeholders, various organizations, individuals and 
community groups distributed emergency shelter materials (e.g. tarpaulins, mattresses, blankets and other 
emergency-shelter non-food items).  Whilst close to 100% of the needs for immediate emergency shelter 
have now been covered, emergency tents and tarpaulins are only a short-term solution and will not 
provide adequate shelter to cover transitional needs through the two to three years required for 
preliminary reconstruction.  Many families are likely to wait much longer for the completion of 
permanent housing built to earthquake-resistant standards (“Permanent Houses”).  In the meantime, 
although some families may have the resources to recover on their own and others may receive assistance 
from government, civil society or the humanitarian community, poverty and insufficient resources 
highlight the need for transitional shelter support.  The lack of adequate housing also impacts the capacity 
of people to resume their livelihoods.  A large percentage of the affected population is engaged in small 
home-based industries.  Hence, in the absence of more durable shelter, these communities will not be able 
to resume their previous economic activities.  Finally, the lack of adequate housing causes severe health 
problems, which are expected to expand during the rainy season. 
 
GoI is presently focusing all available resources on providing Permanent Houses to affected households, 
while the NGOs working under the coordination of the United Nations Early Recovery Cluster (“ERC”) 
are focusing on meeting immediate needs for housing in the form of “Roof Structures”.  A typical Roof 
Structure is a wind and weather-proof bamboo structure with a tile roof, assembled on the existing 
concrete foundation of the original collapsed house, and is considered durable in that it is built to last for a 
minimum of three years while Permanent Houses are being constructed.  All Roof Structures should be 
built to SPHERE standards (For further detail on Roof Structures, refer to Annex 5: Technical Annex).  
Some key features of Roof Structures are that, not being a full Permanent House, they in no way endanger 
a
family’s entitlement for permanent housing assistance under the broader GoI shelter response to the 
disaster, almost all components used in the construction can be reused in the construction of the 
Permanent House (see Section XV: Benefits and Risks), and no permits or authorizations are required for 
construction. 
 
II.   
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF DAMAGE AND RESPONSE 
TO DATE 
 
The Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment Report (“PDLAR”) completed in June 2006 showed that 
over 300,000 homes were either totally destroyed or heavily damaged; with an average family size of 4.3, 
approximately 1.3 million people were rendered homeless by the earthquake. 
Page  8
-

-
Assessments recently conducted by the key members of the ERC show a need of approximately 93,000 
Roof Structures, that is, 93,000 families are living with other families, are in shelters with a roof height 
below 2 meters, or are in shelters that will not provide sufficient shelter from the rainy season.  To date, 
overall commitments from various agencies providing Roof Structures amount to 50,000 
–
showing a gap 
of approximately 47,300 shelters (including a 10% contingency). 
 
III. PROJECT 
RATIONALE 
 
The GoI has released its Action Plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction for the Affected Areas and has 
committed US$270 million in 2006-2007 to reconstruct Permanent Houses.  One of the objectives of the 
multidonor Java Reconstruction Fund is to respond to the basic needs of the households affected by the 
Earthquake, notably in terms of housing. 
 
Whilst GoI has just begun distributing the first phases of cash grants to start the process of permanent 
reconstruction, this resource cannot be mobilized in time to mitigate the potentially devastating effects of 
the rainy season upon settlement conditions in the Affected Areas.  The Provincial Governments of 
Yogyakarta and Central Java together with the Early Recovery Cluster (ERC) have developed a joint and 
complementary strategy aimed at accelerating the process of reconstruction to address the need for 
housing, whilst adhering to the plan for permanent housing reconstruction established by the Government 
of Indonesia. 
 
IV. Project 
Objective 
 
The objective of this Project is to respond to the most basic needs of the households affected by the 
earthquake through the provision of roof structures that transition to permanent housing.  The Project will 
provide eligible families in targeted villages in the affected areas with safe and durable housing through 
the provision of roof structures while permanent house is being rebuilt.  The Project provides the eligible 
beneficiaries an 18 m2 of roof-structure house constructed with bamboo columns and roof trusses and 
bamboo sheets for the walls with clay roof tiles.  Most of the materials of the roof structures can be reused 
in building a permanent house. 
 
V. PROJECT 
DESCRIPTION 
 
To achieve the objective set out above, the Project will augment and increase capacity of the pre-existing 
program of the Implementing Agency.  The program has five components:  (i) set-up of the prefabrication 
facility, (ii) preparation of Roof Structure Kits, (iii) targeting and distribution of kits to beneficiaries, (iv) 
assistance to beneficiaries during construction, and (v) quality control and reporting. 
 
The fabrication facility will subcontract five prefabrication teams of 15 people and will operate for one 
shift per day producing 110 Shelter Structure Kits per day; or 660 kits per week, based on a six-day 
(Monday-Saturday) production week.  Workers are specialized along the different aspects of the 
production to optimize speed and quality of construction. 
 
Preparation of Roof Structure Kits involves prefabrication of the most labor intensive and structurally 
crucial elements of the building including: roof trusses, columns, tarpaulins for the roof, bracing and pre-
cutting of wall components.  In addition, roofing elements (the frame that holds tiles) will be precut to 
facilitate transportation of materials and improve on-site construction efficiency.  Roof Structure Kits 
include a construction manual, to serve as a reference during the construction process.  The Roof 
Page  9
-

-
Structure Kits include clay roof tiles
to be installed over the roof tarp, which will increase the life 
expectancy of the shelter. 
 
The Implementing Agency
 will coordinate closely with the ERC’s MIS program when it is operational as 
well as the Emergency Shelter Cluster under the ERC and local NGOs to identify locations that do not 
receive any assistance from other organizations.  The Implementing Agency’s strategy includes the use of 
in-house staff and local NGOs to identify needy beneficiaries and insure all people living in the 
earthquake affected area have adequate shelter while they rebuild permanent homes.  The Implementing 
Agency continues to receive requests for shelter assistance from communities.  This existing list will be 
combined with other RTs who will be encouraged to contact the project to request assistance.  Project-
supported NGO partner teams will visit communities to describe the program services and verify the RT 
compiled beneficiary list.  The list will be presented at the general community meeting for endorsement 
and support of the proposed beneficiaries. 
 
In the field, the Implementing Agency will oversee and provide technical guidance for the construction of 
Roof Structure, in cooperation with volunteer students from local universities, mainly the Department of 
Architecture, and Civil Engineering of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and recruited skilled 
construction workers who are pre-trained.  The construction process will use volunteers and a 
community-based approach using 
gotong royong
 labor groups, organized by the community.  The 
Implementing Agency’s outreach department and field construction manager will coordinate assistance to 
gotong royong
 (community self-help) teams to ensure adherence to work plan, material control 
requirements and construction standards.  The Implementing Agency’s craftsmen will work with the self-
help teams, through allocation of one hired skilled carpenter to serve on each 
gotong royong
 team. 
 
As Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF’s) preexisting Roof Structure program is complete, all 
supplier and manpower contracts will need to be renewed. 
 
The Implementing Agency will also continue to distribute awareness raising material and safe building 
manuals, which will complement the assistance provided by CHF technical volunteers. 
 
(For a more detailed project description, please refer to Annex 5.C: Technical Annex). 
 
VI. PROJECT 
IMPLEMENTATION 
 
Implementing Agency
.
The Grant recipient and organization responsible for all implementation and 
management issues for the Project will be CHF International (the “Implementing Agency”).  The 
Implementing Agency will be responsible for day-to-day management, procurement, logistics, and all 
operational details of the Project in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures.  Project is managed 
by Yogyakarta based program manager as well as a construction supervisor, and a warehouse manager.  
Oversight from Jakarta office including country director and 2 financial officers.  Staff of approximately 
30 based in Jogja with support from Washington head office as needed.  The organizational structure is 
presented in Figure 4: Project Organization. 
 
Capacity
.
While the Implementing Agency’s Roof Structures are relatively expensive, with over 18 % of 
the unit cost representing overheads, and non-Project-related staffing and office costs, it was chosen due 
to its proven abilities to manage all of the tasks set out in the above paragraph and expands its program 
with minimal additional costs.  As of November 3, 2006, the Implementing Agency has delivered 5,120 
Roof Structure Kits to eligible families in the Affected Areas and approximately 4,500 completed or 
under construction.  The Implementing Agency was judged to be one of the few organizations able to 
deliver Roof Structures on this scale; further advantages are that the Implementing Agency has no other 
commitments to other donors all production is focused on the Project leading to a fast delivery schedule.  
Page  10
-
4
-
Negotiations are ongoing with other potential providers of Roof Structures. 
 
Quality control
.
The Implementing Agency has a quality control system for the input and the output.  
The tracking procedures cover incoming material, production, field distribution, end-user tracking and 
community handover of the structure kits, quality control during the construction and certification upon 
completion of the construction.  
 
Oversight
.
The Urban Unit of IBRD will oversee the project and carry out supervision at least once per 
month, or more regularly as needed.  IBRD will carry out a mid-term review in mid February 2007 to 
assess the performance and the progress as well as the demand of the Roof Structures.  At the Project 
level, after all distribution has been completed, and construction should have been completed the 
Implementing Agency’s Community Liaison staff will conduct additional meetings and follow up with 
the beneficiaries to evaluate their satisfaction with the shelter provided.  IBRD will also assign an 
independent consultant team to verify the deliverables in terms of number, quality, targeting and 
beneficiaries’ satisfaction. 
 
Independent audits of the Implementing Agency’s activities will be carried out in cooperation with 
relevant levels of government and in accordance with section XI on Auditing. 
 
VII. TARGETING OF BENEFICIARIES 
 
The project targets individual neighborhoods (Rukun Tetangga or “RT”) in the Affected Areas and the 
Project will target approximately 400 RTs, and will select these RTs based on the level of damage and the 
level of assistance provided and promised by other organizations.  First point of contact is with provincial 
or district government to select RTs, after which CHF Outreach Staff meet with RTs to introduce the 
program, and ask RTs to provide a list of beneficiaries in need of shelter assistance.  Then CHF university 
volunteers visit communities to verify the need and existence of beneficiaries.  Following that assessment, 
the beneficiary list is vetted with the entire community in a community meeting.  CHF then signs a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the RT leader on behalf of the entire community outlining 
the responsibilities of CHF and the RT.  The main steps of community beneficiary selection and 
processing are outlined as follows: 
 
Step 1 
–
Community Outreach 
From compiled list supplied by GOI, communities are identified and evaluated according to CHF criteria:  
Level of damage, need and vulnerability, cluster potential, and willingness to work with CHF on building 
their own shelters.  More specifically, Community Selection is based on
:
Step 2 – Community Outreach 
Complete Community Selection Information Form CR1 which summarizes the decision process made by 
Outreach to recommend the beneficiary communities. 
 
Step 3 – Community Outreach and Management Team 
Outreach schedules a meeting with CHF management team to present the Community Selection 
Information Form CR1 and review the reasons for the recommendation.  At this meeting, the exact 
location of the targeted area will be located on the CHF planning map.   
 
Decision 1 
–
Community Outreach and Senior Staff 
Is this an appropriate target community? 
 
Step 4 
–
Community Outreach 
Conduct General Community Meeting with the RT and community members.  Describe shelter program, 
RT and CHF responsibilities, and shelter model.  
Page  11
-
5
-
Decision 2 
–
R.T. and Community 
Community members make a democratic decision if they want to participate with CHF.  This decision is 
made based on the facts presented at the General Meeting.  
 
Step 5 
–
Community Outreach 
R.T. completes Beneficiary Tracking Form CR2, listing beneficiary names in order of prioritized need. 
Beneficiaries are selected by RT. 
Decision 3 
–
R.T. Community Members 
R.T. Community Members must agree on beneficiary list and the fact that the members of the community 
with greatest need are prioritized to receive shelter assistance. 
 
For further details of the selection methods, please refer to Figure 3: Targeting Flowchart, and the Project 
Manual.  
 
In selecting their target villages, the Implementing Agency will work closely with the ERC and the DIY 
and Central Java provinces as well as respective 
kabupatens
 (sub-districts) to reduce overlaps.  The 
Project will not operate in villages targeted by the other housing initiative facilitated by the World Bank: 
the Urban Poverty Project (“UPP”), which is providing permanent housing to eligible families in 156 
villages in the Affected Areas. 
 
VIII. PROJECT TIMELINE 
 
The timeline for the entire Project is anticipated to be about 5.5 months (December 10, 2006 – May 30, 
2007).  Construction of structural elements (frame and roofs) of all 8,000 units will be completed by the 
end of April 2007 with the final four weeks used for finalization of field construction, certification and 
reporting.

IX. FINANCING 
AND 
DISBURSEMENT 
MECHANISMS 
 
The total requested funding is US$2.38 million, which includes the cost of project components for 8,000 
Roof Structure Kits (US$ 297 per unit).  This figure includes Operational Costs of US$180,148 (7.58% or 
US$22.52 per unit, Staff Costs of US$242,293 (10.2% or US$30.29 per unit), Goods and Materials Costs 
of US$1,667,998 (70.2% or US$208.50 per unit), and additional Overhead of US$155,439 (7% or US$ 19 
per unit) and an Unallocated Material Contingency Cost of $31,982 (1.35% or US$4 per unit).  For 
further breakdown of unit costs, please refer to the Annex 1: Project Costs. 
 
In order to overcome CHF liquidity for pre-financing, advance from grant is required.  For this purpose, 
CHF need to open a designated (special) account (SA) denominated in US$ in a commercial bank 
acceptable to the Bank.  The SA will be solely used to finance eligible project expenditures.  The ceiling 
of the advance to the SA is fixed at $0.8 million.  The payments to the SA will be considered as the 
advances to CHF, while reporting on uses of the advances should be submitted to the Bank monthly and 
any un-used advances must be refunded to the Bank by the end of the project. 
 
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
X. FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT 
 
27. 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘Substantial’.  These risks may arise from two factors: (i) the 
project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in the country.  In such an 
environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures is needed to ensure that the proceeds of the grant 
are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and efficiency; (ii) CHF should 
exercise careful financial control over the expenditures made at the field location in Yogyakarta, 
particularly over inventories of building materials purchased.  Further, as of the date of the assessment, 
CHF has not been granted a formal registration by the Government of Indonesia to operate in Indonesia, 
and is so far operating under a separate sub-agreement with USAID to carry out its activities
 
under their 
program.  Some operational risks may also arise as a result of this arrangement. 
 
28. 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  In addition to 
existing financial management procedures, CHF will strengthen payment validation procedures related to 
the project and special purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation on monthly basis, to 
facilitate monitoring.  The Jakarta office should arrange periodical physical verification of inventory at 
the project sites in Yogyakarta.  An independent financial audit will be requested upon completion of the 
operation, together with a review of internal controls over project implementation.  Prior to disbursement, 
CHF has to provide a legal opinion on its legal status to operate in Indonesia. 
 
29. 
A midterm review of project will be carried on or about February 15, 2007, to review the progress 
of the project and the projected demand for new roof structure kits.  Failure on the part of CHF to satisfy 
the Bank with the progress of the project or with prospects for its continued implementation, having 
regard to projected demand, will be treated as an additional event of suspension and may also result in the 
suspension of the balance of the grant. 
 
30. 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being Substantial.  This assessment 
has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the proposed financial management 
arrangements will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to 
Page  14
-

-
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the grant required by 
the Bank.  More details of the financial management assessment are given in the Annex 3.

XI. PROCUREMENT 
 
31. 
CHF will manage and coordinate the works, by hiring a number of locally pre-trained skilled 
labors and will employ its own staff to supervise the works. 
 
32. 
Procurement would consist of the purchase of construction materials.  For shopping of goods by 
comparing at least three quotations, CHF has adequate internal procurement and purchasing systems and 
procedures in place that can be followed for contract packages below US$ 200,000, subject to 
clarifications as stated in the Procurement Annex 4.  For contracts above US$ 200,000, ICB procedures 
will be followed.  A more detailed description on procurement is found in the Procurement Annex 4. 
 
XII. ANTI 
–
CORRUPTION  
 
33. 
As the anti corruption action plan on procurement, the implementation agency will disclose the 
following information in the 
www.chfinternational.org
:
(i) the prices of major construction items; (ii) the 
complaint database along with the report on the complaint resolution; and (iii) contract award notices, 
containing the information specified in para. 2.60 of the Procurement Guidelines, and names and 
addresses of beneficiaries.  This information will also be published on the Rekompak website.  Overall, 
the procurement risk is average. 
 
XIII SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS 
 
34. The Project will carry out on-site housing redevelopment for the affected families.  Field observations 
have shown that most water supply facilities, including wells, and sanitation facilities such as septic tanks 
are relatively intact.  Houses will be built on plots of land where ownership has been clearly established 
and verified with the landowners and neighbors.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that resettlement will 
take place in this Project.  In the event that a land dispute does arrive, it will be the responsibility of the 
community to settle it; although there is practically no chance of this happening after construction has 
begun due to the extensive socialization campaign undertaken by the Implementing Agency.  In fact, the 
Project should have positive social impacts for those involved in the process, since (i) the recipients of the 
Roof Structure Kits will be able to return to productive lives, (ii) community members (including 
construction workers, laborers, craftsmen, supervisors, truck drivers and administrative staff) will be 
provided temporary employment and gain practical professional skills, and (iii) volunteer university 
students will be better prepared for future employment through on-the-job training for construction and 
community liaison. 
 
35. 
The Project will use construction components consisting of a tarpaulin and tiles for the roof, 
bamboo sheeting for the walls, and bamboo poles for the framing, recycled tire rubber as fastening 
materials and cement, sand and nails to form the Shelter Kit.  The piles and roofing will be entirely made 
of bamboo.  By design, the houses will not use any timber.  Bamboo used for the Project is sourced from 
multiple local suppliers who in turn source their bamboo from both planted and naturally regenerating 
sources; thus, no environmental issues are expected from the demand that the Project will generate for 
this versatile material. 
 
36. 
Moreover, the Project will encourage the beneficiaries to use as much as possible salvaged 
materials from their previous houses, including bricks, doors, windows, and roof tiles.  Environmental 
problems could occur in the production facilities where the construction materials are processed into 
prefabricated shelter kits, that is, the disposal of waste cuttings from the bamboo piles and wall sheets.  
Page  16

The Project will monitor the use of these materials to ensure that they do not pose any environmental 
threat through improper disposal.

37. 
The Implementing Agency will oversee and provide technical guidance for the construction of the 
Roof Structures in cooperation with volunteer students from the Architecture Department of UGM and 
recruit pre-trained skilled construction workers.  The Roof Structures can be classified as semi-permanent 
housing with a life expectancy of at least three years, and can be incrementally expanded and improved to 
become permanent housing.  Close supervision and assistance to the workers and beneficiaries involved 
during the construction will be required to ensure that the earthquake-resistant design and techniques are 
adhered.  
 
XIV. AUDITING 
 
38. 
Special purpose project financial statement for expenditure under this Grant will be prepared by 
the Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the Yogyakarta office.  The 
financial reports will be subject to a financial audit by reputable auditor acceptable to IBRD.  A copy of 
the Project audited financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if any, 
will be submitted to IBRD no later than three months after the end of the project. 
 
39. 
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed by IBRD with the Recipient 
before negotiations.  The audit report will include an opinion on the reliability of the project financial 
statements. 
 
40. 
Technical/Performance Audit.  There will be a technical/performance audit carried out by an 
independent consultant team during the implementation of the Project and after the Project is closed.  The 
Terms of Reference will be agreed by IBRD with the Recipient prior to negotiations. 
 
Remedie
s
41. 
If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special account, or if 
expenditures are made from the Special Account without adequate supporting documentation to validate 
these, the Recipient will be obligated to refund the same to IBRD.  
 
42. 
IBRD will have the right to suspend disbursement of the funds if significant terms of the Grant 
agreements, including reporting requirements and deliverables, are not in compliance.  This will be

XV. BENEFITS AND RISKS 
 
43. 
The main benefits of the project are the direct benefits associated with providing sturdy Roof 
Structure that will be sufficient to house the family until a Permanent Structure is complete.  It is 
recognized that whilst there is an imperative to make best use of limited resources from national, 
international and private sources and move as quickly as possible to permanent reconstruction phases, 
there is currently a greater imperative to ensure that disaster-affected families receive adequate shelter as 
the monsoon season begins in November 2006 that will remain so until a Permanent House is constructed. 
 
44. 
A key benefit of a Roof Structure is that it does not reduce the resources available for 
subsequent construction of a Permanent Structure as all materials used for its construction will be reused 
when resources for the other components of the permanent house to be provided to a family.  Erection is 
also fast, and materials are cheap, readily available, and the bamboo structure is suitable to withstand 
future seismic events.

By following on from the already proven program of the Implementing Agency, the Program can 
reduce most operational and implementation risks.  However, there are still a number of risks such as 
natural disasters, the ability of the Implementing Agency to establish a central prefabrication facility and 
Page  19
-
13
-
increase its production capacity, and the possibility of overlap with the GoI program that should be 
anticipated.  The risks associated with natural disasters will be mitigated by the quality of the Roof 
Structure Kits distributed, and the technical assistance provided at the construction phase.  The possibility 
that the Implementing Agency will not be able to meet production targets is mitigated by the selection of 
an organization that is well established internationally, in other areas in Indonesia, and in the affected 
areas with proven programs.  To mitigate the possibility that the Project will overlap with the broader GoI 
response once they begin disbursement of funds, the project will work closely with the ERC’s 
Management Information Systems program monitoring all assistance being provided. 
 
46. 
Demand
.
It is assumed that the demand level for CHF roof structures will remain consistent with 
what has been thus far experienced.  Government policies as well as the pace of private reconstruction 
may have an impact on the willingness of beneficiaries to accept roof structures.  Should substantial 
changes occur, CHF will immediately inform and consult with the World Bank.  To mitigate the 
possibility that the Project will overlap with the broader GoI response once they begin disbursement of 
funds, the project will work closely with the ERC’s Management Information Systems program 
monitoring all assistance being provided. 
 
47. 
The uncertain outcome of CHF’s application for registration raises questions about its legal status 
in Indonesia as well as additional risks for the outcome of the proposed grant, which will be addressed as 
follows: First, it is envisaged that the grant agreement will be in the form of a tripartite agreement with 
the GOI (represented by the provincial governments) as the third party to the agreement.  The 
involvement of GOI would serve as an implicit recognition by GOI of the role of CHF in the activities 
supported under the grant.  Second, prior to first disbursement of the grant proceeds, CHF will be required 
to provide a satisfactory legal opinion of counsel acceptable to the Bank on its legal status to operate in 
Indonesia.  Third, the grant agreement will provide that rejection of CHF’s application for registration or 
revocation by GOI of its permit to operate in Indonesia, whether tacit or otherwise, will be treated as an 
event of suspension, triggering a suspension of further disbursements of the grant.  Finally, the grant 
agreement also provides for a mid-term review to be held after no more than half of the grant amount is 
disbursed, during which CHF’s performance will be assessed, thus in effect limiting considerably the 
Bank’s exposure in case of non-performance for whatever reason by CHF. 
 
XVI. PROJECT RESULTS 
 
48. 
Please refer to Annex 2: Results Framework. 
 
XVII. MONITORING AND REPORTING 
 
49. 
The Implementing Agency must provide fortnightly reports on the physical and financial progress 
of the report.  In addition, they must submit one final report after operational aspects of the Project have 
been completed, summarizing the findings of the follow-up surveys of the beneficiaries and, details of the 
procurement, pre-fabrication, distribution, and technical assistance stages of the project. For further 
details on reporting, please refer to Annex 2: Results Framework.  
 
50. 
The project will use their existing accounting system, which is documented in the manual for the 
Implementing Agency field office.  The accounting manual is acceptable.  All project transactions are 
included in its financial statement, so that risk of double counting with other donors can be reduced. 
 
51. 
In addition to the existing financial reporting requirements, the Implementing Agency will 
Page  20
-
14
-
produce financial reports, which consist of financial and physical progress information at the end of the 
project.  Some risks will arise from similar expenditures that are being funded by donors other than 
IBRD.  Separate account codes will be created to allow expenditure to be tracked for different field office 
and different donors.

ANNEX 3:  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
 
Financial Management Assessment 
Durable Shelter Construction in Earthquake-Affected Areas  
of Yogyakarta and Central Java Provinces  
 
A.  
Summary 
 
The project will be financed by the Java Recovery Fund for a period of five months.  The total budget 
estimate is USD 2.4 million, and this will finance the construction of durable shelters to earthquake-
affected communities in Yogyakarta and Central Java.  
 
The purpose of the project’s financial management assessment is to determine whether the financial 
management systems of the implementing agency, CHF International has the capacity to produce timely, 
relevant and reliable financial information on the project activities.  CHF is a non profit organization with 
headquarters in Washington DC, USA.  The financial management system in headquarters has not been 
assessed for this Grant. 
 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘Substantial’.  These risks may arise from two factors: (1) the 
project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in the country.  In such an 
environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures is needed to ensure that the proceeds of the grant 
are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and efficiency; (2) CHF should 
exercise careful financial control over the expenditures made at the field location in Yogyakarta, 
particularly over inventories of building materials purchased.  Further, as of the date of the assessment, 
CHF has not been granted a formal registration by the Government of Indonesia to operate in Indonesia, 
and is so far operating under a separate sub-agreement with USAID to carry out its activities
 
under their 
program. Some operational risks may also arise as a result of this arrangement. 
 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  In addition to 
existing financial management procedures, CHF will strengthen payment validation procedures related to 
the project and special purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation on monthly basis, to 
facilitate monitoring.  The Jakarta office should arrange periodical physical verification of inventory at 
the project sites in Yogyakarta.  An independent financial audit will be requested upon completion of the 
operation, together with a review of internal controls over project implementation.  Prior to disbursement, 
CHF has to provide a legal opinion on its legal status to operate in Indonesia.  
 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being Substantial.  This assessment has 
concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the proposed financial management 
arrangements will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to 
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the grant required by 
the Bank.  More details of the financial management assessment are given below.

B.  
Summary of Risks and Proposed Mitigating Arrangements 
 
The project’s overall risk assessment and summary of mitigating measures is as follows: 
 
Risks 
[High / Moderate / 
Low] 
Assessment 
Summary Comments & Risk Mitigation Measures. 
Conditionality 
A. Inherent Risks 
 
1. Country Level Risks 
Substantial 
This operation will not rely on the Govt. financial management 
systems. Fiduciary risks normally associated with use of 
Government FM systems will therefore not apply. But the wide 
prevalence of corruption in the country will impact the control 
environment to some degree. 
N
2. Entity specific risks 
Main operational risk 
may arise from 
inadequate legal 
authorization to operate 
in Indonesia 
Substantial 
CHF has considerable international experience in this assignment.  
Jakarta team is managed by a team of eight professional staff, 
including two qualified expatriate staff. Yogyakarta team has 30 
staff, including 3 staff in financial administration unit. Prior to 
disbursement, CHF has to provide a legal opinion on its legal status 
to operate in Indonesia.  
N
Implementing 
Entity Organization 
 
Substantial 
CHF is a non-profit organization. Income FY 05 was amounted 
around $130 million and mostly from donors such as USAID. Total 
expenditures amounted $128 million for FY 05. 
 
N, 
b. Entity Governance & 
Audit arrangements 
Moderate 
The audit of the International CHF 2005 financial statement was 
conducted by Gelman, Rosenberg & Fredman. The auditor expressed 
unqualified opinion for the last two years financial reports. KAP 
Johan Malonda is the auditor for the Indonesia operation. The auditor 
expressed unqualified opinion for the last two years.   
N
Overall Entity specific 
Risk 
Substantial 
B. Control Risks 
 
1. Budgeting 
Risk of unbudgeted 
project expenditures 
being incurred. 
 
Moderate 
Detailed budgets for proposed expenditure have been prepared and 
are under discussion with the task team. 
 
N
2. Internal Controls 
Risk of misuse of 
inventories 
Substantial 
The internal audit should include physical verification of inventory, 
comparison with the records and reporting of any difference. 
Financial and Administration Manager play a role as internal auditor 
for Yogyakarta operation, while the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) 
performs the internal audit function for the Jakarta Office. Physical 
verification of inventory, comparasion with the records and 
reporting, if any 
 
Y
3. Accounting 
Risk of unreliable 
accounting and 
reporting 
Substantial 
Accounting staff capacity in Jakarta and Yogyakarta is adequate. The 
Yogya office uses a simple spreadsheet for financial reports and 
forwards it to Jakarta to be entered in Quick Book. The Jakarta office 
will verify all expenditures from the Yogya office before entering to 
the Quick Book. Bank reconciliation takes place in the Jakarta office 
regularly. 
N
4. Flow of Fund 
Risk of funds not 
reaching targeted 
beneficiaries,
 
and risk 
of double counting with 
other similar activities 
of CHF. 
Moderate 
There should be clear definition of expenditures on the principal that 
all directly identified to this project will be reimbursed and 
organizational overhead may be reimbursed only in proportion to the 
total operations in Yogyakarta. 
Y
5. Audit arrangements 
Risk of poor quality 
audit 
Moderate 
Independent private audit firms will be hired and based on TOR 
acceptable to the Bank. The audit will be for financial transactions in 
Indonesia under this Grant. The audit report should be submitted to 
the Bank three months after the end of the project. 
Y

C.  
Project Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangement  
 
Based on the project design features and the risk analysis summarized above, the following arrangements 
are proposed for financial management and disbursements.  These include measures to mitigate risks 
identified above. 
 
Institutional and staffing arrangements
CHF International is US-based foundation incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, USA, and 
registered as Cooperative Housing Foundation.  It has since expanded its activities overseas with 
operations in some 30 countries around the world.  Under the Law on Foundations of Indonesia (Law No. 
16/2001), foreign foundations which are not registered in Indonesia can undertake their activities in 
Indonesia unless the activities of the foundations harm the Indonesian people, nation and country (see Art. 
69).  The same law also provides for the adoption of a detailed regulation on foreign foundations but no 
such regulation has been adopted to date.  Meanwhile CHF has applied to the Government for its formal 
registration as a foundation in Indonesia but its application is still pending and has yet to be approved. 
 
The Jakarta office has adequate financial management staff. Existing staff of the entity are located in 
Jakarta and Yogyakarta.  Jakarta has eight staff, including two expatriate staff and four staff in financial 
and administration unit.  There will be 30 staff in Yogyakarta, including three staff in the financial and 
administration unit.  
 
Accounting & Reporting
The Yogyakarta office only has authority to spend an operational budget less than $1000.  The 
Yogyakarta office will use a simple spreadsheet for reporting purposes.  The Yogyakarta office will 
forward all financial documents to Jakarta.  These documents will be entered to the Quick Book system in 
Jakarta. Activities will be supervised by the Jakarta office of CHF. 
 
The project will use their existing accounting system which is documented in the manual for CHF field 
office.  The accounting manual is acceptable.  All project transactions are included in its financial 
statement, so the risk of double counting with other donors can be reduced.  In addition to the existing 
financial report, CHF Jakarta will produce financial reports which consist of financial and physical 
progress information at the end of the project. 
 
Audit Arrangement
Special purposes project financial statement for expenditure under this grant would be prepared by the 
Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the Yogyakarta office.  The 
financial report will be subject to a financial audit by a reputable auditor acceptable to the Bank.  A copy 
of the project audited financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if 
any, will be submitted to the Bank no later than three months after the end of the project. 
 
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed by the Bank with the Recipient before 
negotiations.  The audit report will include an opinion on the reliability of the project financial statements. 
 
Disbursement Arrangement 
In order to overcome CHF liquidity for pre-financing, advance from grant is required.  For this purpose, 
CHF need to open a designated (special) account (SA) denominated in US$ in a commercial bank in 
Jakarta or Jogjakarta acceptable to the Bank.  The SA will be a segregated account solely used to finance 
eligible project expenditures.  The ceiling of the advance to the SA is fixed at $0.8 million.  The payments 
to the SA will be considered as the advances to CHF, while reporting on uses of the advances should be 
Page  28
-
22
-
submitted to the Bank monthly and any un-used advances must be refunded to the Bank by the end of the 
project. 
 
Reporting the use of the SA funds would be consisting of: 
 
·
Statement of Expenditures (SOE) showing details of expenditures and classified under: 
(a) consultants/staff cost, 
(b) goods and materials, 
(c) labour, and 
(d) operational costs and overhead.

ANNEX 4:  PROCUREMENT  
 
A. General  
 
Procurement for the proposed proje
ct would be carried out in accordance with IBRD’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004; and “Guidelines:  Selection and 
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in 
the Grant Agreement.  The general description of various items under different expenditure category is 
described below.  For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or 
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, 
and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and IBRD project team in the Procurement Plan.  Due to 
the nature of the project, i.e. the purchase of basic material on demand basis, the Procurement Plan is still 
not developed at this stage but will be prior to launching any procurement activities and will be updated 
on an ongoing basis. 
 
Procurement of Works
:
N/A 
 
Procurement of Goods
:
Goods procured under this project would include: the purchase of construction 
materials, including core materials, roof tiles, prefabricated materials, and the related services (such as: 
the transportation and the distribution of materials, including field testing).  CHF has a network of 
established vendors it has established through advertising all opportunities ad public tenders in local 
newspapers.  Depending on existing production capacity, other vendors can immediately be added to the 
existing firms to supply the necessary volume.  Construction materials will be purchased on batches, with 
an estimate of no more than US$200,000 per package.  For contracts below US$200,000, the procurement 
will be done following Shopping procedures acceptable to IBRD, by comparing at least three quotations 
from reputable suppliers, using the Recipient’s standard documents amended to be acceptable to IBRD.  
The list of the reputable suppliers can be drawn from the existing database currently held by CHF or 
expanded if necessary.  Although it is not anticipated yet, however, if necessary, procurement above 
US$200,000 will follow ICB procedures, using IBRD’s standard ICB documents. 
 
Selection of Consultants
:
An auditing firm will be recruited under the project to carry external audit.  The 
estimated value of this contract is US$10,000 and will be selected based on Consultant’s Qualifications 
(CQS).  
 
B. Assessment 
of the Agency’s Capacity to Implement Procurement 
 
Procurement activities will be carried out by CHF International (CHF).  Purchase of material is directly 
done by CHF.  For this purpose CHF employs dedicated Finance and Admin (F&A) Manager, and 
assistant as well as Procurement/Logistics experts. CHF has documented procurement procedures and 
uses standardized formats for the bidding process. 
 
The assessment of CHF’s capacity concluded that CHF has the capacity to carry out procurement, with 
existing internal procurement procedures as follows: 
 
1. 
Up to US$250 – shall be approved by Project Director and F&A Manager without calling quotation. 
2. 
Between US$251 and US$5,000 purchase committee (Country Director, Director F&A, and Program 
Director) shall approve after calling for quotations (at least 3 quotations). 
3. 
Over US$5,000 shall be made after calling sealed bids and are subject to prior approval of the 
Country Director, Director F & A, and Program Director. 
 
Page  31
-
25
-
There is also a provision in CHF’s internal procedures requiring CHF to fully comply with the donor’s 
procurement procedures and requirements for projects financed by donors. 
 
CHF’s shopping procedures may be followed for this project subject to the following 
clarifications/provisions: 
 
·
Shopping will be carried by comparing at least three quotations selected from the pool of 
registered suppliers maintained by CHF.  The term “registered suppliers” shall not be 
limited to ones currently listed in CHF’s vendor system.  If necessary, CHF should expand 
the list of firms invited to submit quotations in order to expand the pool of qualified 
potential suppliers. 
·
Award of contract shall be made to the lowest-priced, substantially technically responsive 
quotation, and the merit point system currently used by CHF is not acceptable under this 
project.  
·
Quotations will be submitted using a one-envelope system. 
·
No negotiation of contracts is allowed. 
·
Successful bidder will be required to submit a performance security in the form of bank 
guarantee from a reputable bank amounting to 10% of contract price.  Successful bidder 
should submit an advance payment guarantee with the same amount should an advance 
payment be requested. 
 
As the anti corruption action plan on procurement, CHF will disclose the following information on their 
program reporting system (PRS) net base server: 
 
1. 
the prices of major construction items; 
2. 
the complaint database along with the report on the complaint resolution; and 
3. 
contract award notices, containing the information specified in para. 2.60 of the Procurement 
Guidelines. 
 
In addition, the names and addresses of the beneficiaries will also be put in the www.chfinternational.org 
and ReKompak websites.  The overall project risk for procurement is 
AVERAGE
.
C. Procurement Plan 
 
There is no specific procurement developed for this Project at this point, since the purchase of materials 
will be made on an on-going basis, following the progress of construction works.  A procurement plan 
will be developed prior to launching any procurement activity under the project and will be updated 
continuously. 
 
D.  Frequency of Procurement Supervision 
 
IBRD will conduct prior review to the first two procurement packages following shopping procedures 
under this project in addition to any ICB if this method is used.  The selection of the auditor will also be 
subject to the Bank’s prior review due to the Recipient’s lack of familiarity with the Bank procurement 
procedures for the selection of Consultants.

ANNEX 5:  TECHNICAL ANNEX 
 
Technical Annex to MOP 
on Yogyakarta and Central Java Earthquake Roof Structure Kit Project 
 
A.  
Background and Strategy 
 
In the morning of May 27, 2006, an earthquake struck the region a
long the central section of Java’s south 
coast.  The areas most severely affected by this earthquake were those south and east of Yogyakarta City, 
i.e. Kabupaten (District) Bantul (located in Yogyakarta Special Region, 
Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta
 – 
“DIY”) and Kabupaten Klaten (located in Central Java Province).  Most of the loss of life and most of the 
material damage was observed in these two districts.  Considerable damage and some loss of life were 
also recorded in the other districts of DIY. 
 
The Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment Report (“PDLAR”) by GoI, World Bank, and ADB 
estimates the total amount of damage and losses caused by the earthquake at IDR29.1 trillion (approx. 
US$3.1 billion) of which IDR15.3 trillion (approx. US$1.7 billion) were in the housing sector.  This is 
more than damage and losses caused in the housing sector by the Aceh disaster (IDR 13.4 trillion). 
 
Under the leadership of the UN, an inter-agency group known as the ERC was established to support GoI 
in dealing with the needs for immediate assistance. 
 
Various damage assessments state the number of houses destroyed or severely damaged between 306,412 
(ERC) and 358,693 (PDLAR).  Assuming an average household size of 4.3 persons, this means that 
between 1.32 and 1.54 million people may have been rendered homeless by the earthquake. 
 
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, government agencies and – in response to the GoI request 
for housing assistance – local and international stakeholders distributed emergency shelter materials (e.g. 
tarpaulins, tents, mattresses, blankets and other emergency shelter items) to the earthquake affected 
people.  With the completion of these efforts, close to 100% of the needs for emergency shelter has now 
been covered. 
 
Assessments recently conducted by the key members of the ERC show a minimum need of 102,300 Roof 
Structures.  Up to mid-October 2006, overall commitments from various agencies providing durable 
shelter assistance amount to 55,000 units, leaving a gap of approx. 47,300 units.  The scope of assistance 
for the first 55,000 units varies from prefabricated bamboo structures to cash vouchers and the 
distribution of building materials and tools. 
 
Again, under the leadership of the UN, another inter-agency group was established (Shelter Cluster Group 
–
“SCG”) to coordinate and oversee shelter provision in the disaster Affected Areas, in support of the 
efforts of GoI and other parties (individuals, civil society, NGOs, etc.). 
 
To deal with the medium term needs of disaster relief and rehabilitation in the sectors: housing, 
infrastructure, restoration of livelihoods, and others, various donors and international organizations have 
jointly established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund called Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) in October 2006. 
 
B.  
IBRD Response and Strategy 
 
IBRD’s response to the disaster included immediate communication with the Executing Agency for the 
Urban Poverty Project III, with the objective of re-allocating undisbursed project funds amounting to 
Page  33
-
27
-
US$20 million to housing reconstruction in the disaster area.  IBRD is also in the process of re-assessing 
its lending program to Indonesia and the macro-economic dialogue, and it is discussing the use of a 
project preparation facility or trust funds. 
 
The objective of this Project is to complement efforts by GoI, the SCG, and civil society in providing a 
safe and appropriate shelter to all households that have become homeless as a result of the disaster and 
have not otherwise been provided with transitional or permanent shelter.  To this end, the Project shall 
provide Roof Structure Kits to an estimated number of 8,000 eligible households.  These kits shall be 
provided by CHF International (CHF). 
 
The main outcome of the project is the provision of 8,000 durable Roof Structure Kits that will be 
prefabricated at the CHF production facility, delivered through CHF logistics support system to 
households whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged, and assembled on site. 
 
The rationale of the Project is that the vast majority of the emergency shelters provided so far is only a 
short-term solution and will not provide adequate shelter to cover transitional needs throughout the 2-3 
years that will probably be required for reconstruction.  In the meantime, some families may have the 
resources to recover on their own, and others may receive assistance from government, civil society or the 
humanitarian communities.  Even so, poverty and insufficient resources create the need for additional 
efforts to provide Roof Structure.  
 
The lack of adequate housing also impacts the capacity of people to resume their livelihoods.  A large 
percentage of the affected population is engaged in small home based industries and will not be able to 
resume their previous economic activities in the absence of more durable shelter.  Finally, the lack of 
adequate housing causes severe health problems, which are expected to become much more during the 
forthcoming rainy season (November through March). 
 
The rationale for entrusting CHF with the implementation of the Project is that CHF is currently, 
independently from the project and in cooperation with the international community and local partners, 
completing a large scale Roof Structure construction program that is consistent with ERC’s Strategic 
Framework.  Selection, prefabrication and distribution, Shelter Kits, tools and awareness raising materials 
is complete, and all field erection and monitoring should be completed by the end of November 2006.  
CHF has also established a joint program for the provision of technical assistance in the field with a 
consortium of local universities and NGOs.  It plans to provide Roof Structures to more than 5,120 
households by the November 2006 under this currently ongoing program.  The Project is to build upon 
CHF’s experience, project implementation facilities, organizational capacities, and human resources. 
 
C.  
Detailed Project Description 
 
The Project shall help close the remaining gap of needs for Roof Structure, as required during the ongoing 
efforts to construct a sufficient number of permanent houses for all households that have become 
homeless as a result of the disaster. 
 
The Project shall provide an estimated 8,000 additional eligible households with “Roof Structure Kits” 
that consist of simple frames made from bamboo, walls made from bamboo weaving, and roof trusses 
made from bamboo, to be covered with tarpaulins and clay roof tiles
.
These Roof Structure Kits shall, for maximum efficiency and speed, be pre-fabricated at one centralized 
facility, then transported to the various community sites, and assembled there by the beneficiaries and 
communities themselves, with the necessary technical assistance provided by the Project. 
 
The Roof Structure design used by CHF uses only high quality bamboo for a number of reasons: 
 
·
Erection is fast and materials are easily available in Indonesia and thus this method fulfills 
Page  34
-
28
-
fast track construction needs. 
·
Materials are traditionally used in Javanese culture. 
·
Adequate bamboo construction is suitable to withstand earthquake resistance or movements.  
·
Will last a minimum of three years, and longer with periodic maintenance (painting, anti 
termite spraying, etc.). 
 
Roof structures will be built to seismic resistant standards, and can handle the weight of a tile roof. 
 
The prefabrication facility has yet to be set up, although it is planned to have five production lines, 
operated in one shift daily, producing approximately 110 units per day or 660 units per week (assuming a 
6-day work week). 
 
The duration of the project shall be five months with an anticipated completion date of April 6, 2007 
(assuming a start date of November 17, 2006).  Construction of structural elements (frames and roofs) of 
all 8,000 kits shall be completed before February 28, 2007.  The final six weeks of the project shall be 
used for finalization of field construction, certification and reporting. 
 
CHF will establish a central warehouse and prefabrication facility for the production of Roof Structure 
Kits under the JRF program.  This warehouse and workshop facility optimizes procurement, speed up the 
production process, and ensure that quality control standards are met.  The quality of incoming raw 
materials to the warehouse is checked by dedicated quality control officers ‘at the gate’ of the production 
site, while another team controls the quality of the outgoing kits.  The central warehouse and 
prefabrication center is located in Jetis, Bantul district. 
 
The primary project beneficiaries will be 8,000 vulnerable households in immediate need of durable 
shelter solutions; with an average household size of four, this equals approximately 32,000 earthquake 
victims.  Aside from this, the Project will also benefit the construction sector through the direct 
employment of workers at the production facility and in the field, work experience for UGM volunteers, 
as well as through the reactivation of local labor and businesses active in the production or the provision 
of construction-related materials or services, e.g. artisans, roof tile producers, daily laborers, 
gedhek
 
(bamboo wall) producers, etc. 
 
Community Outreach Staff of CHF will undertake selection of end-users/beneficiaries according 
to the following procedures: 
 
1. Site 
identification
:
Using the SCG database, Outreach staff will identify those locations with 
heavy and total damage that do not receive any assistance from other organizations.  This 
information will be reviewed and crosschecked with various other sources including local 
government.  CHF aims for full coverage in each targeted village.  Once an area is selected, 
Outreach staff meets with the community leaders (RTs) to introduce the program. 
2. 
Beneficiaries List and Awareness
:
In consultation with the RT heads, CHF will establish a list of 
eligible households’ prioritized order of vulnerability.  Potential beneficiaries will then be 
surveyed by a team of student volunteers under the supervision and guidance of CHF Volunteer 
Coordinators and Outreach Staff to verify eligibility for assistance.  Volunteers also carry out 
detailed community mapping documenting the damage sustained by each household.  Following 
the volunteer assessment, the RT beneficiary list is vetted with the entire community through a 
community-wide meeting. 
3. Ex-post 
Distribution/Monitoring
:
After delivery of the Shelter Kits, CHF volunteers are in the 
communities daily to provide technical support to volunteer construction crews from the villages 
and beneficiaries’ households.  Additionally CHF technical staff will conduct a technical audit of 
approximately 30% of beneficiaries to verify structural quality.  CHF will also conduct household 
level audits to evaluate beneficiary satisfaction. 
 
Page  35

-
The proposed methodology builds on CHF
’s lessons learned during the start-up of its durable Roof 
Structure program and deals with on-the-ground realities, namely: 
 
·
The current capacity of the work force mobilized from the community is insufficient to 
erect shelters at the pace required to meet the needs for durable shelter.  Some 
communities are already facing “burn out” when dealing with the demands of 
reconstruction, combined with the necessity to earn income and tend to the fields and 
animals.  Reconstruction is often taking place between 8:00 pm and midnight, weekends 
included. 
·
Initial housing designs were labor intensive and time consuming to erect on site.  
Manpower limitations require a simple and less labor intensive approach to field 
construction without sacrificing the self-help aspects of the project. 
·
It is expected that during the monsoon season, productivity will be reduced by 50% or 
more, thus impacting productivity levels and necessitating centralized prefabrication. 
·
Quality control of the frame is essential when placing heavy roof tiles on lightweight 
bamboo structures.  Furthermore, many of the village construction teams do not have the 
construction expertise and understanding to consistently produce adequately braced and 
structurally secure shelters capable of supporting heavier roof loads. 
·
Unreliability of suppliers with regards to the quality and quantity of materials distributed 
directly to the villages. 
 
Based on these lessons learnt from the early reconstruction phase, it appears that the prefabrication of 
Roof Structure Kits is the best way to address the majority of challenges described above.  The 
prefabrication strategy has been field tested by CHF and is producing the desired outcomes of fast 
construction coupled with sound management. 
 
D.  
Institutional Arrangements and Project Implementation 
 
The implementing agency for the Project shall be CHF.  CHF will be responsible for day-to-day 
management, including procurement of materials, operation of the prefabrication site, distribution of Roof 
Structure Kits, provision of technical assistance for assembly on site, logistics, and all other operational 
details of the Project, in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures.  CHF will report on its activities 
and their outcomes to IBRD. 
 
IBRD will be entitled to conduct, at its discretion, the technical, financial, social, and environmental 
audits as considered necessary. 
 
Given the experience and demonstrated capacities of CHF, the provision of additional technical assistance 
is not required. 
 
E. Action 
Plan 
 
The following work phases for shelter prefabrication and construction are planned: 
 
Step 1:  Standard Design (Completed) 
 
CHF’s current 3x6 m design for Roof Structure Kit includes clay roof tiles to increase the longevity of the 
roof and provides better perimeter water protection with a 30cm high masonry wall and elevated floor.  
CHF’s design is appropriate for habitation for at least three years. 
 
CHF shelter design has been broken down into shop-built components or pieces that can be shipped to the 
village level in the form of a kit that reduces construction time in the field by at least fifty percent and 
virtually guarantees structural integrity of the finished shelter. 
Page  36
-
30
-
Step 2:  Bill of Quantity/Costing (Completed) 
 
A
budget has been prepared for the standard Roof Structure Kit.  The total cost for a standard Roof 
Structure Kit is based on existing unit prices and currently stands at US$297 including prefabrication, 
transport and distribution, office, staff and central CHF overhead costs.  For a detailed budget, please 
refer to Annex I: Project Costs.
 
Step 3: Set-up of the Production Facility  
 
CHF has leased a production facility in Jetis, Bantul, and is currently preparing the facility for operation.  
This secure site is ideal to store a large quantity of incoming, outgoing material and provides sufficient 
room for loading and unloading trucks.  Moreover, the facility has a reliable power supply.  
 
The production lines are based on a simple design requiring little capital investment.  Power equipment 
has already been procured and includes circular power saws, electric drills, and a backup generator in the 
event of power failure.  CHF subcontracts 5 prefabrication teams consisting of fifteen local laborers and 
carpenters, who will in total, produce approximately 110 units per shift.  In addition to these teams, CHF 
employs 100 laborers to handle sorting of bamboo, loading of trucks, dispatching Roof Structure Kits and 
so on. 
 
Notably, the production facility allows for strict quality control procedures, vis-
à-vis incoming materials 
and outgoing prefabricated units.  Contractors are paid according to their performance against targets and 
quality control standards and specifications.  
 
Step 4: Procurement of Materials 
 
CHF has a network of established vendors and has advertised public tenders in local newspapers.  Many 
of the existing vendors have the opportunity to supply the production center.  Depending on existing 
capacity, other vendors can immediately be added to the existing firms to supply the necessary volume, in 
close coordination with various procurement officers of other agencies that are involved in Roof Structure 
construction. 
 
Step 5:  Kit Fabrication on a Piece Work Basis 
 
CHF will produce, for each Roof Structure Kit, three main types of prefabricated components that are (a) 
the most labor intensive, and (b) crucial to the structural integrity of the building.  These are:  
·
4
wall components, 
·
4
roof trusses, 
·
8
columns, and 
·
7
roof purloins. 
 
In addition, roofing elements (the frame that holds the roof tiles) will be precut to facilitate transportation 
of materials and improve on-site construction efficiency. 
 
The fabrication of the Roof Structure Kit is organized in different shifts consisting of foremen/ 
supervisors and local skilled woodworkers.  Workers are specialized along the different aspects of the 
production to optimize speed and quality of construction. 
 
Page  37
-
31
-
Step 6:  Kit Distribution 
 
The prefabricated elements will be combined with a tarpaulin for the roof, bamboo sheeting for the walls, 
fastening materials, sand and cement to form a Roof Structure Kit.  CHF will rely on the beneficiaries’ 
ability to either salvage or purchase sufficient roof tiles to form the roof of their Roof Structure.  Roof 
Structure Kits will be disbursed from the Distribution Center to beneficiaries, as identified by the 
provincial governors and CHF.  CHF will also coordinate the distribution of toolkits prior to Roof 
Structure Kit distribution with one toolkit for 10 families.  These toolkits include tools for clearing sites, 
preparing the site to receive the Roof Structure.  Thus far, the vast majority of recipients of CHF Roof 
Structure Kits had existing slabs or sites suitable for use in close proximity to the original house site.  
Repair of the foundation for the Permanent House will be the responsibility of the organization (most 
likely to be the Provincial Governments) providing the permanent reconstruction aid.  In addition, CHF 
will continue to distribute awareness raising materials and safe building manuals, which will complement 
the technical assistance provided by CHF volunteers. 
 
CHF will conduct these logistical operations with efficiency, while ensuring accountability to the end-
user level.  CHF will also use its existing partnerships with numerous local NGOs, currently active in the 
distribution and construction process to assist in the distribution and assembly of Roof Structure Kits. 
Discussions are ongoing with the relevant NGOs as well as with the SCG Coordinator to incorporate their 
capacity and expertise in the CHF program. 
 
Step 7:  Construction 
 
In the field, CHF will oversee and provide technical guidance for the construction of shelters, in       
cooperation with volunteer students from local universities, including the Department of Architecture of 
the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and recruited skilled construction workers (one skilled carpenter for 
each team of community 
gotong royong
 labor) who are pre-trained.  Finally, Roof Structure Kits include a 
Construction Manual, to serve as a reference during the construction process, as well as one skilled 
carpenter to assist in construction. 
 
Once installed with roof tiles and recycled brick floors, the Roof Structure Kit can be classified as semi-
permanent shelters with a life expectancy of at least three years.  Beneficiaries may install salvaged doors 
and windows from their damaged houses to enhance the condition of the durable structures. 
 
Correctly positioned in the center of an existing slab, the 18m
2
structure will allow the incremental 
construction of a permanent shelter around the Roof Structure Kit.  Beneficiaries can live a dignified 
existence while they proceed with permanent reconstruction efforts, which may take several years.

TARGETING PROCESS 
 
The selection process of beneficiaries, as description of the figure 3, is as follow: 
 
1. 
Coordinate with local government to identify list of communities according to assessment data and 
criteria established by government. 
 
2. 
Collect data about the community according to CHF/USAID/OFDA criteria: 
 
(a)  Level of damage, 
(b) Poverty level, 
(c)  Willingness to work with CHF to build their shelters, 
(d) Located within cluster of communities to facilitate more effective assistance and 
coordination. 
 
3.  Select community from data and organize meeting to determine if community is interested in 
participating with CHF TSP. 
 
4. 
Carry out general meeting with community (RT) to describe TSP and criteria. Information provided: 
 
(a)  What is CHF 
–
USAID funding source, 
(b)  Assistance with materials and technical support, 
(c)  Agreement for community to use self-help labor to construct shelters, 
(d)  How salvageable materials can be used, 
(e)  Example of shelter built in Kerten (photos), 
(f) Policy of community responsibility for materials delivered – lay down site, security, 
fabrication site for trusses, 
(g) Responsibility of community to ensure that if 10 shelter kits are delivered, 10 shelters are 
constructed of those materials.  (If maximum number of family members exceeds multiples 
of
7,
then additional shelters will be allocated to that family). 
 
5. 
Community decides if they want to participate with CHF.  If yes, RT provides list of beneficiaries to 
Outreach Specialist.  Criteria for beneficiaries: 
 
(a) Vulnerable members of community: widows and widowers, elderly, ill or injured in 
earthquake, single heads of household, 
(b)  Persons who are lower income and unable to provide shelter for themselves, 
(c)  Willing to participate in 
gotong royong
 to construct shelter, 
(d)  Willing to assist other beneficiaries, if able, with 
gotong royong
 to construct shelters, 
(e)  Not receiving shelter assistance from another agency or entity. 
 
6. 
Outreach Specialist brings beneficiary list to Yogya office for discussion with Senior CHF Staff to 
ensure that criteria are met. 
 
7. 
R.T. meets with entire community to show beneficiary list and gain agreement. 
 
8. 
Memo of Understanding (MOU) is signed by RT and CHF.

9. 
Community list of beneficiaries is provided to Government by Outreach Specialist so that 
Government knows where CHF is working and can coordinate with other NGOs and agencies 
who are working on shelter programs.
