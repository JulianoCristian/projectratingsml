Project development objective
:
Ref. PAD IV, Technical Annex 5 
 
The objective of the Yogyakarta and Central Java Earthquake Roof Structure Project is to respond to the most 
basic needs of the households affected by the earthquake through the provision of roof structures that transition to 
permanent housing. 
 
Page  6
Project description  
Ref. PAD V, Technical Annex 5.C 
The project shall help close the remaining gap of needs for Roof Structure, as required during the ongoing efforts 
to construct a sufficient number of permanent houses for all households that have become homeless as a result of 
the disaster.  The project shall provide an estimated 16,000 additional eligible households with 
“Roof Structure 
Kits”. 
The project has four components: 
 
(i)
 
Preparation of Roof Structure Kits
.
This component involves prefabrication of the most labor intensive and 
structurally crucial elements of the building, including: wall components and bracing, roof frames, and 
connecting beams.  Roofing elements (the frame that holds tiles) will be precut to facilitate transportation of 
materials and improve on-site construction efficiency.  The Kit Fabrication is organized in different shifts 
consisting of foremen/supervisors and local skilled woodworkers.  Workers are specialized along the different 
aspects of the production to optimized speed and quality of construction. 
 
(ii)
 
Targeting and Distribution of Kits to Beneficiaries
.
The Implementing Agency will undertake selection of 
end-users/beneficiaries according to the following procedures:  (a) Site identification
:
using the SCG database, 
CAT (Community Assessment Team) will identify those locations with heavy and total damage that do not 
receive any assistance from other organizations.  This information will be reviewed and crosschecked with 
various other sources. IOM aims for full coverage in each targeted village. Once an area is selected, CAT carries 
out a Rapid Assessment Plan; (b) Beneficiaries list and awareness
:
in consultation with the Kepala Desa (village 
head) and the community, IOM will establish a list of eligible households based on data on level of damage and 
number of household members, disaggregated to Dusun and RT (Rukun Tetangga) levels. Potential beneficiaries 
will then be surveyed by a team of student volunteers under the supervision and guidance of IOM Field 
Assistants.  The checklist coming from the field will be included in IOM database, and a verified list will be 
produced for final decision and site inspection.  After the selection of village and beneficiaries is completed, a 
community meeting will be convened and conducted for the socialization of the Project as well as safe 
construction awareness.  A mapping of local warehouses and mock-up locations will be produced together with 
the final beneficiary list and handed over to the distribution unit of IOM; 
 
(c) Ex-post distribution/monitoring
:
After the distribution has been completed, the community liaison staff will 
conduct additional meetings and follow-up with the certified (construction) beneficiaries to evaluate their 
satisfaction. 
 
(iii)
 
Assistance to Beneficiaries during Construction
.
The implementing Agency already has existing contracts 
with service providers in all fields of distribution including trucking, loading, dispatch, transit, logistic 
management and so on. In the field, the Implementing Agency will oversee and provide technical guidance for 
the Construction of Roof Structure, in cooperation with volunteer students from local universities, including the 
Department of Architecture of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and recruited skilled construction workers 
who are pre-trained. A mock-up Roof Structure will also be erected on-site, in presence of the community.  It will 
be done at the sub-village level and may cover several communities benefiting from the action for geographically 
close sub-villages.  Finally, Roof Structure Kits include a construction manual, to serve as a reference during the 
construction process. The implementing Agency will also continue to distribute awareness raising material and 
safe building manuals, which will complement the assistance provided by technical volunteers. 
 
(iv)
 
Quality Control and Reporting
.
The Implementing Agency has a quality control system for the input and the 
output.  The tracking procedures cover incoming material, production, field distribution, end-user tracking and 
community handover of the structure kits, quality control during the construction and certification upon 
completion of the construction.

TECHNICAL REPORT 
 
I.  
BACKGROUND 
 
1. 
On May 27, 2006, an earthquake registering 6.3 on the Richter scale damaged surrounding areas 
of Yogyakarta and Central Java (the “Affected Areas”).  A significant number of houses were destroyed or 
damaged by the earthquake; societal coping mechanisms have also been severely disrupted, with 
widespread trauma and the means of earning a living buried in the rubble.  The scale of the disaster is 
much greater than first thought, owing to a traditional building culture that was complacent about 
earthquake risk.  Masonry walls made of burnt bricks connected with weak mortar – a reality exacerbated 
by unwitting negligence and poverty – were no match for the strong earthquake.  In addition, a lack of 
adequate anchoring, poor workmanship, and minimal compliance with building codes, all contributed to 
the extent of the damage. 
 
2. 
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, in response to the GoI request for housing 
assistance and in cooperation with government, local and international stakeholders, various 
organizations, individuals and community groups distributed emergency shelter materials (e.g. tarpaulins, 
mattresses, blankets and other emergency-shelter non-food items).  Whilst close to 100% of the needs for 
immediate emergency shelter have now been covered, emergency tents and tarpaulins are only a short-
term solution and will not provide adequate shelter to cover transitional needs through the two to three 
years required for preliminary reconstruction.  Many families are likely to wait much longer for the 
completion of permanent housing built to earthquake-resistant standards (“Permanent Houses”).  In the 
meantime, although some families may have the resources to recover on their own and others may receive 
assistance from government, civil society or the humanitarian community, poverty and insufficient 
resources highlight the need for transitional shelter support.  The lack of adequate housing also impacts 
the capacity of people to resume their livelihoods.  A large percentage of the affected population is 
engaged in small home-based industries.  Hence, in the absence of more durable shelter, these 
communities will not be able to resume their previous economic activities.  Finally, the lack of adequate 
housing causes severe health problems, which are expected to expand during the rainy season. 
 
3. 
GoI is presently focusing all available resources on providing Permanent Houses to affected 
households, while the NGOs working under the coordination of the United Nations Early Recovery 
Cluster (“ERC”) are focusing on meeting immediate needs for housing in the form of “Roof Structures”.  
A
typical Roof Structure is a wind and weather-proof bamboo structure with a tile roof, assembled on the 
existing concrete foundation of the original collapsed house, and is considered durable in that it is built to 
last for a minimum of two years while Permanent Houses are being constructed.  All Roof Structures 
should be built to SPHERE standards (For further detail on Roof Structures, refer to Annex 5: Technical 
Annex).  Some key features of Roof Structures are that:  (i) they do not endanger a family’s entitlement 
for permanent housing assistance under the broader GoI shelter response to the disaster; (ii) almost all 
components used in the construction can be reused in the construction of the Permanent House (see 
Section XV: Benefits and Risks); and (iii) no permits or authorizations are required for construction. 
 
II.  
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF DAMAGE AND RESPONSE 
TO DATE 
 
4. 
The Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment Report (“PDLAR”) completed in June 2006 
Page  8
2
showed that over 300,000 homes were either totally destroyed or heavily damaged; with an average family 
size of 4.3, approximately 1.3 million people were rendered homeless by the earthquake. 
 
5. 
Assessments recently conducted by the key members of the ERC show a need of approximately 
93,000 Roof Structures, that is, 93,000 families are living with other families, are in shelters with a roof 
height below two meters, or are in shelters that will not provide sufficient shelter from the rainy season.  
To date, overall commitments from various agencies providing Roof Structures amount to 50,000 
–
showing a gap of approximately 47,300 shelters (including a 10% contingency). 
 
III.  
PROJECT RATIONALE 
 
6. 
The GoI has released its Action Plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction for the Affected Areas 
and has committed US$270 million in 2006-2007 to reconstruct Permanent Houses.  One of the objectives 
of the multidonor Java Reconstruction Fund is to respond to the basic needs of the households affected by 
the Earthquake, notably in terms of housing. 
 
7. 
Whilst GoI has just begun distributing the first phases of cash grants to start the process of 
permanent reconstruction, this resource cannot be mobilized in time to mitigate the potentially devastating 
effects of the rainy season upon settlement conditions in the Affected Areas.  The Provincial Governments 
of Yogyakarta and Central Java together with the Early Recovery Cluster (ERC) have developed a joint 
and complementary strategy aimed at accelerating the process of reconstruction to address the need for 
housing, whilst adhering to the plan for permanent housing reconstruction established by the Government 
of Indonesia. 
 
IV.  
PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
 
8. 
The objective of this Project is to respond to the most basic needs of the households affected by 
the earthquake through the provision of roof structures that transition to permanent housing.  The Project 
will provide eligible families in targeted villages in the affected areas with safe and durable housing 
through the provision of roof structures while permanent house is being rebuilt.  The Project provides the 
eligible beneficiaries an 18 m2 of roof-structure house constructed with bamboo columns and roof trusses 
and bamboo sheets for the walls with clay roof tiles.  Most of the materials of the roof structures can be 
reused in building a permanent house. 
 
V.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
9. 
To achieve the objective set out above, the Project will augment and increase capacity of the pre-
existing program of the Implementing Agency.  The program has four components: (i) preparation of Roof 
Structure Kits, (ii) targeting and distribution of kits to beneficiaries, (iii) assistance to beneficiaries during 
construction, and (iv) quality control and reporting. 
 
10. 
Preparation of Roof Structure Kits involves prefabrication of the most labor intensive and 
structurally crucial elements of the building including: wall components and bracing, roof frames, and 
connecting beams, Roofing elements (the frame that holds tiles) will be precut to facilitate transportation 
of materials and improve on-site construction efficiency.

11. 
The kit fabrication is organized in different shifts consisting of foremen/supervisors and local 
skilled woodworkers.  Workers are specialized along the different aspects of the production to optimize 
speed and quality of construction. 
 
12. 
The Implementing Agency will coordinate closely with the ERC’s MIS program, and identify 
locations that do not receive any assistance from other organizations.  The Project aims for full coverage 
in each targeted sub-village.  In consultation with the community leaders, and the community itself, the 
Implementing Agency will establish a list of eligible households based on the level of damage, and 
number of inhabitants.  Student volunteers, under the supervision and guidance of Implementing Agency 
Field Assistants, will then survey potential beneficiaries.  After a final list of beneficiaries is complete, a 
community meeting is conducted to socialize the Program. 
 
13. 
The Implementing Agency already has existing contracts with service providers in all fields of 
distribution including trucking, loading, dispatch, transit, logistics management, and so on. 
 
14. 
In the field, the Implementing Agency will oversee and provide technical guidance for the 
construction of Roof Structure, in cooperation with volunteer students from local universities, including 
the Department of Architecture of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and recruited skilled construction 
workers who are pre-trained.  A mock-up Roof Structure will also be erected on-site, in presence of the 
community.  It will be done at the sub-village level and may cover several communities benefiting from 
the action for geographically close sub-villages.  Finally, Roof Structure Kits include a construction 
manual, to serve as a reference during the construction process. 
 
15. 
The Implementing Agency will also continue to distribute awareness raising material and safe 
building manuals, which will complement the assistance provided by technical volunteers. 
 
16. 
(For a more detailed project description, please refer to Annex 5: Technical Annex). 
 
VI.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
 
17. 
Implementing Agency
.
The Grant recipient and organization responsible for all implementation 
and management issues for the Project will be the International Organization for Migration (the 
“Implementing Agency”).  The Implementing Agency will be responsible for day-to-day management, 
procurement, logistics, and all operational details of the Project in accordance with IBRD policies and 
procedures.  The implementing agency has an office in Yogyakarta and the organizational structure, so-
called the T-Shelter Unit, to implement the roof structure is already in place.  This unit has a project 
manager for the distribution and certification team, a project manager for community assessment, and a 
project manager for prefabrication production unit and construction as well as project assistants. The 
organizational structure is presented in Figure 1.   
 
18. 
Capacity
.
While the Implementing Agency’s Roof Structures are relatively expensive, with over 
15% of the unit cost representing overheads, and non-operational-related staffing and office costs, it was 
chosen due to its proven abilities to manage all of the tasks set out in the above paragraph and expands its 
program with minimal additional costs.  As of October 20, 2006, the Implementing Agency has 
constructed over 4,500 Roof Structures, of which 3,000 have been assembled on site for eligible families 
in the Affected Areas.  The Implementing Agency was judged to be one of few organizations able to 
deliver Roof Structures on this scale.  Negotiations are ongoing with other potential providers of Roof 
Structures. 
 
Page  10

19. 
Quality control
.
The Implementing Agency has a quality control system for the input and the 
output.  The tracking procedures cover incoming material, production, field distribution, end-user tracking 
and community handover of the structure kits, quality control during the construction and certification 
upon completion of the construction.  
 
20. 
Oversight
.
The Urban Unit of IBRD will oversee the project and carry out supervision at least 
once per month, or more regularly as needed.  IBRD will carry out a mid-term review in mid February 
2007 to assess the performance and the progress as well as the demand of the Roof Structures.  The Terms 
of Reference for the mid-term review will be discussed with the Implementing Agency prior to the 
undertaking of the review.  At the Project level, after all distribution has been completed, and construction 
should have been completed the Implementing Agency’s Community Liaison staff will conduct additional 
meetings and follow up with the beneficiaries to evaluate their satisfaction with the shelter provided.  Data 
is collected using sample testing.  IBRD will also assign an independent consultant team to verify the 
deliverables in terms of number, quality, targeting and beneficiaries’ satisfaction. 
 
21. 
Independent audits of the Implementing Agency’s activities will be carried out in cooperation 
with relevant levels of government and in accordance with section XIV on Auditing. 
 
VII.  TARGETING OF BENEFICIARIES 
 
22. 
It is estimated that the Project will target 132 sub-villages in the Affected Areas in the DIY and 
Central Java provinces.  This figure is based on the IOM’s current median sub-village size of 121 
beneficiaries.  The Implementing Agency will select these villages based on the level of damage and the 
level of assistance provided and promised by other organizations.  The aim is to provide 100% coverage 
of the need as determined by the community themselves in conjunction with the Implementing Agency; 
that is, the Project will provide a Roof Structure to every family that needs one in a targeted village.  
Prioritization of construction for community members with disabilities, widows, and other disadvantaged 
groups is the prerogative of the communities themselves.  For further details of the selection methods, 
please refer to Figure 1: Targeting Flowchart (Annex 5: Technical Annex). 
 
In selecting their target villages, the Implementing Agency will work closely with the ERC and the DIY 
and Central Java provinces as well as respective 
kabupatens
 (districts) to reduce overlaps.  The Project 
will not operate in villages targeted by the other housing initiative facilitated by the World Bank: the 
Urban Poverty Project (“UPP”), which is providing permanent housing to eligible families in 156 villages 
in the Affected Areas.
 
VIII.  PROJECT TIMELINE 
 
23. 
The timeline for the entire Project is anticipated to be seven months (15 November 2006 – 15 June 
2007).  Construction of structural elements (frame and roofs) of all 16,000 units will be completed by May 
31, 2007 with the final two weeks used for finalization of construction (walls), certification and reporting.

IX.   FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT MECHANISMS 
 
24. 
The total requested funding is US$4.258 million, which includes the cost of four project 
components for 16,000 Roof Structure Kits (US$266 per unit).  This figure includes Operational Costs of 
US$3.6 million (85% or US$225 per unit, including 5% contingency for price increases and production 
defects), Staff Costs of US$0.4 million (9.3% or US$24.7 per unit), Office Costs of US$63,840 (1.5% or 
US$4 per unit), and additional Overhead of US$202,252 (5% or US$13 per unit).  For further breakdown 
of unit costs, please refer to the Annex 1: Project Costs. 
 
25. In 
o
rder to overcome the Implementing Agency’s liquidity for pre-financing, advance from the 
Grant is required.  For this purpose, the Implementing Agency will open a designated (special) account 
(SA) denominated in US$ in a commercial bank acceptable to IBRD.  The SA will be solely used to 
finance eligible project expenditures.  The ceiling of the advance to the SA is fixed at US$1 million.  The 
payments to the SA will be considered as the advances to the Implementing Agency, while reporting on 
uses of the advances should be submitted to IBRD monthly and any unused advances must be refunded to 
IBRD by the end of the project.  
 
26. 
Disbursements beyond $2.4 million would be contingent upon satisfactory assessment of the 
program by the Bank in the mid-term review. 
 
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
X.  
Financial Management 
 
27. 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘Substantial’ and these will arise from the following 
factors: (i) the weak overall fiduciary environment in the country that might influence the project.  In such 
an environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures is needed to ensure that proceeds of the Grant 
are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and efficiency; (ii) Jakarta office has 
adequate financial management staff under its resource management unit.  However, the Implementing 
Agency will need to exercise careful financial control over the expenditures made at the field location in 
Page  12
6
Yogyakarta, particular over inventories of building materials purchased; (iii) Yogyakarta office forwards 
all financial documents to Jakarta office for accounting purposes.  Jakarta has a simple project accounting 
system (PAS 2000) that is basically a MS Access database application, and is now in a transition to 
implement their corporate SAP system.  However, for this project, the Implementing Agency will not 
implement SAP system.  This arrangement introduces some risks on the reliability of the accounting and 
reporting for transactions incurred at Yogyakarta for this operation, in particular with respect to costs 
allocated to similar operations being carried out by multiple donors simultaneously.  The Implementing 
Agency intended to implement PAS 2000 in Yogyakarta office in the near future; hence they can record to 
the system directly and send it electronically to Jakarta office for consolidation purposes.  The current 
Cooperation Arrangement between GOI and IOM is set to expire on January 31, 2007, but is expected to 
be renewed before that date.  Non-renewal of the Cooperation Arrangement is specified as an event of 
suspension in the grant agreement. 
 
28. 
A midterm review of project will be carried on or about February 15, 2007, to review the progress 
of the project and the projected demand for new roof structure kits.  The World Bank will inform the 
Recipient prior to conducting the mid-term review.  Failure on the part of IOM to satisfy the Bank with 
the progress of the project or with prospects for its continued implementation, having regard to projected 
demand, will be treated as an additional event of suspension and may also result in the suspension of the 
balance of the grant. 
 
29. 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  In addition to 
existing financial management procedures, the Implementing Agency will strengthen payment validation 
procedures related to the Project and special purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation 
on a
 
monthly basis, to facilitate monitoring. Individual payments above IDR 100 million (US$ 10,980) in 
Yogyakarta office will need to be countersigned by the Jakarta office.  An external financial audit will be 
requested upon completion of the operation, together with a review of internal controls over project 
implementation. Internal audit program should include physical verification of inventory. 
 
30. 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being Substantial.  This assessment 
has concluded that with the implementation of the 
Action Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction for 
the Post-Earthquake Affected Areas in the Province of Yogyakarta and the Province of Central Java
,
the 
proposed financial management arrangements will satisfy IBRD’s minimum requirements under 
OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on 
the status of the Grant required by IBRD.  More details of the financial management assessment are given 
in Annex 3: Financial Management. 
 
XI.   Procurement 
 
31. 
The Implementing Agency will manage and coordinate all human resources, by hiring a number 
of locally pre-trained skilled labors and volunteer students from local universities, including ones from the 
Department of Architecture of the UGM.  The Implementing Agency will employ its own staff to 
supervise the work. 
 
32. 
Procurement will consist of the purchase of construction materials.  For shopping of goods by 
comparing at least three quotations, the Implementing Agency has adequate internal procurement and 
purchasing systems and procedures in place that can be followed for contract packages below 
US$200,000, subject to clarifications as stated in the Procurement Annex 4: Procurement.  For contracts 
above US$200,000, ICB procedures will be followed.  A more detailed description on procurement is 
Page  13
7
presented in the Annex 4. Procurement. 
 
XII.  Anti-Corruption 
 
33. 
As with the anti corruption action plan on procurement, the Implementing Agency will disclose 
the following information on the Implementing Agency’s central website at www.iom.or.id: (i) the prices 
of major construction items; (ii) the complaint database along with the report on the complaint resolution, 
(iii) contract award notices, containing the information specified in paragraph 2.60 of the Procurement 
Guidelines, and (iv) the names and addresses of the beneficiaries.  This information will also be published 
on the Rekompak website.  Overall, the procurement risk is average. 
 
XIII.  Social and Environmental Aspect 
 
34. 
The Project will carry out on-site housing redevelopment for the affected families.  Field 
observations have shown that most water supply facilities, including wells, and sanitation facilities such as 
septic tanks are relatively intact.  Houses will be built on plots of land where ownership has been clearly 
established and verified with the landowners and neighbors.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that 
resettlement will take place in this Project.  In the event that a land dispute does arrive, it will be the 
responsibility of the community to settle it; although there is practically no chance of this happening after 
construction has begun due to the extensive socialization campaign undertaken by the Implementing 
Agency.  In fact, the Project should have positive social impacts for those involved in the process, since (i) 
the recipients of the Roof Structure Kits will be able to return to productive lives, (ii) community members 
(including construction workers, laborers, craftsmen, supervisors, truck drivers and administrative staff) 
will be provided temporary employment and gain practical professional skills, and (iii) volunteer 
university students will be better prepared for future employment through on-the-job training for 
construction and community liaison. 
 
35. 
The Project will use construction components consisting of a tarpaulin and tiles for the roof, 
bamboo sheeting for the walls, bamboo poles for the framing, nylon straps and rope as fastening materials, 
nails, and cement and sand to form the Shelter Kit.  The piles and roofing will be entirely made of 
bamboo.  By design, the houses will not use any timber.  Bamboo used for the project is sustainable 
harvested from both planted and naturally regenerating sources; thus, no environmental issues are 
expected from the demand that the Project will generate for this versatile material. 
 
36. 
Moreover, the Project will encourage the beneficiaries to use as much as possible salvaged 
materials from their previous houses, including bricks, doors, and windows.  Environmental problems 
could occur in the production facilities where the construction materials are processed into prefabricated 
shelter kits, that is, the disposal of waste cuttings from the bamboo piles and wall sheets.  However, the 
current practice is that excess materials are sent along with the shelter kits to the beneficiaries/sub-villages 
to be used during the construction of the shelters for small joints or other purposes.  The Project will 
monitor the use of these materials to ensure that they do not pose any environmental threat through 
improper disposal.

37. 
The Implementing Agency will oversee and provide technical guidance for the construction of the 
Roof Structures in cooperation with volunteer students from the Architecture Department of UGM and 
recruit pre-trained skilled construction workers.  The Roof Structures can be classified as semi-permanent 
housing with a life expectancy of at least two years, and can be incrementally expanded and improved to 
become permanent housing.  Close supervision and assistance to the workers and beneficiaries involved 
during the construction will be required to ensure that the earthquake-resistant design and techniques are 
adhered.  
 
XIV.  Auditing 
 
38. 
Special purpose project financial statement for expenditure under this Grant will be prepared by 
the Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the Yogyakarta office.  The 
financial reports will be subject to a financial audit by reputable auditor acceptable to IBRD. A copy of the 
Project audited financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if any, will 
be submitted to IBRD no later than three months after the end of the project. 
39. 
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed by IBRD with the Recipient 
before negotiations.  The audit report will include an opinion on the reliability of the project financial 
statements.  
 
40. 
Technical/Performance Audit.  There will be a technical/performance audit carried out by an 
independent consultant team during the implementation of the Project and after the Project is closed.  The 
Terms of Reference will be agreed by IBRD with the Recipient prior to negotiation. 
 
REMEDIES 
 
41. 
If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special account, or if expenditures 
are made from the Special Account without adequate supporting documentation to validate these, the 
Recipient will be obligated to refund the same to IBRD. 
 
XV.  Benefit and Risks 
 
42. 
The main benefits of the project are those directly associated with providing sturdy Roof Structure 
that will be sufficient to house the family until a Permanent Structure is complete.  It is recognized that 
whilst there is an imperative to make best use of limited resources from national, international and private 
1

,
the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties’ claims on the 
disputed areas 
Page  15
9
sources and move as quickly as possible to permanent reconstruction phases, there is currently a greater 
necessity to ensure that disaster-affected families receive adequate shelter as the monsoon season begins 
in October 2006 that will remain so until a Permanent House is constructed. 
 
43. 
A key benefit of a Roof Structure is that it does not reduce the resources available for subsequent 
construction of a Permanent Structure as all materials used for its construction will be reused when 
resources for the other components of the permanent house to be provided to a family.  Erection is also 
fast, and materials are cheap, readily available, and the bamboo structure is suitable to withstand future 
seismic events.

44. 
By expanding the already proven program of the Implementing Agency, the Program can reduce 
most operational and implementation risks.  However, there are still a number of risks such as natural 
disasters, the ability of the Implementing Agency to increase its production capacity, and the possibility of 
overlap with and negative externalities of, the GoI program.  The risks associated with natural disasters 
will be mitigated by the quality of the Roof Structure Kits distributed and the technical assistance 
provided at the construction phase.  The possibility that the Implementing Agency will not be able to meet 
production targets is mitigated by the selection of an organization that is well established internationally, 
in other areas in Indonesia, and in the Affected Areas with proven programs.  To mitigate the possibility 
that the Project will overlap with the broader GoI response once they begin disbursement of funds, the 
project will work closely with the ERC’s Management Information Systems program monitoring all 
assistance being provided. 
 
45. 
Beneficiary Aggregation
.
It is assumed that the numbers of beneficiaries will continue to be 
adequate to maintain economies of scale through geographic and sufficiently grouped numbers of 
beneficiaries in a given location (about 60 beneficiary households per sub-village).  
 
46. 
Demand
.
It is assumed that the demand level for IOM roof structures will remain consistent with 
what has been thus far experienced. Government policies as well as the pace of private reconstruction may 
have an impact on the willingness of beneficiaries to accept roof structures.  Should substantial changes 
occur, IOM will immediately inform and consult with the World Bank.  To mitigate the possibility that the 
Project will overlap with the broader GoI response once they begin disbursement of funds, the project will 
work closely with the ERC’s Management Information Systems program monitoring all assistance being 
provided. 
 
Page  16
10
47. 
Procurement
.
It is assumed that the market for raw materials will not significantly fluctuate or 
change in terms of costs or availability of materials.   Should such changes occur, IOM will communicate 
this to the Bank and coordinate any necessary revisions to the project. 
 
48. 
Quality Control
.
It is assumed that the local community self-help mechanism (gotong royong) 
will continue to adequately provide for the ongoing awareness of the need for maintaining structural 
integrity in any subsequent owner led modifications or reconstruction after the units have been handed 
over. 
 
49. 
Construction
.
It is assumed that the local community self-help mechanism (gotong royong) will 
continue to adequately provide for necessary support to the construction program.  Construction assisted 
and supervised by IOM will take place during a period of 6 days for each beneficiary, which from 
experience is more than enough to construct a roof structure.  Should beneficiaries take longer to build the 
roof structure, IOM's operational capacity and budget do not allow for longer period of construction 
assistance.  This may result in instances where the construction of one shelter is not supervised until 
completion. 
 
XVI.  PROJECT RESULTS 
 
50. 
Please refer to Annex 2: Results Framework. 
 
XVII.  
MONITORING AND REPORTING 
 
51. 
The Implementing Agency must provide monthly reports on the physical and financial progress of 
the report.  In addition, the Implementing Agency must submit one final report after operational aspects of 
the Project have been completed summarizing the findings of the follow-up surveys of the beneficiaries, 
and details of the procurement, pre-fabrication, distribution, and technical assistance stages of the project.  
For further details on reporting, please refer to Annex 2: Results Framework. 
 
52. 
The project will use their existing accounting system, which is documented in the manual for the 
Implementing Agency field office.  The accounting manual is acceptable.  All project transactions are 
included in its financial statement, so that risk of double counting with other donors can be reduced. 
 
53. 
In addition to the existing financial reporting requirements, the Implementing Agency will 
produce financial reports, which consist of financial and physical progress information at the end of the 
project.  Some risks will arise from similar expenditures that are being funded by donors other than IBRD. 
Separate account codes will be created to allow expenditure to be tracked for different field office and 
different donors.

ANNEX 3: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
 
Financial Management Assessment 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
Durable Shelters - Yogyakarta 
 
A.  
Summary 
 
This Grant will finance the construction of Roof Structures to earthquake-affected communities in 
Yogyakarta and Central Java.  Total budget estimate is US$ 4.25 million and will be implemented in 
seven months.  This Grant will be funded by several donors, under a multi-donor trust fund. 
 
The purpose of the project’s financial management assessment is to determine whether the financial 
management systems of the Implementing Agency, IOM (International Organization for Migration) has 
capacity to produce timely, relevant and reliable financial information on the project activities.  IOM is a 
non-UN inter-governmental organization with headquarters in Geneva.  Financial management system in 
headquarters has not been assessed for this Grant. 
 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘Substantial’ and these will arise from some factors: (1) the weak 
overall fiduciary environment in the country may influence the project.  In such an environment, a set of 
fiduciary policies and procedures are needed to ensure that proceeds of the Grant are used only for the 
purposes intended, with due regard to economy and efficiency; (2) Jakarta office has adequate financial 
management staff under its resource management unit.  However, IOM will need to exercise careful 
financial control over the expenditures made at the field location in Yogyakarta, in particular over 
inventories of building materials purchased; (3) Yogyakarta office forwards all financial documents to 
Jakarta office for accounting purposes.  Jakarta has a simple project accounting system (PAS 2000) that is 
basically a MS Access database application, and is now in a transition to implement their corporate SAP 
system.  However, for this project, IOM will not implement SAP system.  This arrangement introduces 
some risks on the reliability of the accounting and reporting for transactions incurred at Yogyakarta for 
this operation, in particular with respect to costs allocated to similar operations being carried out by 
multiple donors simultaneously.  IOM intended to implement PAS 2000 in Yogyakarta office in the near 
future; hence they can record to the system directly and send it electronically to Jakarta office for 
consolidation purposes; (4) the current Cooperation Arrangement between GOI and IOM is set to expire 
on January 31, 2007, but is expected to be renewed before that date.  Non-renewal of the Cooperation 
Arrangement is specified as an event of suspension in the grant agreement.  A midterm review of project 
will be carried on or about February 15, 2007, to review the progress of the project and the projected 
demand for new roof structure kits.  Failure on the part of IOM to satisfy the Bank with the progress of the 
project or with prospects for its continued implementation, having regard to projected demand, will be 
treated as an additional event of suspension and may also result in the suspension of the balance of the 
grant. 
 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  In addition to existing 
financial management procedures, IOM will strengthen payment validation procedures related to the 
Project and special purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation on a monthly
 
basis, to 
facilitate monitoring.  Individual payment above Rp100 million in Yogyakarta office will need to be 
countersigned by the Jakarta office.  An independent financial audit will be requested upon completion of 
the operation, together with a review of internal controls over project implementation.  Internal audit 
program should include undertake physical verification of inventory.

15
Funds will be disbursed to IOM on monthly reimbursement based on list of eligible expenditure. 
Expenditure to be reimbursed should be clearly defined.  Organizational overhead may be reimbursed only 
in proportion to the total operations in Yogyakarta. 
 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being Substantial.  This assessment has 
concluded that with the implementation of the 
Action Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction for the 
Post-Earthquake Affected Areas in the Province of Yogyakarta and the Province of Central Java
,
the 
proposed financial management arrangements will s
atisfy IBRD’s minimum requirements under 
OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on 
the status of the Grant required by IBRD.  More details of the financial management assessment are given 
below. 
 
B.  
Summary of Risks and Proposed Mitigating Arrangements 
 
The project’s overall risk assessment and summary of mitigating measures is as follows: 
 
Risks 
[High / Substantial /  
Moderate / Low] 
Assessment 
Summary Comments & Risk Mitigation Measures. 
Conditionality
A. Inherent Risks 
 
1. Country Level Risks 
Substantial 
This operation will not rely on Government financial 
management systems. Fiduciary risks normally 
associated with use of Government. FM systems will 
therefore not apply. But the wide prevalence of 
corruption in the country will impact the control 
environment to some degree. 
N
2. Entity specific risks 
 
IOM has extensive experience in Indonesia, with 
operations in many locations, including Aceh, Nias and 
Yogyakarta. It has considerable international 
experience in this kind of work. 
Indonesia entity is managed by a team of professional 
staff, including 56 qualified expatriate staff.  
N
a. Implementing Entity 
Organization 
High 
IOM is inter-governmental organization which has 
close working relationship with many international 
donors and non-governmental organizations. Income is 
mostly from donor countries and total expenditures in 
FY 2005 amounted to US$ 952 Million globally. There 
is a risk of uncertainty about IOM status, since the 
current Cooperation Arrangement between GOI and 
IOM is set to expire on January 31, 2007, but is 
expected to be renewed before that date.  Non-renewal 
of the Cooperation Arrangement is specified as an 
event of suspension in the grant agreement. 
 
A
midterm review of project will be carried on or about 
February 15, 2007, to review the progress of the project 
and the projected demand for new roof structure kits. 
Failure on the part of IOM to satisfy the Bank with the 
progress of the project or with prospects for its 
continued implementation, having regard to projected 
demand, will be treated as an additional event of 
suspension and may also result in the suspension of the 
balance of the grant.

.
Budgeting 
High 
Detailed budgets for proposed expenditure have not yet 
been prepared. 
 
Y
2. Internal Controls 
High 
FM procedures and policies are well documented. 
However, there has been experience of isolated cause 
of fraud last year in Aceh. Transactions in Indonesia 
are subject to internal audit of IOM. Risks may arise 
from forgery of documents and weak payment 
validation. For Yogyakarta office, it is unlimited 
combined authorization of two signatures for payments 
(Head of Operations and Accounting). 
 
Stringent Payment validation procedures will therefore 
be specified and linked to evidence of physical 
progress. Review of Internal controls over Grant 
operations will be requested, and a copy of the report 
made available to IBRD. Internal audit should include 
physical verification of inventory, compare to the 
records and report any difference.  
For individual payment above IDR100 million should 
be counter-signed by Jakarta-based officer. 
Y
3. Accounting 
Moderate 
Accounting staff capacity in Jakarta is adequate.  Risks 
may arise from the field operation in Yogyakarta. Risks 
may arise from inaccurate allocation of expenditure for 
similar activities funded by multiple donors. 
 
Transactions
 
for proposed Grant operation will be 
included in their entity accounting system to reduce 
risk of double counting.
 
Y
4.  Flow of Fund 
Moderate 
Inadequate 
definition 
of 
eligible 
expenditure 
in 
particular overhead and indirect will weaken the 
fiduciary control over expenditure. 
Clearly define expenditure on the principal that are all 
directly identified to this project will be reimbursed 
and organizational overhead may be reimburse only in 
proportion to the total operations in Yogyakarta 
Y
5. 
Audit 
arrangements 
Moderate 
Independent private audit firms will be hired, 
acceptable to IBRD, based on TOR acceptable to 
IBRD.  The audit will be for financial transaction in 
Indonesia under this Grant.  A single project audit will 
be requested, since the project duration will be seven 
months.

Overall project specific

Project Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangement  
 
Based on the project design features and the risk analysis summarized above, the following arrangements 
are proposed for financial management and disbursements.  These include measures to mitigate risks 
identified above. 
 
Institutional and Staffing Arrangements
IOM is an organization headquartered in Geneva, with extensive operations (220 offices) around the 
world.  It has been in operation in Indonesia since 1999.  It has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) authorizing it to operate as a non UN Intergovernmental Organization 
for relief work.  Its operations in Indonesia are subject to its own internal governance and accountability 
arrangements.  The current Cooperation Arrangement between GOI and IOM is set to expire on January 
31, 2007, but is expected to be renewed before that date.  Non-renewal of the Cooperation Arrangement is 
specified as an event of suspension in the grant agreement. 
 
A
mid-term review of project will be carried on or about February 15, 2007, to review the progress of the 
project and the projected demand for new roof structure kits.  Failure on the part of IOM to satisfy the 
Bank with the progress of the project or with prospects for its continued implementation, having regard to 
projected demand, will be treated as an additional event of suspension and may also result in the 
suspension of the balance of the grant. 
 
Existing staff of the entity located in Yogyakarta will do accounting, reporting and monitoring.  Activities 
will be supervised by Jakarta office of IOM.  Resource department has responsibility on financial 
management and human resources.  Right now there are five staffs working under financial management 
unit.  This considered adequate for the time being.  Although they may need back up from Jakarta office, 
once they start implementing PAS 2000 in Yogyakarta. 
 
Accounting and Reporting
IOM Jakarta has simple project accounting system (PAS 2000) that basically is Microsoft Access 
database.  PAS 2000 Jakarta file is downloaded into the headquarter Mosaic accounting system will 
produce the financial statements.  Jakarta office may see their sub component financial report on the 
organization’s website.  An SAP system has recently been introduced, but will not be applied to this 
operation. 
 
Yogyakarta office uses manual system and forwards all financial information to Jakarta office to be input 
in the system.  IOM intended to implement PAS 2000 in Yogyakarta office in the near future. 
 
The project will use their existing accounting system, which is documented in the manual for IOM field 
office.  The accounting manual is acceptable.  All project transactions are included in its financial 
statement, so that risk of double counting with other donors can be reduced. 
 
In addition to the existing financial reporting, IOM Jakarta will produce financial reports which consist of 
financial and physical progress information at the end of the project.  Some risks will arise from similar 
expenditures that are being funded by other donors in addition to IBRD.  Separate entity level project 
codes will be created to allow expenditure to be tracked for different field office and different donors. 
Page  24

Audit Arrangement
Special purpose project financial statement for expenditure under this Grant would be prepared by the 
Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the Yogyakarta office.  The 
financial report will be subject to a financial audit by reputable auditor acceptable to IBRD.  A copy of the 
Project audited financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if any, will 
be submitted to IBRD no later than three months after the end of the project. 
 
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed by IBRD with the Recipient before 
negotiations. The audit report will include an opinion on the reliability of the project financial statements.  
 
Disbursement Arrangement 
In order to overcome IOM’s liquidity for pre-financing, advance from grant is required.  For this purpose, 
IOM need to open a designated (special) account (SA) denominated in US$ in a commercial bank 
acceptable to the Bank.  The SA will be solely used to finance eligible project expenditures. 
 
The ceiling of the advance to the SA is fixed at $1 million.  The funds made available to the SA will be 
considered as the advances to IOM.  In accordance with IOM’s practices, expenditures would met by 
IOM’s own specific project code for this purpose in Jogjakarta or elsewhere and periodically IOM debits 
the SA to reimburse these expenditures sums based on the four categories specified below.  The reporting 
on uses of the advances should be submitted to the Bank monthly and any un-used advances must be 
refunded to the Bank by the end of the project. 
 
Reporting the use of the SA funds would be consisting of: 
 
(i) 
Interim Financial Report (IFR) showing summary listing of the expenditures for the period in 
accordance to IOM Financial Management System (MOSAIC) and classified under (a) 
consultants/staff cost; (b) goods and materials; (c) labor; (d) operational costs and overhead.  
(ii) 
SA reconciliation statement. 
 
Applications for reporting use of SA funds (as above) and further advance for replenishment of the SA 
may be submitted monthly in a single application. 
 
IFR will not be accompanied by supporting documents. However, all documentation evidencing 
expenditures will be retained by IOM and shall be made available to the auditors for audit and to the Bank 
and its representatives if requested 
 
Allocations of grants proceeds are as follows:

ANNEX 4: PROCUREMENT 
 
A.  
General  
 
Proc
urement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with IBRD’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004; and “Guidelines: Selection and 
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in 
the Grant Agreement.  The general description of various items under different expenditure category is 
described below.  For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or 
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, 
and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and IBRD project team in the Procurement Plan.  Due to 
the nature of the project, i.e. the purchase of basic material on demand basis, the Procurement Plan is still 
not developed at this stage but will be prior to launching any procurement activities and will be updated 
on an ongoing basis. 
 
Procurement of Works: N/A
Procurement of Goods
:
Goods procured under this project would include: the purchase of construction 
materials, including core materials, roof tiles, prefabricated materials, and the related services (such as: the 
transportation and the distribution of materials, including field testing).  IOM has a network of established 
vendors and has advertised public tenders in local newspapers.  Many of the existing vendors have the 
opportunity to supply the Production Center.  Depending on existing capacity, other vendors can 
immediately be added to the existing firms to supply the necessary volume. Construction materials will be 
purchased on batches, with an estimate of no more than US$200,000 per package.  For contracts below 
US$200,000, the procurement will be done following Shopping procedures acceptable to IBRD, by 
comparing at least three quotations, using the Recipient’s standard documents satisfactory to IBRD. 
Although it is not anticipated yet, however, if necessary, procurement above US$200,000 will follow ICB 
procedures, using IBRD’s standard ICB documents. 
 
Selection of Consultant
:
An external auditor will be hired (estimated at US$ 10,000) following CQS 
procedures.  The auditor will conduct an audit of special purpose project financial statement.  The overall 
objective of this assignment is to enable the auditor to express a professional opinion on the project 
financial statements, the operation of the overall financial management system including internal controls, 
and compliance with the financing agreements. Since the IOM does not have the experience in carrying 
out this selection process, this package is subject to the Bank’s prior review. 
 
B.  
Assessment of the agency’s capacity to implement procurement 
 
Procurement activities will be carried out by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  
Purchase of material is directly done by IOM.  IOM does not use external contractors.  For this purpose 
IOM employs dedicated Admin and Finance officers as well as Procurement/Logistics experts (all are 
international staff). 
 
The assessment of IOM’s capacity concluded that IOM has the capacity to carry out procurement, with 
existing internal procurement procedures as follows: 
 
1.  Below US$500 – no need to be supported by quotations from three vendors.  The Project 
manager/procurement officer authorizes. 
2. 
Below US$20,000 – IOM authorizes after obtaining three quotations.  Missions are encouraged to 
coordinate with Field Procurement Unit (FPU) in Manila. 
Page  27
21
3. Between 
US$20,000 
and 
US$200,000 
–
in addition to number two, missions are required 
(mandatory) to coordinate with FPU. 
4. 
Over US$200,000 – in addition to number three, procurement shall be done using competitive 
bidding. 
 
There is also a provision in IOM’s internal procedures that requiring IOM to fully comply with the 
donor’s procurement procedures and requirements for projects financed by donors. 
 
IOM’s shopping procedures may be followed subject to the following clarifications: 
 
·
Shopping is made by comparing at least three quotations from reputable suppliers.  The 
term “reputable suppliers” shall not be limited to ones currently listed in IOM’s vendor 
system. IOM should expand the list of firms invited to submit quotations in order to 
expand the pool of invited suppliers and find other qualified potential suppliers. 
·
Award of contract shall be made to the lowest-priced, substantially technically responsive 
quotation, and the merit point system is not applicable. 
·
Quotation is obtained using a one-envelope system. 
·
No negotiation of contracts is allowed. 
 
As with the anti corruption action plan on procurement, IOM will disclose the following information 
1. 
the prices of major construction items; and 
2. 
the complaint database along with the report on the complaint resolution in its website 
and in the ReKompak website. 
 
The overall project risk for procurement is AVERAGE. 
 
C.  
Procurement Plan 
 
There is no specific procurement plan developed for this Project, since the purchase of materials will be 
made on an on-going basis, following the progress of construction works.  A detailed time schedule for the 
selection of auditor will be agreed with the Bank during negotiation. 
 
D.  
Frequency of Procurement Supervision 
 
IBRD will conduct at least a quarterly supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review of 
procurement actions.

ANNEX 5:  TECHNICAL ANNEX 
 
Technical Annex to MOP 
on Yogyakarta and Central Java Earthquake Roof Structure Kit Project 
 
A.  
Background and Strategy 
 
In the morning of May 27, 2006, an earthquake struck the region along the central section of Java’s south 
coast.  The areas most severely affected by this earthquake were those south and east of Yogyakarta City, 
i.e. Kabupaten (District) Bantul (located in Yogyakarta Special Region, 
Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta
 – 
“DIY”) and Kabupaten Klaten (located in Central Java Province).  Most of the loss of life and most of the 
material damage was observed in these two districts. Considerable damage and some loss of life were also 
recorded in the other districts of DIY. 
 
The Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment Report (“PDLAR”) by GoI, World Bank, and ADB 
estimates the total amount of damage and losses caused by the earthquake at IDR 29.1 trillion (approx. 
US$3.1 billion) of which IDR 15.3 trillion (approx. US$1.7 billion) were in the housing sector.  This is 
more than damage and losses caused in the housing sector by the Aceh disaster (IDR 13.4 trillion). 
 
Under the leadership of the UN, an inter-agency group known as the ERC was established to support GoI 
in dealing with the needs for immediate assistance. 
 
Various damage assessments state the number of houses destroyed or severely damaged between 306,412 
(ERC) and 358,693 (PDLAR).  Assuming an average household size of 4.3 persons, this means that 
between 1.32 and 1.54 million people may have been rendered homeless by the earthquake. 
 
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, government agencies and – in response to the GoI request 
for housing assistance – local and international stakeholders distributed emergency shelter materials (e.g. 
tarpaulins, tents, mattresses, blankets and other emergency shelter items) to the earthquake affected 
people.  With the completion of these efforts, close to 100% of the emergency shelter needs have now 
been covered. 
 
Assessments recently conducted by the key members of the ERC show a minimum need of 102,300 Roof 
Structures.  Up to mid-October 2006, overall commitments from various agencies providing durable 
shelter assistance amount to 55,000 units, leaving a gap of approx. 47,300 units.  The scope of assistance 
for the first 55,000 units varies from prefabricated bamboo structures to cash vouchers and the distribution 
of building materials and tools. 
 
Again under the leadership of the UN, another inter-agency group was established (Shelter Cluster Group 
–
“SCG”) to coordinate and oversee shelter provision in the disaster Affected Areas, in support of the 
efforts of GoI and other parties (individuals, civil society, NGOs, etc.).  
 
To deal with the medium term needs of disaster relief and rehabilitation in the sectors housing, 
infrastructure, restoration of livelihoods, and others, various donors and international organizations have 
jointly established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund called Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) in October 2006. 
Page  29
23
 
B.  
IBRD Response and Strategy 
 
IBRD’s response to the disaster included immediate communication with the Executing Agency for the 
Urban Poverty Project III, with the objective of re-allocating undisbursed project funds amounting to 
US$20 million to housing reconstruction in the disaster area.  IBRD is also in the process of re-assessing 
its lending program to Indonesia and the macro-economic dialogue, and it is discussing the use of a 
project preparation facility or trust funds. 
 
The objective of this Project is to complement efforts by GoI, the SCG, and civil society in providing a 
safe and appropriate shelter to all households that have become homeless as a result of the disaster and 
have not otherwise been provided with transitional or permanent shelter.  To this end, the Project shall 
provide Roof Structure Kits to an estimated number of 16,000 eligible households.  These kits shall be 
provided by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
 
The main outcome of the project is the provision of 16,000 durable Roof Structure Kits that will be 
prefabricated at the IOM production facility, delivered through IOM logistics support system to 
households whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged, and assembled on site. 
 
The rationale of the Project is that the vast majority of the emergency shelters provided so far, is only a 
short-term solution and will not provide adequate shelter to cover transitional needs throughout the 2-3 
years that will probably be required for reconstruction.  In the meantime, some families may have the 
resources to recover on their own, and others may receive assistance from government, civil society or the 
humanitarian communities.  Even so, poverty and insufficient resources create the need for additional 
efforts to provide Roof Structure.  
 
The lack of adequate housing also impacts the capacity of people to resume their livelihoods.  A large 
percentage of the affected population is engaged in small home based industries and will not be able to 
resume their previous economic activities in the absence of more durable shelter.  Finally, the lack of 
adequate housing causes severe health problems, which are expected to become much more during the 
forthcoming rainy season (November through March). 
 
The rationale for entrusting IOM with the implementation of the Project is that IOM is currently, 
independently from the project and in cooperation with the international community and local partners, 
implementing a large scale Roof Structure construction program that is consistent with ERC’s Strategic 
Framework.  This program is being implemented through the construction, distribution, and assembly of 
prefabricated shelter units, tools and awareness raising materials. IOM has also established a joint 
program for the provision of technical assistance in the field with a consortium of local universities.  It 
plans to provide Roof Structure to up to 10,000 households by the end of 2006 under this currently 
ongoing program.  The Project is to build upon IOM’s experience, project implementation facilities, 
organizational capacities, and human resources. 
 
C.  
Detailed Project Description 
 
The Project shall help close the remaining gap of needs for Roof Structure, as required during the ongoing 
efforts to construct a sufficient number of permanent houses for all households that have become homeless 
as a result of the disaster. 
 
The Project shall provide an estimated 16,000 additional eligible households with “Roof Structure Kits” 
that consist of simple frames made from bamboo, walls made from bamboo weaving, and roof trusses 
made from bamboo, to be covered with tarpaulins and/or roof tiles.  
Page  30
24
 
The most labor intensive and structurally crucial elements of these Roof Structure Kits shall, for 
maximum efficiency and speed, be pre-fabricated in centralized facility, then transported to the various 
sites, and assembled there by the beneficiaries themselves, with the necessary technical assistance 
provided by the Project. 
 
The Roof Structure design used by IOM uses only high quality bamboo for a number of reasons: 
 
·
Erection is fast and materials are easily available in Indonesia and thus this method fulfills 
fast track construction needs. 
·
Materials costs are relatively low, even for the high quality standards set out by IOM 
(moisture content of 15% and maturity of two years). 
·
Materials are traditionally used in Javanese culture. 
·
Adequate bamboo construction is suitable to withstand earthquake resistance or movements. 
·
Will last a minimum of two years, and will last longer than two years with periodic 
maintenance (painting, plastering, anti termite spraying, etc.). 
 
The basic design standards specifications are as follows: 
·
Light weight structure, meets wind pressure coefficient as per Indonesian standard (less than 
0.4 KN/m
2
). 
·
Total Design Load (less than 0.2 KN/m
2
). 
·
Roof design can handle clay tiles and aluminum sheeting with 15-18 kg/m
2
.
The prefabrication facility has a current production capacity for the JRF of 160 Roof Structure Kits per 
day, with 4 production lines, operated in 2 shifts each.  This means that over the period of the project, in 
addition to their existing commitments, IOM can produce 16,000 kits, allowing time for initial 
procurement of materials, community assessment and preparation, and selection of beneficiaries, as well 
as construction in the field. 
 
The duration of the project shall be seven months with an anticipated completion date of June 15 
(assuming a start date of November 15). Construction of structural elements (frames and roofs) of all 
16,000 kits shall be completed before April 30, 2007.  The final two months of the project shall be used 
for finalization of construction (walls), certification and reporting. 
 
IOM has already established a central warehouse and prefabrication facility for the production of Roof 
Structure Kits under its currently ongoing program.  This warehouse and workshop facility optimizes 
procurement, speed up the production process, and ensure that quality control standards are met.  The 
quality of incoming raw materials to the warehouse is checked by dedicated quality control officers ‘at the 
gate’ of the production site, while another team controls the quality of the outgoing kits.  The central 
warehouse and prefabrication center is located in Kalasan, northeast of Yogyakarta.  An additional 
warehouse has been established in Bantul. 
 
The primary project beneficiaries will be 16,000 vulnerable households in immediate need of durable 
shelter solutions, with an average household size of 4.3, this equals approximately 68,800 earthquake 
victims.  Aside from this, the Project will also benefit the construction sector through the direct 
employment of workers at the production facility and in the field, work experience for UGM volunteers, 
as well as through the reactivation of local labor and businesses active in the production or the provision 
of construction-related materials or services, e.g. artisans, roof tile producers, daily laborers, 
gedhek
 
(bamboo wall) producers, etc. 
Page  31
25
Community Assessment Team (CAT) of IOM will undertake selection of end-users/beneficiaries 
according to the following procedure: 
 
1. Site identification
:
Using the SCG database, CAT will identify those locations with heavy and 
total damage that do not receive any assistance from other organizations.  This information will be 
reviewed and crosschecked with various other sources. IOM aims for full coverage in each 
targeted village.  Once an area is selected, CAT carries out a Rapid Assessment Plan.  
2.  Beneficiaries List and Awareness
:
In consultation with the Kepala Desa (village head) and the 
community, IOM will establish a list of eligible households based on data on level of damage and 
number of household members, disaggregated to Dusun and RT (Rukun Tetangga) levels.  
Potential beneficiaries will then be surveyed by a team of student volunteers under the supervision 
and guidance of IOM Field Assistants.  The checklist coming from the field will be included in 
IOM database, and a verified list will be produced for final decision and site inspection.  After the 
selection of village and beneficiaries is completed, a community meeting will be convened and 
conducted for the socialization of the Project as well as safe construction awareness.  A mapping 
of local warehouses and mock-up locations will be produced together with the final beneficiary 
list and handed over to the distribution unit of IOM. 
3. Ex-post Distribution/Monitoring
:
After the distribution has been completed, the community 
liaison staff will conduct additional meetings and follow-up with the certified (construction) 
beneficiaries to evaluate their satisfaction. 
 
The proposed methodology builds on IOM’s lessons learned during the start-up of its durable Roof 
Structure program and deals with on-the-ground realities, namely: 
 
·
The current capacity of the work force mobilized from the community is insufficient to erect 
shelters at the pace required to meet the needs for durable shelter.  Some communities are 
already facing “burn out” when dealing with the demands of reconstruction, combined with 
the necessity to earn income and tend to the fields and animals.  Reconstruction is often taking 
place between 8:00 pm and midnight, weekends included.  
·
Initial housing designs were labor intensive and time consuming to erect on site.  Manpower 
limitations require a simple and less labor intensive approach to field construction without 
sacrificing the self-help aspects of the project 
·
It is expected that during the monsoon season, productivity will be reduced by 50% or more, 
thus impacting productivity levels and necessitating centralized prefabrication. 
·
Quality control of the frame is essential when placing heavy roof tiles on lightweight bamboo 
structures.  Furthermore, many of the village construction teams do not have the construction 
expertise and understanding to consistently produce adequately braced and structurally secure 
shelters capable of supporting heavier roof loads. 
·
Unreliability of suppliers with regards to the quality and quantity of materials distributed 
directly to the villages. 
 
Based on these lessons learnt from the early reconstruction phase, it appears that the prefabrication of 
Roof Structure Kits is the best way to address the majority of challenges described above.  The 
prefabrication strategy has been field tested by IOM and is producing the desired outcomes of fast 
construction coupled with sound management.

Institutional Arrangements and Project Implementation 
 
The implementing agency for the Project shall be the IOM.  IOM will be responsible for day-to-day 
management, including procurement of materials, operation of the prefabrication site, distribution of Roof 
Structure Kits, provision of technical assistance for assembly on site, logistics, and all other operational 
details of the Project, in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures.  IOM will report on its activities 
and their outcomes to IBRD.  
 
IBRD will be entitled to conduct, at its discretion, the technical, financial, social, and environmental audits 
as considered necessary. 
 
Given the experience and demonstrated capacities of IOM, the provision of additional technical assistance 
is not required. 
 
E.  
Action Plan 
 
In agreement with the IOM, the following work phases are planned: 
 
Step 1: Standard Design (Completed) 
 
IOM’s current 3x6 m design for Roof Structure Kit encourages installation of salvageable roof tiles and 
provides better perimeter water protection with a 60cm high masonry wall and elevated floor.  IOM’s 
design is appropriate for habitation for at least two years. 
IOM shelter design has been broken down into shop-built components or pieces that can be shipped to the 
village level in the form of a kit that reduces construction time in the field by at least fifty percent and 
virtually guarantees structural integrity of the finished shelter. 
 
Step 2:  Bill of Quantity/Costing (Completed) 
 
A
budget has been prepared for the standard Roof Structure Kit.  The total cost for a standard Roof 
Structure Kit is based on existing unit prices and currently stands at US$265 including prefabrication, 
transport and distribution, office, staff and central IOM overhead costs.  For a detailed budget, please refer 
to Annex I: Project Costs.  For the risks and assumptions associated with this unit cost, please refer to 
section (X – XIV) Fiduciary Responsibilities.
 
Step 3:  Set-up of the Production facility (Completed)  
 
IOM has set up a production facility in Kalasan (close to Yogyakarta International Airport), using WFP 
warehousing.  This secure site is ideal to store a large quantity of incoming, outgoing material and 
provides sufficient room for loading and unloading trucks.  The site has a secure perimeter fence and 24 
hour security.  Moreover, the facility has a reliable power supply for the 4 existing production lines.  
 
The production lines are based on a simple design requiring little capital investment.  Power equipment 
has already been procured and includes circular power saws, electric jig saw, electric drills, and a backup 
generator in the event of power failure.  IOM employs local laborers and carpenters in 40-person teams. 
Currently, four crews (160 people) produce at least 80 shelter kits per eight-hour shift.  With two shifts, 
this equals 160 Roof Structure Kits per day. Per week this is currently 960 Roof Structure Kits.  
 
Notably, the production facility allows for strict quality control procedures, vis-à-vis incoming materials 
and outgoing prefabricated units.  Contractors are paid according to their performance against targets and 
quality control standards and specifications. 
Page  34
28
Step 4:  Procurement of materials 
 
IOM has a network of established vendors and has advertised public tenders in local newspapers.  Many 
of the existing vendors have the opportunity to supply the production center.  Depending on existing 
capacity, other vendors can immediately be added to the existing firms to supply the necessary volume, in 
close coordination with various procurement officers of other agencies that are involved in Roof Structure 
construction. 
 
In addition, and contingent on future funding, IOM will set-up livelihood projects to produce input 
materials.  Especially, the production of bamboo sheeting for the walls and coconut rope for joints provide 
excellent livelihood potential.
 
Step 5:  Kit Fabrication on a Piece Work Basis 
 
IOM will produce, for each Roof Structure Kit, three main types of prefabricated components that are (a) 
the most labor intensive, and (b) crucial to the structural integrity of the building.  These are:  
 
·
4
wall components consisting of 2 columns, 2 horizontal beams and one diagonal brace; 
·
4
roof frames, and 
·
4
horizontal beams to connect two walling elements in the side wall. 
 
In addition, roofing elements (the frame that holds the roof tiles) will be precut to facilitate transportation 
of materials and improve on-site construction efficiency. 
 
The fabrication of the Roof Structure Kit is organized in different shifts consisting of foremen/ supervisors 
and local skilled woodworkers.  Workers are specialized along the different aspects of the production to 
optimize speed and quality of construction. 
 
Step 6:  Kit Distribution 
 
The prefabricated elements will be combined with a tarpaulin and tiles for the roof, bamboo sheeting for 
the walls, fastening materials and cement to form a Roof Structure Kit.  Unlike some other organizations 
who rely on salvaged roof tiles for their Roof Structures, IOM will provide enough roof tiles for an entire 
roof for the Roof Structure; in the event that the household is able to scavenge tiles from their previous 
house, these can be stored to form the roof of the Permanent House.  Roof Structure Kits will be disbursed 
from the Distribution Center to beneficiaries, as identified by IOM. IOM will also coordinate the 
distribution of toolkits prior to Roof Structure Kit distribution.  These toolkits include tools for clearing 
sites, preparing shelter foundations in the event that the existing foundation is not ready for immediate use 
and assembling the Roof Structure Kit.  Thus far, the vast majority of recipients of IOM Roof Structure 
Kits had foundations suitable for use, in most other cases; suitable space was available for use in close 
proximity to the original house site.  Repair of the foundation for the Permanent House will be the 
responsibility of the organization (most likely to be the Provincial Governments) providing the permanent 
reconstruction aid.  In addition, IOM will continue to distribute awareness raising materials and safe 
building manuals, which will complement the technical assistance provided by IOM volunteers. 
 
IOM will use its transportation capacity and existing professional expertise in logistics to conduct these 
complex logistical operations with efficiency, while ensuring accountability to the end-user level.  IOM 
will also use its existing partnerships with numerous local NGOs, currently active in the distribution and 
construction process to assist in the distribution and assembly of Roof Structure Kits.  Discussions are 
ongoing with the relevant NGOs as well as with the SCG Coordinator to incorporate their capacity and 
expertise in the IOM program.

Step 7:  Construction 
 
In the field, IOM will oversee and provide technical guidance for the construction of shelters, in 
cooperation with volunteer students from local universities, including the Department of Architecture of 
the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and recruited skilled construction workers who are pre-trained.  A 
mock-up shelter will also be erected on-site, (either at sub-village level or for a group of sub-villages, 
depending on their geographical closeness), in presence of the community.  Finally, Roof Structure Kits 
include a Construction Manual, to serve as a reference during the construction process. 
 
Like for distribution, IOM might also use the capacity of various local NGOs currently active in the 
distribution and construction processes to assist with the assembly of the Roof Structure Kits. 
 
Once installed with roof tiles and recycled brick floors, the Roof Structure Kit can be classified as semi-
permanent shelters with a life expectancy of at least two years.  Beneficiaries may install salvaged doors 
and windows from their damaged houses to enhance the condition of the durable structures. 
 
Correctly positioned in the center of an existing slab, the 18m
2
structure will allow the incremental 
construction of a permanent shelter around the Roof Structure Kit. Beneficiaries can live a dignified 
existence while they proceed with permanent reconstruction efforts, which may take several years.
