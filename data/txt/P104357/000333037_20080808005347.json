          satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: although the\n            Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) Roof Structure Project (RSP)\n            successfully achieved its development objective; it will\n            have been structured and implemented much differently if the\n            actual level of need had been more accurately estimated\n            prior to inception. Specifically, the estimated gap in\n            coverage of housing need required a response that was beyond\n            the capacity of any one agency, so both International\n            Organization for Migration (IOM) and Cooperative Housing\n            Foundation (CHF) International were contracted to build roof\n            structures. In actuality, however, the level of need was low\n            enough to easily be covered by only one group."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
