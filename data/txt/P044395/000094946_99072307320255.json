Most of its physical, financial, and\n            institutional objectives were met, with a highly\n            satisfactory rate of return. Sustainability of the power\n            sector components is likely, while that of the coal sector\n            components, depend on bridge financing, and sector\n            restructuring, to be provided under a future operation. The\n            key lessons suggest that even under early post-war\n            conditions, revenue collection rates may be raised, almost\n            near normal levels, as indicated by Elektroprivreda Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina's (EPBiH) experience. However, project\n            co-financing, consisting of a small number of co-financiers\n            or parallel financiers, with firm commitments made prior to\n            the Board presentation, would have proved a better\n            financing, in contrast to the financing gaps, and, project\n            alterations during implementation, thus resulting in a\n            difficult, and, time consuming accounting operation.\n            Although the Project Start-Up Advance facilitated\n            procurement prior to Board approval, some difficulties among\n            inter-agency transfers and adjustments did occur. Therefore,\n            since advance funding under emergency projects is vital, a\n            better consideration would be the use of enlarged Project\n            Preparation Facilities, to avoid inter-agency difficulties.\n            Project effectiveness was partly due to a strong Project\n            Implementation Unit, who provided adequate coordination\n            during implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
