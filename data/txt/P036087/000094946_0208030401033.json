Similarly, the Bank\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, due to serious flaws in\n            project design, inadequate back-up plans to improve\n            EdL's financial viability, and management, and lack of\n            integrated investment programs for the medium, and high\n            voltage transmission lines, among others. Lessons of general\n            experience suggest that legal, and institutional reforms be\n            implemented prior to Bank commitments; consideration be\n            given to the inclusion of cross effectiveness conditions\n            with major lending institutions, when integrated\n            transmission systems require completion of all components to\n            be fully effective - this could have greatly increased\n            incentives for the Government to schedule a timely approval\n            of the financial package; technology issues need to be\n            reviewed, and resolved prior to Board presentation, which\n            could have avoided the long, drawn-out procurement of the\n            Baalbeck and Saida transformer substations. Lessons\n            specifically for Bank lending in Lebanon, suggest particular\n            consideration to the use of the Council for Development and\n            Reconstruction, as the project procurement organization,\n            whenever the procurement process of implementing agencies\n            require several layers of internal, and external formal\n            approval; and, monitorable institutional processes should be\n            considered to ensure access to local financial resources,\n            required for expropriations, and resettlement issues."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
