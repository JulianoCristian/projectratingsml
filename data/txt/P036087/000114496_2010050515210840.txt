over such 
cost, from the date payment is made by the 
Bank under the

(b)
If, prior to their stated 
maturity date in July 2007 and in accordance 
with their terms and conditions, any of the 
Bonds (the "Redeemed Bonds") are either 
redeemed or purchased by or on behalf of 
Lebanon, and canceled, and as a result of 
such cancellation the Bank's obligations 
under the IBRD Guarantee in relation to such 
Redeemed Bonds are and shall be forever 
released, either as provided under the terms 
and conditions of the Bonds and the Fiscal 
Agency Agreement, or by operation of law, or 
both, then: (i) the Bank shall refund to 
Lebanon such portion of the guarantee fee 
stipulated in Section 2.02(a) above as is 
equal to the product obtained by multiplying 
the amount appearing in the column entitled 
“Fee Refund at end of quarter” opposite the 
date appearing in the column entitled “Date” 
set out in Schedule 1 hereto (and being the 
date of the then immediately next following 
calendar quarter date) by a fraction, the 
numerator of which shall be equal to the 
aggregate principal amount of Bonds which 
have been redeemed or purchased, as the case 
may be, and canceled, and the denominator of 
which shall be equal to US$100,000,000.  For 
greater certainty and for the purposes of 
this Section 2.02(b), Lebanon acknowledges 
and agrees that said refund shall not be 
prorated in the event that the cancellation 
of the Redeemed Bonds does not occur at the 
end of any quarterly period reflected in said

Form Redeemed Bonds;  and (ii) the IBRD 
Guarantee Amount and the obligations of 
Lebanon in respect thereto pursuant to 
Section 2.01(a)(i) above shall be 
correspondingly reduced by an amount equal to 
Page  7
the aggregate face value of the Redeemed 
Bonds.
Section 2.03.  (a) The obligations of 
Lebanon hereunder shall not be in any way 
discharged, modified or impaired by reason of 
any extension of time, forbearance, 
concession  or other indulgence which may be 
granted to the Bank by the Fiscal Agent or 
the holders of the Bonds, by any variation of 
the terms and conditions of the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement or the Bonds (other than to reduce 
the principal amount due on stated maturity), 
or any related agreement, nor by any other 
circumstances which would or might (but for 
this provision) constitute a discharge or 
stay of, or defense to, Lebanon’s obligation 
to reimburse or indemnify the Bank hereunder.
(b)
The Bank may at any time, 
without thereby discharging, impairing or 
otherwise affecting any rights, powers and 
remedies hereby created or conferred upon it 
by this Agreement, the Bonds, the Fiscal

conferred on the Bank by this Agreement shall 
be in addition to, and not in substitution 
for or derogation of, any other right which 
the Bank may at any time enjoy against 
Lebanon or any other person or entity in 
respect of reimbursement or indemnification 
against payments made or liabilities incurred 
under the IBRD Guarantee, provided always 
that the exercise and/or enforcement of any 
of these rights in conjunction with the 
rights, powers and remedies hereby conferred 
shall not result in the Bank obtaining 
reimbursement or indemnification which 
exceeds the aggregate of all amounts and 
matters in respect of which the Bank is 
entitled to reimbursement and indemnification 
pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) and (ii) 
above.
(d)
The Bank shall not be obliged 
before taking steps to enforce any rights 
conferred on it by this Agreement or 
exercising any of its rights, powers and 
remedies hereunder, the Bonds, the Fiscal 
Agency Agreement or any other related 
agreement or by law: (i) to take action or 
obtain any judgment or award in any court or 
other tribunal of competent jurisdiction 
against any other person or entity (including 
persons or entities from whom it may seek 
reimbursement or indemnity in respect of sums 
Page  8
paid out under the IBRD Guarantee); or (ii) 
to enforce or seek to enforce any other 
rights it may have against Lebanon or its 
rights against any other person or entity.
Section 2.04.  Without limitation or 
restriction upon any of its other obligations 
hereunder, Lebanon hereby undertakes to 
punctually perform all of its obligations 
under the Bonds, the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
and any related agreement, and Lebanon 
further agrees that any amount due to the 
Bank by it hereunder shall be deemed, for 
purposes of Sections 6.02(b)(iii) and 
7.01(d)(ii) of the General Conditions, to be 
an amount due in consequence of a guarantee 
extended by the Bank to a third party with 
the agreement of Lebanon.
