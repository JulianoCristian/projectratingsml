The\n            guarantee was successful in catalyzing private financing for\n            the power sector from the capital markets. Electricite du\n            Liban (EDL) is in the process of recovering from 17 years of\n            damage caused by the civil war. It would have been difficult\n            for EDL to access the commercial capital markets under its\n            own name. Therefore, while EDL is undergoing restructuring,\n            and sector reforms are in progress, the Government of\n            Lebanon has borrowed on behalf of EDL in order to maximize\n            the terms of the borrowing sought under the partial credit\n            guarantee. The extended maturity, the diversified investor\n            base, and the tightened spread, all achieved with the help\n            of the World Bank guarantee, should help to act as a\n            catalyst for future investments in Lebanon."}, "docdt": "1997-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
