risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: reforms and infrastructure investments\n            take time to implement. Arriving at the right mix of project\n            activities is difficult and requires trade-offs to be made.\n            Financing and implementation of municipal projects through\n            state-level institutions calls for a delicate balance\n            between state-level support and local ownership. The size of\n            investments is of critical importance when working through a\n            municipal fund. Successful introduction of new ideas or\n            standards takes time and continuous adjustment during\n            implementation. Stimulating the supply for goods and\n            services may help expedite project implementation. Setting\n            up beneficiary contributions correctly is a critical success\n            factor in pro-poor sanitation. Targeting the poor is\n            difficult and requires extensive preparatory work."}, "docdt": "2015-09-22T00:04:00Z"}
