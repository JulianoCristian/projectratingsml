numerous small rivers located throughout the State for\n            providing irrigation to about 66,000 ha of land throughout\n            the State of Orissa, where large scale irrigation or\n            groundwater development is not possible. The Project would\n            also improve water use efficiency at the farm level in\n            existing major irrigation systems. The Project consists of:\n            (a) over the next five years, construction of about 15\n            medium-scale irrigation projects (MIPs) (MIPs are irrigation\n            projects that encompass cultivable command areas covering\n            between 2,000 and 12,000 ha); (b) command area development\n            (CAD), over a four year period, in three existing major\n            irrigation projects located in Orissa (Mahanadi Delta,\n            Hirakud, Salandi), consisting of land consolidation covering\n            about 200,000 ha; and on-farm works, including construction\n            of field channels, drains, and structures covering a\n            consolidated area of about 57,000 ha."}, "docdt": "1977-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
