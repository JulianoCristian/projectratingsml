The Project would\n            also improve water use efficiency at the farm level in\n            existing major irrigation systems. The Project consists of:\n            (a) over the next five years, construction of about 15\n            medium-scale irrigation projects (MIPs) (MIPs are irrigation\n            projects that encompass cultivable command areas covering\n            between 2,000 and 12,000 ha); (b) command area development\n            (CAD), over a four year period, in three existing major\n            irrigation projects located in Orissa (Mahanadi Delta,\n            Hirakud, Salandi), consisting of land consolidation covering\n            about 200,000 ha; and on-farm works, including construction\n            of field channels, drains, and structures covering a\n            consolidated area of about 57,000 ha."}, "docdt": "1977-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
