designed\n            to reduce transport costs, increase system wide operational\n            efficiency and increase foreign exchange earnings. The\n            environment in Budapest will be improved by the diversion of\n            heavy commercial vehicles from the city to the motorway\n            (M-O) by-pass. There are three components : a railways\n            component, a Hungarocamion (Hungarian International Freight\n            Company) component, and a highways component. The railways\n            component will provide computer aided wagon and locomotive\n            control systems, as well as freight and financial management\n            systems, a recycling plant for old rails, and track\n            maintenance and construction machinery. For Hungarocamion,\n            an integrated and computerized information system, and\n            handling equipment for transit distribution stores will be\n            financed. The highways component will involve the\n            construction of the second segment of the new, four lane\n            Budapest bypass, engineering supervision and project\n            management, a program of periodic maintenance of national\n            roads, and a motorway emergency call system. The project\n            will also provide a traffic information and control system\n            for the Budapest Transport Company, and a technical\n            assistance component for training in the computerized\n            management information systems."}, "docdt": "1989-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
