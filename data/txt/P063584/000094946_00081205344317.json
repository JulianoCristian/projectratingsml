Project (ZAMSIF), which\n            finances community grants for investing in social and\n            economic infrastructure, and improving natural resources\n            management. Negative environmental impacts will be\n            alleviated by the following mitigation measures: Soil\n            degradation will be reduced by watershed management\n            activities that control erosion (using fast-growing tree\n            crops, stabilizing exposed soil with grasses or other ground\n            covering, designing terraces on hillsides), projects which\n            encourage composting, activities to control forest and bush\n            fires, increasing drought preparedness, and improving\n            management of communal grazing. Deforestation will be\n            reduced by establishing community managed wood lots and\n            forestry management, employing reforestation, establishing\n            tree nurseries, improving use of fuel resources, and\n            creating greenbelts in urban areas. Air and water pollution\n            will be controlled by disposing of solid and hazardous\n            waste, collecting garbage, recycling waste, improving\n            drainage with small-scale works, building communal latrines,\n            and filling quarries. To prevent the incidence of disease,\n            bore holes will be located away from toilets and waste\n            disposal facilities as will a separate waste disposal system\n            for medical wastes and other non-infectious waste, and the\n            public will be educated in proper sanitation, health, and hygiene."}, "docdt": "2000-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
