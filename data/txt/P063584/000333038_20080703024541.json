Investment Fund Project\n            (ZAMSIF) for Zambia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the implementation of the\n            Decentralization policy was a pre-requisite for the project\n            activities to have its intended impact. The ZAMSIF\n            implementation experience demonstrates that failure in\n            public sector management can pose a serious constraint to\n            achievement of intended project outcomes. Clear guidelines\n            and procedures are a prerequisite for facilitating community\n            development and ensuring accountability of resources.\n            Adherence to guidelines and processes ensures that\n            subprojects supported meet the standards and sector norms\n            and are addressing community priority needs. Diversification\n            of subproject portfolio achieved through improved\n            facilitation for participatory rural appraisal (PRA)\n            processes and implementation of the information, education\n            and communication (IEC) strategy leads to improvement in the\n            sector spread of subproject portfolio from the traditional\n            dominant sectors such as education and health to\n            non-traditional sectors of roads, HIV/AIDS and income\n            enhancement in order to improve beneficiaries' livelihoods."}, "docdt": "2008-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
