Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), two main strategic objectives of the\n            Government of Zambia: 1) decentralization and empowering\n            local authorities to improve governance and efficiency in\n            service delivery; and 2) increasing access to basic social\n            services through direct poverty interventions. There are\n            four main project components. The Community Investment Fund\n            component consists of community-based small projects\n            including social mobilization, infrastructure, improved\n            natural resources management, service delivery activities,\n            and capacity building for communities. The second component\n            establishes a Direct Investment Fund, comprising larger\n            projects benefiting more than one community to be managed\n            and executed by district authorities; and builds capacity\n            and training for local governments and administrations. The\n            third component, Poverty Monitoring and Analysis, funds data\n            collection and training and capacity building on financial,\n            technical, and institutional issues; and sponsors workshops\n            and information dissemination. The fourth component finances\n            institutional support for ZAMSIF, supplying administration\n            and operating costs, assessments, poverty maps, training,\n            and capacity building."}, "docdt": "2000-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
