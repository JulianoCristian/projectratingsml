There\n            are three main project components. The first supports the\n            rapid privatization of about 27 important firms through\n            internationally accepted methods, using best practices that\n            ensure transparency, competitive tendering, and appropriate\n            sales techniques for the companies being privatized. The\n            second component strengthens the capacity of the Republic of\n            Serbia Agency for Privatization to undertake a complex\n            privatization program using best practices. the third\n            component supports foreign investment and the deregulation\n            of the business environment by strengthening the\n            institutional capacity of the Republic of Agencies for\n            Foreign Investment, for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)\n            Development, and the SME Department of the Ministry of\n            Economy and Privatization, which will supervise the\n            implementation of the new liberalized policies."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
