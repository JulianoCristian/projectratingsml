Implementation Status and Key Decisions

Project implementation is satisfactory. The Project has supported Brazil in achieving 21 of the 50 quantitative national targets defined by the UN
Convention on Biological Diversity. Among the important results in terms of mainstreaming biodiversity in governmental sectors are the adoption in
2012 of the National Policy on Agroecology and Organic Production (Decree No 7,794/2012) and the related National Plan officially launched on
October 2013 and the creation of the Virtual Institute for Biodiversity (Painel Bio) in 2014 with the participation, as members, of 17 governmental
and non-governmental institutions.

The Project has also developed innovative biodiversity criteria and policy guidelines for strategic sectors (agriculture, fisheries and health), including
the implementation of private sector subprojects in more than four million hectares in four major Brazilian biomes (Amazonia, Cerrado, Pampa and
Atlantic Forest) involving various productive sectors and approaches (traditional cattle ranching, forest management, etc).

The project closing date is December 31st , 2014. The project’s last mission took place on December 1st to 4, 2014.
This ISR was cleared by Benoit Blarel, Practice Manager (GENDR) and Gregor Wolf, Program Leader (LCC5C).
