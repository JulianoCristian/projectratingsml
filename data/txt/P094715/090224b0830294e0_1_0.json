National Biodiversity\n            Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project for\n            Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to global environment outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: environmental mainstreaming projects\n            invariably involve institutional complexity in view of their\n            multi-sectoral nature and terms of the number of individual\n            ministries and agencies involved. Designing results\n            frameworks for biodiversity mainstreaming projects, where\n            cooperation among institutions is a central objective, can\n            be challenging. Recognizing the difference in institutional\n            capacity and constraints that different agencies face,\n            several of the partner beneficiaries highlighted in the\n            consultations that there should be a mechanism to allow\n            those with greater capacity to absorb more funding, which\n            is, not including an initial fixed funding allocation by\n            partner beneficiaries. Projects that involve funding for\n            private sector initiatives, that require commitment by those\n            partners should define very realistic targets as the broader\n            macroeconomic environment can affect demand."}, "docdt": "2015-06-15T02:54:00Z"}
