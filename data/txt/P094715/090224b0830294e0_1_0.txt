                                    xvii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Brazil is acknowledged as the most biodiversity rich country in the world, with an
estimated one-fifth of the known species of plants and animals within its national borders.
The country has a wide range of climate zones ranging from humid tropics to semiarid
and temperate areas, comprising several ecologically differentiated biogeographical
zones (biomes). Brazil contains the world’s largest inland wetland (Pantanal), expanses
of semiarid thorn forests (Caatinga), vast tree and scrub woodlands (Cerrado), and more
than 7,000 linear kilometers of coastal and marine ecosystems. With more than 90
percent of the Atlantic Forest biome, half of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, and more
than 15 percent of the Amazon Forest Biome already deforested, large numbers of
biodiversity components in Brazil were considered in danger of becoming extinct. The
Government of Brazil (GOB) officially recognized more than 600 animal species as
being threatened with extinction.

2.      At the time of Project Appraisal, habitat conversion or loss, invasive species and
diseases were the main drivers of biodiversity loss that usually fell within the following
categories: demographic change, inequality and poverty, macroeconomic policies and
infrastructure construction, social changes, and developmental biases. In terms of
economic activities, agricultural expansion, including plantation forestry and grazing,
was the most important factor that threatened biodiversity, followed by invasion of exotic
species, burning, road construction and mining. The main impact was clear-cut
deforestation, followed by others such as erosion, flooding, soil and water pollution,
landscape fragmentation, toxic runoff and water contamination, among others.

3.      Brazil had committed under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to the
global target of achieving by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of
biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level. However, there existed an
intrinsic difficulty in generating a robust estimate of biodiversity loss, and the GOB, to
address this gap, had carried out a set of diagnostic studies to estimate the rate of
ecosystem, species and genetic biodiversity loss in Brazil and in each of the country’s
seven biomes (Amazonia, Cerrado, Pantanal, Caatinga, Atlantic Forest, Pampa, Coastal
Zone and Marine). Although those studies provided insight, it was clear that additional
work would be needed to obtain a valid estimate for each of Brazil’s biomes and for the
entire country, in order to monitor, mitigate and reduce biodiversity loss.

4.       At the time of Appraisal of the National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and
Institutional Consolidation Project (NBMIC, the Project) in February 2006, many
institutions shared responsibility for managing biodiversity in Brazil, but there had been
little effort to mainstream biodiversity concerns. Numerous ministries, institutes,
secretariats, and departments within the GOB, and hundreds of national and international
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and foundations were implementing thousands
of projects. Universities, consulting firms and other private sector institutions were also
involved in biodiversity conservation. Many projects supported by bi-national and



                                            1
multinational donors had been successful, but most efforts at mainstreaming biodiversity
conservation had remained sporadic, uncoordinated and isolated, with the consequence
that successes and lessons were either not shared or lost altogether. Further, efforts to
address conservation policies and practices had not been well integrated across economic
sectors, among public agencies, and between the public and private sectors, despite the
enormous impact that other sectors can have on biodiversity. Conservation initiatives
were almost exclusive the domain of biodiversity and environmental actors. However,
their impact had been limited, and government funding, from ministries other than the
Ministry of the Environment (MMA) was limited or nonexistent. Finally, the scale of
biodiversity-related activities was considered suboptimal, having concentrated primarily
on small, local, community-based economic activities that lacked sufficient scale to make
a significant contribution to halting biodiversity loss in a country as large, and with as
extensive a biodiversity, as Brazil.

5.       Several issues had been identified for Brazil’s lack of success in mainstreaming
biodiversity concerns into policy and development, and the Project was designed to test
and implement solutions designed to remedy these, which included: (i) lack of
information relevant to policymakers; (ii) insufficient analysis of threats and problems;
(iii) failure of decision makers to ask the right questions; (iv) geographic and spatial
differences of scale; (v) exclusion of lower-level decision makers from policymaking;
(vi) differences between different forms of economic development; (vii) lack of
recognition of the role and impact of the private sector in the process of land use change
and occupation; (viii) lack of coordination of financial mechanisms and economic
instruments to finance conservation; (ix) lack of public awareness and support for
biodiversity conservation, and (x) no public sector responsibility to value biodiversity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the National Biodiversity
Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project was to promote mainstreaming of
biodiversity at the national level in key public and private sector planning strategies and
practices as well as to consolidate and strengthen institutional capacity to produce and
disseminate relevant biodiversity information and concepts1.

7.       Three key indicators were defined to measure progress towards the PDO:
        At least three key economic sectors 2 incorporate biodiversity criteria and
         guidelines in their plans and policies by end of year six of the Project;


1
  The wording of the PDO in the Project Appraisal Document was slightly different, as follows: The development
objectives of the National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation (Biodiversity Mainstreaming)
Project is to promote mainstreaming of biodiversity at the national level in key government and private sector planning
strategies and practices, and to consolidate and strengthen institutional capacity to produce biodiversity information
relevant to mainstreaming.

2
  “Sector” was defined in the context of the Project as an area of economic activity such as agriculture, forestry,
fisheries, mining and energy production and transmission. This was not necessarily aligned with ministerial


                                                          2
         Tangible progress is made toward achieving at least 16 of the 50 quantitative
          national targets established for Brazil as part of the CBD targets for 2010; tracked
          by a strategic set of monitoring indicators;
         At least 1 million hectares of affected landscapes under integrated conservation
          and sustainable use of biodiversity are established in Biodiversity Priority Areas
          with significant involvement by the private sector by the end of year six of the
          Project.

8.    In addition, three intermediate results that would contribute to the attainment of
the PDO were defined, one corresponding to each of the three technical project
components, as follows:
    Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity incorporated into select
      government sectors;
    Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity incorporated into key private
      sector planning strategies and practices; and
    A consolidated and coordinated network of key Brazilian institutions working on
      biodiversity issues and producing relevant information for the development and
      implementation of biodiversity mainstreaming policies.

9.      The Project’s Global Environmental Objective was to contribute to the reduction
of the current rate of biodiversity loss, Brazil’s contribution to the 2010 goals and targets
of the CBD.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.       The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The Project was not targeted at a specific group of beneficiaries, per se. Rather, if
successful, it was expected to contribute to a significant reduction of the current rate of
biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels, as a contribution to poverty
alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth, according to the global target for 2010 of
the CBD’s Strategic Plan. The Project was directly related to, and expected to contribute
to GEF Strategic Priority BD2 (Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Production Landscapes
and Sectors) and BD2 (Generation and Dissemination of Best Practices for Addressing
Current and Emerging Biodiversity Issues). To achieve its objectives, under its
Component 1, the Project would provide financial and technical assistance to government
ministries, NGOs, and other institutions covering initially the agriculture, health, science
and technology, environment, forestry, fisheries, and water resources sectors, chosen for


responsibilities since, for example, both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agrarian Development are
responsible for overlapping aspects of agriculture and rural development policy. It was considered essential that both
inter- and intrasectoral strategies be integrated in mainstreaming approaches.




                                                          3
their impact on biodiversity and for the willingness of the relevant institutions to
participate fully. Institutions representing other sectors such as transport, energy and
mining were expected also to participate under the Project. In addition, through
financing to be made available under Component 2 for the creation and management of
an Opportunities Fund, housed in and managed by FUNBIO, the Project would benefit
producer groups, associations, cooperatives, chambers of commerce and large firms to
promote private sector strategies and policies that support biodiversity conservation.
Finally, under Component 3, the Project would benefit institutions responsible for
development and implementation of biodiversity policy by providing capacity building
and establishing mechanisms for coordination amongst them, as well as by promoting the
generation and exchange of biodiversity information relevant to policymakers that would
inform the global scientific community and contribute to Brazil’s CBD commitments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.   The Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project
comprised three technical components and on component for project administration, as
summarized below.

13.    Component 1: Mainstreaming Biodiversity into Selected Public and Economic
Sectors (Total: US$33.4 million, GEF US$8.4 million)

14.     This component was designed to support the implementation of the National
Biodiversity Policy and promote the mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use at scale. This was to be achieved through government actions aimed at
different economic sectors with the purpose of seeking the support of relevant
stakeholders. Each mainstreaming initiative was to follow four main steps: (i)
consolidation of existing information; (ii) consensus building with stakeholders; and (iii)
development of chosen solutions. Government agencies would dedicate attention and
resources to the identification and implementation of large-scale mainstreaming
opportunities at a national level that enjoyed the support of relevant stakeholders. These
opportunities would be tested on the ground through applied sector activities under this
component, as well as through landscape-scale subprojects under Component 2.

15.   Component 2: Mainstreaming Biodiversity into the Private Sector (Total
US$30.0 million, GEF US$7.5 million)

16.    The objective of this component was to incorporate the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity into key private sector planning strategies and practices.
The main mechanism for implementing this was the creation and management of an
Opportunities Fund, housed in and managed by FUNBIO, which provided support based
on the assessment of proposals received and on inducement of subprojects developed to
address the possibility of mainstreaming biodiversity in integrated large-scale productive
landscapes. Activities would be carried out in coordination with relevant public sector
agencies.




                                            4
17.    Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Generation of Biodiversity
Information for Policymaking (Total US$31.1 million, GEF US$6.1 million)

18.     The objective of this component was to strengthen, consolidate, and coordinate a
network of key Brazilian institutions working on biodiversity issues to produce
information relevant to the development and implementation of biodiversity
mainstreaming policies. This network would support progress toward Brazil’s CBD
targets for 2010 by promoting appropriate policies and practices and the dissemination of
biodiversity information relevant to policymaking. This Component would also monitor
the progress made on key biodiversity indicators, including those linked to the CBD
targets for 2010. The two goals were considered linked: the generation of relevant
information requires stronger, better coordinated institutions, and the information
produced would further strengthen the capacity of the biodiversity sectors, especially as it
relates to public policy development.

19.  Component 4: Project Coordination and Management (Total US$2.5 million,
GEF US$0.0 million)

20.    This component would support the other project activities by ensuring efficient
implementation, supervision, coordination, and administration. The Project was to be
coordinated by the MMA, through its Secretariat for Biodiversity and Forests (SBF), and
executed through a contract between MMA and FUNBIO. The National Biodiversity
Commission (CONABIO) was to provide consultative oversight for the Project on
biodiversity priorities, policies, and guidelines. It would also support workshops,
conferences, and special events as well as publication and dissemination of information
generated by the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

21.     The Project’s Components were not revised. However, the GEF Grant
Agreement was amended through a project restructuring on November 25, 2013 in order
to capitalize the Opportunities Fund under Part 2(c) of the Project. As originally
designed in the Project, the Opportunities Fund would comprise both GEF resources and
co-financing designated for the financing of territorial mainstreaming subprojects, and
would be managed as a sinking fund as described in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD). It was envisaged, however, that any future capital contributions that were to be
mobilized could be managed as endowment funds to finance activities over a longer
period. Nevertheless, with initial start-up delays (Section 2.2), and private sector
subprojects submitted with a medium- to long-term implementation period, it became
clear that FUNBIO would not be able to account for use of funds before the Grant’s
December 31, 2013 Closing Date. With this, and to allow for the implementation of the
private sector biodiversity mainstreaming strategy that contemplated actions with both a
geographical focus and a sectorial approach (leading to a stronger impact of project
activities), it was necessary to adjust the Opportunities Fund to the requirements for
Conservations Funds, as provided in Operational Policy 10.20, Global Environment
Facility Operations. The restructuring also extended the Grant’s Closing Date by one



                                             5
year to December 31, 2014 and reallocated US$1.0 million in of the Grant’s towards
capitalization of the Opportunities Fund.

1.7 Other significant changes

22.     In addition to the reallocation described in Section 1.6 above, two other
reallocation of Grant proceeds were approved on July 27, 2012 and October 31, 2014. A
summary of the three reallocations is presented in Table 1 below.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.     Government Commitment. The GOB had adopted several initiatives to reduce
the loss of biodiversity, and was fully committed to achieving the CBD targets to which it
had committed, and putting in place the policies, strategies and mechanisms necessary to
do so (Section 1.1). Since the ratification of the CBD in 1994, the GOB with the support
of the GEF and other international assistance, had taken decisive measures to implement
the CBD’s three objectives, including: enhancement of the legal framework, institutional
capacity building of the MMA, establishment of national policies, programs, and major
projects. The GOB had taken several initiatives to reduce the loss of biodiversity,
including the creation in 1995 of a set of interconnected instruments aimed at creating an
effective national biodiversity conservation strategy and sustainable use policy and
implementation programs. These included the establishment of the National Biodiversity
Program (PRONABIO), conceived as an intergovernmental and multi-institutional
program with establishing guidelines for the functioning of two other new mechanisms:
PROBIO and FUNBIO.               PROBIO, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Brazilian National Biodiversity Project had as
its main objective that of assisting the GOB in initiating a program for the conservation
and sustainable use of biodiversity by identifying priority actions, stimulating the
development of demonstration subprojects and disseminating biodiversity information.
FUNBIO, the GEF Brazilian Biodiversity Fund aimed to create a long-term sustainable
financing mechanism to promote conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity,
particularly vis-à-vis the private sector. Finally, the GOB had hosted the 8th Conference
of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP-8) that provided a unique
opportunity to bring together the best experts and policymakers on the subject.
International conferences on themes related to the CBD organized by the MMA during
the COP-8 served to highlight the challenges and experiences of different countries in
mainstreaming biodiversity into sectoral policies and programs, especially of the private
sector.

24.    Integrated Program of World Bank and GEF Assistance. Since that time,
numerous other World Bank- and GEF-financed projects and programs have supported
biodiversity conservation in Brazil, resulting in nearly a decade of complementary
experience across sectors in support of Brazilian biodiversity. The Project drew upon and
incorporated the lessons learned under those projects and programs, both closed and
ongoing, including: (i) the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program (ARPA); (ii) the
Rio de Janeiro Integrated Ecosystem Management in Production Landscapes of the
North-Northwestern Fluminense; (iii) the Integrated Management of Aquatic Resources
in the Amazon; (iv) the Biodiversity Enterprise Fund for Latin America---Terra Capital
Fund; (v) the First Programmatic Loan for Environmental Sustainability; (vi) the
Environmental Sustainability Agenda Technical Assistance Loan; and (vii) several
municipal-level project that were breaking new ground in environmental work and
mainstreaming. Consistent with the World Bank’s Environment Strategy, the Project’s
design and preparation also drew upon the World Bank’s experience in other countries of



                                            7
mainstreaming of environment into sector lending by stressing the need for cross-sectoral
approaches to environmental issues. Consequently, the Rationale for World Bank
involvement was strong. Finally, the design of the Project’s monitoring strategy drew
heavily on lessons learned from previous monitoring efforts, most of which had been
considered moderately satisfactory.

25.      Institutional Complexity. The Project was very ambitious and its institutional
arrangements were complex, but necessarily so for a project that aimed to promote and
institutionalize a cross-sectoral approach to biodiversity mainstreaming. The MMA,
through its Secretariat for Biodiversity and Forests, was responsible for overall
coordination, and a Project Coordination Committee composed of project partners and
chaired by the MMA was put in place to oversee project activities and ensure consistency
and synergy among its many executing agencies. FUNBIO was responsible for
implementation of Component 2; MMA for implementation of Components 1, 3 and 4.
Caixa Econômica Federal (CAIXA, a Federal Government Bank) was responsible for
financial management for the MMA-implemented components. In addition, project funds
were allocated to eight project beneficiaries (MMA, JBRJ, MAPA, EMBRAPA, MCTI,
MS and FIOCRUZ and ICMBio) to implement specific activities assigned to them, as
agreed in Annual Operational Plans approved by the Project Coordination Committee.

26.     Participatory Process. The Project’s preparation followed a highly participatory
process, in which representatives from at least ten governmental and nongovernmental
organizations with a stake in biodiversity conservation participated. In fact, as an integral
part of this mainstreaming project, co-financing had been secured, and partnerships
established with major stakeholders including the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Supply (MAPA), Ministry of Health (MS), Ministry of Science and Technology (MCTI),
the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), the Chico Mendes Institute of Biodiversity
Conservation (ICMBio, the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden (JBRJ), the Brazilian
Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), the Brazilian Network of Botanical
Gardens (RBJB), and NGOs. Informal contributions were received from many others,
and following its participation in the international workshop during the COP-8 of the
CBD, the private sector had expressed motivation to participate in mainstreaming
biodiversity within Brazil’s business sectors and contributed to the Project’s design. The
participation of these experts, and their willingness to work together at the design phase
bode well for the implementation that would ultimately require cross- and multi-sector
coordination of a diverse set of organizations, governmental, non-governmental, and
private sector alike in order to succeedCo-financing was secured from seven different
governmental institutions, the private sector and NGOs among others, as described in
Annex 5 of the PAD. This participatory process served to mitigate the main critical risk
identified during preparation: that of lack of support from within government and society
for a project that depended on a high degree of acceptance by a number of different
government ministries, and by the private sector and civil society to succeed in
mainstreaming biodiversity within different economic sectors.




                                             8
2.2 Implementation

27.     The World Bank’s Board approved the US$22.0 million Grant for the Project on
January 31, 2008. The Grant Agreement was signed on March 14, 2008, and became
effective on September 11, 2008. A project launch seminar including representatives of
all implementing agencies took place in October 2008.

28.     Initial Delays. Project implementation was slow at first, in part due to the
Project’s institutional complexity as roles and procedures for project implementation
required further definition and structure. Important project activities related to the
mainstreaming and adoption of biodiversity policies in public and private sectors took
longer than planned due to the need to sensitize both sectors while looking for
opportunities for negotiating the incorporation of principles of conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity which appeared strategically complex. The Project’s GEO
(PDO), Implementation Progress, FM, Project Management, and Procurement ratings in
the Implementation Status and Results Reports were downgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory briefly from mid-2010 until the Mid-Term Review in early-2011 when they
were upgraded to reflect the increased pace of implementation.

29.     2008 Financial Crisis. The Project became effective just as the international
financial and economic crisis was unfolding. As a result, subprojects submissions to the
Opportunities Fund under Category 2 aimed at changing production processes to
incorporate biodiversity concepts and practices in the business strategies, prospecting and
negotiating subprojects with the private sector took longer than anticipated. In addition,
most of the subprojects that were put forward negotiated a medium/long-term
implementation period. To address this, the Project was restructured to adjust the
Opportunities Fund to the requirements for Conservation Funds as per OP 10.20 Global
Environment Facility Operations (Section 1.6).

30.     Mid-Term Review (MTR). At the time of the MTR (March 28-31, and April 6,
2011), implementation was still slower than expected. Given initial delays, grant
disbursements totaled slightly less than 30 percent, but had been accelerating. An
Independent Evaluation prepared in advance of the MTR showed that the Project was
audacious and strategically well positioned in relation to the new guidelines of the CBD
(Aichi) targets. Nevertheless, the Project had not achieved the majority of its mid-term
objectives and targets, but it was clear that its implementing agencies were learning to
operate in its complex institutional context and demonstrating improvements in their
implementation capacity. The evaluation recommended some adjustments to the Project
structure, however, the critical factors for its success were the alignment of its initiatives
(projects, subprojects and activities) to the Project’s overall objective of promoting
mainstreaming of biodiversity at the national level in key public and private sector
planning strategies and practices and the construction of customized approaches for the
establishment of dialogues with the different sectors of the national economy. Minor
adjustments were agreed to the mechanisms for identification of subprojects under
Subcomponent 1.2. Originally, these were to be identified and put forward based on
sector workshops carried out through a defined, four-step process to be carried out under



                                              9
Subcomponent 1.1. Instead, the subprojects put forward included initiatives that were
already under development or being contemplated by the project beneficiaries, which had
already been through the assessment, consensus-building and development process
contemplated under Subcomponent 1.1, albeit not with Grant financing.

31.     Staffing. As is to be expected for a project with relatively long implementation
period, and numerous executing agencies, changes in staffing occurred throughout. This
involved both agency staff and consultants, and affected especially staff of the PCU in
MMA that in addition suffered staffing reductions during implementation. Many of the
project beneficiaries that counted on advice and support from PCU staff for routine
administrative issues highlighted this lack of continuity and these shortages of staffing as
an issue affecting their implementation of subprojects (while, at the same time,
commending the quality and disposition of existing staff, despite their work overload).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     M&E Design. Strengthening capacity for monitoring biodiversity was very much
at the center of and implicit in the Project’s PDO. As such, the design of M&E involved
project progress monitoring (managerial monitoring) to manage the implementation
schedule of planned activities and to evaluate the adequacy of schedule and execution,
based on the Project’s Results Framework. The Project Coordination Unit in MMA
would be responsible for project monitoring. More importantly, however, it also
involved strengthening capacity to monitor progress towards 2010 CBD targets (Annex
11), including establishment of the Brazilian Virtual Institute for Biodiversity that would
be responsible for collecting data on progress toward these targets and compiling the
results for reporting purposes. The Project also included under Component 4 funding for
independent assessments of project progress.

33.     The design of the Project’s RF was somewhat complex, as could be expected for a
complex project involving numerous institutions promoting a multi-sectoral approach. In
some cases, there appeared to be a slight overlap in the Intermediate Results Indicators,
with activities carried out under subprojects under Category 1 contributing to the
achievement of more than one indicator. For example, activities that led to the
achievement of the indicator “at least 6 policy initiatives…..designed and adopted in
selected areas through consultative process”, could also be considered toward the
achievement of the indicator “at least 12 policy subprojects designed and implemented in
partnership with key government sectors”. Also, the Outcome Indicator “Progress
toward the achievement of 2010 CBD targets for Brazil tracked by a strategy for selected
monitoring indicators”, did not actually require progress towards achievement of the
indicators, although this was measured during implementation, as described below.

34.    M&E Implementation and Utilization. M&E was implemented well, with data
submitted by implementing agencies and project beneficiaries, and progress reports
compiled by the PCU routinely tracked progress. Several indicators and targets were
redefined during implementation, although not in a formal restructuring (Annex 2, in
Comments). Project monitoring also provided input (as well as strengthening project



                                            10
beneficiaries’ systems to monitor) for tracking progress towards Brazil’s progress
towards the CBD 2010 targets. The Outcome Indicator mentioned above was tracked as
“Tangible progress is made toward achieving at least 16 of the 50 quantitative national
targets already established for Brazil as part of the CBD targets for 2010”. And while
tracking of this indicator allows for identifying the Project’s contribution towards the
number of targets impacted (Annex 2), it does not allow for attributing by how much
each of the Project’s subprojects contributed towards progress. Finally, in preparation for
the MTR, and later upon project completion, external assessments were prepared,
including consultation with project beneficiaries, and the findings of those assessments
are incorporated throughout this ICR. As an integral aspect of the Project, progress
towards putting in place strengthened M&E is also discussed under Section 3.2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
35.     Safeguards.       The Project was classified as Category B, requiring an
Environmental Analysis but not a full-scale Environmental Assessment (EA) Study.
Nevertheless, during preparation the MMA and FUNBIO carried out an EA covering all
the safeguard policies triggered by the Project. These included: (i) Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01); (ii) Natural Habitats (OP 4.04); (iii) Pest Management (OP 4.09);
(iv) Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), and (v) Forests. As expected, the EA found
that the effects of the Project on the environment were likely to be overwhelmingly
positive. Still, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), including a short Pest
Management Plan were prepared and incorporated in the Project’s Operational Manual
(OM) to provide a framework for assessing potential impacts, and presenting specific
activities, responsibilities and budgets to ensure the implementation of any needed
mitigating measures.

36.     Reviews of safeguard compliance were carried out periodically throughout
implementation, and confirmed the multiple benefits for the conservation and sustainable
use of biodiversity derived from project activities and actions. During the MTR, project
activities planned through completion were reviewed and it was confirmed that no social
safeguards should be triggered. Nevertheless, the principles and procedures to be
followed in the event that any project activities would involve donation of land or
indigenous peoples were discussed, and the OM was updated to reflect agreed procedures.
Throughout implementation support and field visits, the multiple benefits for the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity derived from project activities and
actions were confirmed.

37.     Fiduciary. Procurement was carried out by each of the Project’s beneficiary
partners and executing agencies, coordinated by FUNBIO and the Project’s PCU in
MMA. Although there were no major issues with the Project’s procurement
arrangements, all beneficiaries and executing agencies alike highlighted the difficulties in
following the World Bank’s Guidelines, especially insofar as there were differences with
Brazil’s National Procurement Legislation, Law No. 8666. Unfamiliar with specific
World Bank Guidelines and Procedures, beneficiaries’ staff responsible for goods and
services procurement were often reluctant to follow procedures other than those provided




                                            11
in National Legislation, and the back and forth of documentation to the PCU often
resulted in procurement delays.

38.     Responsibility for the Project’s financial management (FM) was shared by both
FUNBIO and CAIXA, each with specific responsibilities, structure and FM arrangements.
FM risk was considered moderate, especially in view of the large number of partners and
activities. FM was reviewed regularly, and found generally satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory throughout implementation, as arrangements including staffing/personnel,
budgeting, accounting, internal control, funds flow, financial reporting and auditing
adhered to standards required by the World Bank. With respect to FUNBIO, the main
issues noted in FM implementation support and supervision reporting related to: (i) a
change in the Designated Account from US Dollars to Brazilian Reais; (ii) Interim
Financial Reports being created in Excel, increasing the risk of errors in recording of
transactions (the Project eventually provided funding to cover expenses associated with
the development and maintenance of FUNBIO’s Cérebro System); (iii) insufficient
controls to ensure that the values of financial and in kind counterpart funds were included
in IFRs, and (iv) the need for further clarity in the management arrangements for the
Opportunities Fund, particularly with respect to the execution of subprojects to be
executed after the Grant’s Closing Date. With respect to CAIXA, the main issues noted
in FM implementation support and supervision reporting related to: (i) weaknesses in the
controls relating to the advances made to the partners and the large variations between the
budgeted values versus the actual values disbursed; (ii) a need to strengthen control
procedures to ensure that the values of the financial and in kind counterpart funds were
promptly included in the IFRs, and (iii) the control of the execution of the budgeted
values was done in Excel, leading to the possibility of human errors. Although CAIXA’s
IFRs continued to be generated in Excel, these minor issues were addressed, and overall
FM arrangements provided accurate and timely financial information and reasonable
assurances that project funds were used for the purposes intended. Independent auditors
routinely audited project financial statements in accordance with international standards,
and the World Bank received the unqualified audit opinions in a timely fashion.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.      All of the institutions and organizations that participated in and benefited from the
Project are established institutions that will continue to exercise their mandated functions
upon completion, albeit in a more coordinated and strengthened policy framework under
the auspices of the MMA. Brazil has committed to a set of 20 streamlined National CBD
Targets 2011-2020, and now benefiting from the coordination of PainelBio, these
institutions and organizations will continue to work together towards these targets, which
include continued dissemination of information related to progress under the systems
established/supported under the Project, in support of Brazil’s biodiversity. The main
issue, as is to be expected, is one of continued funding (over and above their normal
budgets) needed to make decisive progress on mainstreaming and reversing biodiversity
loss. Several of the agencies (e.g., MCTI) have incorporated activities implemented under
the Project in their institutional Plano Pluri-Annual and have allocated funding to
continued implementation. The GOB, in its Fifth National Report to the CBD,



                                             12
recognizes the importance of securing resources and meeting capacity, and highlights that
MMA will be preparing a national strategy for mobilizing resources and meeting capacity
needs. The MMA will contract the Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (the
Insitute of Applied Economic Research, IPEA) to expand its current work on the
quantification, analysis and monitoring of environmental expenditures within the federal
government to include also expenditures specifically for biodiversity at both the state and
federal levels. MMA also intends to work with the Brazilian Business Council for
Sustainable Development and the National Confederation of Industries and IPEA to
establish a common methodology for inventorying environmental expenditures within the
private sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.      The Project’s objectives, both its PDO and GEO, were relevant at the time it was
approved, and continue to be Highly relevant to this day. Brazil is the most biologically
diverse country in the world (Section 1.1). Approximately 104,000 animal species and
43,000 plant species are currently known, comprising about 70 percent of the world’s
catalogued animal and plant species. Brazil hosts between 15 and 20 percent of the
world’s biological diversity, with the greatest number of endemic species on a global
scale. Through its international commitments and internal policies and programs, the
GOB has demonstrated its resolve to support the conservation and sustainable use of its
biodiversity, and to develop and implement policies and programs to integrate the
conservation and sustainable use of biological resources into sustainable development
strategies. Since the time of approval, Brazil has presented it Fourth National Report to
the CBD, reporting on progress towards the 2010 CBD targets and outlining future
priorities and challenges, has following a highly participatory process secured
CONABIO’s approval in September 2013 of the National Biodiversity Targets for 2020,
and has presented its Fifth National Report to the CBD, outlining progress, those targets
and future challenges. A key challenge was and continues to be further strengthening the
capacity to promote mainstreaming of biodiversity at the national level in key
government and private sector planning strategies and practices, and to consolidate and
strengthen institutions to produce biodiversity information relevant to mainstreaming.
The Project’s PDO and GEO focused appropriately on outcomes that, while ambitious,
were reasonable to achieve, based on the design of its components and activities and
satisfactory progress in their implementation. The Project’s PDO continues to be
relevant and supported by the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy FY2012-2015,
specifically in its fourth strategic objective(further improve the sustainable management
of natural resources and enhance resilience to climatic shocks while maximizing
contributions to local economic development, and helping to meet rising global food
demand) and a corresponding sub-objective (improving environmental management,
biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation). The Project’s GEO continues
to be relevant and supported by GEF Strategic Priority BD2 (Reduce Threats to Globally
Significant Biodiversity), BD3 (Sustainably Use Biodiversity), and, especially, BD4
(Mainstream Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use into Production



                                            13
Landscapes/Seascapes and Sectors), and by the corresponding programming priorities
outlines in GEF-6 Programming Directions.

41.      The Project’s design was by definition complex in view of the number of
institutions and agencies that necessarily had to be consulted and involved in
implementation given the objective of mainstreaming biodiversity across multiple sectors
and agencies. It did, however, include three well-defined investment components and
arrangements categorizing project activities to responsible executing agencies. The
Project’s implementation ensured the continued relevance of its design, and two
examples of this stand out. The arrangements for activities under Component 1 were
adjusted to respond to actual implementation realities (Section 2.2). Second, World
Bank’s team worked closely with the implementing agencies to improve implementation
and correct issues with the Project’s original design, as in the case of the Opportunities
Fund. Its design was modified in the Project Restructuring when the actual signing of
agreements with private sector entities had suffered delays, and that it became clear that
private sector subprojects submitted would require longer time for execution than
originally contemplated (Section 1.6).


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     The Project decisively made an impact on mainstreaming of biodiversity at the
national level in Brazil—both in the public and the private sector planning strategies and
practices, and in consolidating and strengthening institutional capacity to produce and
disseminate biodiversity information and concepts. It also, through activities it supported
in pursuit of its PDO, is expected to have a significant positive impact on reducing the
current rate of biodiversity loss (its GEO). The Project achieved and even surpassed
many of the originally defined outcome and intermediate outcome indicator targets. The
Achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated Substantial, in accordance
with progress towards the achievement of the three Outcome Indicators as summarized
below and presented in greater detail in the context of Intermediate Outcomes.

43.      Outcome Indicator 1: At least three key government sectors3 apply biodiversity
criteria and guidelines in their plans and policies by end of year six of the Project

44.     This indicator was complied, with several notable achievements supported by the
Project. Several sectors today incorporate biodiversity criteria in their plans and policies,
including health, agriculture and energy. In health, FIOCRUZ partnered with the MS to
incorporate policies for environmental health and surveillance in its plans and policies.



3
  “Sector” was defined in the context of the Project as an area of economic activity such as agriculture, forestry,
fisheries, mining and energy production and transmission. This was not necessarily aligned with ministerial
responsibilities since, for example, both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agrarian Development are
responsible for overlapping aspects of agriculture and rural development policy. It was considered essential that both
inter- and intra-sectoral strategies be integrated in mainstreaming approaches.




                                                         14
FIOCRUZ included biodiversity research and conservation in its statutes, and established
formally the Centro de Informação em Saúde Silvestre (CISS), that disseminates
information to society about among other things the interrelationships between
biodiversity and health (http://www.biodiversidade.ciss.fiocruz.br/). FIOCRUZ has been
designated a collaborating center of the World Health Organization/Pan-American Health
Organization on matters relating to environment and health, and is a scientific member of
the CBD and council member participating in the PainelBio (see below). FIOCRUZ
included formally several new activities in its Plano Pluriannual 2015-17, such as those
relating to biodiversity and urban health. In agriculture, the Project contributed in a
decisive manner to support MAPA’s role in public policies following its adoption in 2012
of a National Policy on Agro-ecology and Organic Production (Decree No. 7,794/2012)
and the related National Plan officially launched in October 2013. This Plan has as its
objectives to promote, expand and consolidate processes relating to access, sustainable
use, management, handling, recomposition and conservation of natural resources and
ecosystems in general, with two targets and 24 initiatives directly related to themes of
genetic resources, biodiversity, extraction and conservation of natural resources, and
budgeted through 2015. MAPA coordinates with the following ministries: MDA, MMA,
Education, Health, Social Development, MCTI, Fisheries and Aquaculture, and Finance.
In energy, the MMA together with ICMBio and the Empresa de Pesquisas Energéticas
(EPE), under the Ministry of Mines and Energy, carried out hydro-ecological studies on
the Tapajós and Juruena River basins, to guide to decisions relating to hydroelectric
projects as an input to environmental licensing processes. The study aimed to identify
critical areas for biodiversity conservation in the river basins and propose activities that
promote maintaining the connectivity of rivers. Several other achievements (MCTI,
JBRJ) towards formal incorporation of criteria in plans and programs are described below.

45.     Outcome Indicator 2: Tangible progress is made toward achieving at least 16 of
the 50 quantitative national targets established for Brazil as part of the CBD targets for
2010; tracked by a strategic set of monitoring indicators;

46.      The Project’s executing agencies and beneficiary partners contributed to Brazil’s
progress towards 31 of the 51 the National 2010 CBD targets (Annex 11). Monitoring of
progress towards these was carried out by individual agencies and partners, and compiled
by MMA. More importantly, the Project made a direct and decisive contribution to the
establishment of PainelBio (originally expected to be called Virtual Institute for
Biodiversity), a multi-stakeholder panel whose mission is to “contribute for the
conservation and sustainable use of Brazilian biodiversity by promoting synergy between
institutions and knowledge, making scientific information available to society, promoting
capacity building at various levels, and supporting decision making processes and public
policies for the achievement of the Aichi Targets in Brazil”. The International Union for
the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-Brasil is the Executive Secretary of PainelBio, and it
includes representation of 17 governmental and non-governmental institutions, including
MMA, ICMBio, MCTI, FIOCRUZ, World Wildlife Federation-Brasil, among others.
Concomitantly, in an initiative known as the “Dialogos sobre Biodiversidade” a series of
consultations were carried out to establish the National CBD 2020 targets that were
adopted formally following the approval of CONABIO Resolution No. 06 dated



                                            15
September 3, 2013. Targets for the period 2011-2020 (Aichi targets) are more succinct
and more easily quantifiable. Project activities already have contributed to progress
under at least ten of the 20 national CBD 2020 targets (Aichi targets), as presented in
Annex 11.

47.     Outcome Indicator 3: At least 1 million hectares of affected landscapes under
integrated conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are established in Biodiversity
Priority Areas with significant involvement by the private sector by the end of year six of
the Project.

48.     MAPA contributed expressively to the achievement of this outcome through the
establishment of 1,158,906.8 hectares of organic production units, with agricultural
production (735,704 hectares) and sustainable extraction of organic products (432,202.8
hectares).

49.     The progress towards intermediate outcomes that contributed to the above were
the following.

50.    Intermediate Outcome Component 1 - Conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity incorporated into select government sectors

51.    The Project financed several activities aimed to incorporate conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity into public policies, although as mentioned in Section 2.2,
the process followed for selecting the subprojects was not as originally contemplated and
given difficulties by MMA in hiring consultants’ services, and many of the activities
were in the end carried out by project beneficiaries. These included the following, in
addition to those described under Outcome Indicator 1 above:

      MMA – Sustainable Extraction, in which biodiversity criteria were applied at the
       municipal level to extraction practices, with training programs for the extraction
       of plants in the Caatinga that are used in industry;
      MMA – The consolidation of technical directives and good practices for
       management of 17 species affected by the extraction of non-timber forestry
       products;
      MAPA – Publication of phyto-sanitary products approved for use in organic agro-
       ecological agriculture;
      MAPA – Sustainable organic extraction project;
      MAPA – Study groups on agro-ecological organic agriculture;
      ICMBio – Implementation of Action Plans on threatened species;
      FIOCRUZ and MS – Strengthening of the national health surveillance system by
       aligning the CISS with the MS’ Centro de Informações Estratégicas e Resposta
       em Vigilância em Saúde (CIEVS)’
      FIOCRUZ and MCTI – Aligning SISS-Geo (CISS’ on-line, real-time information
       system on wildlife health) and those of FIOCRUZ’ biological collection to the
       Sistema de Informação Sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SIBBr) of the MCTI,
       an online platform developed with the aim of promoting and facilitating the


                                            16
       publication, integration, access and use of information on biodiversity
       (http://www.sibbr.gov.br/);
      FIOCRUZ and ICMBio – Aligning, through a formal cooperation agreement, the
       SISS-Geo with ICMBio’s Sistema de Autorização e Informação em
       Biodiversidade (SISBIO), an on-line system aimed to provide approval for
       research and the collection of biological material throughout the country,
       especially    threatened     species     in     federal    conservation      units
       (http://www.icmbio.gov.br/sisbio/); and
      FIOCRUZ – Establishment of a network of 43 wildlife health laboratories (Rede
       de Laboratórios em Saúde Silvestre), and an interactive network of wildlife health
       (Rede Participativa em Saúde Silvestre).

52.     EMBRAPA, the MAPA, ICMBio and FIOCRUZ contributed strongly to the
implementation of about 17 subprojects in partnership with government sectors that
aimed to transform traditional practices into biodiversity friendly ones, all consistent with
Brazil’s National Biodiversity Policy. EMBRAPA, through nine of its decentralized
units throughout the country, implemented several subprojects relating to the
development and appraisal of techniques and methodology that are favorable to
biodiversity in rural areas, thereby minimizing the impact of agricultural practices. These
subprojects contributed to public policies related to the use of native flora in regional
economies; studies relating to the identification and analysis of soil quality indicators that
provided input to public policies related to incentives to direct planting; studies on
conservation of species such as the coqueiro-gigante and the butiá, and the development
of conservation and storage methods so that farmers can utilize their own seeds.
MAPA’s subprojects contributed to one of the Project’s main achievements: National
Policy on Agro-ecology and Organic Production described above. The Project
contributed directly to initiatives related to seed production, sustainable extraction, phyto-
sanitary products and the development of technical materials. These initiatives resulted
in the compilation of a national cadaster of organic production (Cadastro Nacional de
Produtores Orgânicos) that includes over nine thousand producers in 1,182
municipalities in all Brazilian states. Finally, ICMBio put in place activities for 52
Action Plans for the protection of fauna, covering 62percent of the threatened fauna
species, and activities nationwide and involving a large number of stakeholders, related to
dissemination, appraisal and monitoring of those Plans.

53.    Intermediate Outcome Component 2 - Conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity incorporated into key private sector planning strategies and practices

54.    FUNBIO, prospecting for potential private sector subprojects, identified twelve
areas to be prioritized by mapping productive landscapes within priority conservation
areas                    (http://www.funbio.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ProbioII-
_Territ%C3%B3riosPotenciais_Funbio2.pdf), and reached out to at least 12 private sector
and other organizations supporting activities in those areas. Through the creation and
operation of the Opportunities Fund, capitalized in the amount US$18.8 million (US$5.5
million in Grant financing and US$13.3 million in counterpart funding), FUNBIO
supported the implementation of seven private sector subprojects that will cover


                                             17
approximately five million hectares of priority biodiversity conservation areas in three
biomes (Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Pampa).               Theses subprojects are being
implemented by partnerships between private sector companies, producers associations
and governmental and non-governmental organizations, and involve various productive
sectors including cocoa production, tropical forestry, sugar cane production and biofuels,
livestock, fisheries, non-timber forest products, sustainable and organic agriculture, rural
tourism, wildlife health and digital inclusion. Oversight of the implementation of the
subprojects is being conducted by FUNBIO, in accordance with the Opportunities Fund
operational manual. In addition, ten business plans were prepared and are posted in
FUNBIO’s knowledge base.4

55.     Intermediate Outcome Component 3 - A consolidated and coordinated network
of key Brazilian institutions working on biodiversity issues and producing relevant
information for the development and implementation of biodiversity mainstreaming
policies

56.      The Project achieved its goals of strengthening the technical, institutional and
organizational capacity of institutions involved in biodiversity conservation and of
establishing a network of those institutions, supported by sharing of improved knowledge
systems. Its most important achievement was the establishment and functioning of the
Brazilian Virtual Institute for Biodiversity (renamed PainelBio) as mentioned above. The
Center for Biodiversity Monitoring and Forecasting was not formally established but, in a
coordinated manner project beneficiaries opted to and generated inputs for more than ten
of the National 2010 CBD indicators. Plans for establishing this center are contingent on
further definition of a National Biodiversity Monitoring Strategy. Still MMA has
produced a mapping of the various biodiversity information systems, drafted a decree
related to biodiversity data both within the ministry and among relevant partners and has
established partnerships with other institutions to consolidate information. A technical
cooperation agreement is being discussed between ICMBio and MCTI with the World
Conservation Monitoring Center to align MMA’s biodiversity information systems,
possibly based on ICMBio’s SISBIO. Still, another achievement included information
systems networks exchanging biodiversity information such as the Biodiversity Heritage
Library (BHL)/Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and MAPA’s Sistema de
Informações          Gerenciais         da        Produção         Orgânica (SigOrgWeb)
http://sistemasweb.agricultura.gov.br/. The Consultative Committee of the BHL SciELO
network was established, criteria for selection of essential works on biodiversity were

  The business plans include: An Innovative Financial Mechanism: A proposed model to improve the sustainability of
FUNBIO’s future territorial projects; Sustainable Forests: Vision, challenges and risks for the sustainable forestry
sector and role of FUNBIO; Manejo e Conservação de Polinizadores de Tomateiro; Estado da arte de metodologias e
ferramentas voluntárias de compensação pelo setor privado; Ferramentas e mecanismos para o financiamento
socioambiental; Plano de Negócios para a Floresta Nacional de Irati; Quanto custa o Programa Áreas Protegidas da
Amazônia? Uma modelagem financeira para as Unidades de Conservação do Arpa; Quanto custa uma Unidade de
Conservação Federal? Uma visão estratégica para o Financiamento do Sistema Nacional de Unidades de
Conservação (SNUC); Salvaguardas Socioambientais para o setor privado atuar apoiando a criação, ampliação e
consolidação de áreas marinhas protegidas no Brasil; and HCV good practice – guidance for practicioners.




                                                        18
defined, and policies and procedures relating to the input of these works were approved.
At completion, 676 essential works had been input to the Rede de Bioliotecas Brasileiras
de Biodiversidade.

57.     Several specialized centers for fauna and flora priority areas were created
contributing to biodiversity conservation. The most significant of these are described
below, by implementing partner; other important achievements are listed in the RF in
Annex 2. JBRJ established the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora (National
Center for the Conservation of Flora, CNCFlora) in 2008 with a mandate to produce and
organize scientific knowledge that promotes the conservation of flora, including
developing conservation action plans (http://cncflora.jbrj.gov.br/portal). CNCFlora’s
objectives and mandate are aligned with National Biodiversity Targets and Global CBD
targets, especially those established by the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation. A
major achievement of JBRJ was CNCFlora’s compilation of a list of Brazil’s flora, and
the publishing of Livro Vermelho da Flora do Brasil (Red Book of Brazil’s Flora) that
analyzes 4,617 species of Brazil’s flora, of which 2,479 are considered threatened. This
massive work is contained in and complemented by an on-line information system
supported by operational manuals that allows inputting and validating data regarding
species and their habitats. CNCFlora has also published an official list of threatened flora
species, an official list and red book of these, and a model of action plans to protect them.
Action plans have been developed for 70 threatened species.

58.    MS implemented several activities aimed at incorporating the importance of
biodiversity in health concerns, including the establishment of an informal Núcleo de
Gestão do Conhecimento no Departamento de Vigilância e Saúde Ambiental e Saúde
Trabalhador (Management Nucleus for Knowledge in the Department of Surveillance
and Environmental Health and Worker Health), several workshops and the development
of methodologies on the linkages between health and biodiversity, and the issuance of a
Ministerial Decree creating a working group on Health and Environmental Licensing, to
involve the health sector in environmental licensing processes.

59.     FIOCRUZ’s Programa Institucional Biodiversidade e Saúde (Institutional
Program on Biodiversity and Health, PIBS) carried out a workshop that led to the
establishment of both the Rede Participativa em Saúde Silvestre (Participative Network
of Wildlife Health, RePSS) and the Rede de Laboratórios em Saúde Silvestre (Laboratory
Network of Wildlife Health, ReLSS) in addition to the CISS (described under Project
Outcomes). PIBS is established in the office of the President of FIOCRUZ, and its staff
participated in the design of the institution’s strategic plan for 2011-2014 in which
biodiversity and health are designated as a strategic priority.

60.    MCTI, through a partnership with JBRJ, collected data and knowledge on the
Atlantic Forest biome and formed a network for research and monitoring in biological
reserves as a pilot experience for incorporating this biome in MCTI’s PPBio.

The Project financed the training of almost eight thousand specialists in MAPA,
EMBRAPA, ICMBio, JRBJ, FIOCRUZ and the MMA.



                                             19
3.3 Efficiency

61.    The Project was designed as a stand-alone GEF project, with grant financing of
US$22 million and expected counterpart cash and in-kind contributions of US$75 million
from government ministries and agencies (including an expected US$13.3 million from
FUNBIO). The GEF grant funds were fully disbursed (Section 1.7), roughly in line by
component with appraisal estimates (Annex 1). 5 FUNBIO’s operating costs under
Component 2(d) were roughly 20 percent higher than originally estimated (see footnote),
although this is reasonable in that the only represent around 11 percent of the capitalized
amount of the Opportunities Fund.

62.    The Project’s implementation was efficient in leveraging GEF funds. At
Appraisal, it was expected that the GEF’s US$22 million grant would leverage US$75
million in government and partner agencies contributions. By the time of completion, the
government, partner agency and other contributions amounted to US$95.35 million, 27
percent above the amount originally contemplated. Most of the additional funding came
from regular budgets of the partner agencies, especially, while the MMA’s regular
contribution was actually less than originally estimated (Annex 1, Table (b)). It was also
successful, although not as much as expected, in leveraging contributions to the
Opportunities Fund; US$13.3 million in counterpart funding were mobilized against a
GEF Grant contribution of US$5.5 million (against the expectation of US$25.5 in the
incremental cost analysis—see below). From the perspective of GEF resource
mobilization, the Project was successful in leveraging GEF resources, in amounts above
those originally estimated.

63.     The Project’s PAD contained an incremental cost analysis that estimated
incremental costs of US$97 million over a baseline (without project) scenario, for six
years, for creating the technical, institutional, and incentive-based context that would
promote the mainstreaming of biodiversity concerns in Brazil, and thereby contribute to
the conservation of globally significant biodiversity. Highlighting that the economic
valuation of biodiversity conservation is difficult to measure in monetary terms,
especially the monetary value of conservation policies that have an indirect and dispersed
impact over a long period of time, the PAD also contained a descriptive analysis of the
direct and indirect economic benefits that would be expected to accrue from
implementation of the Project’s components. Given the achievement of its PDO, as
measured by Key Indicators in its Results Framework and, actually, the overachievement
of several intermediate indicator targets (Annex 2), these originally estimated benefits
were achieved. Further, by implementing the Project through established partners (that
contributed more than originally expected in counterpart contribution) with existing
supply chains, the Project was able to build upon and strengthen existing institutions,


5
  Table (a) in Annex 1 shows US$1.42 million in project costs for Project Coordination and Management whereas no
funding had been envisaged for this activity under Component 4 of the Project. In reality, this US$1.42 million
represents operating costs under Component 2(d) of the Project that had originally been estimated as costs of US$1.175
million under Component 2.




                                                         20
thereby minimizing the costs that would otherwise be involved in establishing new
programs. Finally, it is almost impossible to quantify the benefits that are accruing from
the Project’s catalytic influence in setting in motion and formalizing a cross-sectoral,
multi agency and sector (public, private, NGO) approach to biodiversity conservation.
This was determinant in terms of attracting additional project resources, and in exceeding
several originally planned targets; it will undoubtedly continue to produce similar results
in the future. Based on the above, Efficiency is rated Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.     The Project’s Overall Outcome Rating is Moderately Satisfactory based on
High relevance, Substantial efficacy and Modest efficiency. The team decided to take
a more conservative approach in assigning this rating as most of the Project’s outcome
and interim targets were related to process-oriented actions which are harder to measure
than quantitative targets such as numbers of hectares under sustainable production.
Nonetheless most of the targets were achieved and several were surpassed. These
considerations were balanced by the team’s assessment that the Project continues to be
relevant, both in terms of its objectives, design and implementation, and its significant
accomplishments and achievements in terms of mainstreaming biodiversity conservation
(including its contribution to National CBD Targets).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
65.      The Project did not have poverty alleviation as a specific objective. Nevertheless,
those living in poverty and extreme poverty are the main beneficiaries of policies,
programs and initiative aimed at promoting sustainable production, maintaining and
promoting ecosystem services, and supporting the sustainable development of indigenous
peoples and traditional communities. In Brazil, an estimated 26 million people or 13.7%
of the country’s population are considered to live in poverty or extreme poverty, and are
considered the most vulnerable to environmental degradation. A large number of the poor
live in rural areas; their dependence on the ecosystem is even higher.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
66.     The Project was overwhelmingly an institutional development project that aimed
to strengthen capacity for and linkages necessary to mainstream biodiversity among
various government, non-government, private and other actors. Its main institutional
impacts are described in detail in Section 3.2 above. Nevertheless, it is worth reiterating
in this Section, that the project beneficiaries almost unanimously during interviews
highlighted the importance of the Project not only in terms of the financing that it
provided, but its enormous benefit in terms of providing a forum and a catalytic force that
served to provide a forum for cooperation, and especially coordination.

   67. (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
68.    The strengthened partnerships and collaboration fostered through the Project have
has had far-reaching implications, beyond the original project scope. Several planning


                                            21
activities tested under the project have now been adopted by the participant institutions.
The species action plans are now being developed collaboratively between MMA,
ICMBio, FIOCRUZ and JBRJ. The experience gained by ICMBio as an executing
agency for some of the CBD targets have enabled it to become a stronger national
institute for monitoring and promoting biodiversity conservation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

69.    The findings of the consultations with partner beneficiaries, carried out together
with a final project assessment, are included in the relevant sections of this ICR,
including in the section on lessons learned.

70.     An evaluation and closing seminar for the Project was held on December 3, 2014.
About 60 persons, including representatives of 12 government institutions and private
entities participated. A summary of the seminar and its main findings is presented in
Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

71.      The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Negligible. The GOB, and
project beneficiaries alike all remain committed to mainstreaming and reversing
biodiversity loss. The Project succeeded in putting into place mechanisms for working
collaboratively, and multi-sectorally, that will be difficult to reverse, as well as solid
institutional and other vehicles that ensure its sustainability, such as PainelBio, CNCFlora,
RePSS, ReLSS and the seven private sector subprojects covering five million hectares of
priority biodiversity conservation areas. This coupled with tangible, visible international
commitments make any backtracking difficult to imagine. The main risk instead is that
of a halt in further progress, and that relates not to an issue of commitment but that of
continued funding at a level commensurate with implementation of policies and future
plans. Nevertheless, reflecting the importance of this as a possible constraint, there are
already important initiatives in place to mobilize funding on a recurrent basis, and to
ensure the most efficient allocation of existing resources to support the Project’s
accomplishments and further its objectives (Section 2.5).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The World Bank’s Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Project’s design was complex, but well defined, appropriate and
necessary for a project that aimed at promoting institutional cooperation and coordination
among numerous ministries, agencies and private sector partners, each with distinct
mandates and responsibilities on a topic that by definition requires a multi-sectoral



                                            22
approach. The Project built upon over a decade of World Bank and GEF support for
environment generally, and biodiversity specifically, and took into account the lessons of
previous experience. Its fiduciary aspects, although not without problem given the
differences between World Bank Procurement Guidelines and National Legislation
(Section 2.3), were well defined, and the sharing of responsibilities between FUNBIO
and Caixa Econômica provided an appropriate and clear division between the two
institutions. M&E arrangements were well defined, although the selection of indicators
in the RF at times resulted in an overlap of activities as contributing to the achievement
of multiple indicator targets. However, the Project’s risk assessment was not as detailed
as required today, but nevertheless highlighted the main risk of possible lack of support
from within the government, affected populations and civil society (that did not
materialize). As well, the rating reflects the necessity of Project restructuring in order to
adapt the original design for better capitalization of the Opportunities Fund.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

73.     The World Bank’s Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. Implementation
support missions were conducted routinely, task managed by staff in the Brazil Country
Office to provide just-in-time support, and results focused on project-implemented
activities within the broader framework of the country’s CBD commitments and process.
Project beneficiaries highlighted the usefulness and relevance of implementation support
through providing a forum for discussion of relevant issues, both implementation and
strategic. Implementation issues were addressed expeditiously (Section 2.2) and resulted
in a minor adjustment to the methodology for implementation of subprojects under
Subcomponent 1.1 that was necessary to keep implementation of those under
Subcomponent 1.2 on track. The restructuring was timely and the team used the
opportunity to improve implementation and correct issues with the original design,
specifically with respect to the Opportunities Fund under Subcomponent 2.3. External
assessments financed under the Project provided inputs to the MTR and this ICR,
incorporating beneficiary partners’ inputs. Fiduciary aspects were supervised routinely,
with periodic post reviews of procurement and financial assessments, and issues that
surfaced were addressed timely and pragmatically.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.    The World Bank’s Overall Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based
on the ratings attributed for Quality at Entry and for Supervision. Despite the initial
shortcomings leading to restructuring, the Bank team worked proactively with the
executing agencies to focus the Project on implementing the lagging activities and on the
consolidation of key outcomes. The overall quality of the World Bank’s support for the
Project’s design, and of its support provided during implementation was important for
achieving the project results.

5.2 Borrower Performance



                                             23
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

75.      The Government’s Performance is rated Satisfactory. The GOB committed to
National Targets for CBD 2010, which were more ambitious than the CBD’s targets.
Although not met in their entirety, good progress was made towards most in part through
activities supported by the Project. Further, the process put in place by the Government,
in part through activities supported by the Project, built a broader awareness and
institutional cooperation around biodiversity conservation and mainstreaming, and
towards the development and adoption of more realistic and shared National CBD
Targets for 2011-2020. The Government’s commitment to its CBD commitments, and to
the Project’s PDO and GEO, was unwavering throughout which provided a strong and
fruitful enabling environment for the Project’s implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The Implementing Agencies’ Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The Project had two executing agencies, MMA and FUNBIO, a Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) in MMA, two agencies (recipients of Grant funds) responsible for fiduciary
aspects FUNBIO for Component 2 and Caixa Econômica Federal Components 1, 3, 4(a)
and 4(b), as well as numerous beneficiaries that were responsible for implementing
subprojects (MMA, JBRJ, ICMBio, FIOCRUZ, MCTI, MS, MAPA, Embrapa, and
FapUNIFESP).6 In general, the executing agencies, the PCU and the Grant recipients
carried out their responsibilities expeditiously, routinely providing required reporting,
and addressing issues, as they arose, in a timely manner. The partner beneficiaries,
through consultations with them in preparation of the final assessments unanimously
expressed positive reviews of the support and assistance provided. Caixa Econômica
Federal, a federal bank with limited exposure to environmental and biodiversity policies
and activities, faced several issues in carrying out its procurement responsibilities,
especially in the Project’s early phases, impacting the performance of the executing
agencies it was supporting. Performance improved, over time, and as input to the final
assessment, Caixa highlighted the value of its participation in the Project in terms of
exposing its staff to these considerations, and embracing the lessons in its operations.
The one issue highlighted by project beneficiaries was the shortage of staffing, and lack
of continuity, in the PCU (Section 2.2). Performance of project beneficiaries was also
strong, albeit differentiated among that of government ministries that are subjected to
staffing and other considerations, as that of foundations and agencies. Government

  Ministério do Meio Ambiente (Ministry of the Environment, MMA); Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro (Botanical
Garden of Rio de Janeiro, JBRJ); Fundação Osvaldo Cruz (Osvaldo Cruz Foundation, FIOCRUZ), Ministério da
Ciência e Tecnologia (Ministry of Science and Technology, MCTI); Ministério da Saúde (Ministry of Health, MS);
Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento (Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, MAPA),
Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa) and Fundação
de Apoio à Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Support Foundation of the Federal University of São Paulo,
FapUNIFESP).




                                                     24
ministries as project beneficiaries, especially MMA and MS, were on occasion subject to
budget limitations that affected participation in specific subprojects. In fact, activities
being implemented by MS were stopped in 2012 due to budgetary shortages and staffing
issues. Government agencies and foundations embraced the Project not only in terms of
the activities and outputs it would permit them to achieve, but, more importantly, for the
ability to strengthen their institutions through training, equipping, expert inputs, and also
for opportunity it provided for them to network with other institutions and agencies with
similar but complementary missions towards the same overall goal.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.     Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, in view of
ratings for Government and Implementing Agencies’ Performance, and the outcomes that
this performance allowed the Project to achieve.

6. Lessons Learned
78.     Environmental mainstreaming projects invariably involve institutional complexity
in view of their multi-sectoral nature and terms of the number of individual ministries and
agencies involved. But, it is this very complexity that is required to be successful in
terms of sharing of data and information, and of establishing and institutionalizing fluid
relations among most or all involved actors. Some institutions are by definition more
focused, outside of the central structure of government, and, hence, more agile as they are
often not subject to the same constraints as central government ministries. Nevertheless,
it is fundamental to incorporate as many involved actors as possible, even if
implementation is slower for some, because beyond the specific activities financed by the
Project, it is the catalytic mechanism that the Project provides that can serve to put in
place a concerted framework for lasting cooperation and coordination.

79.     Designing results frameworks for biodiversity mainstreaming projects, where
cooperation among institutions is a central objective, can be challenging. First, it is
important to target and acknowledge contributions and achievements by individual
agencies. Yet, several accomplishments of individual executing agencies could not be
achieved by those agencies alone given the multi-sectoral nature of biodiversity
conservation. Further, a project that aims to promote that institutional cooperation on a
subject that by definition requires coordination among institutions needs also to target
and acknowledge achievement of inter-institutional activities. This can often lead to
double counting of results, that is, a result by a given agency may contribute to the
achievement of an indicator defined as an agency output and at the same time contribute
to the achievement of another indicator defined on the basis of multi-sector coordination.

80.      Recognizing the difference in institutional capacity and constraints that different
agencies face, several of the partner beneficiaries highlighted in the consultations that
there should be a mechanism to allow those with greater capacity to absorb more funding,
i.e., not including an initial fixed funding allocation by partner beneficiaries. Obviously,



                                             25
in terms of individual agency outputs there would be advantages to such a mechanism.
Nevertheless, this would invariably result in greater financing to those more agile
partners, with perhaps stronger initial institutional capacity and flexibility, to the
detriment of others that require funding to strengthen theirs. Also, it would likely reduce
the impact of a project in terms of promoting inter-agency cooperation. Further thought
should be given to strike an optimal balance between both extremes, i.e., full flexibility in
funding vs. fixed allocations to partner beneficiaries.


81.   Projects that involve funding for private sector initiatives, that require
commitment by those partners should define very realistic targets as the broader
macroeconomic environment can affect demand.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

82.   A translation of comments provided by the MMA on June 8, 2015 is
provided below. Comments provided by FUNBIO are presented in Annex 7.

83.    The Project provided continuity to the Ministério do Meio Ambiente’s agenda of
implementing the CBD, which has always emphasized that an agenda for conservation
and sustainable use of biodiversity can only be achieved with the involvement of the
diverse sectors of society. The Project created the possibility for the MMA to reach out to
the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock and Supply and associated agencies to involve them in the
biodiversity conservation agenda. During preparation and negotiations, efforts were made
to reach out to involve also the Ministry of Agrarian Development, but the conditions
were not in place for their participation in this Project.

84.     It is worth highlighting that to promote “mainstreaming” it is fundamental to take
into consideration the degree of institutional maturity and development. On the other
hand, recently created institutions, like ICMBIO, were able to take advantage of the
opportunity to strengthen institutional capacity and establish a robust structure to evaluate
the situation of threatened species and to prepare action plans to address the factors that
threaten them

85.    During the celebrations of the International Biodiversity Day in Brasil in 2015,
awards were granted to the best initiatives that focused on biodiversity conservation and
promotion o sustainable use and benefit sharing. Three activities supported by PROBIO
II were selected as finalists in several categories. It is worth noting that none of these
were developed directly by MMA, since the rules of the competition excluded its
nomination for the awards.

86.     Another important lesson relates to the institutions’ interest on the subject of
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In cases where an institution is not
interested directly with the subject, they would generally not respond to an invitation to a



                                             26
discussion session. For MMA, the implementation of this Project consolidated the
nucleus established in the framework of the Secretaria de Biodiversidade e Florestas,
focused on the management of biodiversity, and, in this manner, accomplished its goal on
institutional consolidation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     In accordance with GEF requirements, Project preparation included an
Incremental Cost Analysis to assess the incremental GEF costs of achieving global
biodiversity benefits. These incremental costs were calculated to be US$ 97 million
(World Bank 2007). The biodiversity-related global environmental benefits identified for
each Component in the Project Appraisal Document have mostly been fully achieved,
with some specific indicators being surpassed, including ‘areas under integrated
conservation and sustainable use’ and ‘progress in CBD targets’.

2.      The available data strongly suggests that implementation of the Project was (i)
efficient in terms of leveraging GEF funds; and (ii) cost-effective in terms of achieving
the PDO. With respect to the leveraging of available GEF funds, this was expected at
appraisal to be at a ratio of over 3:1 with Government, together with the private sector,
expected to contribute a total of US$75 million funding from counterparts (from MMA,
FUNBIO, MAPA, EMBRAPA, ICMBio, MCT, Fiocruz, and others), in addition to the
$22 million from GEF. The actual co-funding at the end of the Project totaled US$ 96.05
million representing an additional US$ 21.05 million. Much of this co-funding came from
regular government budgets where programs were re-aligned with the Project’s priorities
from a thematic as well as geographical standpoint, and includes US $13.3 million from
private sector sources. From a GEF resource mobilization perspective, the Project was
efficient with the GEF contribution leveraging substantial co-funding from regular
government budgets and programs. Thus, many activities initiated with Project funds are
expected to continue to be implemented through these regular government budgets and
programs.

3.      During project implementation ten business plans were elaborated and/or made
available through the Knowledge Base hosted at Funbio’s website. These business plans
included analysis of the current context, challenges and opportunities for the development
of private sector subprojects focusing on a particular sector such as sustainable forest
management or voluntary offsetting mechanisms. Business plans also included review of
potential strategies, such as experiences with various financial mechanisms, landscape
planning concepts and tools, so that they could be adapted to specific sectors and
locations. These experiences have been disseminated and are currently being further
developed by FUNBio to expand private sector funding for biodiversity. No further
economic and financial analysis was done.

4.      The economic valuation of biodiversity conservation is difficult to measure in
monetary terms, especially the monetary value of conservation policies that have an
indirect and dispersed impact over a long period of time. Therefore, the PAD contained a
descriptive analysis of the direct and indirect economic benefits that would be expected
to accrue from implementation of the Project’s components. Given the achievement of its
PDO as measured by Key Indicators in its Results Framework, and indeed the
overachievement of several intermediate indicator targets (Annex 2), these originally



                                           41
estimated benefits should be achieved. Further, by implementing the Project through
established partners (that contributed more than originally expected in counterpart co-
funding) within existing supply chains, the Project was able to build upon and strengthen
existing institutions. This has minimized the costs that would otherwise be involved in
establishing new programs. Finally, it is almost impossible to quantify the benefits that
are accruing from the Project’s catalytic influence in setting in motion and formalizing a
cross-sectoral, multi agency and sector (public, private, NGO) approach to biodiversity
conservation. This was a determining factor in attracting additional project resources, and
in exceeding several originally planned targets; it will undoubtedly continue to produce
similar results in the future.

PROBIO II Closing Workshop


1.      About 60 collaborators, partners of 12 governmental institutions and private
entities participated, on December 3, 2014, of the evaluation and closing activities
seminar of the National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation
Project (PROBIO II). In presenting the results, the beneficiary institutions highlighted the
Project success and that Brazil has faced the challenge of treating the national
biodiversity in a unified and transversal way.

2.     The Project was executed in partnership between the Ministry of the Environment
(MMA), the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio) and the Federal Government Bank
(CAIXA), and for its implementation it has also established strategic partnerships with
the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA), Ministry of Agrarian
Development (MDA), Ministry of Health (MS), Ministry of Science and Technology
(MCTI), in addition to the Chico Mendes Institute of Biodiversity Conservation
(ICMBio), the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden (JBRJ), the Brazilian Agricultural
Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ).

3.     The seminars opening table included the World Bank’s Task Manager, Adriana
Moreira, the Secretariat of Biodiversity and Forests of the MMA, Carlos Alberto de
Matos Scaramuzza, the Executive Director of Funds of Caixa, Deusdina dos Reis Pereira,
and the General Secretary of Funbio, Rosa Lemos de Sá.

4.     The beneficiary institutions on five round tables presented the main results and
lessons learned, the challenges, and the integration between different areas:

   -   “Biodiversity and the Private Sector”, mediated by Fernanda Marques (Funbio)
       with participation of Rosa Lemos de Sá (Funbio), Roberto Wack (USP) and
       Bruno Mariani (Funbio Council);
   -   “Progress and Challenges on Threatened Species Management”, mediated by Ugo
       Vercillo (ICMBio), with participation of Rosana Subirá (ICMBio), Gustavo
       Martinelli (JBRJ) and Luís Fábio Silveira (USP Zoology Museum);
   -   “Biodiversity and Health”, mediated by Marcia Chame (Fiocruz), with
       participation of Carlos Corvalan (OPAS), Renato (SVS in MS) and Fernando de
       Ávila Pires (Fiocruz);
   -   “Biodiversity and Agriculture”, mediated by Rogério Dias with participation of
       Josias Miranda (MAPA), Rosa Lia Barbieri e Juliano Gomes Pádua
       (EMBRAPA);
   -   “Biodiversity Information Accessibility (PainelBio, Rare Works, SIBBR,
       Biodiversity Monitoring and Information Systems)”, mediated by Pablo Pena
       Rodrigues (JBRJ) with participation of Fabiana Montanari (Scielo), Luiz Merico
       (IUCN), Andréia Portela (MCTI) and Eduado Dalcin (JBRJ).



                                            46
5.       The specialists concluded that, the PROBIO II, which counted upon US$22
million in grant funding from the Global Environmental Facility – GEF, contributed to
the strengthening of the Ministry of the Environment’s of its different participant
institutions.

6.     In the MMA’s opinion, “all developed activities managed to strengthen and
promote the biodiversity conservation from actions of various partners, such as the
Agricultural Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA), specially with agro
ecology and organic agricultural practices”.

7.      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA),
participating in the PROBIO II, has given the institution the opportunity to integrate
consultants with knowledge in areas different than the ones developed by MAPA, with
exclusive dedication in extractive good practices, which, without support from PROBIO
II support, they would not have been able to do.

8.      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation’s (FIOCRUZ) researchers, stated that the Project’s
resources allowed them to develop a series of research and surveys, such as the reports on
invasive exotic species and the creation of the Centro de Informação em Saúde Silvestre
(CISS), a “Virtual Center, open to researchers in all areas and to collaboration with the
broader society, since anyone can include information on any event involving animals
and insects”. With this information, FIOCRUZ can anticipate events and make
predictions about diseases before they reach people.

Sustainability

9.      The PROBIO II funds were managed by the Federal Government Bank (CAIXA),
a partner whose approach to actions promoting biodiversity conservation was also
impacted. According to CAIXA’s operational area, “this partnership with MMA was
interesting from an institutional point of view, because it allowed CAIXA to put into
practice one of its missions, which is the sustainable development promotion”.

10.     The National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project
(PROBIO II), was considered by the partners as a milestone that improved the
transformation of production models, national territory use and occupation, beginning
with the agricultural, science, fishing, forestry and health sectors.

Although the Project will not be continued, the partner institutions that participated in
PROBIO II should give sequence to the activities and research it generated, with the aim
of generating and spreading information and knowledge on biodiversity. The result is in
the conservation areas priority update, sustainable use, and fair and equal distribution of
the Brazilian biodiversity benefits, as part of the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD).

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Fernanda F. C. Marques, Probio II Project Manager at FUNBIO

1.       The National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project
(Probio II) proposed an innovative, challenging approach for promoting the adoption of
biodiversity friendly practices and strategies by the productive sector in Brazil. It sought
to foster cooperation and collaboration for effecting change in how businesses assessed
and addressed biodiversity related issues in their everyday operations, at a time when
dialog between the private sector and the environmental community was limited. In
addition, project implementation coincided with the onset of the 2008 global financial
crisis, a period during which the private sector became reluctant to make additional
investments as the consequences of the crisis were not yet entirely clear. These factors
impacted prospecting for private sector subprojects and, combined with the complex
institutional arrangements and consequently long negotiation periods, delayed their
implementation.

2.      The restructuring of the Opportunities Fund, allowing for subprojects to continue
beyond the project’s closing date, was critical for the achievement of the project’s
objectives. Seven private sector subprojects were negotiated and are under
implementation in 6 productive landscapes totaling almost 5 million hectares. These
subprojects are catalyzing and scaling up successful initiatives, and provide examples of
biodiversity mainstreaming strategies for various sectors. Based on partnerships between
private sector companies, producers associations and governmental and non-
governmental organizations, private sector subprojects often congregate multiple agendas,
including cocoa production, tropical forestry, sugar cane production and biofuels,
livestock, fisheries, non-timber forest products, sustainable and organic agriculture, rural
tourism, wildlife health and digital inclusion. Despite being one of the main contributing
factors for the delayed implementation of private sector subprojects, one of the positive
outcomes of the often complex institutional arrangements was the establishment of a long
term dialog between diverse stakeholders – companies, NGOs, government agencies and
producers. These institutional arrangements are also generating considerable interest as a
potential model to be replicated in other contexts.

3.      The investment of GEF funds on private sector subprojects through the
Opportunities Fund was critical for the successful achievement of the project’s
capitalization targets. Despite the requirement for a 3:1 co-financing ratio - by no means
a trivial proportion -, subproject proponents perceived the Fund’s investment as a risk
reduction factor. In many cases this investment was also critical for allowing successful
small scale initiatives to be expanded.

4.      An important lesson learned, however, is that prospecting and negotiations
involving multiple actors, especially when developing innovative approaches, will more
often than not be a lengthy process, even under the best economic and financial scenarios.
This should be taken into account when designing and/or implementing such projects in
the future.

The Project’s second PDO or Global Environmental Objective Indicator was: Progress
toward the 2010 CBD targets for Brazil tracked by a strategy for monitoring selected
indicators. Brazil had defined 51 national biodiversity targets for 2010, developed under
a broad participatory process, that were even more ambitious than the global targets.
Notable progress was obtained for most of the national targets and the Project contributed
to the achievement of 21 of these. The National 2010 Biodiversity Targets, progress in
achievement, and support by the Project are presented in the table below:

Strategic Objective A – Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by
mainstreaming biodiversity considerations across government and society
National Target 1: By 2020, at the latest, Brazilian people are aware of ✔
the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use
it sustainably
National Target 2: By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values, geo- ✔
diversity values, and socio-diversity values have been integrated into
national and local development and poverty reduction and inequality
reduction strategies, and are being incorporated into national accounting,
as appropriate, and into planning procedures and reporting systems
National Target 3: By 2020, at the latest, incentives harmful to
biodiversity, including so-called perverse subsidies, are eliminated,
phased out or reformed in order to minimize negative impacts. Positive
incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are
developed and applied, consistent and in harmony with the CBD, taking
into account national and regional socio-economic conditions.
National Target 4: By 2020, at the latest, governments, private sector ✔
and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have
implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption to
mitigate or prevent negative impacts from the use of natural resources
Strategic Objective B – Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote
sustainable use
National Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of native habitats is reduced
by at least 50% (in comparison with the 2009 rate) and, as much as
possible, brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is
significantly reduced in all biomes
National Target 6: By 2020 all stocks of any aquatic organism are
managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based
approaches, so that overharvesting is avoided, recovery plans and
measures are in place for depleted species, fisheries have no significant
adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems, and the
impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe
ecological limits, when scientifically established
National Target 7:          By 2020 the incorporation of sustainable ✔
management practices is disseminated and promoted in agriculture,
livestock production, aquaculture, silviculture, extractive activities, and
forest and fauna management, ensuring conservation of biodiversity
National Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients,


                                           60
has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function
and biodiversity
National Target 9: By 2020, the National Strategy on Invasive Alien
Species is fully implemented, with the participation and commitment of
states and the elaboration of a National Policy, ensuring the continuous
and updated diagnosis of species and the effectiveness of Action Plans for
Prevention, Contention and Control
National Target 10: By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on ✔
coral reefs, and other marine and coastal ecosystems impacted by climate
change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to maintain their
integrity and functioning
Strategic Objective C – To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding
ecosystems, species and genetic diversity
National Target 11: By 2020, at least 30% of the Amazon, 17% of each
of the other terrestrial biomes, and 10% of the marine and coastal areas,
especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem
services, are conserved through protected areas such as Permanent
Protection Areas, legal reserves, and indigenous lands with native
vegetation, ensuring and respecting the demarcation, regularization, and
effective and equitable management, so as to ensure ecological
interconnection, integration and representation in broader landscapes and
seascapes
National Target 12: By 2020, the risk of extinction of threatened species ✔
has been significantly reduced, tending to zero, and their conservation
status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved
National Target 13: By 2020, the genetic diversity of microorganisms, ✔
cultivated plants, farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives,
including socio-economically as well as culturally valuable species, is
maintained, and strategies have been developed and implemented for
minimizing the loss of genetic diversity
Strategic Objective D – Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem
services
National Target 14: By 2020, ecosystems that provided essential ✔
services, including services related to water, and contribute to health,
livelihoods and well-being, are restored and safeguarded, taking into
account the needs of women, traditional peoples and communities,
indigenous peoples and local communities, and the poor and vulnerable
National Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution
of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced through conservation
and restoration actions, including restoration of at least 15% of degraded
ecosystems, prioritizing the most degraded biomes, hydrographic regions
and ecoregions, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and
adaptation and to combating desertification
National Target 16: By 2015, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic
Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from
their Utilization is in force and operational, consistent with national


                                         61
legislation
Strategic Objective E – Enhance the implementation through participatory planning,
knowledge management and capacity building
National Target 17: By 2014, the national biodiversity strategy is ✔
updated and adopted as policy instrument, with effective, participatory
and updated actions plans, which foresee periodic monitoring and
evaluation
National Target 18: By 2020, the traditional knowledge, innovations and
practices of indigenous peoples, family rural producers and traditional
communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity, and their customary use of biological resources, are
respected, in accordance with their uses, customs and traditions, national
legislation and relevant international commitments, and fully integrated
and reflected in the implementation of the CBD, with the full and effective
participation of indigenous peoples, family rural producers and traditional
communities, at all relevant levels
National Target 19: By 2020, the science base and technologies ✔
necessary for enhancing knowledge on biodiversity, its values,
functioning and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved and
shared, and the sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as the generation of
biodiversity-based technology and innovation are supported, duly
transferred and applied. By 2017, the complete compilation of existing
records on aquatic and terrestrial fauna, flora and microbiota is finalized
and made available through permanent and open access databases, with
specificities safeguarded, with a view to identify knowledge gaps related
to biomes and taxonomic groups
National Target 20: Immediately following the approval of the Brazilian
targets, resources needs assessments are carried out for the
implementation of national targets, followed by the mobilization and
allocation of financial resources to enable, from 2015 on, the
implementation and monitoring of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
2011-2020, as well as the achievement of its targets.
