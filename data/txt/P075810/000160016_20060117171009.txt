I   IEG Mission: Enhancing developmenteffectivenessthrough excellence and independence inevaluation.                I
 About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activities of theWorld Bankfor two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessandto verifythat the Bank'swork is producingthe
 expectedresults, and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof this work, IEGannually assesses about 25 percentof the
 Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperations for assessment, preferenceisgiven to those that are innovative,
 large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations; thosefor which Executive
 Directorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generateimportant lessons.
 The projects,topics, andanalyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
        A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report(a self-evaluationby the responsible Bankdepartment) and fieldworkconductedby IEG. To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examineprojectfiles andother documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing countryfor onsitediscussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
 validateand augmentthe informationprovidedinthe ICR, as well as examineissuesof special interestto broader
 IEGstudies.
        EachPPAR is subjectto a peer review processand IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank departmentand amended as necessary.The completedPPAR is then
 sent to the borrowerfor review: the borrowers' comments are attachedto the documentthat is sent to the Bank's
 Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment reporthas beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the IEG RatingSystem
       The time-testedevaluation methods used by IEGare suitedto the broad rangeof the World Bank'swork. The
 methods offer both rigorand a necessarylevelof flexibilityto adaptto lendinginstrument,projectdesign, or
 sectoralapproach. IEG evaluators allapplythe same basic methodto arrive at their projectratings. Followingis
 the definitionand rating scale usedfor each evaluation criterion(more informationis availableon the IEGwebsite:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
   .    Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project'sobjectivesare consistentwith the country's
 currentdevelopmentprioritiesand with currentBank country and sectoralassistancestrategiesand corporate
 goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country AssistanceStrategies,Sector StrategyPapers,
 OperationalPolicies). Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extentto which the project's objectives were achieved, or expectedto be achieved,taking into
 account their relativeimportance. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a returnhigherthanthe
 opportunity cost of capitaland benefitsat leastcost comparedto alternatives.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto riskof net benefits flows over time. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       InstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extentto which a projectimprovesthe abilityof a countryor region
 to make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
 betterdefinition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b)
 betteralignment of the missionand capacityof an organizationwith its mandate, which derivesfrom these
 institutionalarrangements.InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includesboth intendedand unintendedeffects of a
 project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extentto which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expectedto be
 achieved, efficiently. Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,HighlyUnsatisfactory.
       BankPerformance: The extent to whichservicesprovidedby the Bank ensuredquality at entry and
 supported implementationthroughappropriatesupervision (includingensuringadequatetransitionarrangements

Preface

        This i s the ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR) on three lending
operations to the Islamic Republic ofPakistanflom 1996to 2003, to assist the Northwest
Frontier Province (NWFP) indevelopingcommunity infrastructure projects, andto assist
theNWFP andthe SindhProvince (SP) inimplementingstructural reforms inpublic
resourcemanagement, humandevelopment, governance, andprivate sector development
(PSD), withthe overarching objective ofimprovingthe delivery ofbasic public services
andtherebyreducingpoverty.

        The NWFP Community Infrastructure andNationalHousingAuthority
Strengthening Credit (CIP) (Credit 2829-PK), in the amount o f SDR 13.7 million, was
approved onMarch 14, 1996, becameeffective onJuly 17,1996, andwas closed on June
30,2003, 18 months behindthe original date. Seventy-sevenpercent o fthe Credit was
disbursed. Parallel financing was providedby Switzerlandinanamount equivalent to
US$3.5 million, subsequently increasedto US$4.5 million, 92 percent ofwhich was
disbursed. The project was co-financedbythe SwissAgency for Development and
Cooperation(SDC) andbyUNICEF.

        The SP StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC) (Credit 3686-PK), inthe amount o f
SDR 79.1 million, was approved on July 9,2002, becameeffective on July 17,2002, and
was closedonDecember 31,2002, the original date. The Credit was fully disbursed.

        The NWFP Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC-I) (Credit 3687-PK), inthe
amount of SDR 71.2 million, was approvedon July 9,2002, became effective on July 12,
2002, andwas closedonDecember31,2002, the original date. The Credit was fully
disbursed.

       An IndependentEvaluation Group (IEG) missionvisited PakistaninOctober/
November 2004 to discussperformancewith federal andprovincial officials who
implementedthe projects, representativesofdonors, andmembersofthe Bankresident

Summary

1.      Upto the 1990s,Bankassistanceto Pakistanwas concentratedinagriculture,
energy, andinfrastructure. Inthe 199Os,therewas a shift towards social sectors and
public administration inresponseto increasedevidence ofwidespreadpoverty andpoor
deliveryo f social services. The three operationsreviewedhere findtheir origininthis
shift inemphasis. Inaddition, the two provincial policydevelopment operationswere to
address the challengesraisedbythe devolution announcedbythe Musharrafgovernment
uponassumingpower in 1999. The mainobjective ofthis PPARi s to assess to what
extent operationsat the sub-national levelhave proveda successfulvehicle inraising
performanceinpublic services delivery compared to previous operationsat the national
level.

2.      CommunityInfrastructure Project in the NorthwestFrontier Province (1996). Its
objective was to increasethe productivity andlivingconditions oflow-income groups
throughthe provisiono fbasic infrastructure andcommunity development. Fromits
inception, the project suffered fkom implementationconstraintsdue to the institutional
wealmesses inthe Pakistani administration andto the difficulties inherent to having a
community-drivenproject executedby a highly centralizedprovincialsystem,
characterizedbyweak management, blurredresponsibilities, heavy financial procedures,
poor incentives, andgender imbalance, acritical shortcoming incommunity
development. Implementation ofthe devolution policywhile the project was being
executedcreatedfurther uncertainties. Inthis climate, ownership was absent for most of
the implementationperiod. While the physical infrastructure was completed, the social
infiastructure (community development, healthandhygiene education, sanitation,
activities targetedat women andchildren, responsibility for Operations andMaintenance
-O&M) provedtobemuchmorechallengingandresultsweremixedifnotmeager.

3.      The ratings ofmoderately unsatisfactory outcome, modest institutional
developmentimpact, andunsatisfactory Bank andBorrower performance are maintained.
Sustainability is ratedunlikely (against non-evaluable inthe ICR Review) becausethe
project didnot succeedininstitutionalizing community development processeswithinthe
provincial andlocal administrations.

4.      The main lessonsfor Community Development Projects are:

    0   successfulCommunity-driven Development depends on the understandingo f and
        commitment to a Community Development modelby the localauthorities;

    0   project designmustallow for maximumflexibility dependingon the
        circumstancesof eachcommunity;

    0   the designofthe project must ensure that the social infrastructure interacts with
        the chosenphysical infrastructure. Implementationplansmustallow for this;

    0   highquality Community Development andInstitutionalDevelopment staffis of
        crucial importanceandshould beinplace from project start through completion;

    0   the designofthe project shouldpay particular attention to the active participation
        o fwomen inallproject phases. Sustainability is largely dependent onthem;

    0  when beneficiary contributions are put up, the project design mustprovide for
        verification o f effective payment and origino f funds ofcontributions to capital
        cost andO&M; and

5.      Structural Adjustment Creditsof theNorthwestFrontier Provinceand of the
Sindh Province (2002). After devolutionwas announced, studies onprovincial finances
highlightedthat amajor factor inPakistan'spoorperformanceinreducingpoverty inthe
1990swas due to the inabilityofthe provinces to provide essentialpublic services, which
was inturndue to the provinces' weak governanceanddirepublic finances. Giventhe
newresponsibilities devolvedto local governments, the provincesneededto restoretheir
public finances andgenerate sufficient resourcesto fund local governments. The two
Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs) addressedthose issues andwere very similar in
content anddesign. Theybothaimedat: (i)        strengtheninggovernance; (ii)   strengthening
public health andeducation delivery systems, with a focus onprimaryservice delivery;
(iii)
    undertakingfiscal andfinancialmanagementreforms; and(iv) deregulation and
businessfacilitation to enhance prospectsfor growth andpoverty alleviation.
Strengtheninggovernanceto improve public servicedeliverywas a cross-cutting theme.

6.      With the assistanceofthe Bank,bothSACs were basedonreform programs
preparedover 2000-01 byprovincial governments. They were one tranche operations
basedon actions takenprior to Boardpresentation andbothCreditswere disbursedin
July 2002. Their performance subsequentto effectivenessdivergedafter electionswere
heldinOctober 2002. IntheNorthwest Frontier Province, thepartieselectedformed a
solid coalition which supportedthe reformprogram as meetingmuch oftheir own
agenda, particularly inthe deliveryo f social services. A secondSAC was approvedin
2004 and athird one is under discussion. InSindh, onthe other hand, a fragile coalition
emergedfiom the electionswithoften conflicting agendas, a situationwhichledto slow
decision-making andevenparalysisinsomereformareas. Facedwith this situation, the
province andthe Bankagreedin2004 to undertakeaprogramof analytical work
expectedto providethe backgroundnecessaryto aresumptionofreforms.

7.     For the Northwest Frontier SAC, the ratings o fmoderately satisfactory outcome,
modest institutional development impact, andsatisfactory Bank andBorrower
performance are confirmed. Sustainability is ratedlikely(against non-evaluable) onthe
basisthat the operationprovedto be a solid basis for a secondSAC and for deepeningthe
dialogue on the critical areaofpublic resourcemanagement.

8.     For the Sindh SAC, the ratings o fmodest institutional developmentimpact and
satisfactory Bankperformance are confirmed. Outcome is moderatelyunsatisfactory
(against satisfactory) becausethe paceo freforms slowed considerablyafter the 2002
elections, especially inredressingimportant bottlenecks infinancial management, incivil
servicereform, andinpromotingprivate sector development. Sustainability is unlikely
(against likely) becausethere is currently littleprospect o f arriving at the consensus
requiredto strengthenfiscal andfinancial management. Borrower performance is
unsatisfactory (against satisfactory) becausecommitment andownershipweakened
considerably after the 2002 elections.

Lessonsfor Pakistan

   0  the limitedexperiencegainedby the two first SACs reviewedhere suggeststhat
      operationsat the sub-nationallevel are auseful complement to those at the
      national level. Interms of contributing to improveddeliveryof service and
      poverty reduction, they comparefavorably with the Social Action Program;

   0  unlessthe mechanismsgoverning the financial relationships betweenthe federal
      andprovincial governmentsarerevised, there is little or noprospectfor the
      provinces to be able to fulfill their social mandateas providedbythe Constitution
      andthe devolution planinasustainablemanner;
      capacity at the lower levelis generally very weak sincepower resides at the center
      for historical reasons. The focus, content, anddesignof sub-national operations
      should target capacity andinstitutional buildingat that levelinconjunction with
      the transfer o fresponsibilities from the higherto the lower level. The present
      assessmentrevealedthe lack o fclarity inroles andresponsibilities, financial
      procedures, andmodalities ofusingfunds transferredto lower levels; and

   0  whendesigningsub-nationaloperations, joint discussionswith the central
      government are indispensableto ensure that the conditions for success falling
      underthejurisdictionofthe central level are either expectedto be fulfilled within
      the time frame o fthe operation or are excluded from the reformprogram.
Lessons of BroadApplicability

   0  ownership andcommitment, at the politicalas well as at the administrative level,
      are keysto success. Ifobtained, sub-national operations generatevaluable benefits

   1.         Introduction

    1.1       Upto the 199Os, Bankassistanceto Pakistanwas concentrated inagriculture,
   energy, andinfrastructure. Inthe 199Os, there was a shift towards social sector and
   public administration inpart due to increased concern over widespread poverty andpoor
   delivery o f social services. The three operations reviewedhere find their origin inthis
   shift inemphasis. Inaddition, the provincialpolicy development operations also reflect
   the devolutionpolicy o fthe federal government initiatedin2001, which was designed to
   improve the ability andresponsibilityfor delivery o f social services. Thus, the main
   objective o fthis PPARi s to assess to what extent operations at the sub-national level,
   either at the local or provinciallevel, have provedto be a more successful vehicle in
   raisingperformanceinpublic services delivery thanprevious operations at the national
   level, such as the Social Action Program(SAP), Pakistan's mainvehicle for expanding                     ,
   basic services coverage initiated inthe early 1990s.

   1.2        The NWFP Community Infrastructure andNationalHousingAuthority (NHA)
.  Strengthening Project (CIP)' belongs to the group o f 17 projects financed bythe Bankin
   the social sector between 1990and2003, including social protectionandpoverty,
   education, health andpopulation, and community infiastructure, some at the national
   level, others at the provincial level.

   1.3       The SindhProvince (SP) andNorthwest FrontierProvince (NWFP) Structural
   Adjustment Credits (SAC)2 arepart o fthe group o fpolicy development operations o fthe
   early 2000s that addressedseveral o fthe major 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
   themes (fiscal improvement, governance, distortions, service delivery, andpublic
   administratiodimplementationcapacity), Accordingly, the two operations focused on
   those themes as vehicles to improve service delivery.

   1.4       The report i s structured as follows: Section 2 provides the background and context
   inwhich the threeoperations were designed; Section3 discussesperformance ofthe CIP
   andthe lessons to bedrawn; andSection4 discussesthe provincialSACSandtheir

    2.        Background

    2.1       Pakistan, twice the size o fFrance, has a populationo f about 148 million, growing
    at 2.1 percent per year. The country consistso f four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Northwest
 '  Frontier, andBalochistan. The GNIper capita in2003/04 was US$521.' Overmost o f
    theperiodafter independence(1947), the country outperformedits neighbors, with GDP
    growing at over 6 percent per annum, but, inthe 199Os, the growth rate declined to about
    4 percent per year. The economic situation has improved since 1999, with a stable
    govemment inplace under President Musharraf, the resumption ofreformpolicies, and
    support from the international community: GDP growthreached 5.1 percentin2002103,
    is estimated at 6.4 percent in2003/04, and is projectedto reach 8 percent in2004/05.

    2.2       Despite a good growth performance over the long-term, Pakistanhas failed until
    very recentlyto makeprogress inits social indicators, which lagbehindthose o f its
    neighbors. The slower growth o fthe 1990sresultedinfact inan increase inthe incidence
    o fpoverty, reaching 32.1 percent in2000/01, compared to 27 percent in 1990/01. During
    that period, urbanpoverty fell, but ruralpovertyincreased substantially from 24.6 percent
    in1992/93 to 38.7 percentin2002/03. Povertyisreflectedinalmost allsocialindicators:
    Pakistanranked 142out of 175 countries inthe 2003 UNDP's HumanDevelopment
3 - Index (HDI); infantmortality i s 76 per thousand; the fertility rate is 4.5; girls aged 1-4
    have a 66 percent higherdeath rate thanboys, explainingthe lower proportion o fwomen
    inthepopulation; andincomparisonwithother low-income countries, Pakistanhas20
    percent fewer childreninprimary school and40 percent fewer girls. To address poverty
    reductionina comprehensive way, Pakistanissued a PovertyReduction Strategy Paper
    (PRSP) inDecember 2003.

    DEVOLUTION

    2.3       Performance o foperations at the provincial or local levelmust be assessed inthe
    lighto fthe devolutionpolicy adoptedbythe Musharrafgovernment in2001. The policy
    aims at "reconstructing the institutions of the state" through a system ofdemocratically
    elected local governments (LG).4 According to the Local Government Ordinances (LGO)
    issuedbythe provinces inAugust 2001, devolutionhadtwo sets of objectives: (i)                           a
    political objective aimed at reformingpolitical structures; and (ii)                a set o feconomic and
    social objectives aimed at grantingthe citizenry a greater say inmanaginglocal affairs,
    including the delivery o f social services. It involved the abolition o f the existingthree
    levels o fprovincial administration(divisions, districts, andtehsils) andthe creation o f a
    newtier ofLGs (districts, tehsils, unionadministrations), andthe replacement o fthe
    existingmunicipalbodies bythese new LGs. Reforms took place inthree areas: political,
    administrative, and fiscal.

     The FederalBureauof Statisticshasrevised the nationalaccounts statisticsin 2004, movingthe base year from
    1980/81to 1999/00. The government believes the newstatistics capturebetterthe state ofthe economyover the past
    20 years since some economic activityhadbeenunderestimatedor notreported. The rebasinghasresulted inGDP
    estimates for 1999/00and subsequent years 20 percenthigher. Usingthe revisedbase, GDP per capitain2003/04 is
    estimatedat US638 insteadofUS$521. Throughout thisreport,the oldstatistics are used since the analysisand
    decisions ofthe Bank duringthe periodcoveredbythis assessmentwere based onthe previousstatistics.
     Annex A presentsthe mainfeatures ofthe devolution.

                                                         3


2.4      Inthepoliticalarena, localofficials areelecteddirectly or indirectlydependingon
the tier. A key feature o f the reform is the establishment o fbodies through which citizens
are able to access andinfluence government at the local level, the most important o f
which beingthe Citizen CommunityBoard (CCB), formed voluntarily and composed o f
at least 25 members. CCBs can initiate development projects, establish cooperatives, and
support external oversight bodies, such as Monitoring Committees. At least 25 percent o f
the development budget o feachtier mustbe earmarkedfor development projects
identifiedbythe CCBs. At the administrative level, most functional departments o fthe
province were transferred to the districts with a similar, but smaller, structure at the tehsil
level, but not at union level, since there are no expenditure assignments to the union.

2.5      At the fiscal level, responsibilities for elementary andsecondary education,
primaryandsecondaryhealth, agriculture, andintra-districtroads weretransferred to the
districts, while municipal services, includingroads and streets, water supply systems,
sewers, andsanitation, were devolved to the tehsils.' Although union administrations
(UA) were not assignedservice-delivery responsibilities, they are infact responsible for
small-scale development projects. Onthe revenue side, the mechanism adopted for the
transfer o fresources from the provinces to LGs mirrors the revenue sharingsystem at the
federal-provincial level. A ProvincialFinanceCommission(PFC) is to decide, for a
medium-termperiod, the shareofa"divisible pool" to betransferred to districts
according to a formula basedonpopulationand an index o f`%backwardness", the
provincekeeping resources for expenditures for which it i s responsible, including debt
liabilities. Since their creation, PFCs have not made any awards covering a medium-term
period and interim awards are extended every year. The implementation o fthe fiscal
reforms is far from complete; as a result, the responsibility for andthe actual delivery o f
public services are still very muchblurred.

2.6      Upto now, implementationofthe devolutionhasbeenvery uneven among
provinces, due to a host o f factors: unclear processes, procedures, andmandates, lack o f
capacity at the local levels, insufficient financial resources, delocalizationo fpersonnel,
and, last butnot least, considerable resistanceontheparto ftheprovincesandtheir staff.

   2.8     Income per capita is about 30 percent lower thanthe national average. Poverty in

   rural areas (49 percent, against 31percent inurbanareas). Social indicators are very low
   andthe gender disparity is the highest inthe country: the average family size is 7.8
   (against 6.8 for the country); the average size farmis 2.2 acres (against 9.4); morethan
   40 percent o fchildrenunder two are not fully immunized; infant andmaternal mortality
   rates are above national averages; female literacy i s only 15 percent (against 27);
   enrolment o f girls inprimary education is 54 percent against 84 percent for boys.
   Generally, the populationinthe NWFPhas a muchlower access to physical andhealth-

 THESTRATEGYCONTEXT AND PROJECTORIGIN

 3.1       TheBank'scountry assistancestrategy ofNovember 1995, acknowledgedthat
 Pakistan's progress ingrowth hadhardlybeen accompanied by increasedpeople's access
to basic services andimproved quality o f life andthat Pakistancontinued to lag behind
 other countries at comparable levels o f development inkey social indicators, in
differences betweenpoor andnon-poor, andingender disparities. To meet that
challenge, the thrust o fthe strategy was to helpreduce poverty, notablyby focusing on
 service delivery, andit notedupfkont "To this end, we intendto work with the
Government to involve communities,the private sector. Such apartnershipi s necessary
to deliver results on the ground faster."6

3.2        Although it continuedto support the SAP,' the Bankargued that it hadto be
complementedby expanding access to and improving the delivery of core social services,
notably "by raisingthe participationo fpeople indesigning, implementing, and
monitoringprograms to improve their lives more quickly", andby "targeting poor
women and children, particularly inrural areas -including the North, where needs are
great but which hasnot receivedsufficient donor attention inthe past.* Thus, the Bank
presented the NWFP CIP as a project "under which communities inlow-income areas are
involved inselecting, planning, operating, andmaintainingtheir infrastructure, as well as
financing a significant share o fthe cost".'

3.3        The project finds its originina seriesof studies conductedbythe Bankin1989
andbyNHA,anarmo fthe Ministry o fHousingandWorks, which hadconcluded that
earlier approaches o f constructing and financing serviced plots andnew homes or
upgradingprojects without community involvement hadnot served low-income groups
andtended to ignore issues relatedto operation andmaintenance (O&M). Onthebasis o f
these findings, NHA andthe Government o fthe NWFP (GONWFP) came to the
conclusionthat addressing the infrastructure needs o f low-income communities required
community involvement, with dueregardto affordability, sustainability, andeffective
O&M arrangements. The provincedeveloped new policies for community infrastructure
providing for a contribution by the community o fthe landrequired, of at least 20 percent
o fthe capital cost (excluding primaryinfrastructure), and o f 100percent o f O&M costs,
the local councilhaving to contribute 10percent o fthe capital cost (excluding primary
infiastructure). The province launched two pilot operations onthat basis, which served
as blueprint for the preparationo fthe CIP.

OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

3.4      The objective o fthe projectwas to increase the productivity and living conditions
o f low-income groups inthe NWFP through the provisionofbasic infrastructure and
community development (CD). This was to beachieved by: (i)         infrastructureupgrading
andCD inexistingurbanandrurallow-incomesettlements; (ii)           promoting the use o f
demand-driven, participatory designprocedures and affordable standards for
infrastructure; (iii)strengthening the ability of provincial andlocal governments to
collaborate with communities to implement low-income infrastructure programs; and (iv)
promoting sustainable arrangements for O&M o fbasic services. The mainbenefits
expected were improved health, increasedproductivity, andbetter business opportunities.
This objective remained unchangedthroughout project implementation, although there
was a shift inemphasis towards institutional strengthening, at both the federal and local
levels, after devolution was announced. There were two components to achieve the
objective:

         Upgrading of CommunityInfrastructure (CI) consisting of: (i)upgradingo fbasic
        infrastructure inabout 55 urbanandrural communities, including, inter alia,
        provisiono fwater supply, storm water drainage, flood protection, streets and
        footpaths, sanitation and solid waste management; (ii)    provision o f incentive
        grants towards the cost o fon-plot sanitation facilities; (iii)
                                                                     carrying out o f CD,
        provisiono f healthandhygiene education, and, wherever requested by the
        community, improvement o f landregistrationfacilities and documentation; and
  .     (iv) provisiono fdesignandimplementationassistance, including the
        establishment or strengthening and operation o fProject ImplementationUnits
        (PIUS),the provision ofconsultants' services, andtraining o f staff and
        communities.

     0  Institutional Development (ID)and Project Preparation consistingof: (i)
        provisiono fTA to NWFP for the carrying out o f a study for strengthening its
        Local Government, Elections andRuralDevelopmentDepartment (LGERDD),
        institutionalizingthe Project Management Unit's (PMU) infrastructurefunctions
        withinLGERDD, andstrengtheninglocalcouncils; (ii)         provisiono f TA to
        strengthen NHA, includingassistanceindata analysis andsector monitoring;
        programmonitoring, evaluation anddissemination; buildingtechnology
        evaluation and dissemination; policy development; andinformation exchange;
        and(iii) refinancing o fthe Project Preparation Facility(PPF).

3.5     Without affecting the overall objective o fthe project, several events ledto
changes inthe scope o f some sub-components and to reallocations o f funds. First,
substantial cost savings, arising from the devaluation o fthe PakistaniRupee, the smaller
size o fthe communities served inthe earlyphases o fthe project, andthe slow progress o f
some components ledthe Federal Government (GOP), GONWFP, andthe Bank to agree
at the mid-term review inMay 1999,to extend the C I component to 35 communities, o f
which 10were extensions o f existing schemesto neighboringcommunity blocks and
were referred to as "deepening" schemes.

                                                            7


3.6        Second, it was agreed to refocus effort to the institutionalizationo f community
mobilization anddevelopment processes andto buildthe capacity o f LGs to enable them
to undertake community based development activities." However, with no progress in
implementation after about 18 months andwith devolution takingshape, the scope o fthe
sub-component was revised again to target institutional support initiatives to strengthen
the capacity o f LGofficials.

3.7        Third, a similar evolutiontook place at the federal level. Inmid-2000, GOP
requested that NHAbe replacedby the Ministry o f Environment, Local Government and
Rural Development (MELG&RD) as the entity responsible for ID andpolicy formulation
andthat a substantial portionofthe Creditbereallocated to that sub-component. The
Bankagreedto broadenthe sub-component to finance anationwideinformationand
trainingprogram on participatory approaches insupport o f the newly elected LG
officials. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) andthe Project Agreement (PA)
were amendedinJune 2001to reflect these changes.

3.8        The maindesign features ofthe C Icomponent were the following:

      0    a fairly complex institutional set-up within the provincial government with
           LGERDDas the departmentresponsible for the project, andaPMUresponsible
           for providing the technical resources and capacity for planning, design,
           implementation, and day-to-day project management." The PMUwas to be
           strengthened inplanningand CD, design and implementation, M&E, andfinance,
          while the PIUS,whether existingor to be established at the divisional level, were
          to be strengthened with Social Organizer Coordinators (SOC) to assist inCD.

      0   the component was to cover 55 communities inthree phases(20,27,8) over five
          years (subsequently increased to 90 as notedabove), with upgradingo f an
          individual scheme expected to take 2-3 years. Community-Based Organizations
          (CBOs) were to be extensively involved inall stages o fthe project cycle.

     0    the criteriafor pre-selecting communities were: low income; lack o fbasic
          infrastructureor slum area; settlements above 3,000 persons; geographic spread
          andurbdrural balance; andpotential for communityparticipation. To be
          eligible, the schemes proposed by communities were to satisfy the following:

          costs, as per the provincial guidelines (at least 20 percent ltkomthe communities +
          evidence o f community and local councilparticipationandcontributionto capital

           10percent fromthe localcouncils, excludingprimaryinfrastructure); availability
          o fprimary infi-astructure, basedon a separatefeasibility studyreviewedby the
          Bank; environmental sustainability; technical andeconomic viability (the costper
          scheme was limited to Rs 7,200 per householdnet of community contribution);


loThe sub-component was renamed Institutional Strengthening Program (ISP). The Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation (SDC), the cofinancier, agreed to raise its contribution from US3.5 i l l i o n to US$4.5 millionto
assist inthis task.
 The PMUhadbeen created in 1989 to design and implement the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Second Urban
Development Project. It hadresponsibility for infrastructure projectspreparation.

                                               8


         andsustainability inthe form ofprior agreementsto adopt the completed works
         andto provide the financing o fO&M (100percent). Inaddition, continued
         satisfactory O&M was a conditionfor further eligibility.

3.9      The design o f theproject remained substantially unchanged after the
announcement o fthe devolution plan, except that 8 o f the 35 new sites -designated as
pilots  - were to be executedby Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMA) inaccordance
withtheirnewresponsibilities. This was to test the principleso fcommunity
infrastructure development andparticipationunder the new institutional set up.


RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

3.10     The objective o fthepioject was fully consistent withthe 1995 Bank's country
assistance strategy andwas -and still i s -highlyrelevant. However, its design suffered
from several institutional weaknesses inherent to having a decentralized community-
basedproject executed byahighlycentralized andcomplex administration, with its
attendant bureaucratic layers andrigiddecision-making processes. It underestimated the
institutionalgap between the provincial level and the grass root community level as well
as the negative impact causedbythe hightumover o fstaff inthe Pakistanicivil service.
It attempted to fillthat gapbybeefingup the staffo fthe PMUandPIUs andthe
provisiono f a consortiumofconsultants, but, at the same time, created an even more
complex structure. More importantly, ownership o fthe CIP modelby the provincial
authorities was overestimated as evidencedby their skepticism towards the lower levels'
capacity to assume ownership andimplementationo fdevelopment projects, andtheir
resistance to delegate power and/or reticence to buildup capacity at the lower level. The
attitude exhibitedbythe provincialauthorities of "looking down" uponthe lower
administrative levels cameto the open withthe implementationo f devolution. Another
factor whose impact was underestimated was the extent to which the particular social
norms o fthe province -muchmore restrictivethaninthe other provinces - wouldbe
limitingtheroleo fwomenindecision-making andparticipatoryactivities. To sum up,
although the objective o fthe project was sound, its institutionalset-up was tenuous and
fragile.

IMPLEMENTATION

3.11 From the very beginning, the project faced serious constraints to implementation:
(i) wavering Government ownership, with flequent changes inleadership, poor
understandingo fandcommitment to theproject principles, andconsequently
considerable delays inapproval o fbudgets and administrativedecisions, including
appointment o fkeypersonnel; (ii)    appointments o f directors general to the PMUwith
little or no experience; (iii) management and implementation capacity o fPMU
                              limited
andPIUstaffdistractingconsultants from their normaltasks; (iv) poor delineationo f
tasks betweenPMUandPIUs compounded by an acute shortage o f logistical support in
the field; (v) highly centralized administrative, financial, andbudgetaryprocedures; (v)
restrictivepolicies on the recruitment o fNGOs, slowing considerably the outsourcing o f
capacities andskills inCD andjeopardizing their potentialrole inestablishing CD on a

                                                        9


long-termbasis; (vi) highturnover of staff; (vii) low salaries andincentives for field staff,
especially for the Social Organizers (SO) negatively affecting their morale and
motivation; and (viii) gender imbalance inthe PMUandPIUs and among SOs, a critical
shortcoming for C D as it frustrated not only communitymobilizationbut also the more
comprehensive program covering sanitation, health and hygiene education, andthe
specific activities targetedat women and children.

3.12      The adverse impact o fthe above constraints hadbecome clear bythe mid-term
reviewinMay 1999, as there was a significant imbalance betweenphysical
implementationand the broader social objectives o fthe project, reflecting a lack o f
commitment to andan inability to create the basic conditions for CD as much as a lack o f
institutionalcapacity at all levels. That imbalance persisted till the end ofthe project.
Themid-termreview concluded that, without amajor improvement inthe overall
management o f the project, itwould be difficult for theproject to be completedand for
its objectives to be achieved bythe closingdate, December 31,2001                    .Iz To redress the
situation, GONWFP andthe Bank agreedon a two-pronged strategy: (i)                        the need for an
outsourcing plano fNGOs; and (ii) gradual transfer o fresponsibilitiesfrom the CIP
                                             the
modelto greater reliance on LGs for the provisiono fcommunity services. However,
little was achieved inthe ensuing two years for a mix of constraints listed above to the
                                                       -                                              -
point that the Bank seriously considered downgrading the rating o fthe project to
unsatisfactory and was reluctant to consider extending the closing date despite repeated
requestsfrom GONWFP official^.'^

3.13     Against this background, there was one positive development, the slow but
increasing pace inthe construction o fphysicalinfrastructure, an indication, accordingto
Bankmissions, ofthe interestinandownership bythe communities ofdemand-driven
schemes. Duringthat period, the Bank exhibited an ambiguous andvacillating attitude
towards the project and sent conflicting signals to the authorities: on the one hand,
stressing-sometimes instrong terms the failings ofthe project with threats o f
                                                -
cancellations; on the other, entertaining since December 1999, the prospect o f a second
operation.l4Itwas only bymid-2001,with the arrival o f a new Director General at the
PMU, the removalofsome administrative bottlenecks, the recruitment o f additional SOs,
andthepartnership withthree NGOs, that some components startedmakingnoticeable
progress. However, even withthe closingdate extended first to December 31,2002, and
againto June 30,2003, several activities couldnot be completed as envisaged originally.

roadpaving, and drainage, with only a few water supply projects. Constructionof
primaryinfrastructure was carried out by contractors, while secondary or community-       -
infrastructure was carried out by contractors andthe communities themselves. ByJune
 30,2003, the closing date o fthe Credit, most o fthe physicalworks were reported as
completed. The data are scanty, but there is little doubt that the additional sites involved
less work andwere implementedmorerapidly, partlyunder the pressure o f the
approaching closingdate." At appraisal, it hadbeenestimated that the project would
reach some 420,000 beneficiaries; at closing, the estimate was 600,000, including indirect
beneficiaries.I6 According to a "Third-party Evaluation", covering a sample o f 12
communities carried out by consultants inlate 2002, the investment cost of a typical
schemewas some 35-40 percent lower than local government norms due to much lower
unitcosts. This evaluation also reportedthat the workswere generally ofgoodquality."

3.15       Onthe crucialquestion o fthe communities' contributiono f 20 percent to capital
costs, the picture is not clear: the visit to the field by IEGrevealed that, inseveral -ifnot
many-cases, contractors hadfinanced this contributionthemselves inorder to speedup
contract award. Regardingthe 10percent contribution by the Local Councils, little
information i s available, but on several occasions, the provincehad to advance the funds.
Similarly, inthe caseo fthe 8 pilot sites implementedbyTMAs, theprovincehadto
advancethe funds. Strangely, the source o f the contributions to the capital cost, a
cornerstone - with O&M           - ofthe sustainabilityo f any CD project, i s not discussed inany
supervision report or the ICR.

3.16       Sanitation. The project provided for incentive grants o f about 25 percent towards
the approved cost ofon-plot sanitation facilities. However, as early as mid-1997,
GONWFPdecided to drop the component due to a change inpolicy on subsidizationof
house latrines as it created equity problems andhadnot yielded positiveresults inother
projects. Byway of compromise, it accepted to support the component inthe first 29
sites where it hadbeencommitted to the communities. For the remaining sites, it was
agreedto look into other options basedon communal facilities rather than individual
ones. However, no progress was made on this issue untilclosure.

3.17       Community Development. This is the area where implementationdifficulties were
the most visible andcausedmost delay. Communitymobilization andorganizationupto
the preparation o fCommunity Action Plans (CAP)were more or less instep with
infrastructure construction. However, four issues arise when assessingperformance
under this phase o f CD. They all cast doubt on the genuine involvement o f the
communities: (i)      political interference i s recognizedto haveplayed an important role in
the identificationand selection o f sites duringthe first two years o fthe project; (ii)
infrastructure construction was the drivingforce o fthe project, as opposed to what would

 be expectedwhen dealingwith Community-Driven Development (CDD). This is
 consistently notedby supervision reports andi s illustratedbythe decision, as early as
 mid-1997, to reduce the time allotted for CAP preparation from 29 to 7 days not to delay
 construction and speed up disbursements. Although community mobilizationwas
 supposedto continue duringdetailed design and other preparation activities, this decision
 had a negative impact on consensus buildingand decision-making among community
 members andwas counterproductive; (iii)                   there was a lack o funderstandingo f what
 "community mobilization" actually means as well as a lack o f an agreed actionplano f
 the activities to becarried out with the communities, includingtiming, methodology,
 assignment o f responsibilities, strategy for women activities, etc. As a result, combined
 with the constraints listed above, the scope andcontent o fthis component lackedrigor
 andimplementationwas inevitablyloose,18and(iv) women were little involvedinthe
 earlyphases o fcommunity mobilization andinthe choice o finfrastructure, since their
 own CBOs were not the maininterlocutorsinthis area."

 3.18      The second areao fthe CD component was the provision ofhealthandhygiene
 education ando f specific activities targeted to women and children. Bythe mid-term
 review inMay 1999, implementation o fthese programs hadnot started andno h d s had
 been spent.2oThis was the major reason for the Bankto insist onpartnerships with
 NGOs. However, as already noted, problems continued untila new Director General,
 appointed inmid-2001, took remedial actions. Eventhen, formal approval at a higher
 levelmeant delay.2' Iti s only by early 2002, after removal o f administrative bottlenecks,
 that progress was more sustained inprovidingtraining inhealth and education andin
 runningawareness andorientationcampaigns on O&M. ByJanuary2003, CD activities
 were beingimplementedon 74 sites by SOs, andon 16 sites bythree NGOs." Funds
 allocated to these activities were spent at 65 percent.

 3.19      Technical Assistance and Training. Up to the terminationo f its contract in
 December 1998, the consultant consortium spent an inordinate amount o ftime and
 energy to compensate for the management shortcomings o fthe PMU. As a result, the
training of PMUmanagers and staffwas carried out inanhaphazard way, while the
different training needs analyses, andpreparation o ftrainingprograms andmaterials for
 CIP staff, field personnel, and CBOs suffered delays. Despite the subsequent
appointment o f a Training Coordinator andthe recruitmento f individual consultants, it
took a longtime to translate the results o fthe different needs analyses into training

'* An internal  document o f 1997mission states:  " we needa clear definitiono f `community mobilization' and criteria
for judging ifit has been adequately achieved."
  At the two sites visited by IEG, the mission hadrequestedto meetwiththe women to ascertaintheir prioritiesvis-21-
vis those of the menand obtain their views on the benefits from the infrastructure built,but permission was deniedon
the grounds that it was against the "social norms".

'OAn internal document following the mid-term missionreads as an indictment o f CD activities, especially ofthe
different social programs.
21Discussingthe activities underthis CD sub-component, an internal document o fMay 2001notes: "The feedback
from the women's CBOs has been consistently critical o fthe packages offered by the Project for women and children.
While mobilizationand capacity building o ftheir CBOs generates great enthusiasmand expectations, the Project
provides little incentives [sic] to sustain themthrough its interventions aimed specifically for them."

  concepts andprograms as well as to traintrainers. This bleak situation was exacerbated
  when the scope and content o fthe trainingprograms hadto berevised to respondto the
  needs o f the devolution. Bythe endo f theproject, training was impartedto the
  communities bythe CD staff and some NGOs. However, with the implementationofthe
  Institutional Strengthening Program(ISP) underthe IDcomponent, training programs
  were increasinglymerged with activities conceived for andtargeted to respondto the
  needs o f the new localtiers o f government. This was the case for the TMAs responsible
  for the 8 pilot sites and even for the PMU.

  3.20    Monitoring and Evaluation. The project envisaged anM&E framework
  consisting of: (i)MIS as a management tool for the PMU; (ii)
                     a                                              aperformance
  monitoring system to measureprogress against plans, quality o fimplementation, and
  effectiveness inreaching objectives; and (iii) aprocess monitoring system to analyze
  project processes andthereby identifyingpotential areas for improvement. Although
  their designwas timely, the effective operationalization o f the M&E systems was
  considerably delayed due to a lack o f skilled staff, delays inprocurement, uncertaintyo f
  assignments, andpoor cooperation among staff. Inaddition, the role o fM&E in
  providing informationto management for effective andtimely decision-makingwas not
  hllyappreciated. As a result, M&Ewas longneglected andthe M&Eunitoften
' performedadhoctasksto supportmanagement. Ittookseveralyears, untilalocalM&E
  specialist was recruited, to streamline the framework. The process monitoring system,
  administered by the Bank's Water and Sanitation Program(WPS), provedto be the most
  useful inattempting to institutionalizeprocesses. Bank supervision reports address at
  length the travails o fmakingthe different M&E systems operational but they, as well as
 the ICR, provide no information on what they finally deliveredinterms o fmeasuring
  achievements.

  3.21    Operation andMaintenance. Bythe time o fthe mid-termreview, the PMUhad
  signed O&M agreementswith all the 55 original communities, describing their
 responsibilities. However, inpractice, CBOs hadnot been effectively mobilized and
 their contributions (100 percent) not collected. Inaddition, O&M activities hadnot been
 institutionalized inthe CIPprocesses andnot monitored. Duringthe ensuing two or three
 years, progress was slow and inpace withthe handingover o f completed sites to CBOs.
 A complicating anddelayingfactor emergedin2001becausethe O&M agreements
 provided for the CBOs to beresponsible for O&M o fprimaryworks, instead o fthe local
 councils, as providedinthe SAR, givingrise to conflicts between communities and
 councils. Bymid-2002, O&M orientation andtraining were underway inall o fthe 55
 original sites andwere to start inthe 35 additional sites. Effective O&M was reported to
 be unevenwith technical problems unsolvedinsome cases. Inthe case ofwater supply
 schemes, communities are reported not to be able to afford O&M.

 Achievements under theInstitutional Development Component

 3.22    Institutional StrengtheningProgram. The objective o fthe component was to
 institutionalize CD processes andto buildthe capacity o f LG institutions to undertake CD
 activities themselves. After the component hadbeenredirected to supporting the new
 LGs, as notedabove, the provincialauthorities haddifficulties indesigningaprogram

                                               13


anddefiningthe responsibilities for its implementation. Also, the hiringo fthree ID
specialists was not completed untilearly 2002. By end 2002, all thepreparatory work had
been completed (work program, budget, needs assessment o fTMAs), but additional local
consultants were to be recruited to tailor the programs to the specific needs o f concerned
TMAs. Byproject end, itwas agreedthat the program wouldbeactually implemented
over 2003, andpossibly beyond, with the financial assistanceo f SDC. As a result, actual
implementation o f the ISP didnot take place while the Bank was present inthe project,
butthe component certainlycontributedto helpingtheprovincial authorities laythe
ground for strengtheningLGs.

3.23    Federal Facilitation Program. After the component hadbeenfinally revised,
some progress was made indevelopinga nationwideawareness andtraining program for

National Reconstruction Bureau o\sRB),the architect o fthe devolution, questioned the
elected LGofficials. lmplementation started inMarch2001, but after three months, the

timing, target audience, androleofsome ofGOP entities indissemination, monitoring,
andpolicyreview anddevelopment. This createdfurther delay. Inthe end, a fairly large
number o fmastertrainers, trainers andofficialsweretrained, buttheprogramwas
launched too soon after local officials hadbeenelected (they hardlyknew what their new
responsibilitieswere to be), andthe trainers didnot have the requisite expertise. The
component hadno effectiveimpact andwas abandoned.

OUTCOME

3.24    The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is confirmed. There i s no firm evidence
that the project ledto increasedproductivity andimprovedlivingconditions o f low-
incomepeople inthe province. Certainly, the well-being o f the communities concerned
has beenraised inthat benefits derived from improvedinfrastructure are likely to endure
for the medium-term. But the implementationrecordcasts doubt on having achieved the
central objective o fgenerating genuine CD. Inaddition to widespread political
interference duringthe first two years o f implementation, the effectiveness withwhich
the specific objectives were attained i s blurredand questionable at best: this is the case
for the sustainability o f a CDD and voluntary participatory approach; for the
empowerment o f communities to launchnew development initiatives; for the ability o f
provincial and local governments to collaborate withcommunities; and for the
sustainabilityo fO&M arrangements. The IEGmissionrevealed that opinions vary
widely about the true achievement o f a CD spirit: most observers indicatedthat the latter
buildsupwhenthere is a common andimmediate interest at hand, but quickly dwindles
once the project i s completed. Also, achieving the objective is crucially dependent on
effective andpermanent O&M, a factor which is uncertain.

3.25    The uncertainty concerning results is largely due to two relatedfactors: (i)  not
only did it take a long time to set up a M&Eframework, but also it was not used as a tool
bytheproject management; and(ii)      whatever the quality o fthe M&E systems and o fthe
informationand data collected, the supervision and completion missions failed to use and
report them. This was a major failure for a project aimed at testing the innovative and
replicable character o f a new CDD model.

                                                                   14


      INSTITUTIONAL         DEVELOPMENT             IMPACT

      3.26     Therating of Modest is confirmed. While there i s uncertainty as to genuine CD
      among the communities covered bythe project, the latter had apositive impact on the
     provincial and some local authorities inthat they became aware o f a new development
     moaelbut also o fthe new challenges to meet. However, the rating cannot be superior
     becausethe ISP component was so much delayed that itwas not carried out before
      closingo fthe Credit, while the FederalFacilitationProgramwas only partly and
     inconclusivelyundertaken.

      SUSTAIN ABILITY

      3.27     The ICRreview rated sustainability as Non-evaluable on the basis o finsufficient
     time to assess the criterion. Thisassessment rates sustainability as Unlikely. Several
      factors -keyto promote CD               - point    to unsustainability: (i) extent to which
                                                                                      the
     communities themselves financed their contributionto capital costs i s uncertain,u (ii)
     local councils had difficulties inmeeting their own contribution to capital costs; (iii)
     acceptanceo fresponsibility andwillingness to pay for O&M bythe beneficiaries is
     questionable; (iv) the project didnot succeed ininstitutionalizing processeswithinthe
     provincial and local administrations; and(v) the fundamental changes introducedbythe
     devolution are likely to radically disruptwhatever modus operandi was achieved between
     theprovincial/local authorities andthe communities, leadingall stakeholders to approach
     new CD projects (such as the ongoing CIP-11) ina different frame o fmind,with little or
     no interest infollow-up o f the first operation.24

     BANKPERFORMANCE

     3.28      Therating of Unsatisfactoly is maintained. The Bank failed intwo major
     respectsat the time o fpreparatiodappraisal: (i)overestimated the commitment of the
                                                                        it
     provincial government andits willingnedabilityto internalize a development approach
     based on the community beingthe principal actor. Itmisjudgedthe inherent conflict o f
     developing andcarrying out a fimdamentally decentralized project through ahighly
     centralized administration; and (ii) risks were poorly identified and categorized at
                                                        the
     appraisal withunclear andunspecific mitigatingmeasuresbuilt inthe design o fthe
     project.

     3.29      Infairnessto theBank,implementationistobejudged consideringthenoveltyof
     the approachinadifficult context. Also, Bankperformancewas affected bythe

.    disruptions anduncertainties causedby the devolution so that attribution o f some failures
     i s not easily identifiable. However, eachmissionreports reads more as reporting on a


     23Most officials interviewedby the IEGmissionrecognizedthat requestingthe communities to contribute to capital
     costswas advisable, but few thought that a cashcontribution was the preferable way; .most were infavor of
     contributions inkind.

    24 The possibility of such a lack of interest is illustratedby the following. On the occasion of the IEGmission, the
   PMUpersonnelhadnot come to one o f the sites visitedsince completion o f the project in 1998. The explanation was
   that, once aproject is completed, it is "delivered" to the community without further involvement on the parto fthe
   PMU. This is certainly not conducive to assessingoutcome or sustainability.

                                                15


 "rescue mission" than on a "supervision mission", eachone containing a list o f "critical
  actions" to be takenby officials andthe PMU, only to be repeatedand/or readjusted at
 the nextmission. The Bank failed to act decisively and showed great hesitationin
  responding to the lack o fprogress inimplementation, shifting from threats to
  acquiescence. This raises the questionwhether too much attention was devoted to
  completing the "visible" components     - physicalinfiastructure - at all costs (including
  extending it by adding 35 sites) before Credit closing, at the expenseo f analyzing and
  testing the conditions necessary for successfulCD inall its aspects. Inother words, faced
 withcontinuous delays, itmight havebeenpreferable to limitthe physical size o fthe
 project and shift resources to the broader social aspects o f CD, since this was after all the
 ultimate objective o f aproject that was to a large extent a test. The unfortunate outcome
  is that fairly little has beenlearned interms o fkey determinants o f success and
  sustainability o f C D inthe Pakistanicontext, andtherefore ofits replicability inthe
  country and elsewhere.

  BORROWERPERFORMANCE

  3.30     The rating of Unsatisfactory is confimzed. GONWFP showed little or no
  commitment for most of the time, with little interest inattempting to understand and
- assimilate the philosophy underlying the project. This i s amply illustrated by the
 passivity inface o fpolitical interference, delays inadministrative approvals, reluctance to
  facilitate financial flows andtransfers, highturnover instaff, lack o finterest inM&E,
  and, lastbutnot least, verypoor management. Provincialofficials showed little
 motivation andwillingness to learnandto adapt. Also, officials took no steps to mitigate
 the negative impact o f social norms on implementation andattainment o fobjectives: for
 the durationo fthe project, there was not a single woman inthe management team, while
 the project had an important component targeting women and children. The rating also
 applies to GOP, which proved indecisive andunable to articulate a clear actionprogram
 for its institutionalcomponent, which, inthe end, was rushed through without impact
 whatsoever.

4.       The ProvincialStructuralAdjustment Credits

THESTRATEGY CONTEXT

4.1      Underthe 1973 Constitution, mostpublic services arethe responsibility o fthe
provinces. Their budgetsaccount for 80 percent o fPakistan's public expenditures on
education, health, roads, andirrigation services. Incontrast, since tax authority i s
concentratedat the federal level, federal transfers, based onNFC "awards", account for
around 80 percent o fprovincialresources.25This dependence on federal transfers had led
to an increasingmismatchbetween provincialexpenditures andrevenues, a situationthat
promptedthe Bankto launch, inearly 1999, an analysis o fprovincial finances andtheir
fiscal sustainability.26

4.2      In1999, theMusharrafgovernment quickly adopted acomprehensive reform
program and startedpreparinga poverty reduction strategy. Progress was rapidly
achieved, and GOP reached an agreement with the IMFon a Stand-By arrangement in
November 2000, followedby a Paris Club debt restructuringinJanuary 2001.
Satisfactoryperformance underthe Stand-By ledthe Bankto review its assistance
strategyinMay 2001 ina CAS Progress Report (CASPR)27andto resume lendingwith a
US$350millionnationalSAC, which covered public resource management andreforms
inthebanking, power andgas sectors. The Bankstrategy wastailoredto addressnot
only the emergingpillars o fthe government' povertyreduction strategy (macro-economic
stability, humandevelopment, growth, and governance), but also the needto build
knowledge followed by lendinginsupport o fthe dialoguewith the provinces andthe
newly established LGs. The areas targeted were governance, humandevelopment, and
community-based services. GOP expected its new program o f devolutionto makethe
public sector more accountable to users andmore efficient at delivering basic social
services.

4.3      InJune2002, afullCAS2*was issuedinaverydifferent context. Theimproved
economic management over the previous two years andthe events o f September 11,2001
hadledto significant donor support, including from the Bankwith a U S 5 0 0 million
SAC-II at the national level. The CAS,prepared inparallel with the two provincial
SACs, stressedthe needto: (i)         shift the focus to policy and implementationperformance
at the provincial level, as hadbeen the case at the federal levelwith GOP's reform
program; (ii)   proceed first with knowledgetransfer and capacity buildingas the best way
to reap pay-offs; and (iii)     improve systematically governance inservice delivery. At the

 IMMEDIATE BACKGROUND DESIGN        AND

4.4      The findings o fthe study onprovincial finances greatly influenced the content
anddesigno fthe two SACs. Startedin 1999, the study hadhighlightedthe fact that the
poor performance inreducingpoverty inthe 1990swas as much due to the inability o f
the provincial and local governments to provide essential public services as to the failure
o f GOP to sustain a highGDP growth rate. Itpointedto the provinces' weak governance
andpublic finances as key factors behindthis failure andnotedthat, while some initial
reforms hadbeenundertaken, there remained a large agendato tackle inresource
mobilization and expenditure management. The study arguedthat, for devolution to
succeed, the provinces neededto restore their public finances and generate sufficient
resources to fund LGs. The Bank/provinces dialogue onthe subject took a new turnwith
the appointment o ftechnocrats to the provincial governments, who quickly undertook an
intensivereflection on the dire economic andfinancial situationthey hadinherited andon
the way to redress it. Withthe support o fthe President andtheir governor, the NWFP
andSP government leaders developedareformprogramover 2001, which was to become
the basis o fthe two SACS.~'

4.5     The design o fthe two SACswas similar. Itwas largely influencedbythe
conditionspreyailing at the time andbythe 2002 CAS. The Bankwas cautious and
skeptical o fthe chances o f success o f adjustment operations conductedby the provinces
given the perceivedrisks: the novelty o fthe idea; the stability o fthe regime; the
commitment at the federal andprovincial levels; the weak institutional and administrative
capacity; the uncertainty associatedwith the devolutionjust announcedbut yet to be
implemented; and, last but not least, the prospect o f federal andprovincial elections in
October 2002.

4.6     The provincial authorities were conscious o fthe difficulties ando fthe Bank's
skepticism. To overcome the latter, they felt itwas critical not only to develop a reform
program but also to start implementingit on their own. Such a course o f actionwould
raise the chances o f gaining credibility with stakeholders andthe donor community, and,
at the same time, demonstrate the feasibility o f a sub-national model andthejustification
for financial support. The areas oftheir program selected for refomwere those where
shortcomings were most acute, Le., public finance, financial management, social services,
andprivate sector development. A corollary -andpractical objective inthe mindo f
                                                                           -
these "champions", was to create a situation such that it would be difficult for subsequent
provincial governments, notablyafter the October 2002 elections, to depart from the post
reform set-up, thereby increasing the likelihood o f continuedreforms and sustainability in
the medium-to long-term.


29There was however strongoppositionand skepticismonthe part ofthe federalbureaucracy. The leadershipof
PunjabProvince also participatedinthe dialogueonprovincialfinances, but eventually decided infavor of an
adjustmentprograminthe educationsector.

4.7      Given the authorities' desire to show ownership andits own skepticism, the Bank
opted for a series o f SACScovering a three-year period. Self-activating entry and exit
triggers for continuedBank assistancewere agreed, inadditionto the maintenance ofa
satisfactory macro-economic framework. Thus, the first operation was based on a set o f
actions takenbefore Boardpresentation. The size o fthe Credits was based on the direct
cost o f reforms, the strength ofthe reform program, absorptive capacity, and the resource
requirements o f expandingsupport for priority social services. They were to allow the
provinces to incur larger budgetaryexpenditures derivedfrom implementingthe
program, especially the costs o f fiscal restructuring and service delivery improvements.
Both Credits consisted o f one tranche, disbursedupon effectiveness. They were onlent in
local currency to the provinces according to a subsidiaryloan agreement providing for
the exchange riskto bebornebyGOP, a service charge of34 of 1percent ontheprincipal
amount withdrawn and outstanding, and an amortizationperiod o f 35 years, including a
grace period o f 10years. Accordingly, the full benefito fIDA terms on debt repayment
accrued to the provinces andnot to the federal government. The reformprogramo f each
provincewas detailed ina Letter o fDevelopment Policy. The actions takenprior to
Boardpresentation are inAnnexes B and C for the NWFP and SP, respectively.

Objectives

4.8     InJune2001, GONWFPadoptedaneconomic andsocial reformprogram, the
Provincial ReformProgram (PRP) 2001-2004, whose broadobjectives were to restore
good governance andthe respect for the rule o f law, enhancethe effectiveness o fpublic
expenditures, andreestablish the integrity ofthe State institutions andtheir accountability
to the public. Therewere four pillars, with strengthening governance to improve public
service delivery as the cross-cutting theme: (i) strengthening governance through the
reform o fthe civil service to strengthen the accountability, integrity, andprofessionalism
o f State institutions; (ii)
                          strengthening public healthand education delivery systems and
the devolution o fresponsibilities to expand access to these services, with a focus on
primaryservice delivery; (iii) andfinancial managementreforms to increase
                                fiscal
provincial revenues, reprioritize expenditures, strengthen procurement and improve
budget preparation, execution, and oversight; and (iv) deregulation andbusiness
facilitation to enhanceprospects for growth andpoverty alleviation. The Credit endorsed
these four areas and aimed at supporting implementationo fthe program over FY03-05.
The Government which emerged from the October 2002 elections hadmany goals similar
to those o fthe PRP and o fthe SAC and, inJanuary 2003, it endorsed the project.

Relevance of Objectives

4.9     The objectives o fthe Credit were fully relevant as they were consistent with the
national I-PRSP, the PRP, andthe Bank's strategy. Its designwas also consistent with
the CAS' "engagement" principles: (i)strong client "pull" was undoubtedlypresent; (ii)
                                         a
the Credit was the first ina series given the prevailing uncertainties; and (iii)
                                                                                close

Development (DFID), andUNICEF, all involved inproviding support for the social
sectors, capacity building, and institutionalreform inthe province.

Implementation andAchievement of Objectives

4.10       Implementationandachievement of objectives are assessedbyreference not only
to the conditions prior to Boardpresentation andthe final triggers for a second SAC3'
(Le., actions taken prior to Board approval o f SAC-11               - Annex    D),3lbut also to general
progress inimplementingthe program. Generally speaking, implementation slowed
down after the October 2002 elections due to four factors: (i)                 the new govemment was
not formed untilDecember and, even after endorsing the program inJanuary2003, it
needed time to assimilate its content: (ii) were no longer dedicated "champions" to
                                                    there
maintain the momentum: (iii)         the teething problems o fthe devolution inevitably caused
uncertainties anddelays; and(iv) the lack o fpolitical alignment betweenthe provincial
anddistrict governments causedfrictions.

4.11 Governanceand CivilServiceReform. Achievements were mixedandsome
refoms were delayed. With regardto the administrative andoperational aspects o fthe
devolution, the following steps were taken: (i)            key provincial departments andmost of
the provincial staffwere transferred to the districts; (ii) authority to recruit teachers
                                                                       the
andmost o fthe non-policy functions, includingbudgeting, were also transferred; (iii)                      the
district rules o fbusinesswere revisedand notified; (iv) DisputeResolutionCommittees
were set up and a Local Government Commissionwas createdto oversee the working o f
the LGs andto help inconflict resolution; and (v) the rules andregulations governing
personnel management were revisedand simplified ina new EstablishmentCode.
However, implementation o fthese first steps was uneven, because o f delays in
transferring staffing budgets, inconsistencies indemarcation o fresponsibilities, and
provincial interference indistrict affairs.

4.12       Concerning the civil service reform andpersonnel management, progress was
achieved insome areas: (i)        several provincial departments were restructuredand
streamlined: (ii)     personnel policies were revised to promotemanagement on the basis o f
performance, merit, accountability, and transparency and to facilitate retirement o f
redundant or incompetent personnel; (iii)            the Public Service Commission (PSC) was
strengthened and its autonomy reinforced-it became solely responsiblefor all
recruitment above grade 11; (iv) personnelmanagement was made more flexible with all
new employment by fixed-term contract, except for the police andprison departments



30At the time of SAC-Iapproval(July 2002), it was anticipatedthat aseries ofthree SACSwould cover FY03 to FYOS.
Infact, delays underSAC-Iledto pushbackthesecondoperationbyone year. A secondSAC, inthe amount ofSDR
62.1million, was approved on June 22,2004, withthe Creditfully disburseduponeffectivenessandclosed on
December31,2004. At the time ofwriting ofthis report,the Bankand GONWFPwere discussingthe possibilityof a
third operation.

3'Someofthe triggers for a follow-upoperation, identified indicativeinthe SAC-Idocument, were kept, while
                                                         k
others were eitherdroppedor changedinthe courseof supervisionmissionsof SAC-Iand preparationofSAC-11.
Also, somenewtriggers were introduced. Changeswere madeto increase specificity, to respondto andhighlight the
priority reformsof the new govemment, and to strengthenreforms inkeyareas. Ingeneral, they hadthe effectof
"raising the bar".

                                                             21


andthejudiciary, thereby limitingpensionliabilities;'                      and(v) the first phaseofa
centralized HumanResource(HR)databasewas completed. Despitethese initial steps,
the efficacy o fthe refoms was hamperedby continuedhighturnover instaff, including
among highofficials. Inthe area o fjudicial reform, thejudiciary andthe executive were
separatedbefore the project, but the government failed to replacethe position o f
Magistrate, abolished bythe devolution, by family andminor civil courts, thereby
creating a vacuum inthe dispensation o fjustice to the disadvantaged.

4.13      Several ongoinginstitutional reforms andcapacity buildingprograms financed by
donors were extended anddeepened. They concentrated on training the staff o f LGs in
their new functions as well as the staffo fdifferent provincial commissions and CCBs.
GONWFPundertookareview o fthe capacity-buildingneeds for theprovince as awhole
andestablished severalreformunits, for education, health, andbudget analysis, as well as
a coordinationunit for the SAC. However, buildingcapacity at the local levelremains a
daunting`task for years to come.

4.14      Human Development. Progress was made andresults demonstrate an
improvement indelivery o f social services at the local level. Updated official data will
not be available until2006 when the results o fthe 2005 PakistanIntegratedHousehold
Surveys (PMS) will bepublished. Datainthe following paragraphs are from the 2005
PakistanSocial andLiving StandardMeasurement Survey (PSLMS) andare comparable
withthePMS.

4.15      Ineducation, goodprogresswas madeinimprovingaccessandgender disparity:
the GrossPrimaryEnrollment Rate (GER) rose from 73 percent inFY02to 80 percent in
FY05, with the gender gap decliningfrom 40 to 28 percentage points; it is likely to reach
the target o f 85 percent inFY06; the Net PrimaryEnrollment Rate (NER) (age 6-10) rose
from51to 57 percent duringthe same period, with the gender gap decliningfrom 23 to
18percentage points; the literacyrate (age 10 and older) rose from 38 to 45 percent; free
public education was expandedthrough secondary level and free textbooks were
provided to girls o f all grades andto boys upto grade 2 inall public primary schools; and
basic facilities were greatly improved ingirls' schools, including an increase o f 50
percent inclassrooms. Some progress was also achieved inraisingthe quality o f
education: separate teaching andmanagement cadres were created; the teacher-student
ratio was raised from 1:40 to 1:30; additional teachers were recruited, including over
1,500 female teachers; a systemofmonitoring teacher absenteeism, a major problem in
Pakistan, was introduced; andseveral public-privatepartnerships were established: the
private sector andthe community play anincreasing role, with Parents Teachers
Associations (PTA) active inalmost all primaryschools with the authority to manage the
InstructionalMaterials andMinor Repairs (IM&R) funds for minor school repairs.

4.14      Onthe financial side, total expenditures for education were substantially
increased startinginFY03, inline with the Medium-term Budgetary Framework

32With the FY04budget, GONWFP increasedthe sanctionedposts by 9,000 teachers, health workers, andpolicemen
to meet the needs for additional public services and lifted the ban on recruitment (ineffect for 7 years) of other
personnel categories, as it hadbecome a bottleneck to service delivery. However, the scope for expanding recruitment
underthese categorieswas limitedbythe number ofvacancies, thusrestrainingthe wage bill.

 (MTBF). Theyrose to 30.0 percent and30.6 percent oftotal expenditures inFY03 and
 FY04, respectively, against an average o f24.6 percent inFY99-01and22.4 percent in
 FY02, withreallocations infavor o fprimaryandsecondary education andvocational
 training. They are expected to remain at about 30 percent inFY05 andFY06 (Table 4.1).
 Also, inFY03, GONWFP overshot the target o f directing 70 percent o f development
 funds to girls' schools byreaching 81percent, while usercharges from higher education
were raisedby 14-30percent. InFY04, expenditures for education represented 3 percent
 o fthe provincial GDP (PGDP)33andwere expected to remainat that level.

4.15      A similar picture emergesinhealth. Therestructuring o fthe sector, initiated
before the projectby the provincialHealth Sector ReformUnit,whose mandate is to
reorganize the sector inline with devolution, was deepenedandexpanded insome areas:
increased resources andpowers were transferred to the districts; institutionalcapacity in
planningandbudgetingwas intensified at the district level; tertiaryhospitals were given
financial and administrative autonomywhile the network o fdistrict hospitals was
rationalized; a training program for nurses was launchedto ease their shortage and
several hundredsposts were created; facility-specific contracts were introducedto combat
absenteeism; the provincialmonitoring systems were strengthened; and several
partnerships with the private sector andNGOswere initiated. The results are as follows:
infantmortalitydeclinedby3 percent; the coverage ofpre-natal consultations rose
significantly betweenFY02 andFY05 andthe coverage o fpost-natal consultations from
4 to 21percent; the share o fpregnant womenhavingreceived a tetanus toxoid injection
rose fi-om 35 to 45 percent; immunizationof childrenaged 12-23 months increased fi-om
54 to 57percent under the project's periodandstands at 76 percent inFY05, a level
higherthanthe target of65 percent inFY06; the shareofpopulationwith accessto TB
controlusingdaily observation therapy sessions (DOTS) reached the end-FY06target o f
100percent; access to safedrinkingwater increased from 58 to 66 percent; andaccess to
familyplanningandprimaryhealthcare services were improvedbythe expansion ofthe
Lady HealthWorker (LHW)program, whose membership increased by over 50 percent.
4.16      Total spending for healthrose fi-om 5.5 percent o f total expenditures inFY02 to
7.1percent and 7.3 percent inFY03 andFY04, respectively (Table 4.1) andis expected


33There are no statistics on provincial GDP inPakistan. It is estimatedthat the GDP of the NWFP is 10-11 percent of
the national GDP.

to remainat that level inFY05-06. Itrepresents some 0.7-0.8 percent o fPGDP.
However, spending was lower thanbudgetallocations becauseof delays intransfemng
non-wage expenditure budgets to the districts, vacancies o f staff, capacity constraints,
andtime takento prepareandapprove new schemes, all factors illustratingthe needed
improvements inefficacy and capacity.

4.17      Public Finances. Reforms focused on improving fiscal sustainability and
restoringfinancial accountability. Despite an increase inthe fiscal deficit from 0.32
percent o fPGDPinFYOl to 1.62 percent inFY04              - reflectingrisingdevelopment
expenditures, GONWFPsucceeded, over FY02-04, inincreasing fiscal space (total
spending minusinterest payments andpensions). This was mainly due to two positive
developments: (i)        the substitution ofcheap IDAresources inFY03 andinFY04for
expensive debt, mostlyto the federal government (debt servicing fell from 3.3 percent o f
PGDPinFY02to 2.2 percent inFY04, while public debt fell from 17.8percent to 15.6
percent); and (ii)      increasedrevenues collected bythe province, which rose by 20.3
percent and 8.9 percent inFY03 andFY04, respectively(Table'4.2). This increase in
fiscal space, combined with reprioritization o f expenditures, permittedincreased
spending on the social sectors as notedabove.

irrigation water; (v) tax administrationwas strengthened; and (vi) three studies on tax
policy and administration(AIT and landtax; tax potential; andtax administration) were
completed that are to be the basis for continued tax reformunder the PRP. Onthe
expenditure side: (i) line with the MTBF, the shareo f current expenditures was
                          in
reduced substantially, while development spending as a percentage o ftotal expenditures
increased from 10.3 percent inFYO1to 21.8 percent inFY04; (ii)                       inadditionto their

DevelopmentProgram(ADP) were considerably streamlined; (iii)                          a debt management
strategy was proposed to GOP to ensure continued earlyretirement o f expensive debt;
and(iv) the annualwheat subsidywas reducedby about two thirds comparedto FYO1,
some Public Enterprises (PE) were closed, andthe pensionfunds were established
outside the budget with annual capitallasset build-upaimingat matching liabilities within
 10years.

4.19     Some progress was achieved inbudget preparation, execution, and oversight: the
budgetnomenclature was streamlined; performancebudgetingwas initiatedas well as
computerization o f landrecords; the provincial anddistrict budgets were linked online;
andthe Budget Analysis Unitwas made fully operational, capable ofmonitoringthe
budgetcycle regularly. Similarly, fiscal devolutionwas pursued: allnon-salary recurrent
expenditures anddevelopment expenditures were transferred to the districts but the
transfer o f salaries is conditionalto the revisioninthe NFC award; districts andtehsils
saw their responsibilities inrevenue collectionandmanagement increased; and some
incentive matching grants were introducedunder the PFC Award to encourage districts to
raise revenue mobilization. The impact o fthese measures on service delivery i s still
unknown andwill depend on continued in-depthprogress inresource management andin
capacity building.

4.20     Despite the progress made inimproving the fiscal situationunder SAC-I, further
progress will be increasingly difficult to achieve inthe mediumto longterm. Indeed,
fiscal sustainability will remainvery fragile after IDA budget support i s completed unless
provincially collected revenues are raised substantially given the uncertainties o f
increased awards andtransfers from GOP. To rise to that challenge, provincially
collected revenues should grow at arate higher thanthat o fPGDP, a conditionhardly
realistic unless institutionalcapacity rapidly increasesat the local levelto capture a
greater share of the revenues generatedby economic activities andunless private sector
growth is vigorously promoted. The whole poverty reductionstrategy o fthe province i s
dependent on its ability to broadenthe tax base andto perfect its tax system. However,
there i s an undeniable risk o f complacency on the part o fthe authorities as long as budget
support is expected.

4.22     Promoting SustainableGrowth. Progresswas minimal. Reformswere not
defined as well as those under the other chapters ofthe program, although the
government was aware ofthe critical role ofthe private sector for growth andpoverty
reduction. Understandably, it was absorbed bythe demands o f devolution andthe fiscal
situation. Besides an improvementinlaw andorder, the mainachievements were: a
substantial reductioninthe number o f inspections o fplants andbusinesses; the leasing o f
most small hydel projects to the private sector; the clarificationo fthe regulatory
framework applicable to mining; andthe reorganization o fthe technical andvocational
training institutes. There was also progress inreformingirrigationwith farmer
organizations established for local water management. Progress hasrecentlypickedup.
In2004, the Government announced aPSDpolicystatementbasedonsoundprinciples.
This was followed upbyAnalytical andAdvisory Activities (AAA) from the Bank(an
EconomicReport was delivered to the Government inJune 2005) to refine a medium-
term growth strategy whose implementationhasrecently~tarted.~'

4.23      The post-October 2002 Govemtnentprovedquite timidinreducingthe role o fthe
public sector inthe economy, resistingdivestiture o fpublic enterprises (PES).An
additionalrestrainingfactor inPSD i s the little flexibility the provinces have in
liberalizingbusiness legislationandpractices as these are largely the domain o fthe
federal government, a factor more exacerbating inthe case o fNWFP, as it lags behind
other provinces inattractingprivate investment.

Outcome

4.24      The rating of Moderately Satisfactory is confirmed. Assessment o f outcomes o f a
policy development program i s to be cautious after a first o f a series o fthree operations,
especially when it i s the first ever such operation at the level o f a sub-national entitywith
no experience o f adjustment operations. Withthis inmind, the province laid the
foundation for continued progress inreform under the program. However, only the first
steps were launched under SAC-I and its follow-on components and a more reliable

      ~~




35Underthe Bank-financedProject for ImprovementinFinancialReportingandAuditing(PIFRA).

36In2002-03, theBankcarriedout a CountryFinancialandAccountabilityAssessment (CFAA) as indicatedin

recommendationsofthe Economic Reportare beenimplemented.

 judgment will be possible after the implementation o fthe secondoperation, approved by
  the BankinJuly 2004. The ratingi s basedon the following. Goodprogress was
  achieved ineducation andhealth, but fhther strides will dependon more effective
  financial mechanisms betweenthe province andthe districts andincreased capacity at the
  local level. But, there were also shortcomings -some important     -in   implementingthe
  program. Governance remains fkagile as the institutionalizationo fmanyaspects o f
  devolution i s far from complete andwill dependnot only on higher capacity at the local
  level, but also on improvedprofessionalism of all civil servants, including at the
  provinciallevel. Progress incivil service reform i s also fkagile and is underminedby
  continued political interference andhighrotation among staff.

  4.25    The fiscal situationinparticularis fragile andwill remaindifficult inthe absence
  o fbudget support fkom the donor community, larger transfers fkom the federal
  government, or muchimprovedprovincialrevenue mobilizationwith all its attendant
  conditions. A key issue, where little progresswas achieved so far, i s the needto
  streamline financial procedures and clarify the respective mandates andresponsibilities of
  provincialanddistrict staff. Another challenge not covered specificallyby this
  assessmentbut now highlyrelevant to improvethe delivery o fpublic services, will be the
  capacity o f LGs, especially the districts, to mobilize andmanagerevenues themselves.
  Finally, implementationwas weakest inthe area o fpromotingprivate sector growth,
  where only limitedprogress was made for lack o fclear and focused direction and
  commitment.

  4.26    Insum, while the provincetook somecourageous steps intacklingobstaclesto
  growth andpoverty reduction, it addressedeachreform area as an individualplatform for
  action, without a coherent andcohesive vision o ftheir indispensable linkages.

  Institutional Development Impact

  4.27    Therating of Modest is conjmzed. The project hadthe benefit to create among
  provincial andlocal authorities a muchneededawareness o f and exposure to the
  complexity o fthe challenges faced inimprovingpeoples' life. Inthat respect, the
  institutional impact i s undeniable. However, from a more mundane point o f view, the
  project had a modest impact: while some new institutions were created or existing ones
  strengthened, it is premature tojudge their effectiveness.

. Sustainability

  4.28    Therating of Non-evaluable is upgraded toLikely. The rating is based onthe
  unlikelihood ofmajor reversals since the government generally supports the content of
  the PRP. Also performanceprovedto bea solidbasis for a second operation. As the first
  inaseries, theprojectlaidthe groundwork for broadeninganddeepeningreforms.
  However, uncertainties andrisks should not beminimized andmay erode the progress
  achieved untilnow. As already noted, the fiscal situationi s likely to remainprecarious,
  unless the presentand future governments demonstrate firm commitment. The
 devolution i s far fkom completed andthere will certainly be administrative andother
 hurdles to overcome. Lnthe future, political alliances or coalitions mayprovemuch less

                                             27


inclinedto reforms. But above all, sustainability will dependonthe commitment of the
governments inplace and on a massive capacity buildingprogram supported bythe donor
community.

Bank Performance

4.29    Therating ofsatisfactoly is confirmed. The Bankshould be commended for
seizing an opportunity andperceivingits potential for benefits despite the risks present at
preparation. Also, it acted speedily by engaging inanintensive dialoguewith the
proponents o freform. Duringsupervision andpreparationo f SAC-11, it demonstrated
consistency inapproach andflexibility inrefiningand adjusting the triggers for a second
operation, while remaining firm onthe key conditions for success, such as the needto
streamline the annual development programo fthe province to safeguard fiscal space for
the social sectors. For the future, more Economic andSector Work (ESW) will be
required, especially on identifyingsources o f growth.

Borrower Performance

4.30    Therating ofsatisfuctoly is confirmed. There was commitment to reforms, even
thoughthe government inplace since late 2002 was not familiar with the agenda andhad
to spendtime and energy inassimilating the program. However, this commitment was
somewhat uneven: the coalitiono fIslamic parties andthe goveniment were very
supportive o fthe humandevelopment reforms as these largely reflected their political
agenda inthis area, butwere reluctant to initiatereforms aimed at promoting growth and
PSD. The lack of commitment inthis areastems from a lack o fknowledgeand strategy
o fhow to go about reducingthe role o fthe public sector. As already noted, the
government lackeda coherent vision o fthe relationships betweenreform areas.

Objectives

4.31    Upontakingoffice inApril 2000, the Government o f Sindh (GOS) launcheda
reformprogramaimed at alleviatingpovertyby improvingpublic service delivery and
stimulatinggrowth. The programwas championed bythe leadership o fthe province and
committed civil servants. With the issuanceo fthe report onprovincial finances, the
dialogue with the Bank intensifiedandhelpedintegrate the reform areas into a medium-
term framework. With the prospect o f elections inOctober 2002, GOS initiated a process
o fbuilding a consensus with civil society, donors, andthe private sector.

4.32    The program, closely aligned with the nationalpovertyreduction strategy, was
based on three pillars, which were supportedby the Credit as key objectives with
corresponding components: (i) restructuring and financial management; (ii)
                                fiscal
improvingpublic service delivery through civil service reform, decentralization, and
reformsinhealth, education, water, andurbanservices to help accelerate human
development and achieve the millenniumgoals; and (iii)   regulatory reforms,
privatization, and infrastructure improvements to stimulate private sector activity and
economic revival. The government emerging fi-om the October 2002 elections was

                                                        28


  formed inDecember on the basis of amulti-party coalition. It endorsed the programand
  theproject inMarch2003.

 Relevance of Objectives

. 4.33     The objectives o fthe Credit were fblly consistent with the nationalI-PRSP,
  GOP's devolutionplan, andthe Bank's CAS o f June 2002. Support for a medium-term
  fiscal restructuringplanwas also consistent with the IMF's PovertyReductionand
  GrowthFacility (PRGF). As inthe case o fthe NWFP, the CAS'S "engagement"
 principleswere present: (i)        the leadership o fthe provincewas at the origino f reforms at
  the provincial level andhadpromotedthe idea with the federal government andother
 provincial governments; inaddition, it had shown exceptional energy and commitment in
  initiating the reform process; (ii)series o f SACSmatchedthe medium-term vision o fthe
                                            a
 program and allowed for flexibility inimplementation; and(iii)           there was strong support
  bythe donor community. The risks -political continuity, implementationcapacity, and
  exogenous factors - were well identifiedby the Bankandwell evaluated. Although high,
 the Bankfelt that, giventhe strongmomentum for reforms, the riskswere worth taking.

 Implementation andAchievement of Objectives

 4.34      Implementationand achievement o f objectives are assessed on the basis o fthe
  actions takenprior to Boardpresentation andprogress made over FY03-04 inachieving
 thebenchmarks andtriggers for a secondoperation. As ofwriting, progresshasbeen
 insufficient to launcha second SAC. Infact, most o fthe progress achieved didtake place
 duringFYOl-02. Immediatelyafter the 2002 elections, there was, as expected, delay due
 to the formation o f a new government and its endorsement o fthe program. However, as
 earlyas the first halfofFY03, increasingly longer delays crept in, reflectingthe
 reluctance - andthe divisions        - at the  political level to cany onwith the reforms, despite
 continued commitment on the part of somemembers o fthe government. Continued
 delays andprotracted discussions over 2003-04 led GOS andthe Bankto undertake a
 programo f analytical work, inthe form o f an economic report,38which i s expected to
 provide the necessarybackgroundto GOS to resume its reform agendaandhelp the Bank
 designa follow-on operation better suitedto the changedpolitical environment.

 4.35     Fiscal Restructuring and Financial Management. Reforms focused on
 restructuring and strengthening the tax system to create fiscal space, improving the
 compositiono f expenditures, fiscal decentralization, andfinancial management.
 Implementationo fthe budget over FYO1-04 was broadly inline with the Medium-Term
 Fiscal Restructuring Plan (MTFRP), althoughsome indicators do not show consistent
 favorable trends (Table 4.3). Goodprogress was achieved inrevenue mobilization,
 where provincially collectedrevenuesprogressed from 1.6 percent o fPGDP3'inFYOOto
 2.2 percent inFY04, mainly due to the simplification andrestructuringinthe tax system
 undertaken duringFY01-02: the number o ftaxes was reduced, the tax basewas widened
 byintroducinganAIT, the base o ftheproperty tax was expanded, andthe number and

rateso f stamp duties were rationalized andconvertedinto advalorem rates. The
performance o ftheproperty tax ando f stamp duties was particularly good, while the AIT
proved to yield lower revenues thanexpected because of difficulties encountered in
assessmentandcollection. However, governance andmanagement problemskept
revenueperformance from reachingtheir potential andbudget targets were never
achieved.

4.36    Progress was also achieved intax administrationwith the creation o f a
coordination committee coveringthe two revenue departments, the Board o fRevenue
(stamp duties, landtax andAIT, andirrigationcharges) andthe ExciseandTaxation
Department (property tax, infrastructurecess, andother taxes) as a first step towards their
integration underthe ministry of finance and, ultimately, the creation o f a single Revenue
Authority.

4.37    The increased fiscal space created by improvement inrevenues permittedto retire
expensive debt to GOP, lowering debt servicing from 1.5 percent o fPGDP inFYOOto
0.9 percent inFY04, a major benefit o fthe reforms. However, its impact on raisingthe
share o f actual expenditures for priority social sectors over the years subsequent to the
approval o fthe project was minimal, as institutional weaknesses keptthe level o fnon-
salary spending (non-salary current expenditures anddevelopment expenditures) behind
budgetestimatesthroughout the period(Table 4.4). The low rate ofutilizationo f h d s
was due to: delays inthe release o ffunds from the provincefor procedural reasons;
capacity constraints at the district leveland lack o f adequately trained staff; and
ambiguityinspendingrules, with, as aresult, cashbalances accumulating indistrict
accounts.

4.38    The first phase o ffiscal decentralization was completed inFY02byunbundling
theprovincial budgetinto district budgets andbytransferringnon-salary funds. Also,
responsibilityfor the KhushalPakistanProgram (KPP -pro poor public works program),
ruralwater supply, androad schemes, was transferred. However, the availability o f funds
to the districts remained limited and subject to rigidities and ambiguities: (i) the
                                                                                 in

absenceo f a revision inthe national award formula, the province had little choice but to
keep the PFC award on an interimbasis,4O(ii)                    the distribution criteria for development
expenditures remainedambiguous since the award does not identify explicitly the
revenue sources; and (iii)         the province remained reluctant to transfer the responsibility for
collecting land-based taxes, such as the AIT andthe propertytax, to the districts, even
though such transfer would providethe latter with an incentive to improve their fiscal
base. Independently o fthe constraints imposedby the federal award formula, muchwork
remains at the provincial levelto achieve a better balance inresource allocationbetween
province anddistricts, to enablethe latter to discharge their responsibilities under the
devolutionplan.

*Starting inFY04, district governments received singleline transfers from the province andmade their own

4.39      Infinancialmanagement,progresswasmadeattheprovinciallevel, againmostly
inFY01-02. GOS adoptedaFinancialManagement ReformProgram, under which
several steps were taken: appointment o f a Provincial Financial Controller, responsible
for improving the financial management system; reconciliation o freceipts and
expenditures inline with the program targets; computerization andintroductiono fthe
NAMunderthePER4projectinseveralprovincialdepartmentsanddistricts,4l
completion o fthe backgroundwork, inline with federal guidelines, for the establishment
of internal audit units inall provincial departmentsand districts; and creation bythe
Provincial Assembly o f a PAC, open to the public andthe press. The provincealso
worked closely with the Bank on the PFAA. Progress infinancial management was
much slower at the district level, becauseo fvacancies inthe posts o fExecutiveDistrict
Officers (EDOs) (Finance), uncertainty about their role andresponsibilities, and lack of
capacity. Inprocurement, considerable work went into preparing a new Procurement

4.40       Public Service Delivery. The reform agendacoveredthe civil service andthe
delivery o f education, health, andurbanservices, as well as ruralwater supply and
sanitation. Inthe area o fcivil service, progress was limited as manyo f the measures
intendedbythepre-October 2002 govemment were partially implementedor delayed.
Some 270,000 civil servants were transferred to LGs,with reporting andaccountability to
elected officials.42 The PSC was givenmore autonomy andmade responsible for all
recruitment above grade 11to foster merit andprofessionalism, butthe Governor retained
the discretionary power to overmle the Commission's decisions. Monitoring o fthe
numberoftransfers, especially at senior levels, was discontinued inpracticeandthe
average tenure period shortened. To strengthen governance and accountabilityinthe
education sector andreduce widespread teacher absenteeism, the School Management
Committees (SMCs            - equivalent    to PTAs) were giventhe power to report teachers'
absenteeismandrecommendtransfers or dismissals as well as to recruit female teachers
andjunior staffon contract. However, their capacity to carry out these responsibilities
remainedhamperedby strong political opposition to such a delegation o fpowers andby
financial constraints, as discussedbelow.

4.41       In education, GOS adopted an EducationSector ReformStrategy, whose
objective i s to ensure that, by 2010,70 percent ofprimary school age children complete
primaryschoolwithbasic skills ofnumeracy andliteracy. The strategy focused on
improvingaccess and quality. Access was muchimprovedbythe delivery o f flee
textbooks inprimaryschool, the reopeningo f a largenumber o f closed schools andthe
refurbishingo fshelter-less ones, andthe expansion ofthe compulsory Universal Primary
Education W E ) program to an increasing number of "talukas" (same as thesils) andcity
districts. The results are as follows. Onthe basis o fthe 2005 PSLMS (see para. 4.14), in
primaryschools, the GERincreased EromSOto 56percentbetweenFY02 andFY05, with
the gender gap declining from 23 to 17percentagepoints, andthe NERincreased from 40
to 48 percent, with the gender gap declining flom 12to 11percentage points.43 The
overall literacy rate (age 10andolder) rose from 46 to 56 percent. However, there was
very slow progress inthe distribution o fscholarships to girls due to the late release of
funds andthe lack o f clarity among district officials on how to use the funds.

4.42      Intermsofshareintotalexpenditures andPGDP,spendingoneducation
remained flat after FY02 (Table 4.4). Inthat connection, the effectiveness o f SMCs,
expected to benot only keyplayers inpromoting and developing community
involvement and empowerment inschool affairs but also important facilitators in
accelerating fundingat the local level, was considerably hampered by the lack o f clarity
on how to implementthe policy governing their role andresponsibilities. As a result,
there was persistent confusion about the mode o ftransfer of funds Eromthe province to

of total expenditures; 43 percentwere inthe lowest grades, 1-5, ofien hnctionally illiterate.

43The UNICEF MultiIndicator Cluster Survey had a GER o f 69 percent for boys and of 58 percent for girls for 2004.

the districts, about their use, and about the rules under which SMCs were to operate. In
addition, SMCs lackedtrainingto understandtheir functions andresponsibilities.

4.43       Inthe healthsector, the pre-October 2002 government adopted a reformprogram,
with well-definedtargets inlinewiththose ofthe 2001NationalHealthPolicy. Reforms
focused on: revivingthe immunizationandtuberculosis programs; improving sector
management andtransparency inprocurement, andreducing absenteeism; enhancing
M&E; andpromotingpublic-privatepartnerships. Accordingto theJune 2005 PSLMS,
the percentage o f children(12-23 months) fully immunizedincreased from 15 to 46
percent betweenFY02 andFY05. Other sources indicate infantmortality dropping from
95 per thousand inFY99 to 71inFY04; the TB DOTScoverage increasing from 8 to 100
percent betweenFY99 andFY05; andthe number o fbirths attendedby a skilledbirth
attendant rising from 18 to 36 percent between FY99 andFY04. As inthe case o f
education, performance was negatively affected by factors such as cumbersome and
ambiguous releaseprocedures, lack o f clarity on how to use the funds, andpoor capacity
infinancial management andprocurement atthe districtlevel. As aresult, therateof
utilization o fbudget allocations remainedbehindallocations (Table 4.4).

4.44       Inwater supply,the samePSLMS indicatesthat access to safedrinkingwater
(from tap) has increased overall from 30to 45 percent betweenFY02 andEy05 (from 4
to 20 percent inrural areas and from 67 to 71percent inurbanareas).@Urbanservices,
includingwater andsanitation, were devolved to the TMAs, with a technical directorate
retainedat the provincial leveland support units at the district level. However, no reliable
indicators show whether performance inservice delivery has actually improved at the
local level. Ingeneral, it was plaguedbythe same rigidities andconstraints already
noted: lack o fclarity inresponsibilities, acute shortage o fplanningandtechnical capacity
at the TMA level, and lack o f financial and fiscal autonomy. However, the situationin
the sector, compared to what i s usuallyreferred to as "social sectors" (education and
health), i s made worse by the fact that the focus o fhigher levels o f government i s on the
latter.

4.45       Private Sector Development and Economic Revival. Reforms aimed at improving
the investmentclimate byrestoringlaw andorder (after the ethnic conflicts o fthe 1990s
inKarachi), modernizingtheregulatoryframework, initiatingprivatization, rehabilitating
infiastructure, roads andirrigation, andpromoting agriculture andrural development.
Overall, progress was very limited. Inthe regulatoryfield, the main achievement was the
reductioninthe number o f factory inspections from 27 to 6, to be carried out intwo days.
But another keyobjective, the consolidationandrationalizationofthevast labor
legislation into 6 laws, was not achieved: only one law was enactedproviding for more
flexibility inhiringandfiring; most o f the other pieces o f legislationrequirereview by
the federal government. Little progress was achieved inprivatization, mainly because the

Privatization Commission, establishedbythe pre-elections government, remained
without chairmanuntillate 2003.

4.46    Intheroadsector, theprioritywasshiftedtoincreasingbudgetallocationsto
maintenance andrehabilitation (M&R) andto the completiono f ongoingprojects.
Allocations for M&R were increased, but the releaseo f funds andtheir effective
utilization laggedbehind. At the district level, priorities inmaintenancewere oftennot
established or respected, partlydue to anabsenceo fmechanism linkingthe provincial
RoadMaintenanceUnitwith the districts. As o f end 2003, the RoadFund, animportant
element o fthe sector strategy ando f the reformprogram, hadyet to be established.
Muchprogress was achieved incompleting ongoing projects inFYOI-02, but less so in
FY03, whenthe rate o futilization o f funds was again higher for new projects than for
ongoing ones. Inirrigation, the programaimed at implementingthe institutional and
policy reforms initiated inthe irrigationand drainage sector under the NationalDrainage
Program, Le., strengthening the autonomy andthe functioning o fthe SindhIrrigationand
Drainage Authority (SIDA), whose mandate i s to achieve an efficient management and a
self-sustaining operation o fthe irrigationanddrainage systems, with an emphasis on
maintenance o fcanals. N o progress was achieved inthis area.

Outcome

4.47    Therating of Satisfactory is downgradedto Moderately Unsatisfactory. Again,
caution i s called for inassessingoutcome onthe basis o f a single operation. The pre-
October 2002 government designed a very ambitious programwhose first stageswere
implemented swiftly and courageously. These undoubtedly produced significant initial
results interms o f openingthe debate on economic and social management inthe
province. Also, initial progress was made infiscal restructuring, humandevelopment,
andcivil service reform. However, reforms inall areas slowedconsiderably after the
2002 elections, for lack o f commitment o fthepoliticalparties inpower anddivergences
inpolicyorientations. Itsoonledto slow implementation, ifnotparalysis insome areas.

4.48    The ratingi s based on the following. The initial fiscal restructuring created fiscal
space by retiringexpensive debt andmobilizing additional provincialrevenues. However,
without a revisioninthe federal award formula andthe insufficiently cohesive and
sustained effort by the provincial authorities inraisingefficiency inresource mobilization
andexpenditures, the fiscalrestructuring didnotproducethe impact originally expected
from the reforms, notably inchanneling moreresources to social services. This was
exacerbatedbythe inability -or lack o f determination    - toaddressthe numerous and
recurrent problems - although well identified arisingfrom inadequate andburdensome
                                               -
financial procedures and lack o f clarity inroles andresponsibilities betweenthe province
andthe lower LGunits. This was amajor shortcoming that negatively affected allreform
areas inhumandevelopment, governance, andpublic services. Although progress was
made in humandevelopment indicators, the performance inthe sectors was constrained
preciselybythis type o f financial shortcomings. The civil service reform showed
hesitations and even some minor reversals, while that aimed at promotingPSDremained
timid, withlittle achieved. Insum, the recordis verymixedifjudgedbycomparison
with the triggers for a secondoperation inthe timeframe envisaged after approval o f

                                              34


SAC-I. Inthose circumstances, GOS andthe Bankrightlydecided to undertake
additional economic work to overhaul the program.

Institutional DevelopmentImpact

4.49    Therating of Modest is maintained. It is basedonthe fact that decentralization o f
functions were carried out according to the devolutionplan, but little or no capacity was
effectively created, whether inmanagement, procurement, or training at the district level
or below. Contraryto the NWFP, the greater awareness among the provincial leadership
o fthe dire economic and social conditions o fthe populationandofthe complexities in
attempting to solve them, was not kept as-amotivating factor for sustaining reforms.

Sustainability

4.50    The rating of Likely is downgradedto Unlikely. There is currently little prospect
o f arrivingat the consensusrequiredto strengthen and deepenthe reforms initially
undertaken to ensuretheir sustainability. Two important issues standout, first the need to
strengthen the fiscal situation and financial management, the key to a sustainable
program, and second, the needto redress the manyprocedural obstacles and institutional
ambiguities plaguingthe administrative set-up following the devolution. This is a huge
task requiring strong political determination. Without the latter, there i s a risk o f
reversals inpolicies, albeit generally resisted so far. Also, up to now, the districts and
lower levelLGshave little or no sense o fdirection.

Bank Performance

4.51 Therating of Satisfactory is maintained. As inthe case ofthe NWFP, the Bank
seized a unique opportunity to support champions o f reforms, acted speedily, and
expended considerable efforts to structure an ambitious program. However, emboldened
bythe commitment ofthe government inplace, itprobablygave insufficientweight to
assessingthe volatile political conditions prior to the elections, although it recognized
political continuity as the major risk. Duringsupervision andpreparation for an eventual
second operation, the Bank showed consistency infocusing on the key parameters o f the
program andwas well advised, inthe face o f insufficient progress, to launcha programo f
economic work.

Borrower Performance

4.52    Therating of Satisfactory is downgraded to Unsatisfactory. Although there was
firmcommitmentbythe former leadership, it considerably weakened after the elections
due to a fragile alliance amongparties advocating conflicting agendas andvying for
influencethroughpatronage. This quickly resultedinslowing decision-making and in
dilution of efforts.

c. LESSONS  FROMTHE PROVINCIAL SACS

4.53  Some lessons apply to Pakistan, others have a broader applicability.

Lessonsfor Pakistan

   0  The limited experience gained bythetwo first SACSreviewedhere suggeststhat
      operations at the sub-national level are a useful complement to those at the
      nationallevel. Interms of contributing to improved delivery o f service and
      poverty reduction, they compare favorably with the SAP.

   0  Unless the mechanisms governing the financial relationshipsbetweenthe federal
      andprovincial governments arerevised, there is little or noprospect for the
      provinces to be able to fulfill their social mandate as providedbythe Constitution
      andthe devolutionplanina sustainable manner.

   0  Capacity at the lower level is generally very weak since power resides at the
      center for historicalreasons. The focus, content, anddesign o f sub-national
      operations should target capacity and institutionalbuildingat that levelin
      conjunctionwith the transfer o f responsibilities from the higher to the lower level.
      The present assessment revealedthe lack o f clarity inroles andresponsibilities
      between the different levels, infinancial procedures, andmodalities o fusing
      funds transferred to the lower levels.

   0  Whendesigning sub-national operations, joint discussions with the central
      government are indispensable to ensurethat the conditions necessaryfor success
      falling under itsjurisdiction are either expected to be fulfilled within the time
      frame o f the operation or are excluded from the reform program.

Lessons of BroadApplicability

   0  Ownership andcommitment, at the political as well as at the administrative level,
      are keys to success. Ifobtained, sub-national operations generatevaluable
      benefits interms o fcreating greater awareness amongprovincialmd local
      authorities o ftheir duties andresponsibilities vis-a-vis their constituencies.

   0  Giventhe weak localcapacity, emphasis shouldbeplacednot only onbuilding
      institutional capacity andtraining, but also on incentives to encourage staff to
      learn and assume greater responsibility.

   0  Sub-national operations should be accompanied bywell designed andwell
      focused TA directed at the issues listed above.


                                                  37                                    Annex A


                            Annex A: DevolutioninPakistan


1.       Uponassuming office in1999, the Mushanafgovernment announcedareform
aimed at "reconstructing the institutionso fthe state" through a system o f democratically
elected local govemments (LG). Accordingly, Local Government Ordinances (LGO)
were issuedby the provincesinAugust 2001. The devolutionhadtwo sets o f objectives.
First, apolitical objective aimed at reformingthe political structures by: (i)    revivingthe
political system historicallyinthe hands o fentrenched interests; (ii)     facilitating accessof
vulnerable citizens to political life; and(iii)   strengthening accountability between
politicians andthe electorate. Second, underpinningthe political objectives, the second
set o f objectives aimed at: (i)  improvingservice delivery, inparticular social services; (ii)
devolving to local governments theresponsibilities to regulate andadminister laws on
land, labor, naturalresources, NGOs, andeconomic activities; and(iii)        delivering access
tojustice.

2.       The devolution was basedon the abolitiono fthe existing three levels o f
deconcentratedprovincial administration (divisions, districts, andtehsils) andthe creation
o f a new tier o f LGs (districts, tehsils, unionadministrations), andthe replacement o fthe
existingmunicipal bodies bythese new LGs. Reforms took place at three levels:
political, administrative, and fiscal.

3.       First, at the political level, the citizenry elects directly a 21-member Union
Council (UC), with the nazim(mayor) andnaib nazim (deputy mayor) elected onthe
same ticket. Nazimenandnaib nazimenare ex-officio members o fthe district councils
andthe tehsil councils, respectively, withthe other members electedbythe U C
councilors. Members o fthe tehsil anddistrict councils are therefore elected indirectly.
At each administrative level, there are three types ofbodies throughwhich citizens are
able to access andinfluence government at the local level: external oversight bodies;
citizendispute resolutionmechanisms; andbodies responsible for community
development andmanagement facilities, the most important o fwhich is the Citizen
Community Board (CCB), formedvoluntarily and composed o f at least 25 members.
CCBs can initiate development projects, establish cooperatives, and support external
oversight bodies, such as MonitoringCommittees. At least 25 percent o fthe
development budget o f eachtier must be earmarked for development projects identified
by CCBs.

4.      Second, at the administrative level, each district has 10to 13 departments
depending on the province, which form the executive branch. Eachdistrict has a District
CoordinationOfficer (DCO), the highest-ranking civil servant, and an ExecutiveDistrict
Officer (EDO) incharge o f eachdepartment. A similar, but smaller, structure exists at
the tehsil level, but no such structure exists at the union level, since there are no
expenditure assignments to the union.

5.      Third, the fiscal reformswere devised so as to avoid amendmentsto the
Constitutionwith respect to the functions exercised respectivelybythe federalandthe
provincial governments. Thus, on the expenditure side, there were no shifts o f

                                              38                                     AnnexA


responsibility from the federal to the lower levels o f govemment, but only from the
provinciallevel. Broadly speaking, responsibilities for elementary and secondary
education, primary and secondary health, agriculture, andintra-district roads were
transferred to the districts, while municipal services, includingroads and streets, water
supplysystems, sewers, andsanitation, were devolved to the tehsils. Although union
administrations (UA) were not assignedservice-delivery responsibilities, they are
responsible for small-scale development projects initially fundedfrom the District
Government allocations under the KhushalPakistan Program (KPP) (pro-poor public
works program).

6.       On the revenue side, the mechanism adopted for the transfer o fresources from the
provinces to LGs mirrors the revenue sharingsystem at the federal-provincial level. By
amendment to its LGO, eachprovincecreated in2002 a Provincial Finance Commission
(PFC) which is to decide, for a medium-tern period, the share o f a "divisible pool" to be
transferred to districts according to a formula based onpopulation and an index o f
"backwardness", the provincekeepingresources for expenditures for which it i s
responsible, including debt liabilities. Since their creation, PFCs have not made any
awards covering a medium-tern periodandinterimawards are extended every year.
Presently, the local share o fthe divisible pool i s as follows: Punjab: 39.8 percent; Sindh:
40 percent; NWFP: 40 percent; andBalochistan: 31percent. The provinces have used
different routes to fimdthe tehsils andUAs, but these have been largely financed out of
the General Sale Tax (GST) revenues andby own-source revenues. The implementation
o fthe fiscal reforms i s far fkom complete and, as a result, the responsibility for andthe
actual delivery o fpublic services are still very muchblurred.

7.      Upto now, the implementationofthe devolutionhasbeenvery uneven among
provinces, due to: unclear processes, procedures, andmandates, lack o f capacity at the
local levels, insufficient financial resources, delocalization o fpersonnel, and, last but not
least, considerable resistance onthe part o f the provinces andtheir staff.

  Dear Kyle,

  Thanks for sharingwith usthe draft Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR)
  covering the three subject operations. As mentionedinthe report our cofinancing support was
  limitedto the NWFP Community Infrastructure andNational HousingAuthority
  StrengtheningCredit (CIP) (Credit 2829-PK).

  We generally concur with the assessment.

  Itrightlypoints out the inherentinstitutional weaknessesembeddedina highlycentralised
  provincial system that resultedinimplementationconstraints.

  We also agree withthe findingthat the project didnot succeedininstitutionalising
  community development processes withinthe provincial andlocaladministrations
  eventhough SDC extended its maximumpossible flexibility inthis respect.

  Furthermorethe project was unable to capitalise from the unprecedented opportunity and
  space offered bythe LocalGovernment Framework         .Insteado fproviding stimulus and
  meaningful support to the decentralisation efforts it preferredto continue the follow its
~

  regular implementation approach that onthe contrary was meant for cintinuum o f
  institutional vacuum at the locallevel.

  Eventhough the lessons drawn are appropriate, we however, feel that the main lessons
  derived from the experience o f the CIP couldhave been more specific andrelevant to the
  current institutional landscape andthe key stakeholders involved inits implementation
  including the Bank. Especially inthe context o f Bank's involvement support o fthe overall
  reformprocess.

  Last butnot the least, arethere any lessons leamt fromprojects' interventions, ifany, inthe
  face of a number ofnatural clamaties that have especially hitNWFP inthe recent years
  including the devastating earthquake o f last October?

  Kindregards.

Performance Assessment Report onthe NwFlp Community Infrastructure andNational
Housing Authority Community Strengthening Credit (CIP) (Credit 2829-PAK). We will be

Withrespectto the specificity ofthe lessons, we hopethat the lessonsfromthis audit, taken
inconjunctionwithadditional lessonsfromaparallelreviewofthe overall country lending
program (Pakistan: Country Assistance Evaluation) will be o f use to the Bank andother
stakeholders indesigningfollow-up work. We havehad discussions withthe Bankregional
team on these lessons, andmanagementi s broadly inagreement. Inaddition, IEGis
undertakingareview ofthe Bank's assistancefor natural disasterrecovery. We have
conveyedthe preliminary findingsandlessonsofthis review to the Bankstaffworkingwith
the country authorities to help design projects to reflect the current needsarisingfromthe
recent earthquake. We would bepleasedto sendyou copies o f thosereports when they are
finalized. We also behappy to meet with any SDC staffto discuss specific lessonsor issues
that may be o fuse infuture projects o f a similar nature.

Once again, thankyou for your comments, and for SDC's support o fthe Bank'sprogramin
