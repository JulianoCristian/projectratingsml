supports the economic reform program of the\n            Province, and builds on three pillars: 1) fiscal\n            restructuring and financial management; 2) improving public\n            service delivery, through civil service reforms,\n            decentralization, and reforms in health, education, safe\n            water supply, and urban services; and, 3) regulatory\n            reforms, privatization, and infrastructure improvements. The\n            project is consistent with the macroeconomic program, and\n            the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of\n            Pakistan. Despite project benefits, this operation faces\n            three types of risks: continuity risks, implementation\n            capacity risks, and risks from external shocks. The\n            Government has attempted to mitigate risks, through building\n            consensus around the reform program, and, partnerships and\n            reforms have been institutionalized in a number of bodies,\n            both at the provincial, and local levels."}, "docdt": "2002-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
