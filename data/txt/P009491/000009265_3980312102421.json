in Bangladesh. The project\n            comprised of: (a) improvement of 500 km of feeder roads type\n            'B' (FRB) to bitumen surfaced standards and road\n            side tree plantation; (b) construction of improved public\n            facilities \u0096 internal roads, paved areas, raised and covered\n            selling areas, drainage, potable water supply and latrines -\n            at 65 growth center markets (GCMs); (c) construction of\n            4,000 meters of structures on rural roads (SRR); (d)\n            maintenance of the improved roads; (e) institutional\n            development activities of LGED including construction of a\n            new LGED headquarters building, district offices and\n            laboratories, training, contractor development; and (f)\n            socio-economic monitoring and evaluation of the completed\n            projects.  The key lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: a) Start bidding process for civil works before\n            project starts, and appoint design and supervision\n            consultants prior to Credit approval so as to avoid delays;\n            b) more local community participation in priority setting,\n            design and implementation of the project; c) need to place\n            greater emphasis on the rural road structures; d) New\n            emphasis on developing river jetties to better integrate\n            inland water transport and road transport; e) need to\n            continue with training and equipment support to small\n            contractors, but at the same time pushing to increase\n            contract sizes to enhance contractor output and efficiency;\n            f) early action on land acquisition with suitable\n            compensation procedures; g) greater emphasis on field-level\n            training and implementation of maintenance programs; h) need\n            to overhaul rural market management and leasing systems with\n            greater user participation to improve efficiency and\n            increase revenue; and i) need to strengthen the financial\n            status of local bodies (Union Parishads) in ensuring\n            sustainability of infrastructure maintenance."}, "docdt": "1998-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
