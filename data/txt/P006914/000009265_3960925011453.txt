PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA - AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1410-CR)
PREFACE
This is the completion report on the Agricultural Credit and Devel-
opment Project in Costa Rica (Loan 1410-CR), for which a loan of US$18.0 mil-
lion was approved in April 1977. The Closing Date for the Loan was December
31, 1984.   Final disbursement took place on March 26, 1985, and an unused
balance of US$144,063.95 was cancelled.
The project is the third agricultural project financed by the Bank
in Costa Rica.   While the two preceding projects focused on large-scale
farms, the emphasis of this third proJect was on medium and small farms.
This report was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of statistical data
prepared by the Central Bank of Costa Rica (CB); and information on the proj-
ect which is available in the Bank, including:   the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 1399a-CR) dated April 1, 19.7; the Loan Agreement and Project Agre^ment
dated June 2, 1977; supervision reports; and correspondence with the Borrower
and internal Bank memoranda as contained in relevant Bank files.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments on
October 17, 1985. Comments received from the Borrower are attached as Annex
2.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA - AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1410-CR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project is the third agricultural project financed by the Bank
in Costa Rica.   The two previous projects were:   the First Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 538-CR) financ-ed by a 1968 Loan of US$3.0 million -and
which was completed in April 1973; and the Second Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 827-CR) financed by a 1972 Loan of US$9.0 million and ~--'ich was com-
pleted in September 1980.
Objectives
The objectives of the project were to increase agricultural output,
particularly beef and milk; raise income ±evels, particularly those of small-
and medium-size farms; and strengthen the extension service of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) as well as its seed production capa-
bility. The project included credit for development o:5 livestock, crops and
agroindustries; support for strengthening the national extension service;
support for implementation of a seed improvement program; funds for a pilot
scheme for the rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads; and assistance
in preparation of a rural development project.
Implementation Experience
Project start up was delayed due to late ratification of legal
documents. Implementation was about 18 months slower than expected, largely
because of inadequate loan promotion by the Central Bank, a sharp reduction
in subloan demand in the latter project years, procurement delays, and late
completion of the rural development study. Project costs amounted to US$35.6
million, or about 6% less than estimated at appraisal.
Results
About 1,520 subloans were financed, compared with 3,260 estimated
at appraisal, although the volume of credit disbursed almost equalled origi-
nal expectations. Nearly 70% of the subloans were for livestock development,
28% for crop development, and 2Z for agroindustries.  As stipulated in thte
Loan Agreement, small farmers accounted for more than 25% of the subloans.
Additional extension staff were hired and trained, but eventually most of the



- iv -
staff -ransferred to other positions because of better employment conditions
elsewhere.   The project's seed program component was restructured during
implementation, and a substantial contribution was made to improving the seed
production capability of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.   The
feeder road component was successfully implemented, but only after the Bank's
disbursement percentage was increased from 30% to 70%. The rural development
study financed under the project was completed with much delay as a result
mainly of changes In the Government's priorities.
Monitoring and evaluation under the project was unsatisfactory.
Consequently, available information on the agricultural and socio-economic
impact of the project is poor.   However, indications are that, with minor
exceptions, crop and livestock production supported by project funds was
satisfactory; the project viability is presumed to be close to appraisal
expectations.
Sustainability
The general prospects for sustainability of production and benefits
are good.  There is now established business relationship between the bene-
ficiaries of the credit program and the intermediary credit institutions, and
this relationship is expected to continue after the project. Project efforts
to strengthen the agricultural extension service have failed as newly
acquired staff had left the setvice by the time of project completion.
Findings and Lessons
Procurement encountered problems (para. 3.20), and monitoring,
evaluation and reporting were unsatisfactory. No funds for project adminis-
tration, including monitoring and evaluation were provided, contributing to
poor performance of M&E functions.  The project included several components
scattered throughout the country.  This has contributed to the difficulty in
monitoring and evaluation.   A more focused and simpler project would have
been easier to monitor, and perhaps could have been more effective in its
development impact,  The Bank should be more assertive in ensuring compliance
with Loan conditions, and in promoting efficient implementation; it has been
too accommodating concerning the project's organization, implementation of
the extension component, and submission of audit reports (paras. 3.21,
3.25-3.26 and 7.02).
Institutional performance was mixed. The Central Bank (CB) has not
proven to be an appropriate intermediary for implementing the credit compon-
ent.  Its role under this project did not fit the general mandate of the CB,
and funds allocated for administering the project were grossly inadequate.
In projects which include several components and implementing agencies, a
central agency such as the Ministry of Planning may need to take the overall
coordinating function.  In such cases, however, the responsibilities of the
several agencies must be defined clearly, and extreme care should be taken in
the selection and appointment of at least the managerial staff (paras. 4.01
and 7.01).



v
The extension component was too small to have had a significant
impact on the overall improvement of the Extension Service of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock. To improve the overall Service, the Government
subsequently chose a national project on technology transfer instead of
through a piecemeal approach as under this project, an approach which is
likely to prove more effective (para. 3.09).



COSTA RiCA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01.     At the time when the project was appraised in September 1976, Costa
Rica's GNP per capita was about US$900, and the GNP was growing at an annual
rate of 6% while agricultural production was growlag at around 4.1%. The
agricultural sector accounted for about 20% of GDP and 75% of merchandize
exports, and employed about 35% of the labor force. Coffee, bananas, sugar,
and beef cattle were the principal sources of foreign exchange, and food
imports (principally wheat) account:d for nearly 10% of total imports. The
total population was estimated at about 2.0 million, and the rural population
numbered 1.1 million. About 25% of the rural population was below the
relative poverty income level then estimated at about US$255 equivalent. The
Government's multi-pronged agricultural development strategy was to redress
rural poverty by financing projects which benefited the rural poor, expand
agricultural production and productivity through increased availability of
credit, and improved research and extension services; and diversify
agricultural production by encouraging increased production of livestock
products and basic grains. The project was designed to support this
strategy.
1.02      Over the past 9 years, no dramatic changes have occurred in the
structure of the economy: agriculture still accounts for the same percentage
of GDP; the sector's share of total exports and labor force has declined
slightly to about 70% and 30%, respectively; coffee, bananas, beef and sugar
continue to be the major sources of agricultural exports; and food imports
still account for nearly 10% of total imports. The population is about 2.4
million, and the most recent estimate of the GNP per capita amounts to
US$1,280 (estimate for 1980-82 computed in then prevailing prices).
The country is now going through severe economic difficulties. As in the
rest of the economy the rate of growth of agricultural production has
declined in recent years, although the sector h.3 performed better than the
economy as a whole. The Government is now giving high priority to projects
which would increase and diversify agricultural exports.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The project was identified in early 1973 jointly by the Government
and the Bank and was prepared by the Government. It was appraised by the
Bank twice: the first time in April 1974 and the second in September 1976.



-2
After the first appraisal, the processing of the project was delayed by two
years because of protracted negotiations between the Government and the Bank
regarding subsidized on-lending interest rates. As a result of this delay,
and because of changes in the project scope in the intervening years, the
Bank reappraised the project in 1976.
B. Negotiations and Board Approval
2.02      Negotiations with representatives of the Government took place in
Washington in March 1977.   The Loan was approved by the Board, without
discussion, on April 26, 1977.
C. Project Objectives and Components
2.03      Objectives.  The objectives of the project were to:  increase
agricultural output, particularly beet and milk; raise income levels,
particularly those of small- and medium-size farms; and strengthen the
extension service of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) as well
as its seed production capability.
2.04      Components.  The project included:  credit for development of
livestock, crops and agroindustries (accounting for 81% of the total project
cost); support for strengthening the national extension service (5%); support
for implementation of a seed improvement program (7%); funds for a pilot
scheme for the rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads (6%); and
assistance in preparation of a rural development project (1%).
D. Project Cost and Financing
2.05      Total project cost was estimated at US$37.6 million, of which the
Bank contributed US$18.0 million (48%) to cover 100% of the estimated foreign
exchange component. Financial intermediaries or participating banks (PBs)
contributed US$3.3 million (9%); the CB and other Government agencies US$11.2
million (29%); and farmers the remaining US$5.1 million (14%).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Introduction.  This chapter compares actual performance with the
targets established at appraisal, including comparative analysis of
implementation of the different components (credit, technical assistance,
seed improvement, roads and the regional development study), assessment of
project cost, disbursements, procurement, reporting and auditing, and
compliance with loan covenants. The implementation schedule is presented
first.



-3-
A. Implementation S zedule
3.02      Effectiveness.  The Loan became effective on January 23, 1978, nine
months after it was approved by the Boare'. The country was in the middle of
national campaign for   .itions in 1977 which made it difficult to obtain
carlv ratification of tbh  legal documents by the National Assembly.  This
contributed to a delay in initiating the project's implementation.
3.03      Implementation Period.  According to appraisal projections, the
project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1983 and the Closing Date to
be December 1983. CompLution was delayed by about one and a half years due
to: (a) inadequate loan promotion by the CB which contributed to a delay in
initiating the project, (b) sharp reduction in demand for subloans in the
latter y:ars of the project which required three years to disburse the last
5% of the amount of the loan allocated to this category, (c) delay by MAG in
procuring equipment caused by cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, and (d)
delay in completing the rural development study.
B.  Implementation of Project Components
3.04      Credit.  The total number of subloans financed amounted to about
1,520 compared to an appraisal expectation of 3,2601/. About 70% of the
subloans were for livestock development, 28% for crop development, and the
remaining 2% for agroindustries. The average aEount of subloan per
beneficiary was much higher than the appraisal expectation so that the total
cost of subloans financed was virtually the same as the appraisal estimate.
The demand for subloans was greatest during the initial three years of the
project; about 95% of the loan allocated to the credit component was
disbursed by the end of 1981. Thereafter, the demand for credit declined
mainly due to an increase in the rate of interest charged on the subloans
(from 8% to 12% for small farmers and from 12% to 16% for other farmers),2/
and due to reduced enthusiasm by the credit intermediaries for promoting new
subloans since the undisbursed portion of the loan was small. Because of the
above factors and a sharp devaluation of the local currency, it took another
three years to complete disbursement of the last 5% of the loan amount
allocated to the credit category.
3.05      Livestock accounted for about 1,060 of the subloans.  About 645 of
these were for beef cattle breeding which represented over six times the
appraisal estimate; the large increase in the demand for such subloans was
due to sharp increases in beef prices during 1978-80. There were 330
subloans for dairy development, which represented about 80% of the appraisal
estimate.   Of the remaining subloans for livestock, 45 were for pig
/  About 2,300 of the sub-loans projected at appraisal were for
miscellaneous "complementary investments", but no such investments were
financed. If such categories of sub-loans are excluded from the
appraisal's projection, then the actual number of sub-loans financed
under the project exceed the appraisal's projection of sub-loans for the
non "complementary investments".
2/   The on-lending interest rates were in line with rates charged throughout
the agriculture sector. They were positive in real terms until about
1980 when they turned negative due to an accelerated domestic rate of
inflation.

development and about 20 were for poultry development, both of which were not
foreseen at appraisal. The rest were for dual-purpose livestock development
(dairy and beef).
3.06      About 480 of the subloans were for crop development representing
about 30% of the appraisal estimate. The farms developed were mainly used
for growing citrus, coffee, and cocoa. The citrus and coffee farms were
successful in increasing pr3duction, but the cocoa farms have not been as
successful due mainly to problems with Moniliasis disease. The medium- and
large-scale growers of cocoa have succeeded in dealing with this disease by
applying improved cultural practices in soil drainage, cleaning, pruning,
weeding, fertilizing and using appropriat4 shade trees; they also used
private extension services financed through their own resources to help them
combat the disease. The results on cocoa farms owned by small farmers are
disappointing since these farmers did not receive sufficient technical
support .rom the extension service. One-third of the small farmers abandoned
their plantations after some investments had been made, the other two-thirds
completed the infrastructure investments; even here, the results were mixed.
A few subloans were also made for other crops such as bananas, plantains,
macadamias, sugarcane, cotton, rice, cassava and basic grains. No data are
available on the performance of these sub-projects.
3.07      About 25 subloans were granted for agroindustries and services
compared to an appraisal estimate of about ten. A major subloan was made to
Central Agricola de Cartago, a private enterprise, for the construction of 13
silos and warehouses for seed storage of about 5,500 m ton and purchase of
drying equipment. This sub-project was expected to be implemented by the
National Production Council (CNP), but the CNP shifted the responsibility for
building commercial seed storage facilities to private enterprise, as a
result the Government proposed and the Bank accepted in December 1978 to
reallocate to the agricultural credit component about US$0.9 million of funds
allocated to CNP for this activity. Implementation of the sub-project was
satisfactory.
3.08      As required by the Loan Agreement, small farmers accounted for more
than 25% of the subloans (nearly 80% of the number of subloans and more than
35% of the subloan amounts). The key indicators of the credit component are
summarized in Annex 1.
3.09      Extension Service.  Under the project, MAG was to hire an
additional 65 extensionists to provide technical assistance to farmers who
were expected to benefit under the project.  The project provided vehicles,
equipment, and training to these extensionists.  The extensionists were hired
and were given on-the-job training for about two years in the application of
the T&V system using internationally recruited consultants; about 30 of them
were trained in Israel for one month each. However, the performance of MAG
in sustaining the system and in providing technical assistance to the farmers
has not been satisfactory. This was mainly due to budgetary problems caused
by the general economic crisis in the country. Thero was no coordination
between MAG and the PBs, there was no link between research and extension,
budgetary allocation to the service was grossly inadequate, and virtually all
of the extensionists hired and trained left the Ministry for other more
remunerative jobs.



3.10      Seed Program.  The project included funds to finance construction
of physical infrastructure and the purchase and installation of related
equipment for the implementation of a National Certified Seed Program. The
works involved construction of two foundation seed storage rooms and
associated field equipment to be owned and operated by MAG, and 26 warehouses
for storage and distribution of certified or improved seed to be owned and
operated by CNP.
3.11      The CNP withdrew from the project in 1978 because of:  (a) a change
in Government policy to permit the private sector to take the responsibility
for seed storage; (b) it had previously experienced administrative and
financial difficulties in dealing with seeds; and (c) it lacked counterpart
funds. This part was, therefore, financed under the agroindustries component
of the credit program (para. 3.07).
3.12      Construction of the two foundation seed storage rooms was financed
entirely by thte Venezuelan Investment Fund. Bank funds were used only for
procuring the associated equipment. There was a three-year delay in the
procurement of the seed production equipment caused mainly by lengthy
bureaucratic procedures, lack of coordination within the pertinent agencies
in finalizing tender documents, and difficulties in obtaining import
permits. In the end, most of the equipment was procured, but a small amount
of funds left in the loan originally allocated for this purpose was
reallocated to the road component.
3.13      As a condition of disbursement, the Bank had insisted on the
Government preparing a timetable for developing a national seed program,
including production of foundation seeds and training of experts. The
Government prepared the program which was approved by the Bank. As part of
that program, two agronomists were trained in Iowa State University using
project funds; more could not be trained due to a shortage of qualified
candidates. MAG also created a Seed Department in April 1984, and staffed
it with five agronomists and two field assistants. Although the project
helped in improving the seed production capability of MAG, much remains to be
done to achieve self-sufficiency in seed production for at least the major
crops; the country is now self-sufficient in only rice seeds.
3.14      Feeder Roads.  The project included a pilot scheme for selection,
construction, and maintenance of third-class feeder roads by financing
equipment, civil works, and six man-months of an internationally recruited
engineering consultant service. About 110 km of roads were planned to be
improved.
3.15      Implementation of the road component started slowly  due to lack of
sufficient counterpart funds, but the Bank agreed in early 1981 to increase
the disbursement percentage from 30% to 70% to alleviate the counterpart
funding problem and to offset the impact of the devaluation; this improved
substantially the implementation performance. At the end of 1983, all funds
originally allocated for this component were fully utilized requiring
reallocation from other categories to complete the targets established at
appraisal and also to finance unforeseen expenditures in rehabilitation of
some project roads that were partially destroyed by an earthquake and to
rehabilitate the road equipment acquired with project funds for road
maintenance since the equipment was in disrepair. In the end, all physical
targets wer( fulcilled. The successful implementation of this component was
due to good coordination between the Municipality of Perez Zeledon (the area



- 6 -
selected for the pilot scheme), the implementing agency (the Institute for
Promotion and Assistance to Municipalities, or IFAM), the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport (MOPT), and active participation and commitment of the
beneficiary (the municipality of Perez Zeledon) in the component (including
financial contribution).
3.16      Rural Developmcnt Study.  The project financed preparation of a
rural development project. The Ministry of Planning, with assistance from
internationally recruited consultants, was expected to undertake the study.
In 1978, the Ministry prepared an Integrated Development Plan for the
Atlantic Region as part of a technical assistance agreement with the
Organization of American States, on the basis of which the Atlantic Region
was selected for a project which might be suitable for financing by the
Bank. However, no progress was made in undertaking the study until the end
of 1980 when the Ministry passed the responsibility to the Agrarian
Development Institute (IDA). The preparation of the study was further
delayed until 1983 because of the Government's indecision on priority
development options, lack of initiative by IDA in proposing the design and
scope of the project, and poor coordination and lack of clear-cut definition
of responsibilities between IDA and the Ministry of Planning. With
assistance from various FAO/CP missions, the area and main components of the
project were finally defined and preparation was initiated in late 1983 with
assistance from the Regional Unit for Technical Assistance (RUTA). The
report on the feasibility study was submitted to the Bank in December 1984,
the quality of the report is good.
C. Cost Estimate
3.17      The total cost of the project at completion is computed at about
US$35.6 million equivalent compared to an appraisal estimate of US$37.6
million, and the proportion of actual expenditures on the different
components were virtually the same as appraisal estimates. Except for the
extension component where the actual cost is higher by about 10%, the actual
costs of the other components are lower than appraisal estimates as shown
below:

3.19      Up to the end of FY79, only US$2.5 million of the Loan (14%) was
disbursed. At the end of FY82, US$16.2 million (90%) was disbursed, and it
took another three years to disburse the remaining 10% of the Loan (assuming
US$180,000 which remains undisbursed will be disbursed by June 30, 1985).
The slow pace of disbursement in the latter years was caused by: a sharp
decline in the demand for subloans, inadequate project promotion by the CB
and PBs, and devaluation of the domestic currency.



- 8 -
E. Procurement
3.20      Procurement of equipment for seed production and roads took more
time than anticipated. In some cases, bidding documents for International
Competitive Bidding prepared by the Borrower did not clearly specify the
criteria for bid evaluation, and, in others, award and signing of contracts
took too much time. Bureaucratic procedures for processing tender documents
exasperated the proiblem. Goods financed under the subloans were procured
directly by the beneficiaries and no serious problems were encountered.
F. Reporting
3.21      The CB was responsible for monitoring and evaluating (M&E) the
credit component, while the Ministry of Planning was responsible for M&E of
the non-credit components. Except for reporting data on the number and
amount of subloans, the CB did not keep a systematic record of the impact of
the credit component, and did not prepare a completion report as required by
the Project Agreement. The Ministry of Planning, in cooperation with IFAM,
kept good records on the road component and submitted the same to the Bank
in a timely manner. The reporting by the Ministry on the other components
(seeds and extension) was neither satisfactory in quality nor in timeliness.
G. Auditing
3.22      Auditing was divided between two auditors:  the Auditoria General
de Bancos (CB's general auditor of banks) audited the credit component, while
a private firm (Venegas, Alvarez and Co.) audited the remaining components
(seeds, extension, roads and the Ministry of Planning).
3.23      The audit of the Auditoria General de Bancos contained some good
features such as field review of the subloans made up to the end of each
year. The information submitted included statements of disursement from the
loan by category; reconciliation of balances of the credit component as
shown by the PBs as compared with CB balances; statements of payments made
and received by the CB for the accounts of the PBs; and analysis of subloan
arrears. The information did not include balance sheets, income statements,
and sources and application of funds for the PBs. The Bank sent letters to
the Auditoria General de Bancos advising them on the minimum requirements for
auditing of Bank projects and also supervision missions discussed this issue
with them, but the efforts did not change the quality of reporting. Also,
the reports were submitted to the Bank with considerable delays of at least
four months.
3.24      Concerning the auditing of the non-credit components, the
above-mentioned private firm included in its statements comments of
investments financed under the project, sources and application of funds, and
statement of loan disbursements. Notes and comments on the execution of the
project were also given. The firm was retained to audit project accounts
until 1982, but after that the Government, with the agreement of the Bank,



readvertised to retain new auditors due to a perceived high cost of retaining
Venegas, Alvarez and Co. When the final selection was made in 1984, the same
firm won the bidding. The audit reports for the non-credit components for
1983 and 1984 have now been received by the Bank.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.25      CB did not fully comply with the condition of Section 2.04(c) of
the Project Agreement, which states: "Banco Central shall, through its
Development Credit Department (DCD) establish, no later than March 1, 1978,
and maintain thereafter, a monitoring system to collect and analyze
statistical data related to the carrying out of Part A of the project, and to
aid in the preparation of completion and evaluation reports concerning Part A
of the Project." The department was never effective in monitoring and
evaluating the credit component. It was not fully committed to the project,
did not have the full backing of the management of CB, and was disbanded in
1984. There were no people to collect, collate, and evaluate data on the
performance of the credit component, which was the major part of the project.
3.26      Another condition not fully complied with was Section 4.02(ii) of
the Loan Agreement concerning submission to the Bank of audit reports. The
Bank has not yet received complete audit reports on the project for 1983 and
1984.  Also, the Government did not provide sufficient Nunds to maintain the
extension component (Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement) which contributed to
an unsatisfactory performance of that component.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      The performance of CB in implementing the credit component has not
been satisfactory. That bank did not keep proper records of the subloans
financed under the project, and hence was not able to monitor and evaluate
the impact of sub-projects. It also failed to prepare a completion report
although this was a requirement under a Project Agreement between CB and the
Bank. Also, coordination was poor between the extension service, MAG and the
PBs. As a result, the extension service had very little or no influence in
processing of sub-projects, although is was expected to participate in
processing sub-projects.   Of all the agencies, IFAM was the most efficient
and committed agency and as a result the road component was the best
implemented part of the project. Although the Ministry of Planning was not
directly involved in implementing the different components (except the
regional study), the Ministry did not do well in its primary responsibility
of coordinating the implementing of the non-credit implementing agencies.
This was primarily due to frequent changes in the leadership of the Project
Coordinating Unit (there were six managers during the seven years of project
implementation), the inexperience of some of the people appointed to head the
Unit, and inadequate budgetary support.



- 10 -
4.02      There were four participating banks, of which the Banco Nacional de
Costa Rica (BNCR) was the most active accounting for nearly 80% of the number
of subloans and 75% of the subloan amount. The others were Banco de Costa
Rica (BCR) accounting for about 15% of the number of subloans and 20% of the
subloan amount; and Banco Anglo Costarricense (BACR) and Banco de Credito
Agricola de Cartago (BCAC), jointly accounting for the remaining volume and
amount of subloans. In general, the participating banks have done fairly
well in identifying and processing subloans, but their supervision efforts
have not been as satisfactory. The low level of the supervision effort is
partly the cause of arrears which have tended to increase over time, rising
from about 20% in 1980 to nearly 40% in 1982. The arrears are worse for the
large farmers compared to the medium and small farmers reflecting the
political leverage the large farmers have in delaying or not paying their
loans.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
5.01      The role played by the Bank throughout the execution of the project
was fair. Relations among Bank, CB and the Ministry of Planning personnel
were cordial at all times, and the Bank acted supportively and flexibly in
responding to the Government's request for reallocation of the proceeds of
the loan, extending the Closing Date for the loan to allow completion of the
project, helping to initiate the regional development study, and organizing a
seminar in M&E. The appraisal was a bit optimistic about the speed of
organizing the coordinating agencies and their efficiencies in administering
the project. The Bank could have taken a more forceful position early on to
ensure proper monitoring of the project and satisfactory performance of the
extension service, smoother coordination among the various implementing
agencies, and proper compliance with the conditions of the Loan.
VI. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
6.01      Introduction.  It is difficult to assess fairly the agricultural
impact of the project because of the lack of data (the appraisal report is
based on expected benefits from beef, dairy, and crops, but did not include
expected benefits from agroindustries and seeds). In the absence of data,
the assessment here of the project's agricultural impact is based on: (a)
results of a 1983 survey undertaken in connection with preparation of another
project focusing on beef and milk production. That survey's findings
concerning the parameters of beef and dairy production in the base year
(1983) are considered as proxy indicators of possible performance for the
beef and dairy farms financed under the project; and (b) information
corntained in various Bank documents concerning production of other farms
financed under the project (poultry, pig, permanent crops, and annual
crops). While the above pieces of information may serve as general indicators
of the likely impact of the project, they may not provide conclusive evidence
of the project's impact. There is also no data base to compare the income of
the beneficiaries before and after the project, and to evaluate the ex-post
rate of return on investments.

According to appraisal projections, the above-shown production coefficients
were expected to be attained by year 6 for dairy and by year 10 for beef
breeding following initiation of the project. The results of the 1983 survey
show that the coefficients for nearly all categories of productivity
indicators have already reached or exceeded appraisal expectations.
6.03      Pig and Poultry.  These operations were not foreseen at appraisal.
Nevertheless, the project financed a few subloans which, according to the
technicians of the PBs, were successful. The farms are reportedly applying
modern techniques of production, and they are considered to be profitable.
Some of the farmers are expanding their operations using their own funds, and
their loan repayment record is good. In the case of poultry, the country has
attained self-sufficiency in the production of eggs and the project is
acknowledged to have helped in this.
6.04      Perennial Crops.  The main perennial crops financed were citrus,
coffee and cacao. Citrus plantations five years old are reported to be
yielding about 4 tons per ha compared with appraisal estimate of 3 tons per
ha. Financing of coffee and cacao was not anticipated at appraisal but about
200 na and 500 ha, respectively, of new plantings or rehabilitations were
financed. New coffee plantations five years old are reportedly yielding
about 10 tons per ha compared with the national average of about 9 tons per
ha. The cacao development was mainly carried out in the Atlantic Zone and
the performance was mixed. Plantations that are following appropriate
cultural practices in combating the Moniliasis disease are doing well. Cacao
plantations owned by small farmers and which suffered from the Moniliasis
disease because of poor cultural practices have been abandoned but these can
be rehabilitated with further investment. There are indications that some
farmers who have rehabilitated their fields are showing encouraging results.
6.05      Other Crops.  The other miscellaneous crops financed with a total
of about 40 subloans were rice, cotton, cassava, basic grains, and
sugarcane. On average small farmers have 3 ha of sugarcane and medium-size
farmers have 25 ha. Cane yields reportedly average 70 tons per ha, 14% above
the appraisal projections of yields at full development.
6.06      Financial and Economic Rates of Return.  There is no satisfactory
data base to compute the ex-post financial and economic rates of return on
investments; these are assumed to be the same as appraisal estimates The
financial returns to the beneficiaries are presumed to have been satisfactory
reflected by the demand for credit. The economic rate of return is presumed
to have been satisfactory because (a) the total cost of the project is
virtually the same as appraisal projection, and the average cost of
subprojects, computed in constant 1976 prices, is lower than appraisal
estimate. This should improve the economic rate of return (ERR) compared to
appraisal estimate, assuming all other things remain unchanged; and (b) there
are preliminary indications that, as expected at appraisal, the project might
have improved significantly the productivity and production of subprojects of
particularly livestock. Sensitivity tests made at appraisal showed that even
if the benefits were to be reduced by 10%, the ERR would be about 13%.

VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Summary.  A key objective of the project was to support the poorest
segment of the farm population. This objective has been attained since, as
agreed at negotiations, more than 25% of the subloans were made to
smallholders considered to be among the poorest. Although conclusive data
are not available, the project is perceived as having contributed
significantly to the improvement of production, particularly of livestock.
The physical road improvement targets established at appraisal, as well as
the training of extensionists have been met. Despite the substantial effort
in training extensionists, however, all the trained staff left the Service
and there is no clearly identifiable improvement in the extension service of
MAG which can be attributed to the project. Despite about two years of delay
in completing the project, the actual cost of the project (computed in US
dollar equivalent) is less than the appraisal estimate; the lower than
anticipated number of subloans (including the projected subloans for
complementary investments) contributed to this. The performance of the
implementing agencies has been mixed. The CB did not do well in
administering the credit component, partly because the project did not fit
well into the overall functions of the Central Bank. The Ministry of
Planning did not do well in coordinating the overall implementation of the
project because of managerial weaknesses, inadequate budgetary support, and
the perceptions of the implementing agencies considering the Project
Coordination Unit as another bureaucratic layer that did not materially
contribute to their efforts.
7.02      Lessons Learned.  The key lessons learned include:
(a)  the CB has not proven to be an appropriate intermediary for
implementing the credit component. Its role under this
project did not fit the general mandate of the CB, and funds
allocated for administering the project were grossly
inadequate. Perhaps future projects in Costa Rica should not
use the CB as an executing agency for credit components, but
the bank may continue to rediscount funds;
(b)  in projects which include several components and implementing
agencies, a central agency such as the Ministry of Planning
may need to take the overall coordinating function. In such
cases, however, the responsibilities of the several agencies
must be defined clearly, and extreme care should be taken in
the selection and appointment of at least the managerial
staff; the Bank should play an active role in this;
(c)  no funds were included in the project (and in the loan) for
project administration, including for monitoring and
evaluation. This should be done in future;



- 14 -
(d) the project included several components scattered throughout
the country. This has contributed to the difficulty in
monitoring and evaluation. A more focused and simple: project
would have been easier to monitor, and perhaps could have been
more effective in its development impact;
(e) the extension component was too small to have had significant
impact on the overall improvement of the Extension Service of
MAG. To improve the overall Service, the Government chose a
national project on technology transfer (extension, research,
and training) financed by the Inter-American Development Bank
instead of through a piecemeal approach as under this
project. That approach could prove to be more effective than
a piecemeal strategy of research and extension development;
and
(f) the Bank should be more assertive in ensuring compliance with
Loan conditions, and in promoting efficient implementation.
In the case of this project, the Bank appears to have been too
accommodating concerning the project's organization,
implementation of the extension component, and submission of
audit reports.

Subject: Completion Report on IBRD Agriculture Credit
and Development Project (Loan 1410-CR)
Dear Sir:
As you requested in your letter of October 17, we are remitting
herewith this Department's comments on the draft Completion Report on IBRD
Agriculture Credit and Development Project, Loan Agreement No. 1410-CR.
The institutions responsible for project execution (components B, C,
D and E) indicated they had no comments on the draft Report, and we are
attaching copies of their letters to us to that effect. We are also attaching

COMMENTS ON PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY THE WORLD BANK:
AGRICULTURE CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1410-CR)
Paragraph 1.02
With regard to changes in the economic structure of Costa Rica, it
can be demonstrated that it is not entirely true that over the past nine years
there has been no dramatic change. In fact, the economy has been recovering
from the sharp decline experienced over the period 1980-82. Real GDP grew by
2.3% in 1983 and 6.6% in 1984, and is expected to grow by 2.42 in 1985.
Following a decline of 4.7% in 1982, agricultural production rose by
3.9X in 1983 and 7% in 1984, and is expected to rise by 1.8% in 1985.
Paragraph 3.16
The discussion of particular administrative aspects of the
development of component E should also mention the quality of the feasibility
study submitted in December 1984, its advancement to the point where financing
was obtained, and the benefits that will accrue to the area selected.
It is important to emphasize the work carried out by the MIDEPLAN
Coordination Department in 1983 which resulted in IDA's finalizing the
feasibility study with assistance from other agencies, when, for a variety of
reasons, neither IDA nor MIDEPLAN had been able to bring it to a conclusion in
six years.
With regard to project administration, two phases should be clearly
distinguished: one lasting from the time the Loan Agreement was approved until
i983, and the other tne period when the project design aas being finalized.
Phase I:
OFIPLAN was designated as executing agency;
-    because of administrative problems, OFIPLAN transferred its
responsibilities to IDA (ITCO);
-    this phase resulted in the assembly of a great deal of scattered
information.
Phase II
-    the Project CoordinatiXig Unit took a more active role in the
execution process (analyzing agreements and results and defining
responsibilities); a new agreement was signed with IDA, UNDP and RUTA

conditional upon the achievement of specific goals and objectives,
with participation to that end by international experts;
-    the result wa; the Atlantic Region Agriculture Development Study;
-    this phase was characterized by IDA's great willingness to work in
conjunction with other entities in the interests of project
execution, the assistance afforded by RUTA, UNDP and the World Bank,
and the acceptance of a higher level of responsibility by the Project
Coordinating Unit.
Paragraph 3.21
rhe responsibility for coordinating IBRD Project 1410-CR was assigned
to MIDEPLAN, although the Loan Agreement itself names the Minister of the
Treasury as Borrower and Representative and gives MIDEPLAN certain clearly
iaentified functions, set out in Section 3.10, where its responsibilities are
declared to be the preparation of reports, project follow-up, and facilitation
of the work of the executing agencies, although without any clear statement as
to how they were to be carried out.
Regarding the presentation of reports, it is noted that the Ministry
of Planning, in cooperation with IFAM, kept good records on the road component
and submitted them to the Bank in a timely manner, which was not the case with
the other components (seeds and extension).
It needs to be made clear that this was not the result of any
negligence on the part of the MIDEPLAN Coordination Department. What occurred
was that, as time elapsed and funds diminished, the executing agencies lowered
the quality and regularity of their reports, which meant that the Project
Coordinating Unit had difficulties in preparing its own reports. This
situation was exacerbated by the constant turnover of both policy and technical
staff responsible for liaison among the various institutions involved.
Clearly, the coordination process proved satisfactory with an
institution like IFAM, which carried out the roads component very ably, making
it possible to keep the Bank informed and provided with the corresponding data.
Paragraph 3.24
This paragraph, which deals with the external auditing of the
financial statements on the non-credit components, mentions that audit reports
for 1983 and 1984 had not been received by the Bank, whereas they were in fact
remitted by this Department on April 18, 1985 under cover of a letter bearing
reference RE-CP-095-85, a copy of which is now attached.
The contract with the firm of Venegas y Alvarez could not be
revalidated, as the Comptroller-General of the Republic did not consider it
advisable, with the consequences you are already aware of. We are attaching a
cooy of the letter referred to and that from Venegas y Alvarez.

Paragraph 4.02
This paragraph, on the subject of institutional performance, makes a
number of assertions regarding MIDEPLAN in general and the Project Coordinating
Unit which need clarification.
According to the Report, it was MIDEPLAN's responsibility to
coordinate execution of the non-credit components, although in actual fact its
functions were not defined exactly.
Taking into consideration the possible changes in administrative and
budgetary focus made during the two presidential periods when the project was
in execution, MIDEPLAN cannot be held responsible for tasks that properly
belonged to the executing agencies; indeed, as the Report states, its sole
responsibility was the coordination process (see Section 3.10 of the Loan
Agreement). It is of course true that the ProJect Coordinating Unit had
several managers during the seven years of project implementation, but that
gives no grounds for underestimating the work done by the Unit and much less
for generalizing that the personnel who coordinated it were inexperienced.
Paragraph 7.02
Subparagraph (b): The Project Coordinating Unit agrees with the
points raised here, since they would lead to less dependency on political
organs. However, in addition to clarifying the responsibilities of the
participating agencies and the coordinating entity, some mechanism for
consultation should be set up promptly by the World Bank; despite the goodwill
mentioned in paragraph 5.10 of the Report, which we also can attest to, time
and distance prove to be limiting factors in some cases.
Subparagraph (c): It must be recognized that budget limitations
prevented adequate monitoring of the various components in the field, as well
as MIDEPLAN's being able to contract for the services of technical specialists
in the specific subject areas targeted by each component. We regard it as a
major failing, as does the Report, that no funds were included which would have
permitted "smoother coordination among the various implementing agencies."
Moreover, the present legal structure does not permit quick procurement of
equipment (competitive bidding), and the conditions attaching to the use of
training funds did not allow compliance with Section 3.10(a).
In this sphere, it would be advisable to take advantage of the
experience gained from the mechanisms used in connection with component E (UNDP
Agreement).
Subparagraph (f): There is no objection here, provided direct access
to the Bank is made easier.
