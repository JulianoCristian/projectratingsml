COSTA RICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an agricultural credit and development project
in Costa Rica for which a loan of US$18 million is proposed. The project
would provide agricultural credit as a continuation of the First and Second
Agricultural Credit Projects, but, in line with Government and Bank policies,
a substantial number of small farmers, not served under the previous projects,
would be encouraged to participate under more attractive terms and conditions.
The project would also strengthen the national extension service, implement
a seed improvement program, carry out a pilot scheme for the rehabilitation
and maintenance of feeder roads, and prepare a comprehensive regional rural
development project. The five project components would aim at (a) increasing
agricultural output leading to import savings and increased export earnings;
(b) raising the income levels, particularly of small- and medium-size farm
operators; and (c) building up selected institutions for planning and execution
of projects aimed at the improvement of living standards for the rural popu-
lation.
ii.       Costa Rica, with a population of about two million, growing at a
rate of 2.6% a year, has been successful in achieving a sound balance between
high income growth and social development. The distribution of income is
fairly even and steadily improving. However, urban-rural disparities are
still substantial, with rural incomes averaging less than half of urban
incomes.  During the past decade, output in real terms grew at an average rate
of over 6% per year; however, this rate has been reduced during the past three
years due to world economic recession and Government policies to bring infla-
tion down from unprecedented levels of 30% in 1974 and 17.4% in 1975 to 4.4%
between December 1975 and December 1976. Inflation is projected to be about
6% in 1977.
iii.      Traditionally, Government efforts have been orientated to promote
the production of coffee, bananas, beef and sugarcane, commodities that have
accounted in the past for over 80% of agricultural exports. The Government
that took office in 1974, without turning away from traditional policies,
aimed at strengthening the production of export commodities, set up new
policies and programs to increase the production of milk, grains and beans,
which, with the exception of rice, do not meet domestic requirements. As part
of the strategy to achieve these goals, the Government is giving more emphasis
to assisting small and medium farmers, who are important producers of these
commodities. In addition, and important to the agricultural sector, there is
a recently started Family Welfare Program (Programa de Desarrollo Social y
Asignaciones Familiares), which has as a main component the free distribution
of milk and other food products to pre-school and school-age children on a
countrywide basis. This will further increase demand.
iv.       The Bank has financed two credit projects in Costa Rica's agri-
cultural sector. The First Agricultural Credit Project--Loan 538-CR for US$3
million--was made in June 1968 and aimed at expanding production of beef,



- ii -
bananas, cotton and pineapples. The second--Loan 827-CR for US$9 million--
which became effective in January 1973, was a continuation of the earlier
loan but also provided finance for dairy production, a wider range of crops,
forestry and certain types of agro-industry. The first project was fully
disbursed in 1973, and full disbursement of the second project is expected by
the end of September 1977. Performance under the two projects has been, in
general, satisfactory.
v.        The total cost of the proposed project would be US$37.6 million,
including contingencies. The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
cost amounting to US$18 million (48%); the Government, including the Central
Bank and Participating State Banks, would finance US$14.5 million (38%); and
subborrowers under the lending program would contribute US$5.1 million (14%).
Commitments would be made over a three-year period, and Bank disbursement
would take up to five and a half years. The Central Bank of Costa Rica
(CB), as agent for the Government, would channel Bank loan proceeds to the
executing entities participating under the project. Under the lending program,
interest rates on subloans to small farmers, defined herein as those whose
main income is derived from farming and whose net income does not exceed
US$2,900 per year, would be 8% per annum, as against 12% for other farmers.
Also, their contribution to the project investment costs would be 10% compared
to 20%. for other beneficiaries. At least 25% of the Bank participation in the
lending program would be for small farmers.
vi.       Five Government agencies would be involved in executing the project.
CB, on-lending through four Government-owned commercial banks, would be re-
sponsible for implementing the agricultural credit component; the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock for strengthening the extension service, constructing
and operating two foundation seed storage warehouses and carrying out the
National Seed Program; the National Production Council for constructing and
operating 26 commercial seed storage warehouses; the Institute for Promotion
and Assistance to Municipalities for administering the feeder roads component;
and the Niational Planning Office for preparing the regional rural development
project. CB would coordinate and monitor the execution of the lending program
and the National Planning Office would provide liaison between the other
implementing agencies and would monitor the other components of the project.
vii.      About 3,250 subloans would be made to finance on-farm investments
and a small number of subloans for agro-industry subprojects and for contrac-
tor machinery; 65 extension workers, with vehicles and equipment, would be
added to the extension service; 28 seed warehouses and distribution centers
would be constructed; a pilot scheme would be implemented whereby a selected
county would be assisted in taking over responsibility for the rehabilitation
and maintenance of about 100 km of feeder roads within its jurisdiction; and
a comprehensive regional development project would be prepared.
viii.     Procurement of the machinery and equipment for the feeder roads,
civil works for the construction and installation of the seed storage build-
ings and all vehicles would be by international competitive bidding. The
rehabilitation and maintenance of the feeder roads would be done by force



- iii -
account, and items to be purchased by farmers financed by the agricultural
credit program would be procured from local established commercial agents who
adequately represent a broad spectrum of international suppliers.
ix.       The project would be of major importance to the country as it would
contribute to increased production of both crops and livestock products for
import substitution and exports. The economic rate of return on the farm
investments, extension services and seed program is estimated at 16%. The
economic rate of return of the feeder road component is about 13%. The
overall economic rate of return of the project, excluding the cost of the
rural development study and of agro-industries, is estimated at 16%. Economic
feasibility of investment plans for agro-industry and services would be
assessed on a case-by-case basis.
x.        During negotiations assurances were obtained which provide a suit-
able basis for a Bank loan of US$18 million for a term of 17 years, including
a grace period of 3-1/2 years. The Government would be the borrower and would
bear the foreign exchange risk.






COSTA RICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Costa Rica has requested a Bank loan of US$18
million to help finance the continuation of its agricultural credit program,
initiated under two previous Bank-financed agricultural credit projects. The
proposed project would also finance technical assistance, seed improvement,
feeder roads and a rural development study.
1.02      The Bank has made two loans to Costa Rica's agricultural sector,
both for agricultural credit only. Loan 538-CR for US$3 million became ef-
fective in December 1968 and was completed in April 1973, and Loan 827-CR for
US$9 million became effective in January 1973 and, as of February 24, 1977,
72% was disbursed. It is expected to be fully committed during the first
semester of 1977 and fully disbursed by the end of September 1977. Perfor-
mance under these projects has been generally satisfactory.
1.03      The project presented by the Government for Bank appraisal was
prepared by the National Planning Office (OFIPLAN). An FAO/Bank Cooperative
Program mission assisted in the preparation.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Costa Rica, with a population of about two million, growing at 2.6%
a year, has been successful in achieving a balance between high income growth
and social development. GNP per capita was US$906 in 1975, and the distri-
bution of income is fairly even and steadily improving, shifting from the
upper 5% of the population in favor of the middle class. In 1971, a survey
indicated that the share of the middle 60% of the population in total income
was 45%, 11 points better than in 1961. This distribution is better than
in most other Latin American countries and not much different from that in
many of the developed countries. Urban-rural disparities although decreasing
are still substantial. The average rural income is less than half the average
urban income and an estimated 25% of the rural population is below the rela-
tive poverty income level, estimated by the Bank, for 1975, at about US$255 per
capita per year (US$1430 per family). Rapid economic growth contributed to
maintaining unemployment at the moderate level of 5% to 7% but underemployment
has averaged 12% to 15%. Moreover, the rate of employment creation is likely
to become an acute concern in the future since the labor force is expected to
increase by 4% per annum over the next few years.



-2-
2.02      Between 1965 and 1974, real output grew at an average rate of 6.3%
per year. More recently, however, growth has been somewhat reduced by world
recession and Government policies to bring inflation down from unprecedented
levels of 30% in 1974 and 17.4% in 1975 to 4.4% when measured between December
1975 and December 1976; inflation is projected to be about 6% in 1977. Real
GNP increased by 5.3% in 1974, 3.4% in 1975 and an estimated 6% in 1976.
2.03      The economy remains heavily dependent on the export of a few agri-
cultural commodities, mostly bananas and coffee. Consequently, changes
in weather conditions and in world prices affect the national economy.
Imports exceed exports, with the annual trade deficit increasing from an
average of US$100 million per year between 1970 and 1973 to US$266 million in
1974, US$217 million in 1975 and about US$200 million in 1976, or some 11% of
GDP. Although foreign exchange earnings increased substantially during
1976/77 because of higher coffee prices, the balance of payments deficit is
likely to continue to be a major problem.
B. Agricultural Sector
Agriculture in the Economy
2.04      The agricultural sector is the most important in the Costa Rican
economy (Annex 1). From 1970-75, it accounted for 21% of GDP and 74% of total
merchandise export earnings and employed 36% of the country's labor force.
After achieving a growth rate in volume of more than 7% per year in the late
1960s, the sector slowed down in the early 1970s, averaging so far about 4.1%
per year. The performance of the sector has been geared to exports, with
dramatic increases in output and export of bananas, sugar and beef cattle
taking place from 1965 to 1975. Except for rice, there was until recently
little incentive for farmers to produce for the domestic market (para 2.14).
Food imports reached about US$60 million in 1975, 8% of total imports, of
which wheat alone accounted for US$20 million. In order to diversify the
economy and benefit small and medium farmers who are important producers of
corn, beans, sugar and milk, the Government has modified its pricing policies
(para 2.15) and provided more resources in credit, research and technical
assistance to promote the production of food crops.
Land Use and Land Tenure
2.05      Costa Rica has a total land area of about 50,900 km2, of which about
31,000 km2, or 3.1 million ha (61%), is farmland, distributed among 77,000
farms. Of the farmland, half is pasture, 16% is used for annual and permanent
crops, and the balance (34%) is under forests and scrub growth. Costa Rica
is still expanding its agricultural frontier and 450,000 ha have been added to
the country's farmland in the 10 years between the last two censuses (1963 and
1973). Crop land decreased in area by almost 100,000 ha between the two



- 3 -
census years, while pasture area increased by more than 600,000 ha, mostly in
newly opened areas of the country. About 40% of total pasture area is im-
proved, but to varying degrees. Most of the expansion has taken place on the
Dry Pacific Coast (Guanacaste) and in the Northern Plains of the country,
which still represent an agricultural frontier used for extensive production
of beef for export. It is estimated that about 400,000 ha on the Pacific and
Atlantic Coasts are unused, potentially good cropland and that about 330,000
ha more could be used for livestock, mostly in the Northern Plains. Develop-
ment is hampered by the lack of roads and infrastructure such as drainage
works on the humid Atlantic Plain and irrigation in the dry zone of the
Pacific Coast (IBRD Map 11419R).
2.06      Land tenure is very skewed since 3.5% of the farmers own close to
55% of the total farmland in holdings of more than 200 ha, while 70% of the
farmers occupy 8% of the land in holdings of less than 20 ha. However, on
more than half of the farms in the latter category, coffee is cultivated,
often as the main cash crop. It is estimated that in 1973, 2 to 3 ha of
coffee alone could provide a family income above the relative poverty level.
Excluding those farmers who operated farms of less than 1 ha on a part-time
basis, it is estimated that at least 60% of coffee growers were outside the
relative poverty target group as defined by the Bank.
Agricultural Credit
2.07      At present, funds channeled into the agricultural sector are lent
within the framework of the Government's agricultural sector policy as set
forth in the 1974-77 lNational Development Plan and the National Program of
Basic Grains. Credit expansion is controlled by the Government through the
Central Bank of Costa Rica (CB). Interest rates, also set by CB, do not
exceed 12% per annum for agricultural loans, and small farmers benefit from
a concessional lending program which includes lower interest rates (8%),
exemptions from fees on the granting of loans, free notary services, and other
free services such as legal work for guarantee assessments usually charged in
addition to interest payments.    Small farmers, who are defined as those
whose income is derived principally from farming and whose net income does not
exceed ¢ 25,000 (about US$2,900) a year, are given priority in the allocation
of funds by CB to the commercial banks. Based on historical trends of agri-
cultural production increases and on the rate projected by the Bank for in-
flation, it is estimated that, during the three-year commitment period of
the proposed loan, the additional requirement of foreign exchange for the
agricultural lending program of the National Banking System would total at
least US$57 million. Of this amount, about US$11 million would be required by
small farmers, of which it is proposed that the Bank should supply about
US$5 million, including price contingencies (Annex 2).
2.08      The National Banking System (Sistema Bancario Nacional--SBN) com-
prises the CB and four autonomous state-owned commercial banks--the Banco
Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR), Banco Anglo Costarricense (BACR), Banco de
Costa Rica (BCR), and Banco de Credito Agricola de Cartago (BCAC). All are
well organized and operate according to sound banking principles within the



-4-
framework of the General Banking Law, which is administered by CB. These
banks have 236 banking offices throughout the country.
2.09      BNCR has had a special Department of Rural Credit which has operated
for over 50 years through Agricultural Credit Rural Boards (Juntas Rurales),
which are decentralized bank offices located strategically around the country
to deal particularly with small farmers. Each office has a manager, usually
a qualified agriculturalist, supported by administrative staff. Credit
operations are decided upon by a Board (Junta Directora), including three
farmers from the neighborhood of the office of the Junta Rural. Then, during
the 1960s, BACR, BCR and BCAC set up their own Small Farmer Credit Offices
(Oficinas de Credito al Pequeno Agricultor), with a basic organization similar
to that of the Juntas Rurales. While the Juntas Rurales remain the principal
suppliers of small farmer credit, the share of small farmer loan balances
held by the Small Farmer Credit Offices increased from 13% in 1968 to 40% in
1975. During 1975, more than 42,000 loans were made to small farmers, and,
as of December 31, 1975, balances of the portfolio of the SBN for small
farmers' credit represented about 23% of loans outstanding for the agricul-
tural sector (further details on agricultural credit are given in Annex 2).
Extension Service
2.10      The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) is divided into two
main components, each under the authority of a vice-minister. One is the
technical section, which comprises the specialized Bureaus of Research, Train-
ing and Extension, Basic Technical Services, Livestock, Plant and Animal
Health, Fisheries and Forestry. The other consists of eight Regional Agri-
cuiltural Centers and over 59 extension offices. As support offices, M4AG
has a sectorial planning office and the National Agricultural Council, insti-
tuted in 1970 to advise the Government on policy matters and to coordinate
activities of the v,rious entities concerned with the agricultural sector.
The Council, as reorganized in August 1975, is headed by the Minister of
Agriculture and Livestock, and other members are from the Ministry of the
Presidency, the National Planning Office (OFIPLAN), the Ministry o' Economy,
CB, the Institute of Land and Colonization (ITCO), and the National Production
Council (CNP). The MAG, with assistance from the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), is staffed with adequately trained technicians and has most of the
necessary facilities to carry out its work although it needs additional
technical personnel and transportation for its extension service (Annex 3).
SBN has 80 graduate agriculturalists to assist in the preparation and super-
vision of loans to farmers and ranchers (Annex 2). The Coffee Board, the
Banana Growers' Association and the Sugarcane League have their own specialist
services.
Seeds
2.11      Productivity is held back by the lack of selected and processed
higher yielding seeds, particularly for grains and beans, but also for pota-
toes, oilseeds, cotton and pastures. Rice is the only crop for which a sig-
nificant amount of improved seed is produced in the country (about 60% of the



seed used). These seeds, labelled "authorized," are not certified seeds but
simply commercial grain grown by selected farmers and from which impurities
have been screened. In 1972, a Seed Law was enacted, which created the
National Seed Commission (NSC), with the purpose of establishing a system
of seed certification and a national seed program to increase productivity
of the major crops. The commission has insufficient legal authority and
finance to fulfill its functions. A revised law has been drafted which is
expected to be reviewed by Congress during the first half of 1977. NSC would
become a separate public entity, dependent on MAG, with appropriate legal
powers and its own budget and staff. NSC would supervise and, as certifying
agent, participate in the implementation of a National Seed Program, currently
under preparation. The program would include projections of the country's seed
requirements and establish targets for production of seeds (authorized and
certified). The program would also allocate responsibilities among the enti-
ties involved in each stage of the various activities of the seed industry.
2.12      Although research remains weak, most of the infrastructure needed
to carry out this program already exists. Between 1974 and 1976, under the
auspices of NSC and with financing from USAID, the University of Costa Rica
built and equipped a modern seed laboratory, and CNP constructed and equipped
a seed processing plant, which, together with a plant in the private sector,
have the capacity to meet all crop seed needs until 1980. The country also
has qualified seed technicians who were trained abroad. The program, however,
is being held up by lack of seed storage space and distribution centers. The
seed component of the project has been designed to help overcome this problem
(Annex 4).
Feeder Roads
2.13      The country has some 20,000 km of county feeder roads and tracks,
in addition to the Pan-American highway and other major national roads. The
Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MIOPT) is responsible for construction
and maintenance of the Pan-American highway and other national roads, but it
does little work on the feeder roads that are so vital to the farm sector.
Most of these roads are so poorly constructed and maintained that the market-
ing of farm products and the provision of institutionalized technical and
financial assistance to farmers are seriously hampered. In 1970, the Govern-
ment, aware that problems of local interest should be solved basically by
municipal governments, created the Institute for Promotion and Assistance to
Municipalities (IFAI). In the five years it has been operating, IFAM has
entered into agreements with municipal governments under which technical and
financial assistance is channeled to them from the Central Government and from
international organizations for a variety of projects, which have been related
mainly to education and health. Now, however, IFAM is in the process of
designing pilot projects to assist municipalities in taking the responsibility
for the rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads. The proposed project
would help IFAM in this effort (Annex 5).



C.   Government Strategy
2.14      Government interest in the agricultural sector has traditionally
focused on the export sub-sector. Research and technical assistance have been
concentrated on the promotion of coffee, sugarcane and cattle raising. These
activities have absorbed most of the credit made available to the sector by
the SBN (Annex 2). Retail price ceilings of milk and sugar had been maintained
at the same low level for many years (paras 6.02 and 6.04) and prices of grains
and beans were allowed to adjust to those of imported foodstuff (para 6.05).
With the exception of rice, only limited resources and staff have been devoted
to research and technical assistance to develop and promote improved seeds and
cultivation practices for grains and beans, which would have increased the
competitive position of domestic producers.
2.15      The need to diversify the economy away from a few export commodities,
balance of payments difficulties, the world grain shortage in 1973/74 and the
desire to benefit more small and medium farmers have, since 1974, led the
Government to give more attention to the production of domestic food. Retail
price ceilings of milk and sugar were practically doubled in two years and a
comprehensive program was designed to achieve self-sufficiency in grains and
beans by 1978. Its successful accomplishment required substantially increased
producer support prices, achieved through massive Government market interven-
tion, and proportionately higher retail prices, abundant production credit and
import and export licensing (para 6.05 and Annex 1). As a result, the percen-
tage of domestic consumption of grains and beans met by local production
increased for an average of 62% and 35% for corn and beans, respectively,
between 1970 and 1974, to 81% and 46% in 1975. In fact, substantial surpluses
developed for rice. But these increases were mostly achieved through area
expansion and not productivity increases. The Government hopes that with new
technical assistance and a seeds program, to which this project would contri-
bute, producers will be encouraged to adopt more efficient technologies and
practices.
2.16      Relevant to the agricultural sector is a recently started Family
Welfare Program (Programa de Desarrollo Social y Asignaciones Familiares),
which, besides promoting sanitation and street paving, provides for direct
free distribution of food to pre-school and school-age children at schools
and nutrition centers with the purpose of reaching 62% of them by 1980. The
program is financed by a progressively increasing proportion of the general
8% sales tax and by a new 3% payroll tax. Out of a total allocation of US$34
million in 1976, about US$10 million was programmed for food distribution.
In 1980, the whole program is expected to cost US$80 million, including US$18
million for food distribution. The impact this will hnve on the demand for
food will be substantial since the program requirements in 1976 represent a
10% increase over the normal consumption of milk and milk products.  By 1980
this would rise to 18%. The program will increase the demand for fish,
cocoa and sugar products, vegetables, fruits and fats.

2.17      The proposed project would assist the country to meet its needs by
expanding and improving the production systems of commodities such as milk and
meat, as well as sugar, grains and beans, fruits and vegetables.
III.   PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS PROJECTS
3.01      The First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 538-CR) for US$3 million
became effective in December 1968 and aimed at expanding production and export
of beef, bananas, pineapples, and cotton. The Second Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 827-CR) for US$9 million, effective January 1973, continued the
program but included a wider range of crops, dairy production, forestry and
agro-industries. In both projects, loans were channeled to farmers by CB,
the borrower, through four state-owned commercial banks (participating banks
- PBs). CB was responsible for project execution.
Lending Terms
3.02      Under the first project, Bank funds to CB at 6-1/4% were passed to
the PBs at 6-1/2%, together with the Bank commitment charge. Sub-borrowers
paid an effective rate of 9-3/4% with repayment periods ranging from three to
six years and grace periods of from two to five years, depending on the sub-
project. Financing called for farmers to pay 20% of investment costs; PBs,
30%; and the Bank, 50%. PB technicians assisted sub-borrowers in preparing farm
plans and appraising subloan applications.
3.03      Under the second project, Bank funds went to CB, which paid the com-
mitment charge and 7-1/4%, and from CB to PBs at not less than 7-1/4%. Sub-
borrowers were charged an effective rate of not less than 9-3/4%. Repayment
periods were frQm three to 10 years, with grace periods ranging from two to
five years. The lending program required subborrowers to pay 20% of invest-
ment costs; PBs, 27%; and the Bank, 53%.
Performance
3.04      First Project.  A Project Performance Audit Report, dated August 6,
1975, was prepared by the Operations Evaluations Department of the Bank. The
report points out that the lending pattern under the first project differed
substantially from appraisal estimates. The disbursements were completed in
April 1973, the closing date having been postponed twice from the original
date of June 1971. Slow disbursements resulted from initial staffing problems
and inexperience in the CB unit that was responsible for project administra-
tion, and in the PBs, and from overcentralization of subloan approval in the
CB. In addition, average subloan size was US$57,000, compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$18,000, and 90% of the lending went for beef cattle
investments, as compared with the appraisal estimate of 30% and a revised
estimate of 74% made in April 1971. This came about partly because alter-
native sources of funds were made available to banana producers and because
the main cotton growing areas were affected by volcanic eruptions and droughts.



- 8 -
Also, the PBs preferred to make subloans to larger cattle ranchers because they
offered greater security and were better able to prepare the relatively complex
farm plans required.
3.05      Second Project.  Some of the problems mentioned above persisted
during the implementation of the second project. The project has lagged
behind schedule, with commitments at 86% of appraisal estimates and disburse-
ments at 72% of the appraisal forecast for December 31, 1976. The cancella-
tion of commitments to slow-moving beef subloans and to a large agro-industry
subproject, due to the downturn on the international beef market in 1975 in
the first case and to mismanagement in the latter case, were the principal
reasons for the slow progress of the project. Complex and cumbersome proce-
dures for subloan analysis and review, which was carried out by PB headquarters
staff, and overcentralization of approval in CB, also slowed down subloan
processing. However, simplified procedures, which transferred most of the
subloan approval authority from CB to the PBs, were introduced by CB in
October 1976 and are expected to speed up commitment and disbursement of
remaining funds. Nevertheless, the loan closing date, originally set for
December 30, 1976, has been extended to September 30, 1977.
3.06      The composition of the lending program has again differed sub-
stantially from appraisal expectations, with livestock and agro-industry sub-
loans far exceeding their expected share at the expense of crops and forestry.
Subloans approved to September 1976 averaged 0 237,000 (US$30,000) compared
to the V 161,000 (US$24,000) 1/ expected at appraisal. However, the dif-
ference and the average size of subloans have been considerably lower than
in the first project. The strength of the beef market until 1975 and, more
recently, of the milk market, as well as reasons mentioned in the above
comments on the first project, account for the interest in livestock sub-
loans, which have represented 64% of the lending program, as compared with
46% expected at appraisal.  The long period needed to recover forestry invest-
ment is responsible for the absence of demand for forestry subloans.  Crop
subloans have accounted for only 10% of the lending program, compared with
40% expected at appraisal.  There have been two main reasons for the short-
fall:  (a) about 64% of the expected investments under this category were
for a scheme to develop oil palms on about 2,000 ha, which failed because
of the absence of promotion, incentives and infrastructure; and (b) until
quite recently annual food crops have been subject to disincentives created
by price policies.
3.07      While divergencies from appraisal targets are difficult to antici-
pate or control when they result from unexpected market shifts, it is believed
that, in the proposed project, the risk would be reduced that subloans would
be larger than anticipated or that lending for large beef operations would be
1/   Exchange rate at appraisal, V 6.6/US$l; actual exchange rate up to
May 1974, e 6.6/US$l, and subsequently, V 8.5/US$i.



greater than is now projected. This would be accomplished principally by
permitting lending for complementary investments so as to assist farmers with-
out requiring complex farm plans; decentralizing subloan review and approval
procedures to the level of branches and agencies so as to speed up procedures
and to place reliance more on the personal knowledge of sub-borrowers and
less on collateral; and expanding and strengthening the extension service,
which would mainly assist small farmers who would invest principally in
crop and milk production.
IV.   THE PROJECT
A.   Brief Description
4.01      The project would be carried out over a three-year period and would
provide agricultural credit to finance on-farm investments, agro-industries,
contractor machinery and private consultants services; strengthen the national
extension service; implement a seed improvement program; assist in carrying out
a pilot scheme for the rehabilitation, construction and maintenance of feeder
roads; and prepare a comprehensive rural development project in a selected
region of the country.
4.02      The project would help implement the Government's policy for the
agricultural sector and increase agricultural output leading to import
savings and increased export earnings. It would help raise the income level
of the small- and medium-size farmer and support selected institutions for
further planning and execution of projects to improve the conditions of the
rural population.
4.03      The proceeds of the loan would be channeled through CB to the dif-
ferent entities responsible for the implementation of the various project com-
ponents. CB, through its Development Credit Department (DCD), would administer
and supervise the agricultural credit component of the project, which would be
implemented by the four state-owned commercial banks (para 2.08); MAG would be
responsible for strengthening the National Extension Service and for the
construction of the foundation seed storage facilities; the CNP would be
responsible for the construction of the storage and distribution facilities
for commercial seed; IFAM would implement the pilot project for feeder roads
and OFIPLAN would be responsible for the preparation of the Rural Development
Project.
B.   Detailed Features
Agricultural Credit
4.04      On-farm Investments.  The project would provide medium- and long-
term subloans to help finance on-farm investments on about 3,250 farms. It
would cover a wide spectrum of farm and ranch sizes throughout the country,



- 10 -
and beneficiaries could be individuals, groups of farmers or cooperatives.
About 2,100 of the farmers expected to benefit from the program would be
small farmers, defined for the purpose of the project as those whose income
is derived principally from farming and whose net income does not exceed
¢ 25,000 (about US$2,900) a year (para 2.07). Initially, a minimum of 25% of
the loan amount allocated to the lending program would be reserved for sub-
loans to this category. During the implementation of the project, this
proportion could be increased, but only in exceptional circumstances would it
be reduced. Two types of subloans would be financed for on-farm investments.
The first type would consist of subloans for comprehensive farm development
investment subprojects, which would be prepared and appraised on the basis of
farm plans.  The second type of subloan would finance inputs, which would be
complementary investments on farms already possessing most assets necessary
for efficient operation, to consolidate their position. Such investments would
mainly involve completion, expansion, or renovation activities related to farm
machinery and equipment, planting, cattle handling facilities, on-farm tracks
or roads, as well as rehabilitation works. In particular, subloans for com-
plementary investments would be relevant to lending to small farmers. These
subloans would be appraised on the basis of simple cash-flow projections
to determine the merits of the proposed investment. While no economically
viable farm investment would be precluded, it is expected that the bulk of the
subloans would finance the production of milk and beef in the livestock sub-
sector; cotton, rice, other grains and beans in the annual crop category;
and sugarcane and fruit trees in the case of semi-permanent and permanent
crops. Most subloans for dairying would be made to small farmers in the
traditional dairy area of the foothills of the Central Valley and other areas
such as flicoya, Arenal and valleys of El General and San Carlos which are now
beginning to supply fluid milk, instead of cheese and butter, to pasteurizing
plants of San Jose and other major cities. Lending for beef production would
take place mainly along the Pacific Coast. The financing of crops would take
place countrywide; sub-borrowers, except those growing rice or cotton, would
be mainly small farmers, who would consume some of the increased output on the
farm.  The main items of on-farm investments would be machinery and equipment
i2%), land preparat ion and I.asture (Kprverrient 'i9%). constraction and
installations (26%), fences (5%), on-farm roads (7%), and breeding stock
(18%). Illustrative models of investments in typical enterprises to be
financed under the project are included in Annex 6.
4.05      Agro-Industry and Services.  Under this category the project would
provide a line of credit for enterprises related to farm production, but which
do not fit technically or economically as an on-farm investment.  Small- and
medium-size agro-industries would be the main components of this category of
subloan. There are subprojects under preparation for feed-mixing plants,
rice mills, cotton gins, and canning and bottling of juices and other products
including baby foods and candy. Subloans would also include the financing of
individuals, companies or cooperatives to purchase machinery and equipment to
do contract work for farmers such as land clearing, leveling, on-farm road
construction and transport of sugarcane from farms to mills. Economic feasi-
bility of investment in agro-industries and services would be assessed on a
case-by-case basis.

Extension Service
4.07      The project would provide financing to strengthen the National
Extension Service of MAG.  Sixty-five additional extension workers would be
added during the period of project implementation, which would raise the total
number of extension workers to 400 (para 5.04) to reinforce the extension
offices at strategic places throughout the country (para 2.10) where PBs would
be providing subloans to small farmers. The project would also finance the
purchase of 69 vehicles; office and other equipment; and training for staff
and farmers, including travel out of the country for advanced training and
study tours (Annex 3). The total cost of this component would be US$1.5 million.



- 12 -
Seed Program
4.08      The project would finance the construction, installation and equip-
ment needed to complete the physical infrastructure for the implementation of-
a National Certified Seed Program. This would involve the construction and
equipment of two foundation seed storage rooms to be used by MAG and 26 ware-
houses to be used by the CNP for the storage and distribution of certified
or improved seed. The two proposed foundation seed storage facilities would
have a capacity of 100 m tons each, and the commercial seed warehouses would
consist of 26 units with a capacity of 230 m tons each, which would meet
projected seed storage requirements up to 1985.
Feeder Roads
4.09      The project would enable IFAM to assist the Municipal Government of
the County of Perez Zeledon to initiate a pilot scheme for the selection,
construction and maintenance of feeder roads. These are classified as third
class roads and their improvement would consist mainly of making them usable
on a year-round basis. Road work would consist of earth moving, grading,
gravel surfacing, and providing drainage, including installation of culverts
and minor bridges for some 107 km. The estimated average cost is US$15,500
per km. Construction works and maintenance of the roads would be carried out
by an autonomous division of the County Government which the project would
assist in setting up. The project would also finance the services of an
internationally recruited consultant for six months, the salary of a road
engineer during project implementation (para 5.06), the purchase of equipment
for the machinery pool, and the cost of labor and materials for the civil
works (further details are given in Annex 5). The total cost of this com-
ponent would be about US$1.7 million.
Rural Development Study
4.10      T¾- npr?iiect would finance the studies necessary to prepare a com-
iehens1vc rc.bliia_ raral    L 1iopmeil tLjr .. The .cd   inu    - *de Li.  c11-
tification of the target group and the definition of the appropriate tech-
nology and investments required to increase their productivity, income and
welfare. The cost of the studies would be approximately US$0.4 million, in-
cluding about 50 man-months of internationally recruited consultant time at
US$6,000 per month to cover remuneration, overhead costs and travel; counter-
part personnel and related expenses; vehicles and equipment. It is expected
that a consultant firm, which may include Costa Ricans, would carry out the
study and that the foreign exchange expenditure would be about 75% of the
total cost. Assurance was obtained at negotiations that, by March 1, 1978,
a region for the proposed development study would be selected and terms of
reference for the consulting team, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been
prepared.

C.   Cost Estimates
4.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$37.6 million, of
which US$18 million, or 48%, represents the foreign exchange component.
Costs have been estimated at August/September 1976 prices, with a physical
contingency of 10% of baseline costs allowed for the extension service, seed
program and feeder road components. A price contingency of 21% of baseline
costs, plus physical contingencies, expressed in dollars, has been added.
The price contingency is based on the assumptions that between the date of
the appraisal mission and March 31, 1978, estimated to be the mid-point of
the first year of commitments, prices will rise by 11%; an annual increase
of prices by about 8% is projected for the second and third years of the
project. Commitments on the agricultural credit program would be made over
three years and subloans would be disbursed over five years. Investments
for all other components would be made over a period of three years (Annex 7).

4.13      The Bank loan of US$18 million would finance the entire foreign
exchange cost, which represents 48% of the total project cost. Subborrowers
ucnder the agricultural credit component of the project would finance US$5.1
million, or 14% of the project cost (17% of the agricultural credit component).
Government would finance US814.5 million, or 38% of the costs. It is projected
that as mulch as one-third of the lending program could be to small farmers and
it has been agreed that as a minimum, 25% of the Bank participation in the
lending program would be for this category of sub-borrower. Government
financing includes the contribution of CB and state-owned commercial banks
participating in the agricultural credit component, budgetary allocation of
the MAG for the extension service and construction of two foundation seed
warehouses, the contribution of CNP for construction of the other 26 seed
warehouses and contributions of IFAM and the Municipality of Perez Zeledon
for the feeder road component.
4.14      The Bank loan would be made to the GovernmenL at the Bank lending
rate prevailing at the time of loan approval, for a term of 17 years,
including 3-1/2 years of grace. The Government would bear the foreign ex-
change risk.
E.   Procurement
4X15      The items to be procured by farmers financed under the agricultural
credit component would be bought from local commercial agents, who represent
a broad spectrum of international suppliers. Equipment for the feeder road
component, civil works and equipment for the seed storage buildings and all
vehicles, estimated to cost about US$3 million, would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Bidding documentation, advertising procedures to be followed for the bidding,
and contract award would require prior Bank approval when the estimated cost
of the contract is US$75,000 or more. The rehabilitation of the feeder roads
would be done by force account, utilizing the equipment purchased through ICB.
Materials for road construction would be procured according to local competi-
tive bidding procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank. Assurances on
these points were obtained during negotiations.
F.   Disbursements
4.]6      The Bank would disburse:
(a)  60% of amounts disbursed by the participating banks for
project subloans to beneficiaries of the agricultural credit
component of the project;
(b)  100% of the foreign cost of vehicles and equipmenl, or 757
of the cost of locally procured vehicles and equipment;



- 17 -
(c) 30% of the total cost of the civil works for the con-
struction and installation and equipment of the seed
warehouses and for the feeder road component;
(d) 100% of the foreign cost of overseas training and of
advisers for the extension component; and
(e) 75% of the total cost of salaries, travel and subsistence
of consultants, supervision services for construction and
installation and preparation of the rural development study.
4.17      Disbursements for expenditures under the agricultural credit compo-
nent and for civil works performed under force account would be made against
certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which would not be sub-
mitted to the Bank but would be retained by CB and/or participating banks for
review by Bank supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made
against full documentation. The schedule of estimated disbursements is given
in Annex 8 and the project cash-flow projections for the CB and participating
banks are given in Annex 9.
V.   ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01      CB, as fiscal agent for the borrower, would process all applications
for withdrawals from the loan. Coordination and monitoring of the lending
activities of the banks in carrying out the agricultural credit component
would also be a responsibility of CB. OFIPLAN would provide liaison between
the other implementing agencies, review procurement documents prepared by the
implementing agencies and would monitor activities on extension services,
the seed program, feeder roads, and the rural development study, and for this
purpose would appoint one of its senior staff members as Liaison Officer.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that such a Liaison Officer would
be appointed, not later than September 1, 1977, with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank.
Administration
5.02      Agricultural Credit.  CB's DCD would implement the agricultural
credit component. Lending to farmers and other beneficiaries would be carried
out by the four state-owned commercial banks through their headquarters offices
and more than 200 branches and agencies (para 2.08 and Annex 2). These banks
have played a dominant role in the provision of agricultural credit in Costa
Rica and they are consequently experienced in the field. Lending procedures
for short-, medium-, and long-term loans are well established and debt recovery
performance is good (Annex 2). Under the previous Bank-financed projects, all
subloan applications were subject to review and approval by the DCD. However,



- 18 -
the participating banks now have their ownl staff experienced in agricultural
subloan approval (Annex 2). In view of their satisfactory performance, approval
of subloans under US$100,000 (para 5.08) would, under the proposed project, be
delegated to them. Subloans ranging from US$100,000 to US$150,000 would need
approval of CB and those above US$150,000 would be submitted to Bank for its
review.
5.03      Under the proposed project, DCD would:
(a)  supervise implementation of the PBs' lending program;
(b) provide overall guidance, training and assistance to PBs and
assist the MAG Extension Service in subjects related to the
efficiency of the project's credit component;
(c) collect and analyze statistical data related to the execution
of the lending program and the preparation of quarterly progress
reports to be sent to the Bank promptly af-er the end of eacl
quarter; and
(d) establish a monitoring system to facilitate the preparation of
project completion and evaluation reports of the agricultural
credit component (para 5.13) and to contribute to the formula-
tion of national agricultural credit policies.
5.04      Extension Service.  This component would be administered by the
H4AG's Vice-minister for Operations, who has under his direction the eight
Regional Agricultural Centers (CARs), which, in turn, supervise and assist the
extension offices (para 2.10) to which the personnel and equipment financed
under the project would be assigned (Annex _). Coordination between MAG and
the banking system is handled by the National Agricultural Council (CAN) in
San Jose and at the field level by local councils (CANCITOS) presided over by
the local CAR director. The CAN and CANCITOS include representatives of the
banking system and other entities related to the agricultural sector (Annex 1).
Because the workload of the Extension Service would increase under the proiect,
an assurance was obtained at negotiations what 65 additional extension workers
(para 4.07) would be appointed by September 1, 1978.
5.05      Seed Program.  C7NP through its Planning Division would be responsible
for the construction of the certified seed warehouses to be financed under the
project. A local consultant firm is completing the detailed engineering and
other technical specifications. The operation of the certified seeds storage
facilities would be the responsibility of the Development Division of CNP, which
currently is in charge of the operation of commercial grain warehouses and of
the new seed processing plant financed by USAID.  MAG would be responsible for
the construction and operation of the two foundation seed warehouses to be
located at its main research station in Taboga (Enrique Jimenez Nunez). The
Director of MAG's Agronomy Department, who is also chairman o' the National
Seed Commission, would be responsible for implementation of the National Seed
Program.  Both MAG and CNP have qualified personnel trained at the Seed Tech-
nology Faculty of the University of Mississippi and, withi USAID financing,



- 19 -
would continue receiving technical assistance from this university. A
draft National Seed Program including identification and definition of
the role of the various participating agencies, coordination arrangements
and targeted seed production for the main crops and a timetable for opera-
tions, was presented to the Bank at negotiations. That this program and
timetable had been finalized to the satisfaction of the Bank and that the
Government and CNP had signed a subsidiary contract, also satisfactory to
the Bank, would be conditions of disbursement for the seed program compon-
ent. Assurance was received at negotiations that the program would be
initiated by September 1, 1978. Assurances were also obtained at negotia-
tions that construction designs and specifications of all the seed storage
warehouses would be approved by consultants, acceptable to the Bank, before
invitations to bid were advertised, and that adequate personnel and funds
would be provided to staff the Enrique Jimenez Nunez experiment station of
MAG and each of the CNP seed storage and distribution centers (Annex 4).
5.06      Feeder Roads.  IFAM would have principal responsibility for this
component of the project and would enter into an agreement with the Municipal
Council of the Perez Zeledon County to establish a County Road Improvement
Office (CRIO). A qualified road engineer, acceptable to the Bank, would be
appointed manager of CRIO and a consultant, also acceptable to the bank and
specialized in feeder road construction and maintenance, would be provided
under the project to assist in the organization of the CRIO in Perez Zeledon.
M1OPT, under an existing contract with IFAM, would continue to provide tech-
nical and financial assistance to IFAM, which, in turn, would provide super-
vision of the construction and maintenance works to be conducted by the
CRIO in Perez Zeledon (Annex 5). It would be a condition of disbursement for
this component of the project that an agreement between the Government, IFAM
and the Mlunicipal Council of Perez Zeledon, satisfactory to the Bank, had been
signed. Assurances were obtained that the manager of the CRIO and the road
construction consultant would be appointed by December 1, 1977.
5.07      Rural Development Study.  OFIPLAN would be responsible for the rural
development study, including recruiting internationally a team of consultants.
Lending Operations for the Agricultural Credit Component
5.08      Subloans would finance any viable farm project or complementary
on-farm investment for the development of livestock and annual or perennial
crops. Except in the case of subloans to small farmers or for complementary
investments for dairy development, subloan proceeds to finance the purchase
of breeding stock would not exceed 50% of the subloan amount. PBs would
extend subloans for approved subprojects not exceeding 90% of investment in
the case of small farmers and 80% in the case of other beneficiaries. PB
subloans would be appraised and approved by the respective PBs involved
provided that the subloan, by itself or in combination with earlier subloans
under this project to the same sub-borrower, totalled less than US$100,000.
Subloans not exceeding US$35,000 could be approved at PB field offices.



- 20 -
Subloans exceeding US$100,000 would be approved by DCD, and those exceeding
US$150,000 would require Bank and CB approval. Assurances regarding these
conditions were obtained at negotiations.
5.09      PB subloans would be made with repayment terms ranging from a mini-
mum of three years to a maximum of 12 years, including grace periods of up to
five years. Repayment and grace period terms would be established for each
subloan on the basis of the requirements of cash-flow projections. Redis-
counting of PB subloans by CB would be made under the same repayment terms.
Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.
5.10      The following interest rates and proportions of financing
have been selected to encourage investment in farming while maintaining the
financial viability of the institutions:
Type of            Portion of Subloan            Annual Interest Rate
Beneficiary          Rediscounted by CB    CB to PBs   PBs to Sub-borrowers
(%)                (%)              (%)
Small farmers                  100.0               5.0               8.0 /1
Other beneficiaries             80.0               9.5              12.0 /1
/1   The Costa Rica banks charge interest quarterly and in advance, thereby
increasing the effective interest rate by 0.6% and 0.9% respectively.
In accordance with current banking regulations, subloans at 8% for small
farmers would not exceed in aggregate ¢ 100,000 (US$11,700) to the same
sub-borrower. Assurances were obtained at negotiations regarding the portions
of subloans to be discounted by CB and the interest rate structure. The CB
will carry out by December 31, 1977 a study of the impact on the allocation of
resources and the cost to CB of the lower interest rate to be charged to small
farmers.
5.11      The CB and PBs would enter into subsidiary loan agreements incor-
porating terms and conditions of the lending operations and would specifically
(a) incorporate terms, conditions and interest rates for on-lending (redis-
counts) between CB and the PBs and between the PBs and the farmers and other
beneficiaries, and (b) cover the obligation of CB and PBs for the provision
of short-term subloans to finance the operating capital needs of sub-borrowers.
It would be a condition of disbursement under the agricultural credit compo-
nent of the project that CB had signed a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfac-
tory to the Bank, with at least one of the PBs.
Accounts and Auditing
5.12      Separate project accounts would be maintained by each of the execut-
ing entities under the project as follows: (a) by CB for the loan proceeds
for the different components of the project and for project funds handled
under the agricultural credit component; (b) by MAG for the Extension Service
and the foundation seed warehouses component; (c) by CNP for certified seed



- 21 -
warehouse construction; (d) by IFAM and the Municipality of Perez Zeledon for
the feeder road component; and (e) by OFIPLAN for the preparation of the rural
development project.   Assurances were obtained that records and accounts
identifying all transactions pertaining to project components would be main-
tained. Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that project accounts
would be audited by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, and that
these audits would be carried out at the end of each fiscal year and certified
copies of the financial statements so audited, together with the report of the
auditors, would be sent to the Bank no later than four months after the close
of each fiscal year.
M4onitoring and Reporting
5.13      DCD of CB would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a
system for monitoring the impact of the proposed agricultural credit component
of the project, while OFIPLAN would be responsible for monitoring the progress
and the impact of the extension, seed and road components. The Bank would
assist in the development of appropriate monitoring systems. Under this
system, it is envisaged that DCD would assemble information each season from
a sample of representative farms financed under the project which would allow
periodic evaluation of progress. Assurances were obtained from Government
that such monitoring systems, acceptable to the Bank, would be established by
the DCD and OFIPLAN and submitted to the Bank by March 1, 1978.
5.14      Quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the Bank by DCD in
respect to the lending program and by OFIPLAN for all other components.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES, AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
A. Production
6.01      The project would assist Costa Rica in increasing the output of beef,
milk, sugar, grains, beans, cotton, cassava and tree-crops. Incremental
production resulting from the agricultural credit program and incremental herd
value would be approximately as follows:

Full development would be attained by year 6 for dairy and semi-permanent crops,
by year 7 for annual crops, year 10 for beef breeding and in year 12 for perma-
nent crops. Total annual value of incremental production would be about V 125
million (US$14.7 million), while incremental herd value would be e 6 million
(US$0.7 million) for beef cattle and ¢ 45 million (US$5.3 million) for dairy
cattle, giving a total of ¢ 51 million (US$6 million).
B. MarketinR and Prices
Milk
6.02      Costa Rica is currently 90% to 95% self-sufficient in milk and dairy
products. If supply and demand continue to grow at about 6% per year, the gap
would amount to 26 million liters of fluid milk equi7adent in 1980 and 35
million liters in 1985.  Demand is expecteA to ?row at 3% to R.5% per year, at
least until 1980, as a result of implement.iWion of the R'amily Kalfare Program
(para 2.16), which would bring annua) Trrtr.  opii'-. ei'r to <n equivalent of
65 million liters in 1985.  The proi2r-t l,tcrmnta' pro4llictio-i oF 20 million
liters would help meet part of this 3ho:t'7al,t.  'Ale ni:.Tjcer)s' price for raw



- 23 -
milk is currently between ¢ 1.40 and 1.50 per bottle (0.67 liter) in the San
Jose area, i.e., about US$0.25 per liter, which is attractive to producers.
Retail prices are also regulated at levels which are reasonable to consumers,
although unrewarding to dairy processors who depend on products other than
whole milk for their profits (Annex 1). Since 1974, retail ceilings have been
raised from US$0.15 to US$0.29 in 1976.
Beef
6.03      Producers' decisions to invest in beef cattle in Costa Rica depend
on prices of exported meat to the US. Although domestic demand accounts for
40% of total production, consumption per capita has kept declining over the
last 15 years as increasing exports have resulted in high domestic prices.
Government imposed ceilings on domestic retail prices in 1974, which have
remained at the same level. Domestic per capita consumption is therefore
expected to stabilize at 14 kg or 15 kg per year. US imports of meat are
projected to expand at about 6% per year during the next 10 years and, if
Costa Rica is to retain its present share in that market (about 5%), its
exports should increase at the same rate. Total demand for beef is there-
fore expected to increase at least 4.7% per year, slightly more than past
production trends (4.5% from 1970 to 1975) so that a shortfall of over 1,400 m
tons would develop in 1980 and one of 4,000 m tons in 1985. Incremental pro-
duction from the project at full development (year 10) would be about 3,300 m
tons. Prices received by producers for exported meat, that were at ¢ 4.7 per kg
liveweight in 1973, declined to ¢ 4.3 in 1974. Following the devaluation of
the Colon in 1974, they regained their former level of about 0 4.7 but did not
rise further in 1975 due to the downturn in the international beef cycle and
recession in the US.  Prices picked up again in 1976 to around ¢ 5.7 per kg
liveweight (US$0.67). International prices, in constant terms, are expected to
remain stable or increase slightly in 1977 and thereafter increase by about
30% by 1980.
Sugarcane
6.04      The Sugarcane League, a public sector institution, regulates the
allocation of sugar production between domestic consumption and exports by
fixing production quotas every year for mills and farmers. Domestic utiliza-
tion absorbs about 60% of total production of sugar and has been growing at
around 8% per year. Its growth is expected to slow down somewhat as consumer
prices, which were exceptionally low until 1974 (they were held by the Govern-
ment at ¢ 0.55 per pound from 1955 to 1974), were raised to ¢ 1.00 per pound
(US$0.12) in 1975, just allowing mills to cover their production costs.
Profits depend on widely fluctuating international prices of the 40%o of the
production exported, which were as low as US$0.10 per lb in 1976 although,
they were at US$0.16 in 1974 and US$0.35 in 1975. They are expected to
stabilize around US$0.15 per lb in constant 1976 prices up to 1985.  Total
demand is expected to grow by at least 5% per year, but if production continues
to increase by only 2% annually, as it did between 1970 and 1975, Costa Rica's



- 24 -
share of the US market will decline. Provided the Government maintains domes-
tic consumer prices at reasonable levels, demand for credit to increase
sugarcane planting and processing is expected to be strong.
Grains and Beans
6.05      Demand for grains and beans for human and animal consumption is
increasing at about 2.5% per year, that is by 10,000 m tons to 15,000 m tons
per year. CNP is the public institution in charge of price stabilization
through market intervention (Annex 1). Between the agricultural years 1973/74
and 1975/76, CNP guaranteed prices to producers have increased by 70% for rice
and sorghum, almost doubled for corn and increased by 165% for beans. In 1976,
they were, per quintal, ¢ 125 for rice (US$14.6), ¢ 60 for sorghum (US$7.0),
q 75 for corn (US$8.8), and ¢ 225 for beans (US$26.3).  Actual prices received by
producers from CNP are lower, usually by some 20%, as most consignments do not
meet GNP required standards of humidity, breakage and foreign matter. Produc-
tion costs are, per quintal, about US$6 to US$8 for rice, US$6 for sorghum,
US$5.5 to US$7.5 for corn, and US$13 to US$18 for beans. However, they
vary substantially according to the region and the technology used. Retail
prices are controlled by the Government. Ceilings are fixed at levels allowing
for purchasing costs from the farmer at CNP-guaranteed prices and for distri-
bution mark-up not to exceed, according to products, 18% to 23%.  Retail prices
have increased in proportion to producers' prices.
Other Crops
6.06      Although Costa Rica imports almost all its cotton requirements, most
of its very limited production has traditionally been exported. Prices for
locally produced cotton are not expected to differ from average international
prices for similar types of fiber and should remain at about US$0.65 per lb
of raw cotton (in 1976 constant prices). Cassava is an expanding crop with
export potential, benefiting from the high international cereal grain prices,
since it can be substituted for grains used in feed formulations. National
annual yields per hectare average close to 7 m tons, with the prospect of
considerably higher levels as cultivation practices improve.  Producers' prices
are about ¢ 0.36 per kg (US$0.04). Besides coffee, a whole range of tree
crops can be grown economically in Costa Rica, the most common being plantain,
cocoa, citrus and mango. Domestic demand is expanding rapidly and Costa Rica
is currently importing US$3 million worth of fruit and fruit preparations.
Coffee and bananas are Costa Rica's major sources of foreign exchange earnings,
with currently high prices.
C.   Producer Benefits
6.07      Incomes of farmers from the enterprises to be financed under the
project would increase significantly, as shown below:

Results indicate that, except for permanent crops, the mnodels are particularly
sensitive to reduction in sales receipts. However, farmgate prices for
grains are guaranteed by Government and those for milk are controlled, so that
farmers have some protection against adverse price movements. Prices of meat
and sugarcane are more subject to fluctuations on the world market. However,
the proportion of production consumed domestically is large so producers are
provided with a relatively stable market for a substantial nart of their
output.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed project would be of major importance to Costa Rica as
it would contribute to increased production of both crops and livestock pro-
ducts for domestic consumption and exports, which would improve the national
balance of payments. In addition, at full development, the project could gen-
erate incremental tax returns amounting to about US$1.0 million per year. The
agricultural credit and extension service components would assist farmers to
increase their productivity and thus their income levels, while the seed
program component would lead to higher crop yields as a result of increased
availability of improved seeds. Incremental employment created would be
equivalent to 2,400 full-time annual jobs. The reeder road component, besides
serving as a pilot scheme for the establishment of the CRIO in other parts of
the country, would provide better access to markets for crop and dairy pro-
ducers within the region specifically selected for this project. The regional
rural development study is expected to lead to the preparation of a compre-
hensive rural development project and strengthen the institutional capacity
of OFIPLAN in the field of project preparation.
7.02      The economic rate of return of the agricultural credit and the seed
and extension service components, accounting together for over 90% of project
costs, is estimated to be about 16%. Several sensitivity calculations have
been made and in no case does the estimated economic rate of return fall
below 11%. The economic rate of return for the feeder road component alone,
which is the only one that is not nationwide in scope, is estimated to be
13%. The economic rate of return measuring incremental benefits of the
agricultural credit and feeder road components (with necessary deductions to
avoid double counting since farms served by the roads may also be subloan
beneficiaries) against the costs of all project components except the rural
development study and investment in agro-industries and services is estimated
at 16%. Detailed calculations of these rates of return and sensitivity
calculations are given in Annex 10.
Risk
7.03      The economic viability of farming operations in Costa Rica is heavily
dependent on domestic and export prices and the wieather conditions. The tech-
nical assistance and improved seeds to be provided under the project would help
improve the quality and hence the marketability ot farm output and thus con-
tribute to reducing financial risks to producers.



- 27 -
The Government's policy is to encourage the production of food for domestic
consumption, and the projections for exported beef and sugar are favorable.
Also, recent Government agricultural pricing policies have been effective in
encouraging food production and, at negotiations, assurance was obtained that
the Government will afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange
views with it concerning the maintenance of economically sound price policies
which provide incentives to farmers.
7.04      None of the activities financed under the project are expected to
have an adverse impact on the environment. IAG has an effective system of
licensing and controlling the use of chemicals, and use of parathion on grains
and chlorinated hydrocarbons on pastures is prohibited.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a) by March 1, 1978, a region for the development study would be

months after the close of each fiscal year (para 5.12);
(n)  monitoring systems acceptable to the Bank would be estab-
lished by the DCD and OFIPLAN and submitted to the Bank
by March 1, 1978 (para 5.13); and

to exchange views with it concerning the maintenance of
economically sound price policies which provide adequate
incentives to farmers (para 7.03).
8.02      Conditions of disbursement under certain project components would be
as follows: (a) under the seed program, that the National Seed Program, in-
cluding a timetable for work, satisfactory to the Bank, had been finalized,
and that a subsidiary contract, satisfactory to the Bank, had been signed by
Government and CNP (para 5.05); (b) under the feeder road component, that the
Government, IFAU, and the Municipal Council of Perez Zeledon had signed an
agreement satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.06; and (c) under the agricultural
credit component, that the Central Bank had signed a subsidiary loan agree-
ment, satisfactory to the Bank, with at least one of the participating banks
(para 5.11).
8.03      With the indicated assurances obtained, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$18 million for a period of 17 years, includ-
ing 3-1/2 years of grace.

ANNEX 1

COSTA RICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Agricultural Sector
General Features
1.        The agricultural sector is the most important in the Costa Rican
economy. Over the past five years, it has accounted for 21% of GDP and 74%
of total merchandise export earnings and employed 36% of the country's labor
force. Out of a total area of 5.1 million ha, 3.1 million ha is occupied by
77,000 farms (1973). However, only 2.1 million ha are actually used for crop
production and livestock raising (Table 1). The country is divided into three
main zones, each with its own agricultural production system:
(a) The Central Highlands (Meseta Central). The Central Highlands
rise to altitudes of up to 3,800 m. The climate is temperate
and annual rainfall is between 2,000 mm and 3,000 mm (mostly in
September-October, followed by a two- to five-month dry season
between December and April). This area was the first settled,
where population has remained concentrated, and where agricul-
tural production started. Farms are small, 17 ha on average,
and derive their main income from coffee, sugarcane, livestock
raising for beef and milk (71% of the dairy herd produces two-
thirds of total milk production), fruit and vegetables. The
Meseta Central accounts for one-third of the total number of
farms. Infrastructure is well developed and access is easy to
the large markets of the four main cities.
(b) The Pacific Lowlands. This zone has a climate that ranges from
wet sub-tropical in the south (Puntarenas, Valle del General)
to dry tropical in the North (Guanacaste). Rainfall averages
1,500 mm to 2,500 mm per year, with a five-months dry season,
in the north, and 2,500 mm to 6,500 mm, with a two to four months
dry season in the south. Since the 1930s, this has been an area
of strong penetration by settlers. Half of the farms are located
there, accounting for 65% of the country's total pasture area
and 73% of the annual crop area. This is an area of extensive
livestock raising for meat production and of rainfed production
of basic grains (rice, corn, beans, sorghum), and some export
crops (all the pineapple area, 32% of the country's banana area
and, 20% of the sugarcane area are located there). Because of
the difficult access to markets and sources of input (mostly due
to the lack of sufficient roads) and the lack of supplemental
irrigation in drought-prone areas, much of the potential of this
zone is still to be exploited. The unused potential is esti-
mated at some 265,000 ha for crops and 76,000 ha for intensive
livestock raising.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
(c) The Atlantic and Northern Lowlands. The plains along the
Atlantic Coast and, in the northern part of the country, up
to the border with Nicaragua, are in the wet tropical zone
and receive well distributed rainfall ranging from 3,000 mm
to 6,000 mm. Banana plantations (20,160 ha) in the
province of Limon, provide employment for 20,000 laborers.
The Northern Plains can still be considered as an agricul-
tural frontier zone, accounting for 16% of the country's
pasture area and 32% of its forests. The land has been
partly occupied by large ranchers raising beef cattle
extensively but it is estimated that some 350,000 ha more
could be used for livestock. The Atlantic Plains have
good cropping potential (some 150,000 ha) but develop-
ment is constrained by the lack of communications and
poor drainage.
Land Distribution and Land Use
2.        Costa Rica is still in the process of expanding its agricultural
frontier, with some 450,000 ha added to the agricultural land during the
10-year inter-census period (1963-73) (Table 1). Because of the lack of
incentive in the past to produce non-export foodstuffs (para 3), the land
devoted to crops has dropped by almost 100,000 ha, but the pasture area has
increased by more than 600,000 ha, about 40% of which has been improved to
various degrees. Most of the expansion has taken place on the dry Pacific
Coast (Guanacaste) and in the Northern Plains of the country, but the new
lands have not altered the land tenure structure, which displays a consider-
able concentration of ownership. In 1973, 3.5% of the farmers owned close to
55% of total farmland in holdings of more than 200 ha, while, at the other end
of the scale, 70% of farmers operated 8% of the land in holdings of less than
20 ha (Table 2). However, more than half the farms in this latter category
cultivate coffee, often as the main cash crop, which provides to the majority
of them an income above the relative poverty level as defined by the Bank.
Overall Performance of the Sector and Government Strategy
3.        The sector achieved a growth rate of more than 7% per year in
volume in the late 1960s but the pace slowed down in the early 1970s to an
average of 4.1% per year (1970 to 1975). Until recently, performance has
been geared to exports, with a dramatic expansion in output and export of
bananas, sugar and beef taking place from 1965 to 1973. But production of
food for the domestic market, particularly grains, beans, and milk, do not
meet requirements. This came about because Government has long devoted most
of its resources and staff to research and technical assistance for improve-
ments in the production of export commodities, particularly coffee, sugar-
cane and cattle raising. These activities were also given priority by the
Central Bank in the allocation of credit from the National Banking System
(Annex 2).
4.        Balance of payment difficulties, the need to diversify the economy
away from a few export products and the world grain shortage in 1972/73,



ANNEX 1
Page 3
however, led the Government to revise its policies regarding milk, sugar,
grains and beans. Further encouragement for their production came when the
Government that took office in May 1974 put more emphasis on small farmers, who
are, except for rice, important producers of these commodities. Without turning
away from its policies aimed at strengthening and improving the export sub-
sector, Government has since 1974 directed its attention to increasing milk
production (retail price ceilings that has been held at the same level for
several years were almost doubled in 1974 and 1975) and to designing a compre-
hensive program to achieve self-sufficiency in basic grains (corn, beans, rice
and sorghum) by 1978. Also, most relevant to the agricultural sector is a
recently started Family Welfare Program (Programa de Desarrollo Social y
Asignaciones Familiares), which includes direct distribution of food to pre-
school and school-age children in schools and nutrition centers. The goal of
the food distribution sub-program is to reach 62% of these children by 1980.
Impact on demand for food will thus be quite substantial since the program
requirements in 1976 represent 10% of normal consumption of milk and milk
products. By 1980 this percentage would be 18%. The program will also have
substantial effect on demand for fish, cocoa and sugar products, vegetables,
fruit and fats. Emphasis under the proposed project would therefore be placed
on expanding and improving the production systems of traditional commodities
such as milk and meat, together with sugar, grains and beans, cassava, fruit
and vegetables.
Traditional Export Crops
5.        Coffee has traditionally been Costa Rica's major source of agricul-
tural export earnings, equalled only recently by bananas. It is estimated
that as much as one-third of the population depend in part, or totally, on the
production of coffee. However, during the last 15 years, the area used for
production has increased only slightly because of increased urbanization,
Government efforts at diversification, shortage of labor during harvest, high
wages, and slowly increasing export quotas. Yields have nevertheless increased
by some 4% per year (Tables 3 and 4). Marketing prospects are expected to
remain very favorable during the next two or three years, but the Government
does not intend to encourage new plantings as prices are expected to fall
back in line with their traditional levels later on. Coffee growers receive
around two-thirds of the total short-term credit available for agricultural
crops and they are further helped by the Coffee Board (Oficina del Cafe), a
public agency involved in the determination of export and domestic quotas, the
allocation of production quotas, the regulation of producers' prices, and the
provision of credit and technical assistance.
6.        Costa Rica is also the second largest exporter of bananas in the
world, a crop that has recently equalled coffee as the largest source of
foreign exchange earnings. Banana is grown in the South Pacific and the
Atlantic Coasts. Unlike the situation in other Central American countries,
a relatively large share of total production is in the hands of domestic pro-
ducers. In 1973, bananas accounted for one-third of exports and half of the
cultivated area. Government is little involved in the production and market-
ing of the product as producers have long-term.marketing arrangements with
foreign companies. The Banana Growers Association (ASBANA), created a few



ANNEX 1
Page 4
years ago, provides domestic independent producers with technical assistance,
bulk purchasing of inputs, and long-term subsidized credit to help bridge the
efficiency gap between their operations and those of foreign-owned plantations.
Foreign companies with banana operations include subsidiaries of United Brands,
Standard Fruit and Del Monte.
Grains and beans
7.        I'ntil recently, Costa Rica favored consumer-oriented policies fea-
turing cheap staple food and it allowed prices to producers to be adjusted to
the value of cheaper imports of corn and beans.  As a result, cultivated areas
and production of corn and beans steadily declined (Tables 3 and 4). Rice
is efficiently produced on the Pacific Coast under rainfed conditions and is
sold locally and exported. It is the only grain crop produced in excess of
domestic consumption requirements. Sorghum is grown in association with rice,
and its production, still small, is encouraged for corn substitution in animal
feed. World grain shortages in 1972 and 1973 and drought in Costa Rica in
1972 resulted in a dangerous depletion of stocks and expensive imports.
Partly in reaction to this, the Government in 1975 started implementation of
a National Program of Basic Grains, aiming at self-sufficiency in corn, beans,
sorghum and rice by 1978. The program consists of setting much higher
guaranteed support prices on consignments purchased from producers by the
National Production Council (CNP), the Government marketing agency (para 26);
providing subsidized guaranteed short-term production credit and technical
assistance; and instituting import and export licensing. Between the agri-
cultural years 1973/74 and 1975/76, support prices practically doubled for
rice, corn and sorghum and increased by 165% for beans. The percentage of
total production bought by CNP increased from 19% in 1974/75 to 38% in 1975/76
and would have been more than 60% in 1976/77 if the drought had not destroyed
80%O of the rice crop and a still unknown proportion of the other grain crops
(Table 5).
8.        Marketing of basic grains other than through CNP is done through
normal commercial channels. For many basic food products, commercial mark-ups
by wholesalers and retailers are limited by law to 10% and 12%, respectively.
Retail price ceilings are fixed by the Ministry of Economy. From mid-1973
to mid-1976, retail price ceilings (and actual prices) increased in proportion
with producers' prices, by 164% for beans and 98% for corn. Rice prices have
increased by about 60%, as has the general consumers' price index (Table 6).
Costa Rica's requirement for import and export licensing is in conflict with the
regulations of the Central American Common Market calling for free circulation
of grains within the common market (Limon Protocol), although the Protocol has
been inoperative for several years. Almost all imports of grains and beans,
however, have traditionally come from countries outside the Common Market area.
9.        Production costs per quintal average US$6 to US$8 for rice, US$6 for
sorghum, US$5.5 to US$7.5 for corn and US$13 to US$18 for beans, to be compared
with CNP guaranteed prices of US$14.6, US$7, US$8.8 and US$26.3, respectively,
for the 1976/77 crop year. Price incentives for the production of rice, which
is undertaken mostly by large farmers, have been excessive. Marginal areas
have been put into cultivation and there is now an oversupply which is



ANNEX 1
Page 5
difficult sell now on the world market. The Government is aware of this
situation and has taken steps to reduce the support price of rice (the price
quoted above is already 12% lower than in 1975/76). Also, marginal areas
should be progressively phased out of production and adequate supplies main-
tained at a lower cost to CNP by encouraging productivity increases in the
best suited areas. The credit component of the project would help in this
respect.
10.        On the other hand, the increase in the price of beans, although
considerable, has been an insufficient incentive for the farmers to put sub-
stantially more of the commodity on the market. Beans are mostly produced on
small- and medium-size farms where the potential for area expansion is limited
and productivity increases are hampered by inadequate cultivation practices
and bad quality seeds.
11.        It is not clear whether or not Costa Rica has a comparative dis-
advantage in the production of corn and beans. They are produced all over
the country but growing conditions, and therefore production costs, differ
substantially among its many ecological zones. In addition, in some of them,
climatic conditions, compounded by remoteness from markets and lack of ade-
quate road infrastructure, do not leave many alternatives to farmers, whatever
prices are offered. Production cost per quintal could be substantially re-
duced if improved seeds, better cultivation practices and modern inputs which
would increase yields substantially were made available to them. Corn and
bean growers would benefit mostly from the seeds and technical assistance
components of the project. Some complementary investments (such as grain
handling and storage equipment) would be financed out of the credit component
to help farmers to meet CNP standards of breakage, humidity and foreign
matter. But most credit requirements for this type of farmer are of a
short-term nature and they can be met from other sources.
Sugarcane
12.       Sugarcane is produced mostly in the central and northern areas of
the country. In 1973, 55% of producers operated farms less than 10 ha in size
and accounted for 12% of production, while 13% accounted for 72% of production
on farms above 50 ha. Production has increased considerably over the past
decade (6% to 8% per year), particularly during the 1960s, because of new
export opportunities to the US following the exclusion of Cuba from this mar-
ket. Yields of sugar are about 5 m tons per ha, compared with 6 m tons in
the Philippines, rainfed, non-mechanized, and 7.7 m tons in Peru, irrigated
and partially mechanized. In spite of past improvements, cultivating prac-
tices are still inadequate on some 70% of the cultivated area. Production
costs of sugar in Costa Rica average US$0.12 per lb, compared with an average
US$0.13 in less developed countries and US$0.14 to US$0.16 in developed
countries. Twenty-eight plants are operating with a total installed annual
capacity of 235,000 m tons of sugar but seldom are operations at more than 70%
of capacity. Too many antiquated plants are operating in the Central Valley,
while in other areas mills are built in anticipation of an expansion in
cultivated areas, although such expansion is slow to take place because of
poor transport facilities.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
13.       Domestic utilization has been increasing by 8% per year and absorbs
about 60% of total production. Consumption of sugar per capita (55 kg per
year) ½s one of the highest in the world, about equal to that of the US.
This exceptional level has resulted from very low retail prices, held by the
Government at ¢ 0.55 per lb (US$0.064) from 1955 to 1974. Only in 1974 was
the ceiling raised to ¢ 0.74 per lb and then to ¢ 1.0 per lb in 1975 (US$0.12),
which still just allows producers to recover their costs. Expansion and mar-
keting services are provided by the Sugarcane League, a public sector insti-
tution, which fixes yearly production quotas for sugar mills and farmers and
regulates producer prices on the basis of a weighted average between export
and domestic prices. Profits depend on international prices and their fluc-
tuations. In 1974, the export price (FOB) of sugar was US$0.16 per lb and in
1975, US$0.35; but in 1976, the price fell to about US$0.10. Provided
Government keeps domestic prices at levels that at least cover production
costs, prospects for the sugar industry are good. Assuming an annual rate of
increase in domestic consumption of 6% and in world imports of 3.5%, demand
should grow by at least 5.5% per year. Average production growth from 1966
to 1970 was 5% but only 2% from 1970-75.
14.       The project would help finance new plantings and replantings with
improved varieties together with investments such as transportation equipment
and on-farm roads.
Cotton
15.       Cotton growing for export expanded during the 1960s in the dry
Pacific area but did not develop beyond a maximum of 8,700 ha. A combination
of natural disasters (volcanic eruption in 1967, followed by drought in 1968),
unfavorable prices, and pest problems led to an almost complete disappearance
of cotton in 1970/71, but from then up to 1975, cultivation has slowly resumed
on about 800 ha.  During the past four years, progress has been made in cul-
tivation practices and pest control, and the good prices in the last two years
have attracted farmers back to the crop until the area occupied in 1976 reached
about 3,000 ha.  Yields over the past four crop years have been 650 kg of
cotton lint per ha. Government has a limited target of 8,000 ha in well
selected areas of the Guanacaste province, although cotton could be grown
under good conditions on as much as 20,000 ha. Government provides technical
assistance and facilitates the provision of production credit to farmers
willing to engage in this activity. Cotton is one of the crops given priority
in credit allocations by the National Banking System. Although past produc-
tion has been mostly exported, substitution of imports of cotton lints and
cotton raw fabrics alone would justify plantings on some 5,000 ha (at current
yields) and there is little doubt that the domestic market could absorb all
the incremental production of 8,000 ha by 1985, particularly if new increases
in oil prices weaken the competitive position of synthetic fibers. Export
prospects are also reasonably good as world prices are expected to remain at
around US$0.65 per lb (in constant 1976 prices). The proposed project would
provide financing for about 20% of the targeted area and also for cotton gins,
under the line of credit to agro-industries. At the international prices
projected by the Bank Commodity Division, rates of return to farmers would
be attractive at about 20%.

Beef Production
16.       Total cattle population in 1973 was 1.7 million head, with almost
90% used for extensive production of beef. The herd is growing at almost 5%
per year and so is the pasture area. The most common cattle are cross-
breeds of the Zebu type, mainly Brahman, Indo-Brazil, Gir and Nellore. The
carrying capacity of pastures is low, about 0.8 AU per ha. About 40% of
total pasture area is cultivated or improved to various degrees. There
is a marked concentration of the beef herd on the Pacific Coast (almost 60%
in Guanacaste and Puntarenas) and in the Northern Plains (22%) on farms
larger than 100 ha.
17.       Strong impetus has been given to beef production by the opportun-
ities of export to the US, the volume of which has increased from some 8,000 m
tons of boneless meat in the early 1960s to 30,400 m tons in 1975 (Table 7).
Costa Rica now provides about 5% of US meat imports in dollar terms. Export
prices went up by 50% from 1970 to 1973 before they fell by 17% during 1974
and 1975 as a result of the downturn in the beef cycle and of world reces-
sion. Prices, however, started rising again in 1976 and the market should
strengthen in 1977. International prices are expected to increase in real
terms by about 25% in 1978 and 1.8% per year thereafter until 1985.
18.       Domestic consumption accounts for about 40% of total meat produced.
Annual consumption per capita has steadily declined from 20 kg in 1955 to 14 kg
in 1974. Good returns on exported meat have led to insufficient supplies and
high prices on the domestic market, even though culled cows provide most of it.
Beef producers are organized in associations (camaras) that handle sales to
packing plants. CNP formerly acted as an intermediary between these associa-
tions and the packing plants but now it only regulates exports in order to
insure at least minimum domestic supplies. The retention quota for domestic
consumption is usually 5% to 8% but can go up to 15% of fat steers normally
intended for export. Moreover, since 1974, Government has instituted ceilings
on the retail prices of almost every cut and they have remained unchanged. In
spite of this last measure, domestic consumption per capita has not increased
because incomes have been eroded by recent high inflation levels.
Milk
19.       Dairy breeds (mainly Jersey, Holstein and Guernsey mostly, but also
Brown Swiss and Ayrshire) account for only about 8% of cows and heifers. Some
84% of the dairy herd is concentrated in the Central Highlands, around the
four main cities, where it produces 77% of the country's total milk production.
About 75% of the dairy herd is on farms with less than 100 ha. Yields vary
according to areas, usually running to 1,350 liters per lactation (300 days)
in the Northern part of the country to 2,550 liters in some parts of the
Meseta Central. Production increased during the past decade in the well suited
areas around the four main cities, at an average rate of 6% annually in spite
of past unfavorable producer prices. However, retail price ceilings for fluid
milk, previously held to ¢ 0.88 per bottle (US$0.19 per liter), were raised to
¢ 1.20 in 1974 and then to ¢ 1.65 per bottle (US$0.28 per liter) in 1975.



NEX 1
Page 8
Producer prices for raw milk in 1976 were ¢ 1.45 per bottle in the San Jose
Area (US$0.25 Der liter), which is attractive to producers. Retail prices,
controlled by Government, however, remain reasonable to consumers at US$0.29
per liter of whole fluid milk.
20.       Costa Rica produces 90% to 95% of its dairy products requirements.
Consumption per capita, which is presently about 135 kg per year, is growing
at 1.7% per annum. Demand is expected to go up by about 6% per annum, not
including requirements from the new Family Welfare Program (para 4) which
should increase this annual rate by some 2.5 percentage points up to 1980.
21.       There are three important cooperative dairy processing plants in
Costa Rica, all located on the Central Highlands. Because of the 3mall mark-up
allowed between producer and consumer prices, there is no net Drofit on the
sales of whole fluid milk. The profit comes from the sale of butter and cream
and on the 30% of raw milk supply processed into other dairy products. Com-
petition among the three plants for milk collection is strong.
Support Services
22.       The provision of technical assistance, credit and marketing services
has been institutionalized for many years and is characterized by the large
number of institutions involved. The National Agricultural Council (CAN)
plans overall agricultural development programs and coordinates the activities
of all the public agencies concerned with such development. All of these
agencies are represented on the CAN. It does not, however, have legal author-
ity to enforce its recommendations. Specialized commodity organizations
handle marketing and sometimes technical assistance and credit to producers of
export products. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), besides
performirng its primary functions of formulating sector policies, is responsible
for overseeing research, experimentation and technical assistance. Involvement
of the national banking system in the provision of credit is described in
Annex 2. Other relevant institutions are the Institute for Land and Coloniza-
tion (ITCO) in charge of purchase and distribution of land for agrarian reform
purposes, and the Institute for Development of Cooperatives (INFOCOOP).
Research
23.       Most agricultural research in Costa Rica is carried out by MAG.
Crop research is the responsibility of the Department of Agricultural Research
(Direccion General de Investigaciones Agricolas) which operates two stations
for its programs. One is located in a wet tropical area on the Atlantic
Coast ("Los Diamantes") and the other on the Dry Pacific Coast, in Guanacaste
("Enrique Jimenez Nunez"). Livestock research is the responsibility of the
Livestock Department (Direccion de Ganaderia), which also works in the same
two stations. Most livestock research, however, is carried out at the Meseta
Central ("El Alto") station, which specializes in this field. Budgetary con-
straints (annual budgetary appropriations are around 0 8 million, or US$0.9
million) and lack of well defined priorities account for the present general



ANNEX 1
Page 9
weakness of Government research, particularly in basic grains. Records are
best in coffee and sugarcane. The University of Costa Rica also operates a
station on the Meseta Central ("Fabio Baudrit"), mostly to provide university
students with a testing ground for their theses, but facilities are poor and
the budget is limited. Finally, the Agronomical Center for Research and
Teaching (CATIE) performs research at its Turrialba station but its activi-
ties provide little backing to the Costa Rican national research programs.
Extension Services
24.       MAG is the main public institution in charge of providing extension
services to farmers and substantial efforts have been made over the last 10
years to improve coverage and efficiency. Eight regional centers (CARs), ad-
ministratively reporting to the Vice-Minister for Operations, have been set
up and they, in turn, operate 59 extension agencies with a total staff of 336:
50 specialists, 59 extension agents, 94 assistants and 133 support personnel,
twice the number in 1967 when operations started. Over 90% of this staff
works outside the San Jose headquarters, and facilities and equipment were
greatly improved in the early 1970s with the financial assistance of IDB
and USAID. The annual budget grew from ¢ 3 million in 1967 to ¢ 16 million
(US$0.3 million to US$1.9 million) in 1976. Commodity organizations (paras 5,
6 and 7) have their own specialized staff and banks employ 80 graduate agri-
culturalists to help farmers in preparation and supervision of loans.
25.       In each region, the Director of CAR presides over the meetings of
the CANCITO, a coordinating body similar to CAN at the national level.
CANCITOs are made up of representatives of the various agencies involved in
the sector: CAR, banks, CNP, INFOCOOP and ITCO, and farmers' associations
and cooperatives. They formulate regional development programs and projects,
which are submitted to CAN for approval, and they coordinate the activities
of the agencies involved in specific programs and projects and in technical
assistance generally. Similar bodies exist at the county level in about half
the counties (Comites Agropecuarios Cantonales = CAC) as well as from some
23 Local Development Councils sponsored by the Institute for Assistance to
Municipal Governments (IFAM). Like CAN, they do not have the authority to
impose their recommendations on the constituting agencies, but they do provide
a framework for discussion and planning at the local level and would act as
coordinating agents of the credit and technical assistance components of the
project.
Marketing Services
26.       CNP has been operating as an autonomous public institution since
1956. Its major functions are to stabilize producer and consumer prices of
major food items through market intervention and to promote agricultural
production. Its staff of 2,500 is involved in a wide range of activities,
including price regulation of grains through purchases, storage, sales and
direct imports and exports; import and export licensing for grains and beef;
production, purchase and sale of seeds and other agricultural inputs; opera-
tion of a machinery pool for lease to farmers; and operation of 109 retail



ANNEX 1
Page 10
stores throughout the country, a national slaughterhouse (Montecillo), and a
national liquor factory. CNP operates the main storage facilities in Costa
Rica--eight plants (four warehouses and four silos) with a total capacity
of 52,000 m tons--and about 2,600 m3 are available for meat and fresh product
conservation in 16 refrigeration chambers. CNP agents purchase agricultural
production from 47 collection points. Handling equipment and storage capacity
has become insufficient, however, as volumes of grain production are rapidly
increasing. Thus, by March 31, 1976, CNP had to provide storage for 97,000 m
tons of grains, including 53,000 m tons of rice, requiring emergency measures.
27.       CNP has recently suffered heavy losses on its grain purchases and
storage and sales operations (around ¢ 400 million, or US$47 million accumulated
since 1974), brought on by the excessively high-priced beans and corn that were
imported in 1974 to make up for the bad 1972 and 1973 crops which substan-
tially reduced levels of stocks. Sluggish consumption of beans resulting from
much increased retail prices, relatively abundant 1974/75 and 1975/76 crops,
lack of sufficient storage facilities and mismanagement resulted in a deterio-
ration of stocks which compelled CNP to sell at half the initial purchasing
prices. Other heavy losses have recently been incurred on Government rice
purchases: exports of surpluses are made difficult by present gluts on the
world market and the grain deteriorates because of insufficient drying and bad
storage conditions. With the financial assistance of the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), handling and storage facilities are
being built that will double present CNP capacity by 1980. CNP's new manage-
ment is in the process of requesting financial help from the Central Govern-
ment to write off these unprecedented, but hopefully exceptional, commercial
losses and has taken steps to reduce producer support prices for rice in order
to avoid such surpluses in the future.
Crop Insurance
28.       A subsidized scheme for crop insurance, to be administered by the
National Insurance Institute (INS), was created by law in 1970. It is funded
by premiums paid by the farmers, 10% of the net profits of INS and of the
banking system, and a Government allocation of 10% of the tax levied on bank
profits. Some 2,000 policies were issued in 1976, almost exclusively in
the provinces of Guanacaste and Puntarenas with the total value of coverage
amounting to more than ¢ 200 million (US$23 million). About 70% of insured
farmers operate farms of less than 25 ha. Over 90% of the policies and
insured amounts cover rice and sorghum production (40% to 45% of areas under
these crops), while the rest are for corn and cotton. Premiums average 5% of
coverage, including direct production costs up to a maximum of 50% to 70% of
the normal crop value as estimated annually by INS for each crop and each
region in the program. Policies can be used as collateral for short-term
production credit in areas and for activities included in the scheme and
farmers are encouraged to buy insurance when they apply for such credit. The
crop insurance scheme does not cover costs of long- and medium-term invest-
ments or livestock. Purebred livestock is insured by INS under a different
scheme at commercial terms. At the end of 1975, total coverage for livestock
was about ¢ 3 million, distributed among some 600 policies. Losses from crop



ANNEX 1
Page 11
failure can be substantial. The 1976 drought alone is expected to cause a
loss of ¢ 100 million (US$11.7 million), net of premiums paid, and 60% will
be financed by a special issue of Government bonds. As drought has occurred
every four or five years for the past 15 years, agricultural insurance finan-
cing may have to be revised unless INS expands the scheme to include new
activities and areas, thus diversifying its portfolio from rice cultivation
in the drought-prone Guanacaste province.

COSTA RICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Banking System and Agricultural Credit
A. General
1.        The National Banking System (Sistema Baneario Nacional - SBN) com-
prises the Central Bank of Costa Rica (CB) and four Government-owned commer-
cial banks--Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR), Banco de Costa Rica (BCR),
Banco Anglo Costarricense (BAC), and Banco de Credito Agricola de Cartago
(BCAC). Five commercial banks, which operate outside the SBN, although sub-
ject to Central Bank control, are not permitted to accept deposits from the
domestic private sector and do not lend significantly for agriculture. The
major part of agricultural credit is supplied by the banks comprising the
National Banking System although a reportedly substantial amount, mainly of
a seasonal nature, is provided by agricultural input suppliers, rural stores,
cooperative money lenders and fidueiary warehouses.
B. The Central Bank
2.        The Central Bank was established in 1950 prior to which central
banking functions were performed by the Issuing Department of BNCR, the
Largest of the commercial banks. CB performs regular central bank functions,
and, in particular, it is required to: (a) promote the development of the
Costa Rican economy; (b) promote monetary stability and a sound financial
structure in the country; and (c) maintain the external stability of the
national currency. An amendment, dated October 1970, to CB's organic law
stipulates that CB is obliged to prevent any decline in production because of
a lack of credit and to promote the diversification of national production to
strengthen the balance of payments position of the country. Other specific
duties of CB are to:
(a) determine the interest rates for all operations of the SBN;
(b) establish limits on the volume of lending and investments of
the SBN; and
(c) maintain a department for a General Auditor of Banks to supervise
and control the operations of the various departments of CB and
of the commercial banks.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Organization
3.        The Central Bank of Costa Rica is an autonomous institution and is
governed by a Board of Directors of eight members headed by an Executive
President who is appointed by the Council of Government. The Minister of
Finance, the Minister of Economy, Industry and Commerce and the Director of
the National Planning Office (who has ministerial rank) are ex-oficio members
of the Board. The commercial banks have two representatives appointed by
the Council of Government from lists of three submitted by the banks and,
in addition, the Council of Government appoints two members from the private
sector who have broad financial and economic experience. Under the Executive
President, day-to-day operations of the CB are controlled by a Manager and
Deputy Manager who are appointed by the Board.
4.        CB has a department under the Board of Directors responsible for
auditing its other departments and the commercial banks. Below the Manager
there are five departments--Administration, Accounting, Development Credit,
Foreign Commerce and Economic Studies--as well as a General Secretariat and
a Treasury Office.
5.        The Development Credit Department (DCD) is primarily responsible for
administration of the two earlier Bank-financed agricultural credit projects
and would be responsible for administration of the agricultural credit compo-
nent under this project. In addition, it (a) supervises the execution of
credit programs financed by USAID and other foreign institutions; (b) reviews
and approves selected investment projects or subprojects financed by the SBN;
(c) provides technical assistance to banks and beneficiaries participating
in credit projects; (d) compiles statistics and reports concerning programs
under its administration; (e) carries out economic studies related to the
agricultural and industrial sectors; and (f) advises the CB Manager in sub-
jects related to foreign-financed projects.
6.        The DCD is headed by a Director who is responsible to the Manager
of CB. It has seven sections, staffed, at present, by 30 university graduates
and 14 other employees. The existing staff is adequate to carry out the res-
ponsibilities which the Department would have under the proposed project.
Credit Regulations
7.        CB is empowered to establish quantitative and qualitative controls
on the lending activities of the banking system in its broadest sense to in-
clude private finance companies. At present, however, such controls are
exercised only on the commercial banks, including those outside the SBN. Re-
placing an earlier, more complicated system, which had placed credit ceilings,
in absolute terms, on each bank branch office, CB, in 1971, adopted a new one
which operates within the framework of the annual monetary budget. The pre-
sent system, by specifying the sectorial composition of the banks' portfolio
by percentages, aims at directing financing resources towards those sectors
of the economy which have been given high priority; this has resulted in the



ANNEX 2
Page 3
channeling of credit towards the production and export sectors of the economy.
Since 1972, CB has operated its credit control system by placing ceilings on
the total lending volume of individual banks in addition to the sectorial
restriction and has subjected each bank's portfolio and program to quarterly
review.
C. State Commercial Banks
General
8.        The four commercial banks of the National Banking System (Sistema
Bancario Nacional - SBN) have each been in existence for more than 50 years.
Banco Anglo Costarricense (BACR) was established in 1863, Banco de Costa Rica
(BCR) in 1877, Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) in 1914 and Banco Credito
Agricola de Cartago (BCAC) in 1918. BNCR was established as a Government-
owned bank while the others, originally privately owned, were taken over by
the State in 1948.
Organization and Management
9.        The banks are governed by Boards of Directors according to the
general policy and administrative procedures set up under the organic law
establishing the SBN. The Board of Directors of each bank is composed of
seven members, all of whom are appointed by the Council of Government for a
period of eight years. Under the Board of Directors, the day-to-day operations
of each bank are the responsibility of a General Manager who is appointed by
the Board for a six-year term. The organic law which governs the SBN requires
that the Board of Directors of each bank shall appoint a Credit Committee, com-
prising the General Manager, the managers of departments and the head of the
credit unit. The Board of Directors also assigns individual loan limits to
senior staff.
10.       The four banks of the SBN each have a commercial department through
which they make loans to agriculture, industry and commerce and a Mortgage
Department, which provides loans for real estate transactions. Each of the
banks also operates a "Financiera," which is subject to less strict control
with regard to interest rates payable and chargeable than the Commercial and
Mortgage Departments. However, the iending activities of the Financieras are
relatively small and limited principally to short-term commercial and
personal loans.
11.       As of June 1976, the banking system had a total of 236 bank offices
in the country, out of which 77 were in the capital city of San Jose. Located
at the capitals of the seven provinces, there are 35 branches (sucursales),
which are main offices, with local credit committees that may authorize loans
for up to ¢ 500,000. Other offices under the responsibility of the branches
are called agencies, Juntas Rurales (para 12), or bank offices, most of which



ANNEX 2
Page 4
may authorize loans for up to ¢ 100,000. The four state-owned banks employ
over 3,000 people, of whom 290 are qualified as technical; these include,
among vataI.ols disciplines, 80 graduate agriculturalists.  The four banks are
well organized and operate according to sound banking practices. They all
have experience in agricultural credit, and their standards of operations
and accomplishments are above the Latin American average.
12.       Rural Credit Department.  BNCR has had, practically since its incep-
tion in 1914, a special department to deal with small farmer credit. This
department, the Department of Rural Credit, operates through 72 Agricultural
Credit Rural Boards (Juntas Rurales de Credito Agricola), which are decentral-
ized bank offices located strategically throughout the country. The credit
operations of each Junta Rural is decided upon by a board (Junta Directora)
comprising three farmers from the neighborhood of the Juntas Rurales office.
The office is under the charge of a Manager, usually an agricultural tech-
nician, supported by such administrative staff as necessary. During the
1960s, BACR, BCR, and BCAC established Small Farmer Credit Offices (Oficinas
de Credito al Pequeno Agricultor) with a basic organization similar to that of
the Juntas Rurales.
13.       Audi,.  All the participating banks are subject to audit by the
Auditor General of Banks, who is appointed by the Board of Directors of the
Central Bank. The Auditor General's office is staffed by professional finan-
cial analysts and auditors and their work is conducted both by program visits
or interim audits and by a number of unscheduled visits to the various depart-
ments and branches of the banks. The report sets out full details of the
financial condition of the banks and also lists field visits made by audit
staff, including visits to borrowers of the commercial banks. The report
dces not contain any adverse comments regarding management deficiencies or
defalcations but reference is made to detailed reports made throughout the
year which are probably more suitable vehicles for such comments. In addition
to the Auditor General's audit, each bank maintains an internal auditing unit.
These auditing arrangements were considered suitable for the two earlier
projects and would be acceptable for the Project.
Origin and Application of Resources
14.       As of the end of December 1975, the total resources of the four state
commerciaL banks amounted to about US$817 million, compared to US$435 million
in 1971. Out of the 1975 figure, only 7% represented capital and reserves.
Most of The resources originated on deposits (58%), rediscounts and loans from
CB (14%), external borrowing (8%), and other liabilities (13%). The applica-
tion of resources at December 1975 was mainly on the loan portfolio (73%),
cash and banks (13%), fixed assets (9%) and other assets (5%) (Table 1).
Earnings and Expenditures
15.       Overall banking operations of the four Government commercial banks
has been profitable over the past five years, during which net profits have



ANNEX 2
Page 5
ranged from 10% during their fiscal year 1971 to 6% in 1975. During the same
period, over 10% of the annual gross income was set aside as reserves, pro-
visions and write-offs; however, during the period, write-offs for defaulted
loans did not amount to 1% in any of the five years. This good performance
can be attributed mainly to the fact that, in spite of being a nationalized
and development-oriented banking system and thus heavily assisted by Govern-
ment's credit policies, sound management and banking practices have been
traditionally respected and demanded by Government. Other important factors
related to the performance indicated is the low cost of financial resources,
such as current accounts (no interest paid), term deposits, and rediscounts at
CB; a great number of short-term loans for the commercial and other sectors of
the economy; and a relatively continuous and conservative lending policy,
together with diligent efforts of the banks' staff to secure payments.
Further details related to earnings and expenditures are shown in Table 2.
Lending by Sectors
16.       The agricultural and industrial sectors have received the greatest
part of the credit provided by the banking system during the last five years.
Together, their participation has ranged from 70 to 74% of the total amount
lent. The agricultural sector by itself represented 54% of the total in 1971,
going down to 46% in 1975. Combined loan portfolios of the commercial banks,
to the end of fiscal years 1971 to 1975, was as follows:
Sector                          1971      1972      1973      1974     1975

D. Agricultural Credit
General
17.       Between 1971 and 1975, the amount of credit disbursed annually to
the agricultural sector increased by an average rate of over 20% per year
(Table 3). Total credit to agriculture, expressed in US dollar equivalent of
the respective years, grew from US$105 million, disbursed during 1970, to
US$207 million during 1975. The number of loans made during the same period
increased from 20,500 to over 53,000 in 1975. About 35% of the credit was
for medium and long term (over one year), mainly medium term (two to seven
years). Short-term credit (under one year) accounts for 65% of total.
Traditionally nearly 80% of the medium- and long-term credit has been to the
livestock sector and over 65% of the short-term credit has been for crop
production. Loans made to small farmers (those farmers with incomes under
4 25,000) have during 1975 accounted for about 89% (42,000) of the number of
loans made during the year and for about 20% (US$41 million) of the amount
disbursed (Table 4).
Short- and Long-Term Lending
18.       Annual disbursement for short-term and for medium- and long-term
loans to finance crops and livestock development during the past three years
is as follows:

ANNEX 2
Pa,ve 7
Short-term credit for operations traditionally has dominated medium- and long-
term credit for investment purposes, mainly in respect to crops. During 1974
and 1975, the participation of crops in the lending program of the banking
system increased by about 15% due to better Government support prices provided
as part of the National Program of Basic Grains (Annex 1). The participation
of livestock in short-term credit for fattening cattle and in investment
credit decreased due to the years of world recession which affected beef
demand and prices. Over the past few years, the demand for medium- and long-
term agricultural credit of the National Banking System has increased by about
20% per annum. If agricultural production is to continue to increase by 4.1%
per year, as it did from 1970 to 1975, the supply of medium- and long-term
credit to the sector should increase in real terms by at least the same rate.
Assuming that both local and international rates of inflation would be 8.4%
in 1977, 8% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in 1980, as projected by the Bank,
and that the foreign exchange component of investments to be financed by
medium- or long-term lending is about 45%, the additional amounts of foreign
exchange required during the three-year commitment period of the proposed loan
would be equivalent to about US$57 million.  Small farmers' requirements may
be expected to be about 20% of this amount, or about US$11 million, of which
it is proposed that the Bank should supply US$5.3 million (including price
contingencies).
Distribution of Credit by Product
19.       Traditionally coffee and beef cattle have utilized over 60% of the
total agricultural credit provided by the banking system for production and
investments for specific products (it does not include credit for isolated
inputs) (Table 3, other). The only other products, which, during 1975,
accounted for more than 1% of credit disbursed were rice (16%), sugarcane
(7%), milk (3%), corn (2.5%), and sorghum (1.6%). Until 1973, the distribu-
tion by product was even more concentrated in coffee, beef and sugarcane.
Rice, milk and corn have increased their share of total credit only since 1974
(Table 3).
Lending to Small Farmers
20.       The amount of credit for small farmers (those with incomes of less
than ¢ 25,000 and credit of less than ¢ 100,000) is also presented in Table 3,
with additional details for year 1975 in Table 4. Credit to the small pro-
ducers has absorbed a relatively low proportion of the total credit financed
by the banking system. Notwithstanding, its share of the total credit grew
from 11.7% in 1970 to about 20% during 1975. This credit is characterized by
a great number of loans for small amounts.  The number of loans in 1975 was
more than 42,000 (89% of total) and the total credit was ¢ 353 million (20% of
total), or an average of ¢ 8,000 per loan. Livestock production, mainly
fattening of cattle and dairy, accounted for over 60% of the credit for small
farmers. The balance was for crops such as rice, corn, beans and vegetables.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
Lending Procedures
21.       Practically all lending procedures in agriculture are the same for
the four state commercial banks. The credit department makes a preliminary
study of the application and attached documents. Then the appraisal section
proceeds to the field investigation and project evaluation. Its report and
the section head's comments are handed over to the credit department, which,
after careful review, submits the file, together with the department head's
recommendation, to the Manager, the branch or head office credit committee,
or the Board of Directors, depending on the size of the loan applied for.
Credit committees meet about twice a week and boards, twice or three times
a month.  At the local branch or agency level, where the Manager knows the
position, experience, and creditworthiness of each farmer, the procedure for
small farmer loan approval is simplified. The application form is used as
an evaluation report and contains recommendations to the Manager or credit
committee. Loans are supervised and, as far as possible, repayment dates
are fixed in accordance with crop harvesting. Small farmers have access to
credit facilities in the commercial departments of the banks, but most of them
are financed through the Rural Credit Department in BNCR.
Delinquency Rates on Loans
22.       Recuperation of loans is not a problem for the Costa Rican banking
system. Write-offs for defaulted loans have not reached 1% in any of the last
five years. More-than-one-year overdues from 1971 to 1975 ranged between 4%
and 2% on balances outstanding at year's end. Although the delinquency rate
for loans overdue for up to 90 days has remained at about 25%, this does not
indicate a serious problem because legal action to collect is not initiated
until loan payment is more than 90 days overdue. For loans with payments more
than 90 days overdue, judicial proceedings are suspended if the bank and the
borrower can reach an agreement on how and when the loan would be repaid.
Delinquency rates of credit outstanding at end of the year, for the banking
system has been as follows:
1971    1972    1973    1974    1975

Interest Rates
23.       CB, within its authority to fix interest rates for institutional
credit in Costa Rica, issues circulars from time to time amending or ratify-
ing interest rates for the different types of credit operations in the various
sectors of the economy. The latest circular was issued in March 1976 and, as
in the previous circular of December 1974, raised some of the rates. The
range for agricultural loans is now 8% to 12%, compared with the 8 to 11%
range in effect since December 1974 and the 8% to 9-1/2% range before then.
For other categories of loans such as commerce, interest rates go as high as
18%, plus commissions. For agricultural loans, the rates of interest vary
by type of borrower and by type of activity, with small farmers being charged
the lowest rate. The general current structure of interest rates is given in
Table 5, and summarized for agricultural loans as follows:
Rates
A.   Rediscount Rates from CB
Loans up to 360 days for the production and
storage of domestic agricultural and industrial
products                                                      7%
Loans up to one year for small farmers financed
by the state banks                                            4%
B.   Loans from Banks' Commercial Departments
Loans to farmers in general                                    12%
Loans for beef cattle fattening and milk cattle
raising                                                      10%
Loans for planting and harvesting operations
of basic grains                                               8%
Loans to small farmers                                          8%
Loans for agricultural production cooperatives
(mainly coffee and sugarcane)                                 6%
C.   Deposits from Private Sector and State Banks
Current accounts                                               None
Deposits for six to 12 months                                   9%
Deposits over 12 months                                     10 to 12%
Savings deposits                                                7%
All interest charges are collected quarterly in advance.
24.       Agricultural Credit from External Sources.  During the past five
years, the Costa Rican banking system has received about US$60 million in
medium- and long-term loans for agricultural credit from international insti-
tutions and private foreign banks. Of these loans, one for US$9 million was



ANNEX 2
Page 10
provided by the Bank (June 1972) to CB with an interest rate of 7.25% and an
18-year term. The loan was to finance agricultural and agro-industries devel-
opment and was channelled through the four government commercial banks.
Another of the loans was made by the IDB to the BNCR, for US$6 million, with
an interest rate of 3.25% per annum and a 20-year repayment term. This loan
is the second made by the IDB to the BNCR (the first was for US$5.2 million
in 1965) for livestock development. The other eight loans, for a total of
US$45 million, are from different foreign private banks to banks in Costa
Rica, with interest rates ranging from 8% to 12% for terms not exceeding 10
years. Foreign financing of medium- and long-term credit during the period
1971 to the end of 1976 accounts for about 22% (US$60 million) of the total
agricultural medium- and long-term lending (US$273 million) made by the bank-
ing system during the same period.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DFVSLOPrEMNT PROJECT
Seed Program Component
Present Status of the Seed Industry
1.        Seed Production.  Over the past 20 years, the Government and the
private sector have worked towards the establishment of a modern seed industry.
In 1957 an agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG)
and the National Production Council (CNP) initiated a cooperative seed program,
which was the first serious move towards the production and distribution of
improved seed in Costa Rica. Under this program, continuous efforts have been
made to introduce, multiply, and distribute improved rice seed. The private
sector, following the initiative of the MAG/CNP program, made its contribution
by installing two rice seed processing plants and by marketing both locally
processed and imported improved rice seeds. MAG estimates that 60% of the
seed used for the 1976 rice crop was of improved quality, derived from genetic
material of the CR-1113 variety selected in Costa Rica by national technicians.
However, the use of improved seeds for other crops has been limited to corn,
and even here its use has extended only to 5% to 8% of the total area planted.
This partially explains the low productivity, which is about 1.5 m tons/ha.
Only the trial stage has been reached in the search for improved seed for
other crops such as beans, oilseeds and cotton, using imported or locally
prcduced varieties.
2.        At present, there is no locally produced, certified seed for any
crop. The improved seed distributed by CNP and the private seed processing
plants is called "authorized seed," which is selected by screening impurities
from the commercial grains grown by selected farmers. It is better than
regular commercial grain but quality control is still uneven and farmers have
justifiable complaints.
3.        Legislation.  Effective coordination, not only of the Government
agencies concerned with seed activities, but also of the private sector groups
in the industry, is essential to the success of the National Seed Program.
Therefore, in July 1972, Law No. 5029 was enacted which created the National
Seed Commission (NSC) and assigned to it responsibility for coordinating the
actions of Government and private entities related to the production, certi-
fication and marketing of improved seeds. It was also given the task of
promoting the use of improved seed to increase the productivity of the main
crops produced in the country. Commission members are the Agronomy Department
Chief of MAG, the Seed Section Chief of the CNP, the Director of the Official
Laboratory for Seed Analysis, one representative of the seed producers and



ANNEX 4
Page 2
one representative of the seed merchants, both appointed by MAG. The Commis-
sion, however, has not yet obtained the staff or the budget to carry out its
responsibilities.
4.        Participants in the Industry.  Various entities are involved in the
seed industry. In the Government sector, the most active is CNP, which is
responsible for contracting, processing and distributing commercial seeds.
MAG runs the experimental stations and is responsible for foundation seed
development, while the University of Costa Rica operates the Official
Laboratory that tests and analyzes the seeds. In the private sector, the
major participants are the two rice seed processing plants (Empresa Procesa-
dora Central Agricola and the Arrocera Costa Rica), private seed importers,
seed merchants and the seed farmers under contract to the CNP.
5.        Infrastructure and Personnel.  Costa Rica has most of the infra-
structure necessary for a successful seed improvement program. There are
three experimental stations where research and production of foundation seed
has begun although on a small scale. "Enrique Jimenez Nunez" located at Taboga
is the main station. Some 100 ha of its 830 ha have been allocated for the
production of seed (breeder to registered) for rice and other basic grains.
Substations, located at Parrita and Upala, with 50 ha each, also dedicate a
total of 40 ha to the production of such seed. Two private seed processing
plants, and a new one built by CNP, with USAID financing at Barranca at a cost
of over US$1.2 million, have enough total capacity to process all the seed
requirements for the next 10 years. The seed testing laboratories at the
University of Costa Rica, built in 1974 at a cost of US$600,000, also financed
by USAID, are functioning under the management of a well trained staff.
Assisted by USAID loans and grants, Costa Rica has a number of professionals
trained in the different disciplines of seed technology. The University of
Mississippi, over the past four years, has, under the auspices of USAID,
trained staff and provided advisory services in all aspects related to the
seed industry. The only inadequacy appear to be in storage and distribution
centers, which the proposed project would be able to correct, and research for
the production of new varieties, which the Government has started to promote.
Proposed Investments
6.        The proposed project would finance the construction, equipment, and
installations needed to complete the physical infrastructure for the imple-
mentation of a National Certified Seed Program. Two 100 m ton foundation seed
warehouses ("foundation seed" is to be understood here as all seeds up to
registered) and 26 232 m ton commercial seed warehouses in five distribution
centers would be constructed with project financing. Capacities and location
of warehouses would be as follows:

The foundation seed warehouses would be located at MAG's "Enrique Jimenez Nunez"
experimental station and would be used to store breeder seeds.  About half of
the commercial seed storage chambers would be located at the new Barranca
processing plant and would replace existing obsolete and inadequate facilities
whose capacity totals 2,074 m tons. The rest would be built in other regions of
the country which presently have no properly equipped seed storage facilities
and would be administered by the CNP as part of its seed processing and distri-
bution network.
7.        Technical Specifications.  Technical specifications for the ware-
houses have been prepared by local consultant firms and they would be reviewed
by a qualified seed storage expert, acceptable to the Bank, before implementa-
tion of construction. The 26 warehouses for CNP have a design that has not
been used before and are expected to store various types of seed, some of
which have not been handled by CNP before.
8.        Cost Estimates and Financing.  Detailed investment costs are given
in Tables 1 and 2 and are summarized as follows:

9.        Implementation and Management.  The Government of Costa Rica would,
through CB, channel Bank Loan funds for the seed component to MAG for the
foundation seed warehouses and to CNP (Annex 1) for the commercial seed
warehouses. MAG and CNP would be responsible for the local counterpart
investment and for the administration of their respective components. MAG
intends to staff the "Enrique Jimenez Nunez" experimental station with five
agronomists and five assistant agronomists. Since none of the proposed
distribution centers except Barranca has existing facilities, new operating
units would be organized to man the four centers outside Barranca. Each unit
would consist of one manager, one secretary, three warehousemen, and two
laborers.
10.       Justification of Proposed Capacity.  The capacity of the two founda-
tion seed warehouses (200 m tons) is based on targets set by MAG for the produc-
tion of basic and registered seed as follows:

Detailed targets for the production and distribution of improved and certi-
fied seeds are being prepared by the Natiorina Seed Commission as part of the
National Seed Program proposal to be presented to the Bank before or during
negotiations (para. 5.05). The proposed capacity of 6,000 m tons for the
26 improved seed warehouses was prepared on the basis of the CNP's projection
of basic grain seed requirements for 1980 and its objective of supplying 60%
of these requirements. The relationship of the proposed capacity to esti-
mated 1975 volume and projected 1980 volume of basic grain seed requirements
is presented below:

Seed Program is presented before or during negotiations. The appropriateness
of the 76% ratio of proposed capacity to projected CNP volume would also be
reviewed by the qualified seed expert who would be contracted to review
technical specifications (para. 7).

COSTA RICA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Feeder Roads Component
Background
1.        Project Area.  The area in which the feeder road component is to be
implemented is the county (Canton) of Perez Zeledon, part of the El General
River Basin in the southern region of Costa Rica (see Map 11419 R). Coloniza-
tion of this area is fairly recent, having started slowly around 1856 with
the settlement of the Central Valley and stepping up only after construction
of the Interamerican Highway in 1936. The county covers an area of 1,870 km2
and has a total population of 67,100 (1973). Some 76% of its labor force is
occupied in agriculture. Well distributed small landownership predominates.
The average farm size is 22 ha; 53% of the 5,970 farms of the county have
from 5 ha to 100 ha and represent 60% of the land, which is substantially
more than the national equivalent figures. Total farmland is 128,800 ha
(1973), 45% of which is in pastures, 21% is in crops and 35% is unused.
2.        Agricultural production is based mostly on coffee, grains (corn and
beans) and extensive cattle breeding for which yields are lower than national
averages. In addition, sugarcane and tobacco are cultivated in a limited,
easily accessible area. With good access roads, potential for development of
the production of milk, sugarcane, fruit and vegetable is good, and markets
exist in the county's towns and in the metropolitan urban areas, well connected
by the Panamerican road.
3.        According to a study carried out under the auspices of the Institute
for Promotion and Assistance to Municipalities (IFAM) in 1974/75 and surveys
by the University of Costa Rica, 55% of the marketed production of the county
is taken from the farm by man or animal load. Carts are used when roads are
usable, but this is for only three or four months of the year. Some trans-
porters and coffee processors collect at the farmgate or at collection points
whenever and wherever possible, but prices paid to farmers vary considerably
(by 20% to 60% according to products), depending on how accessible the farm
is.  Freight rates, which are ¢ 1.00 per m ton/km on paved roads and ¢ 1.25 on
gravelled roads, increase to ¢ 2.00 on roads that require four-wheel drive
vehicles. Farmers surveyed almost always gave upgrading of feeder roads top
priority in ranking improvements they considered important.
4.        Perez Zeledon has a very poor transport system, composed of:
(a) 80 km of paved Interamerican Highway;
(b) 120 km of gravel-surfaced all-weather roads;



ANNEX 5
Page 2
(c) 200 km of earth-surfaced dry weather roads; and
(d) around 200 km of trails and paths.
An important national program for improvement of regional roads, under nego-
tiation with the Inter-American Development Bank, foresees improvement and
asphalt surfacing of 47 km of gravel roads within the county.
5.        Present Feeder Road System in the Project Area.  The present feeder
road system in the project area is made up of (a) gravel-surfaced roads,
(b) earth-surfaced roads, and (c) trails.  Therefore, any feeder road program
has to cover these three types and must be linked to the existing all-weather
road network or to the above-mentioned IDB regional roads.
6.        Most of the existing all-weather roads have 5 m-wide gravel surfacing
with a high percentage of oversized material, no satisfactory crowning and a
very rough surface. Drainage is poor and not well maintained and horizontal
and vertical alignment is partially deficient. Earth roads are 3 m to 5 m wide,
with very poor alignment, grading and drainage. The natural soil, mostly clay,
has a low support value, averaging 6% CBR. 1/ In the rainy season (September-
March), the unsurfaced, undrained roads become muddy and flooded, rendering
motorized travel, even by four-wheel drive vehicles, impossible. Ox carts,
which are the only means of transportation under these circumstances, only
worsen conditions. The trails are at most 3 m wide, have no drainage, and
can be used only by ox carts.
7.        The lack of an adequate feeder road system and the very poor mainte-
nance of the few existing roads seriously curtail agricultural development in
this potentiaily rich area. The main reason for this situation is the absence
of an organization that can adequately take care of the roads. The Ministry
of Public Works and Transport (MOPT), through its Highway Department and its
Operation Department, is responsible only for the national and regional
highway system. It has neither the funds nor the means to handle feeder road
construction and maintenance so these duties have been completely entrusted to
the Municipal Councils of each county (Canton).  These Councils, however, also
do not have the organization, technical know-how, equipment, or financial
means to assume such a task.
8.        Project Description.  The proposed project component is conceived
as a pilot project for construction, improvement and maintenance of feeder
roads through a county-level organization, assisted financially and technically
by IFAM, with additional technical assistance from MOPT. The original project
proposal, covering 445 km of roads, was reduced to 15 roads with a total of
107 km (Map) requiring an investment of US$1,659,000 (baseline cost), with a
foreign exchange component of US$800,000 (47%), or an average cost per km of
US$15,500. If successful, the prototype organization being tested here could
be used by other counties.
9.        Selection of Project Roads.  Five conditions have been considered
by IFAM in the selection of the roads.
1/   California bearing ratio.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(a) they should not be located in zones where the intensification of
agricultural production is unadvisable from the standpoint of soil
conservation and erosion control;
(b) they should serve areas of small farms;
(c) they should benefit a minimum of ten farms per kilometer;
(d) beneficiaries should have shown evidence of their interest
in an upgraded road either through the constitution of a
promotion group or/and the sending of an official applica-
tion to the Municipal Government or MOPT offices; and
(e) be recommended by IFAM field inspectors.
The first 107 km selected would benefit about 14,000 people, or about 2,200
farms, 37% of the total number of farms in the county. Total area of the
farmland served by these roads (about 2 km on each side) would amount to
about 24,000 ha.
Detailed Features of the Feeder Road Component
10.       Design Standards.  Proposed design standards for the proposed feeder
roads consider the characteristics of existing roads in the area, the physical
condition of penetration roads in other regions of the country, and the trans-
portation needs of the project area (the traffic density is expected to be
less than 50 vehicles a day). On this basis, the design standards indicated
in Table 1 were recommended. They were discussed with and approved in prin-
ciple by the president of IFAM.
11.       Cost Estimates.  Estimates are based on information supplied by
local consultants and on sound engineering judgment. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at 47%. Costs, based on prices and estimates of
September 1976 without contingencies, can be summarized as follows:

Local cost, mainly port handling and transportation to the job sites, is esti-
mated at 13%, or US$80,000. Detailed construction cost estimates are shown
in Table 2.
13.       Implementation Schedule.  As shown in Table 3, equipment procurement
by competitive bidding would take about six months, starting in June 1977, and
construction work on the roads would take until December 1979. Maintenance of
the roads constructed during the first year is included in the program for the
second year. After termination of the project, the equipment wouLd be used
for improvement of new feeder roads and for maintenance of the roads already
built.
Technical Details
14.       Subsoil and Material Conditions.  Average support value of soils in
the area is 6% CBR. There are a few gravel pits along the rivers in the area
with CBR values of up to 80% and with an average of 15% material greater than
3 inches in size. Most of these pits have difficult accesses and some of them
have a yearly production capacity of only a few thousand cubic meters. Some
rock pits can be found along the roads to be improved in the southern tip of
the county, but their characteristics would require further investigation as
they seem to have a high clay content.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
15.       Earth Movement.  The proposed works would consist of improving exist-
ing roads and trails or construction of new alignments over rolling, partly
mountainous country where more excavation than embankment would be needed.
Therefore, it can be figured roughly that only 50% of the excavation material
would be used for embankments, half of it by side-dumping and half requiring
transport distances of up to 500 m. The other 50% of excavation material
would be used for deposits, either by side-dumping or after short distance
hauling. Embankments and loose cut surfaces should be compacted with a sheep-
foot roller.
16.       Gravel Surfacing. The suggested gravel surface is 4 m wide and 0.20
m deep, requiring 800 m  of compacted gravel material per km.  As a maximum
size of 3 inches is called for and pit material has an average of 15% oversize
material (para 12), screening is needed.  Because of the small capacity of the
pits and transport difficulties, the use of crushing equipment is not recom-
mended.
17.       Pipe Culverts.  Due to heavy rainfall, good drainage of the roadway
is essential to maintain satisfactory condition of the roads during the wet
season. For this purpose and for drainage of minor waterways, it was esti-
mated that concrete pipe culverts 0.60 m in diameter are needed at distances
ranging from 200 m to 300 m, according to topographic conditions. Since some
of these pipes would be laid under embankments and no containing walls are
planned, an average length of 6 m was selected for each pipe cul ert. Excava-
tion needs for 0.60-m pipes were calculated at an average of 1 m per linear
meter of pipe.
18.       Major Culverts and Bridges.  Box culverts or small bridges will be
required to cross some creeks and rivers. Information about the standard
design and approximate cost of such structures in Costa Rica was obtained
through local consultants (Table 1).
Project Management
19.       Administrative Responsibility.  IFAM, which would have principai
responsibility for the feeder road component, is an autonomous development
institute established by the Government in 1970 to promote local and regional
development by providing loans and technical assistance to local governments.
It also acts as a coordinating agency among local governments and between
local governments and other government agencies. To fund its operations, IFAM
uses its own resources or acts as financial intermediary for funds obtained
from national and international lending institutions. IFAM's own resources
are derived from: (a) its allotment of 2% of sales taxes and 10% of real
estate taxes; (b) portions of the Family Welfare Program and other program
funds made available by the Government for infrastructure works in rural
areas; and (c) funds budgeted to IFAM from the National Treasury. Since its
establishment, IFAM's operations have grown dramatically, particularly in
1976 when loans quadrupled to 4 100 million from ¢ 23 million in 1975.  This



ANNEX 5
Page 6
expansion was funded primarily by an increase in its budget allotment (from
0 8 million in 1975 to ¢ 44 million in 1976) and by a four-fold increase in
USAID funds channeled through IFAM by the Government. IFAM's ambitious plans
call for continued expansion of its operations with IFAM-financed investments
projected to reach 0 200 million by 1978 and 0 250 million by 1979. It plans
to finance this expansion mainly with IBRD and IDB funds.
20.       Utilizing the services of AITEC (a US consulting firm), IFAM has
recently completed a country-wide survey of about 860 communities of over
50 inhabitants to determine the perceived needs and priorities for physical
and social infrastructure improvements. The results of this study are being
used as guidelines for planning future IFAM programs. IFAM *s also currently
responsible for a 0 200 million IDB-assisted road improvement program to pave
200 km of gravel roads with asphalt.
21.       IFAM is headed by a President who reports to a Board of Directors
whose members, as well as the President, are appointed by the Council of
Ministers. The current President is a former Minister of Public Works and
Transport who is a civil engineer by profession. IFAM is made up of three
major divisions: Planning, Operations and Technical Assistance. The
Operations Division provides financing for local government projects through
supervised credit programs. The Technical Assistance Division provides tech-
nical and consulting services to local governments and runs training programs
designed to upgrade the administrative, technical and financial skills of
local government officials. In view of its experience in dealing with local
governments and in administering road improvement programs, IFAM is well-
equipped to administer the feeder road component.
22.       Implementation.  IFAM would enter into an agreement with the
Municipality of Perez Zeledon setting up the terms and conditions for the pro-
vision of technical and financial assistance. The agreement would specific-
ally provide for:
(a) the establishment of a County Road Improvement Office (CRIO);
(b) the appointment of a qualified and experienced road engineer,
as manager of CRIO;
(c) the financial arrangements under which IFAM, the Municipality of
Perez Zeledon, MOPT and direct beneficiaries would share the costs
of the machinery and the civil works to be carried out for the
improvement of the roads;
(d) the financial arrangements for the maintenance of the improved
roads;
(e) the establishment of a cost accounting and statistics system;



ANNEX 5
Page 7
(f) the establishment of a technical unit responsible for the
operation and maintenance of the machinery and equipment;
(g) the establishment of a training program for CRIO personnel; and
(h) technical supervision of the maintenance of the improved roads.
IFAM in coordination with the MOPT and with the assistance of a private con-
sultant (para 21) would be responsible for the procurement of the machinery,
including the preparation of technical specifications, invitations for inter-
national bidding and selection of bidders, all of which would also need Bank
approval. In accordance with existing regulations of MOPT and IFAM, the costs
to be incurred on the improvement and maintenance of the feeder roads would
be shared by MOPT, IFAM, the Municipality of Perez Zeledon and beneficiaries
of the roads. However, the proportion in which these institutions share the
costs are determined in a case-by-case arrangement and, for this particular
case, it is being negotiated by the parties involved.
23.       Technical Assistance.  An internationally recruited consultant would
be hired to provide short-term (six months) technical assistance. He would be
a civil or road engineer experienced in road construction and maintenance, pre-
ferably specialized in feeder roads, and under his terms of reference, he would
primarily provide technical assistance and guidance to IFAM and CRIO in all
matters related to the selection, improvement and maintenance of feeder roads.
His main duties would be to:
(a) review the list of equipment to be procured;
(b) organize the preparation of bid documents for ICB purchasing
of equipment;
(c) review design standards and technical specifications for project
roads and selection criteria for future roads;
(d) assist in the organization of the CRIO's road construction
unit;
(e) assist in the organization of the CRIO's road maintenance unit; and
(f) participate in the preparation of the CRIO personnel training
program.
24.       His assignment in Perez Zeledon would be for four months during the
first year of the project and about two months during the second year. The
cost of the consultant services has been estimated at about US$6,000 per month,
including travel and all other costs.
Economic Rate of Return
25.       Economic benefits are expected from the incremental production that
would be generated by upgrading the roads.



ANNEX 5
Page 8
26.       About 2,200 farms are expected to benefit from the first 107 km
improved in Perez Zeledon. Their approximate current production and land use
is shown below:
Unit               Production              Area (ha)
Coffee                    m ton                8,280                    2,750
Corn                      m ton                 1,000                   1,000
Beans                     m ton                   400                   1,000
Cattle:
No. of head              no.                 10,500                     -
Area in pasture          ha                     -                    11,250
Unused farmland            ha                                           8,000
Total farmland             ha                                          24,000
27.       Incremental production generated by the improved roads, has been
estimated on the following assumptions:
(a) About 15% of the farms (320) would allocate
an average of 5 ha to milk production. Good
market prospects exist for tle milk produced in the area.
One of the processing cooperatives located near San Jose
has already started daily collection in Perez Zeledon of
about 5,000 1, and would readily absorb some 30,000 1
more.
(b) 500 ha of land presently used for grain production or
livestock raising would be planted into sugarcane to be
processed by the El General Sugar Mill. This new plant
is currently processing 1,000 m ton to 2,500 m ton of
cane daily during about 180 days a year but is only
working at half capacity, and could absorb the produc-
tion of twice the area at present planted in Perez Zeledon
(1,800 ha).
(c) Vegetables would be planted on an initial 15 ha to be
increased to 30 ha after 10 years. Production would
meet the demand of the urban population of the county
which now imports 90% of its vegetable consumption from
the Meseta Central, for which the county market is
currently of negligible importance.
(d) Easier access to CNP buying points in San Isidro and to
lower-cost agricultural inputs would encourage farmers to
increase the productivity of their grain area in order to
take advantage of current high producers' prices. Yields
have been assumed to increase from 1 to 1.8 m tons per ha
of corn and from 0.4 to 0.55 m ton per ha of beans over
five years, starting one year after the road has been con-
structed.



ANNEX 5
Page 9
(e) On half the coffee area, the average yield of coffee would
increase from 3.5 to 4 m tons per ha over five years,
starting one year after the road has been constructed. Half
of the project farms would then have caught up with the
yields obtained in the more accessible areas of Perez Zeledon.
28.       At full development (year 8) incremental production would be:
Corn (m tons)                  380
Beans (m tons)                  50
Coffee (m tons)                720
Vegetables (m tons)             60
Milk (1 per day)            19,600
The value of incremental production and incremental production and investment
costs have been shadow priced to reflect economic values as defined in Annex
10. Assumptions used on farm costs and benefits of generated production are
summarized in Table 4.
29.       The rate of return so obtained is 13%.  Net incremental benefits
might be reduced by unexpected decreases in the prices of coffee and sugar
on the world market; daily milk collection from the area might be slower to
organize; yields could be lower because of inefficient technical assistance
and, for dairy and sugar productions, insufficient medium- and long-term
credit. However, sensitivity testing to various assumptions (10% increase in
construction costs, 10% and 20% decrease in net incremental benefits from milk
and from coffee, 10% and 20% decrease in all incremental benefits, 10% increase
in road costs and 10% decrease in all benefits) does not result in strong
variations since in no case does the rate of return fall below 10%.

been estimated at border prices derived from international prices and their
fluctuations as projected by the Bank Commodities and Exports Projections
Division.
(a)  Beef.  The prices used in the model:  ¢ 5.77 (US$0.67) per kg
liveweight for exported meat and 0 3.67 (US$0.43) for culled
animals for domestic consumption, are in line with international
prices. Future prices in constant terms have been assumed to
increase from 100 in 1977 to 126 in 1978, 129 in 1980, and 130
in 1985 (1976 = 100).
(b)  Grains.  On the basis of their respective share in agricultural
credit, improvements in the cultivation of corn, beans and sorghum
have been assumed to absorb 20% of complementary investments.
For corn and sorghum, incremental production has been valued at
prices of US grains (FOB Gulf ports) landed in Costa Rica. For
beans, at average wholesale prices in Honduras and Nicaragua in
the second half of 1975 and the first half of 1976, plus freight
to Costa Rica.

It is not the intention of the project to increase total
availabilities of rice in the country and only the reduction
in unit costs, through promoting productivity increases,
have been included as incremental benefits. Some 60% of
investments in mechanized annual crops have been allocated
to rice cultivation.
(c)  Milk and Tree Crops.  Milk and fruit have been considered as
non-tradable and no adjustments have been made to domestic
farmgate prices. Besides the amounts specifically allocated
to the two dairy models, dairying has been assumed to absorb
50% of complementary investments.
(d)  Sugarcane.  Half of the investments in semi-permanent and
permanent crops and 30% of complementary investments have been
tentatively allocated to sugarcane production. Small producers
(3 ha of cane) would increase their yield from 50 m tons to 70 m
tons per ha (under rainfed conditions) with an average invest-
ment of ¢ 6,000 (US$703) per ha and annual operating costs in-
creasing from ¢ 3,200 to ¢ 4,800 (US$375 to US$562). Medium-
size producers (15 ha) would increase their yields from 65 m
tons to 85 m tons per ha with an average investment of 0 8,000
(US$937) per ha. Total improved cane area would amount to
around 2,000 ha. Farmgate prices for cane have been assumed to
follow projected trends in international prices of sugar and,
consequently, would increase from ¢ 80 (US$9.40) per m ton in
1977 to 0 100 (US$11.70) per m ton afterwards.
(e)  Cotton.  Cotton would account for 40% of the investment in mech-
anized annual crops. Cotton incremental production has been valued
at W 4,070 (US$477) per ton of seed cotton (US$0.18 per lb), in
line with present and projected world prices of about US$0.65 per
lb of raw cotton.
Costs
2.        The most important agricultural inputs and most agricultural machin-
ery are free from import duties and internal indirect taxation. In addition
direct imports of machinery and equipment by public entities are tax exempt.
Agricultural wages are legally fixed, currently at rates varying between
t 24 (US$2.80) per day and ¢ 32 (US$3.70), according to the type of work and
crop, but there is substantial unemployment and underemployment of the agricul-
tural labor force outside the peak season (three to six months a year). Un-
skilled labor has been shadow priced at 70% of the legal wage rate: The proj-
ect labor requirements will conform with the national pattern of labor utili-
zation and countrywide computations show that annual labor requirements of the
agricultural sector are only 70% of availabilities.



ANNEX 10

Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
3.        The economic rate of return on the farm investments and extension
services is estimated at 18%. When the cost of the seeds component is added,
it is 16%. The economic rate of return of the feeder roads component is about
13% (calculations are detailed in Annex 5). The overall economic rate of
return of the Project, excluding the cost of the rural development study and
of credit to agro-industries, is estimated at 16%. Economic feasibility of
credit to agro-industries and services will be assessed on a case per case
basis. In order to avoid double counting of benefits from the construction
of feeder roads in Perez Zeledon and from the agricultural credit component,
the assumption has been made that the farms benefitting from the roads should
normally receive 2% of the project farm credit to small-scale sugar and dairy
development and complementary investments, which corresponds to the percentage
they represent in the total number of farms below 50 ha in the country. 15%
of net incremental benefits from sugar planting and 5% from dairy development
have therefore been deducted from the benefits as attributed to the roads in
Annex 5.
4.        Sensitivity testing shows that, should costs increase by 10% or
benefits decrease by 10%, the rate of return would be 13% and that, in the
most unfavorable circumstance (costs increased by 10% and benefits decreased
by 10%), the overall rate of return would not fall below 10%.
