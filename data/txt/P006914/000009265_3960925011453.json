The objectives of the project were to increase\n            agricultural output, particularly beef and milk; raise\n            income levels, particularly those of small and medium-size\n            farms; and strengthen the extension service of the Ministry\n            of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) as well as its seed\n            production capability. The project included credit for\n            development of livestock, crops and agro industries; support\n            for strengthening the national extension service; support\n            for implementation of a seed improvement program; funds for\n            a pilot scheme for the rehabilitation and maintenance of\n            feeder roads; and assistance in preparation of a rural\n            development project. About 1,520 sub loans were financed,\n            compared with 3,260 estimated at appraisal, although the\n            volume of credit disbursed almost equaled original\n            expectations. Nearly 70 percent of the sub loans were for\n            livestock development, 28 percent for crop development, and\n            2 percent for agro industries. As stipulated in the Loan\n            Agreement, small farmers accounted for more than 25 percent\n            of the sub loans. Additional extension staff were hired and\n            trained, but eventually most of the staff transferred to\n            other positions because of better employment conditions\n            elsewhere. The project's seed program component was\n            restructured during implementation, and a substantial\n            contribution was made to improving the seed production\n            capability of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The\n            feeder road component was successfully implemented, but only\n            after the Bank's disbursement percentage was increased\n            from 30 percent to 70 percent. The rural development study\n            financed under the project was completed with much delay as\n            a result mainly of changes in the Government's priorities."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
