Souther Conveyor Project is the\n            first phase of a two-phase development to harness the\n            Republic of Cyprus' last substantial remaining surface\n            water resources. Different supply options, phasing and\n            technical alternatives were examined. The proposed Phase I\n            project is the least-cost alternative to meet the\n            Republic's priority water needs. The project's\n            primary objectives are: (i) to ensure adequate water\n            supplies to major cities as well as to rural areas; and (ii)\n            to maintain vitally important irrigated crop production in\n            an area threatened by aquifer seawater intrusion. The\n            project also aims to rationalize further the utilization of\n            the country's scarce water resources in Cyprus through\n            the establishment of appropriate institutions and the\n            implementation of realistic cost recovery measures for both\n            domestic and irrigation water. The project components\n            include: (a) a major dam and appurtenant structures; (b) a\n            main conveyor (110 km) and connecting pipelines; (c) a\n            pressurized irrigation network; (d) a terminal reservoir;\n            (e) domestic water treatment and conveyance works; (f)\n            establishment of project administration including a central\n            water control system; and (g) provision of consultant services."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
