Lessons learned from\n            the project: Privatizations are very difficult processes\n            that require strong political will to implement. Frequent\n            changes in leadership in the implementing agency can delay\n            reform processes in the institution. A strong and effective\n            project implementation unit kept continuity and maintained\n            implementation, despite changes in the leadership of TELCOR.\n            While preparing telecommunication rural strategies, it is\n            important to count on relevant ad-hoc studies to quantify\n            the specific requirements of each individual country."}, "docdt": "2007-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
