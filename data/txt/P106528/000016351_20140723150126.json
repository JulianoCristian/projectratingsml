"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall outcome rating of the\n            Results Based Management and Budgeting Project for the\n            United Mexican States was judged to be moderately\n            unsatisfactory.  The Bank and borrower performance were\n            moderately unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome\n            was moderate. Significant changes included revised\n            components and project restructuring. Several lessons were\n            learned. The instrument was not the best alternative for\n            what was needed for these reforms. The mitigation measures\n            in place did not lower the risks identified at appraisal.\n            This Project benefitted the most from the technical\n            assistance and feedback received both during preparation and\n            the last years of implementation. In retrospect, it would\n            have been better to have supported the Government's\n            agenda with a Non-Lending Technical Assistance program or a\n            Reimbursable Advisory Services to support more effectively\n            the type of reforms the Government was pursuing. Although\n            there were mitigation measures in place for this risk, the\n            fact that there were two implementing agencies and a\n            financial agent was more complex than initially assessed.\n            While Components 1 and 2 were very much in line with the\n            Government's agenda, both conceptual and technical; the\n            components related to results-based budgeting were not\n            aligned. This is largely reflected in the lack of\n            disbursements throughout the Project. Additional\n            implementation support should be considered for projects\n            that involve more than one implementing unit that are not\n            familiar with large and complex procurement processes.\n            Meaningful and objective results indicators are critical for\n            monitoring complex reform initiatives. It is optimal to\n            ensure alignment between Government processing and the\n            Bank's required action. As reflected in the\n            Borrower's comments, timely action from the Bank with\n            respect to issuing Bank feedback especially \"no\n            objection\" is also a critical element for timely\n            implementation. While reform initiatives do not always allow\n            for quantifiable measures of success, this project could\n            have benefited from a results framework that provided for\n            mid-course target values that could have informed\n            counterparts and the Bank that mid-course corrections were\n            warranted earlier."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
