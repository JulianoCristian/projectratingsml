This restructuring paper seeks the approval of\n            the Executive Directors to amend the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO) of the project by aligning the PDO to a\n            reduced project scope and partial loan cancellation. The\n            restructuring will also introduce the following changes: (i)\n            the reduction in project scope as a result of changes in\n            Government priorities and use of own resources; (ii) the\n            revision to the results indicators to align the expected\n            results with the activities that will be undertaken under\n            the restructured project; (iii) the revision in project\n            financing reflecting cancellation of US$12.756 million of\n            the loan amount (from US$17.243 million to US$4.4866 million\n            including the front-end fee) and revisions to the costs by\n            component, financing plan and expenditure categories; and\n            (iv) the revisions to the procurement plan and\n            implementation schedule as result of the reduction in\n            project scope and partial loan cancellation. The\n            restructuring will allow achievement of the revised PDO and\n            completion of the restructured project within the current\n            closing date of December 31, 2013. These changes have been\n            approved by management and discussed and agreed with the\n            Government of Mexico. The restructuring does not trigger any\n            new safeguard policies."}, "docdt": "2012-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
