                         observed in the implementation of procurement related activities under Component 1 of the project and at the request of the implementing agency SFP, the Government has
                         requested the partial cancellation of the loan for all activities to be implemented by this entity. As a result of this decision, a mission was deployed to discuss and agree with
                         authorities on the scope of a project restructuring aiming to: a) reflect the requested cancellation; b) revise accordingly the project development objective; c) update the status of
                         proposed activities in the remaining components and agree on the prioritization of the same in order to reflect actual chances for their implementation before the end of the current

                         Administration and project closing date; d) reallocate available loan proceeds among prioritized activities; and e) update the results framework and associated targets according to the
                         revised project scope.

                         Progress to date: Building on progress achieved in the past three years, the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) through the Expenditures Department (Subsecretaria de Egresos) has
                         continued to implement the Results and Performance Evaluation (PBR-SED) reforms and to incorporate new features to the Budget preparation and implementation cycle. Aspects to
                         be highlighted include: a) the preparation and dissemination of specific guidelines to incorporate the programmatic and results approach in the formulation of the 2012 Budget; b) the
                         implementation of revised budget classification codes to further disaggregate budget information at program and geographical levels; c) the launch of an integrated evaluation model
                         with established parameters to assess results and impact of government programs; d) the launching of a transparency portal to enhance access to budget information and social
                         accountability; e) the deployment of the new integrated financial management system SIGAF in the Central Government; and f) the adoption of standards and supporting instruments
                         to support PFM functions and PFM harmonization at the municipal level.

                         In the case of the SFP, advances were also observed in both the Management Enhancement Program and the modernization of public procurement instruments and norms. These
                         activities however were not directly related to the implementation of this project.

                         Although progress towards the project's PDO in these areas is evident, utilization of Loan proceeds did not happen as planned. Many of these activities were part of the overall
                         project action plan and were supported by the Bank through project implementation support and other parallel programs but were funded with Government own resources. A total of 6
                         out of 8 activities under the Loan's PAC for an estimate amount of USD 1.2 million have significantly advanced the procurement process and would start implementation before the
                         end of the calendar year. Other activities will be initiated soon and the Government has requested the addition of 7 new activities.

                         On the basis of this evaluation and new requests, a first level project restructuring was deemed necessary and agreed upon with the authorities. The SHCP, as the only remaining
                         implementation agency, is in the process of quantifying de level of effort and costing the proposed new activities. The restructured project would focus its attention to: a) consolidate
                         progress made in the implementation of the PBR-SED reform and facilitate the transition to the new Administration including the support to the evaluation of key Government
                         programs (i.e. Citizens Security, education and the water sector); b) enhance the PFM and budget transparency agenda; and c) expand the scope of the Accounting Harmonization
                         program to sub-national and decentralized government.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The SHCP, at the request of the SFP, has requested the partial cancellation of the loan given cumulative delays in the implementation of activities under project Component 1.

                         Beyond progress made in the areas of Results Based Budgeting and Performance Evaluation (PBR-SED) and the launching of a Budget Transparency Portal, the SHCP, through the
                         Subsecretaria de Egresos, has advanced procurement processes for 6 out 8 activities to be financed with Loan's proceeds. In addition, 7 new activities were identified to help
                         consolidate efforts made in these areas before the end of the current Administration.

                         A project restructuring and an amendment to the Loan Agreement will be prepared to reflect the partial cancellation of the Loan and the updating of the project objectives, scope,
                         funds allocations and expected results.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
