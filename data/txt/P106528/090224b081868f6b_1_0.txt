                         cancellation involved a significant reduction in project scope as well as modifications to the Project Development Objective (PDO), and therefore a restructuring with submission to
                         Board for consideration/approval. As of end of calendar year 2012 the project and loan restructuring has been approved and signed. The loan amount has been reduced from US
                         $17.24 million to US$4.44. The new PDO is to strengthen SHCP’s capacity to: (i) allow the use of standardized performance information of priority public programs during budget
                         preparation; (ii) generate harmonized sub national fiscal information; and (iii) disseminate budget performance information to the Borrower’s citizens on a regular basis.
