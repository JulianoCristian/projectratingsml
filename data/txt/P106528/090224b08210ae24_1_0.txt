                         indicators is generally on a positive trend with respect to strengthening SHCP’s capacity on the use of standardized performance information for priority public programs during
                         budget preparation and disseminating budget performance information to the public. However, with the refocusing on the development of the Government Accounting System, the
                         capacity to generate harmonized subnational fiscal information would not happen within the Project's timeline.
