ETHIOPIA
FORESTRY PROJECT
(Cr. 1722-ET)
PREFACE
1.          This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Ethiopia
Forestry Project, for which Credit 1722-ET in the amount of SDR 31.6 million
(US$45.0 million equivalent) was approved on July 3, 1986 and made effective on
December 19, 1986.
2.          The Credit was closed on June 30, 1994, (compared with the original
closing date of June 30, 1993), even though an extension of the closing date through to
December 31, 1994 had earlier been agreed to by the Bank. Only 41 percent of the Credit
was disbursed with the last disbursement taking place in March, 1995 after the processing
of the final withdrawal application.
3.          The ICR was prepared by staff of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Program (CP) on behalf of AF2AE Division of the Africa Region and reviewed by Ms. S.
Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE, and Mr. L. Borin, Acting Projects Advisor, AF2. The
ICR is based on information obtained from the project files and on the findings of an ICR
mission-/ which visited Ethiopia in January 1995. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by providing input to the Aide Memoire drafted by the FAO/CP
completion mission.

FORESTRY PROJECT
(Cr. 1722-ET)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Intro(luction
1 .    Between 1973 and 1986, IDA supported the agricultural sector in Ethiopia by providing twelve
credits totalling US$ 238 million. IDA's assistance covered different aspects of the agricultural sector,
viz, irrigation and rainfed agriculture for food crop production, coffee development, livestock,
agricultural research, marketing and storage, credit and drought rehabilitation and resettlement
programs.
2.    The principal objectives of the Forestry Project were to increase supplies of fuelwood and
building poles to Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar, and to reverse the process of forest degradation near
these cities. Project activities under the State Forestry Program (SFP) component included the
establishment of 11,000 ha of new plantations and upgrading of 13,000 ha of State forestry plantations;
the SFP also included the construction of about 400 km of forest roads and 17 villages to house the
4,200 families to be relocated from areas identified for State forestry operations. The Community
Forestry Program (CFP) under the project included the establishment of 1,600 ha of state-supervised
plantations and supervised upgrading of 1,000 ha; and, establishment of 8,450 ha of new plantations,
plus the rehabilitation of some 2,720 ha of plantations under the self-help program. Primary
responsibility for the plantation work under the self-help program was entrusted to Peasant Associations
(PAs) and Urban Dwellers Associations (UDAs); private peasant farmers were also entrusted with
planting about 250 ha. Provision was also made under the Credit for forestry research, institutional
support for project implementation, staff training and technical assistance. The project also aimed to
foster the development of an incentive framework, which would allow full cost recovery for the State
plantations. and permit a sufficient margin for community growers to stimulate forest (re)planting. To
this end, a covenant was included in the Credit Agreement (Part 11 Table 10). Project objectives were
appropriate and responsive to the country's needs of increasing the supply of forest products and
protecting the environment. However, with regard to the component mix, the project's emphasis on the
SFP proved to be excessive; the mid-term review in November 1992, sought to redress this situation by
restructuring the project to change its focus from the State forestry sector to private sector planting. The
latter activity was to be promoted through some 48 forestry extension centres around the country.
Emphasis on State plantations was to focus on improved management.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Project start up was slow due to delays in the construction of project buildings and other civil
works and in the procurement of equipment and vehicles. Thus, actual planting commenced only one-



- iii -
and-a-half-years after credit effectiveness. Implementation was further slowed down when the
Government changed its socio-economic policy from centrally planned to mixed economy in 1990, and
due to the civil war and the subsequent change in Government, in May 1991.
4.    At completion, the project succeeded in achieving its broad objectives; however, the results
among the components have been of a mixed nature. The experience with the establishment of new
State plantations was not highly successful; however, this should be viewed in the context of the
changed emphasis of the project, to focus on private sector plantings. Thus, under the SFP, the project
planted only a third of the new plantations it targeted, mainly due to the lack of plantable land since
unencumbered land had not been identified during appraisal. However, the project brought under its
management almost three times the area of the State plantations originally envisaged. With respect to
the families to be relocated under the SFP, it should be noted that, apart from a plan for the small
project area in Bahir Dar, no resettlement plan was prepared for the major project area despite
IDA's reminders; a much lower number of families were, however, actually resettled under the
project. Although the project sought to compensate those relocated by it, the resettled farmers are
reportedly worse off now; as a consequence of this lack of planning, some of those relocated have
moved back to their original areas (at the cost of the plantations). Within the CFP, the project met its
plantation targets under state-supervised planting, but not under the PA/UDA self-help program.
Plantings by individuals have, however, by far exceeded project targets. From an environmental
perspective, the project was moderately successful in arresting degradation of plantations through the
protection/ rehabilitation of plantations around Addis Ababa. Natural regeneration of indigenous
species was also fostered thereby, while soil fertility was stabilized through community/on-farm tree
planting.
5.    In terms of institution building, project achievements have been modest. The overseas degree
training program was only partially implemented -- to a certain extent due to the initiation of a forestry
degree program in Ethiopia during the project's life. However, the non-degree staff training program
was carried out reasonably successfully. The disruption of the envisaged management support and the
transfer of technical know-how under the project, by the early departure and non-replacement of the
leader of the technical assistance team, also detracted from the project's performance. The Project
Management Unit (PMU) suffered due to its set-up, because, although it was administratively separate
from the line Ministry, it was still dependent on the latter for budget approval, procurement of goods
and services and for approval for overseas training. Furthermore, the Project Coordination Committee
rarely met, which deprived the PMU of an important linkage with the Ministry of Natural Resources
Development and Environmental Protection. It is noteworthy that, in spite of these exigencies, project
management was able to maintain project activities during the difficult times of the previous regime and
protect the project assets during the civil war.
6.   Notwithstanding the many obstacles which prevented its smooth implementation, the project has
made a positive impact on the environment and the economy of the country. The greening of the badly
degraded and eroded hills surrounding Addis Ababa is a vivid example of the project's contribution.
Within the community forestry component, farmers have started to harvest their trees, and have
reported that their financial gains are extremely attractive, now that they can sell their harvests on
auction at freely negotiated prices. In this context, while the DCA covenant which had sought to ensure
the establishment of a liberalized marketing and pricing system for forestry produce was not complied



- iv -
with (procurement and marketing of products continued to be undertaken by the Fuel Wood and
Construction Poles Marketing Enterprise (FCPME) at prices below costs of production), with the
change in Government and the ensuing liberalization of prices, produce coming from the CFP was no
longer required to be sold through public marketing institutions at fixed prices.  Additionally,
Government is reviewing the possibility of privatizing or liquidating FCPME. With regard to the
output of the State plantations, following the recent regionalization process, the regions are determined
to sell their forestry products under an auction system.
7.    Contrary to what had been anticipated during appraisal, most of the project output is being sold
as construction poles instead of fuelwood, even though this should have been expected given the higher
market value of poles. Given the higher returns from the sale of construction poles, combined with the
actual project costs being lower than the appraisal estimates, an Economic Rate of Return of 19 percent
was calculated for the project at completion; this compares favourably with the 16 percent estimated at
appraisal. In view of the foregoing, overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory.
Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    Project completion has coincided with the implementation of the Government's regionalization
program. The project is now divided among three administrative regions, and plans for future
operations (with respect to the activities initiated under the project) are still being developed. A likely
risk to the sustainability of the State plantations may be the unavailability of adequate funds during the
transitional period to carry out the necessary forest management and conservation activities. The
regions, however, appear committed, and propose to avoid this risk by establishing self-financing
schemes, e.g., using the proceeds from the sale of wood products from the plantations, for forest
management/conservation purposes. With regard to the community forestry plantations, these are likely
to be sustainable because the farmers are eager to benefit from the returns from these plantations, and
the communities are not likely to accept the deterioration of the forests now that they have understood
the high economic value of the plantations, particularly in view of the liberalization of marketing
channels and prices.
9.    The following key lessons emerged from the project's implementation experience:
*  unencumbered plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal or prior to project
effectiveness, in order to expedite plantation implementation;
*  re-settlement activities should not commence before preparing adequate resettlement plans. In view
of the significant difficulties in ensuring inter-sectoral coordination, and given the inherent
sensitivity and complexity of the subject, the preparation of adequate resettlement plans, addressing
key issues, e.g., health and education services, allocation of land, etc., should have been ensured
earlier on; additionally, establishing State plantations in densely populated areas is likely to lead to
low survival rates; however, the risk of failure is greater if farmers have been evicted to set up
plantations;
*   a separate project management structure without an adequate coordinating mechanism may lead to
its institutional isolation from established technical/ administrative bodies, hence reducing its
effectiveness;



* it should be ensured that project covenants are either complied with, or formally excluded if they
are unattainable, since retaining an unfulfilled covenant throughout the implementation period,
albeit, with continuous reminders, amounts to de-emphasizing its usefulness/ seriousness;
* and finally, a general lesson is that an enhanced monitoring capability should be designed for
projects with environmental/natural resource conservation components, that not only reviews
physical achievements, but also assesses the environmental impact of the project.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ETHIOPIA
FORESTRY PROJECT
(Cr. 1722-ET)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    The primary objectives of the project were to increase the supplies of fuelwood and
building poles to Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar by establishing and rehabilitating eucalyptus
plantations, as well as through community forestry activities and, in the process, reversing
the trend of degradation of forests and plantations. Project components included: (i) a State
Forestry Program (SFP) consisting of the establishment of 11,000 ha of new plantations,
rehabilitation of 13,000 ha of existing coppice plantations and construction of 372 km of
forest roads and 17 forest villages to house some 4,200 families that would be moved from
the plantation sites; (ii) a Community Forestry Program (CFP) comprising the
establishment of 1,600 ha of state-supervised plantations and supervised upgrading of
1,000 ha; and, establishment of 8,450 ha of new plantations, plus the rehabilitation of
some 2,720 ha of plantations under the self-help program. Primary responsibility for the
plantation work under the self-help program was entrusted to Peasant Associations (PAs)
and Urban Dwellers Associations (UDAs); private peasant farmers were also entrusted
with planting about 250 ha; and (iii) institutional support through staff training, applied
research and technical assistance. In the case of State supervised plantations for the
communities, the project was to establish and manage the forests on behalf of the UDAs
and PAs. The latter would then harvest the trees and reimburse the establishment and
management costs to the Government.
2.    Project objectives were appropriate and responsive to the country's needs of
increasing the supply of forest products and protecting the environment. With regard to the
component mix, however, the project's emphasis on the SFP proved to be excessive. An
attempt was made to redress the situation after the mid-term review in November 1992,
when the project was restructured to take into account the changed political and economic
circumstances in the country. The re-designed project was to change the emphasis of tree
planting from State sector to private sector planting, to be promoted through some 48
forestry extension centres around Addis Ababa and several other regions. Emphasis on
State plantations was to focus on improved management. This reorientation of the project
would, it was hoped, consolidate and improve the management of the existing, established
state plantations, and expand future planting activity through enhanced community and



- 2 -
private forestry. The state forestry extension service would have been intensively expanded
to provide forestry technical and material support to all planters, whether as a community
or as individuals.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    As indicated in Part II, Table 5, the project has generally achieved its plantation
objectives, but the results among the components have been of a mixed nature. Within the
State program, the project has succeeded in covering a total area of 26,400 ha of new
plantings and rehabilitation, against 24,000 ha envisaged at appraisal. However, about
19,400 ha or 74 percent of this area consisted of old and neglected plantations rehabilitated
and brought under the management of the project. The experience with the establishment
of new State plantations has not been highly successful: 3,800 ha against 11,000 ha of new
plantations foreseen at appraisal and 3,200 ha against 6,000 ha of new plantings under the
rehabilitation plan.  However, this should be viewed in the context of the changed
emphasis of the project, to focus on private sector plantings. Within the CFP, the project
achieved its objectives in establishing state-supervised plantations, but not in self-help
plantations, where only about 15 percent of the area expected has been planted. On the
other hand, plantings by individuals have by far exceeded project targets. Due to the
reduced area of new plantations, only 190 km of roads were constructed compared with an
SAR target of 370 km. Project achievements in strengthening applied research were
modest as a number of trials have been inconclusive, and those completed were not
properly evaluated (para 13).  Also, only part of the degree training program  was
implemented, because the project was not able to spare staff for long overseas training;
however, a forestry degree program was initiated in Ethiopia during project
implementation.
4.    The project has failed in achieving the establishment of two thirds of the new State
plantations because of the non availability of sizable blocks of plantable land. The project
had not identified precise sites for the new plantations during preparation or appraisal. It
only indicated the global areas where plantations would be established, and intended to
relocate the families within those areas downstream to give way to the new plantations.
Because of the project's slow start, lack of building material and changes in Government
policy in 1990 against the forced relocation of families, only some 620 families were
relocated out of the 4,200 planned. The project was not able to find more land for
plantation establishment. The main causes for not achieving the settlement target were the
lack of settlement land, paucity of construction material, farmer resistance to relocation and
the lack of a resettlement plan (para. 18).
5.    From  an environmental perspective the project was moderately successful in
arresting degradation of plantations through the protection and rehabilitation of plantations
to the north of Addis Ababa. Natural regeneration of indigenous species is also being
fostered through this protection. The enhanced supply of woody biomass for fuel, meeting
an estimated 15 to 20 percent of demand in Addis Ababa, may alleviate future degradation



- 3 -
of forest resources, but the overall demand is still greater than the sustainable supply and
pressure will be increasingly exerted to overcut on an uncontrolled basis. The project
should meet between 60 to 70 percent of the current pole demand. Community/on-farm
tree planting is also assisting in soil stabilization as well as providing limited quantities of
fuel to offset the use of agricultural residues and animal manures that can be used to
enhance soil fertility. In terms of institution building, the project has made only a modest
impact. This is because the management support and the transfer of technical know-how
envisaged under the project was disrupted by the early departure and lack of replacement
of the leader of the technical assistance team. This led to a less systematic and ad hoc
assignment of the remaining professionals to different tasks (Appendix B).
6.    Contrary to appraisal estimates, where most of the project output was expected to
be used as fuelwood, the primary demand for the project produce, has been for construction
poles. This is probably due to the construction boom which is taking place in the country.
Since construction poles have higher value than fuelwood, the project's economic benefits
are more attractive. The Economic Rate of Return calculated for the project of 19 percent
compares favourably with the appraisal estimate of 16 percent. Another reason for this
higher rate of return is also the lower (actual) project costs compared to what was
envisaged at appraisal (Appendix C).
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
General
7.    The project start up was slow as a result of the combined effects of delays in the
construction of project buildings and other civil works, lack of some critical construction
material, delay in the procurement of equipment and vehicles, and untimely release of
Government budgets. Implementation was further slowed down due to the change in the
Government's socio-economic policy in 1990 from a centrally planned to a mixed economy
- in which farmers were no longer obliged to leave their land for forest establishment - and
the civil war which culminated in the overthrowing of the Government in May 1991.
Mid-term Review
8.    Due to the civil war and the subsequent change of Government, the mid-term
review was carried out belatedly, towards the end of the project period (in November
1992). The outcome of the review was an action program to be implemented over three
years on the two main components. When the project was re-designed following a mutual
agreement between the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) and the Bank, the Government
requested for a three-year extension of the project's closing date to June 30, 1996.
However, the Bank extended the project for an initial period of 18 months to December 30,
1994. Later, in December 1993. the Government requested the Bank to bring forward the
closing date to June 1994, or six months earlier than the Bank's proposed closing date;



- 4 -
accordingly, the Credit was closed on June 30, 1994. The reason given was that the closing
date should be brought forward to allow the pursuit of the new Government economic
policy, as well as the new forestry policy and strategy. At that time, the project had just
completed preparing its plans and budget, and was about to start procurement of equipment
and material, and had commenced implementation of the re-structured project with very
favourable response from the private sector in the production of wood for fuel and poles.
In fact, some activities, such as provision of seedlings and improved management of state
plantations were prematurely interrupted and terminated as much as a year earlier than the
actual closing date of June 1994.
Studies
9.    The project provided a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in November 1985 to
undertake two studies: preparation of maps from aerial photography and a socio-economic
study of the project areas in order to define the new plantation sites and to plan community
forestry. However, due to Government delays in awarding the contracts, these studies were
undertaken only after the project became effective, hence defeating the purpose of the PPF.
The two studies were completed in mid-1987 and it was after this event that serious
planning on sites started. A study on Marketing of Fuelwood and Poles for Addis Ababa
and Bahir Dar was done in 1989 to support the project's case for a review of wood prices
by Government (in line with the covenant between GOE and the Bank). Although the
study was submitted to Government, no action was taken on wood prices (para 17). The
study for the redesign of the Forestry Project was undertaken in 1992 and formed the basis
of the project's mid-term review. Its proposals for changes to the project's direction were
only partially implemented as the project closed prematurely (para 8).
Establishment of Plantations
10.   After the socio-economic study was carried out, it became apparent that some of the
areas assumed to be appropriate for planting, were not so because they were either densely
populated or unsuitable for planting. This was particularly true in Bahir Dar, where only
about 400 ha or 10 percent of the envisaged area of the new state plantations were
established, and half of these were destroyed by relocated farmers after 1991. The reason
for this shortcoming can be attributed to deficient project formulation.
Project Management
11.   The Project Management Unit (PMU) was established promptly and commenced its
operations on time. However, the PMU was initially burdened with issues related to
inadequate project infrastructure and timely release of approved Government budget. It
was only one-and-a-half-years after project effectiveness, that planting and other field work
began. Although the PMU was established as a separate entity from the line Ministry, i.e.,
from the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in the earlier years and the Ministry of Natural
Resources Development and Environmental Protection (MNRDEP) later, it was



- 5 -
nevertheless dependent on the latter for its budget, for procurement of equipment and
materials and for approval of overseas training. This arrangement put the PMU in an
awkward situation.  The Unit had full autonomy for planning, implementing and
monitoring project activities, but was totally dependent on the line Ministry for obtaining
resources for realizing project plans. Being an external body (not related to the Ministry),
its leverage on the ministerial departments was limited. The Project Coordinating
Committee (PCC) rarely met and did little to resolve these problems; the PCC hence, failed
to become an effective link between the PMU and the line Ministry.
12.   Additionally, the PMU was overwhelmed with too many tasks, being responsible
for all technical and managerial aspects and for monitoring and evaluation of its operations,
albeit, with important technical assistance inputs. The already existing institutions such as
the Silvicultural Research Centre (SRC) and the Forestry Training Institute (FTI) which
could have carried out the necessary work for the project to its specification, were not
utilized. It is noteworthy that, in spite of these obstacles, project management was able to
maintain project activities during the difficult times of the previous regime and protect the
project assets during the civil war.
Research and Training
13.   The forestry research  component was not adequately planned. Although the
research topics identified were relevant, research methodology and documentation of
results were not geared towards producing recommendations for future use. A number of
trials have been inconclusive. Some research advice notes were prepared by the project in
the fields of nursery soil mixtures, fertilizer applications and on planting and tending
techniques (Appendix B). However the usefulness in terms of increased benefits and/or
decreased costs in plantation operation is not indicated. The research component, which
ended up exclusively under the PMU's direction, operated in isolation from the Forestry
Research Center (FRC) or SRC - contrary to the original intentions of the project.
14.   The non-degree staff training program was carried out reasonably successfully. The
overseas degree training plan was, however, modified and only 3 undergraduates (against
the appraisal target of 10) went for graduate training overseas. This was mainly due to the
initiation of a forestry degree education program at Alemaya University in Ethiopia during
project implementation and the difficulty in sparing staff for several years of overseas
training, given the limited number of available foresters in the country.
Technical Assistance
15.   All the technical assistance foreseen under the project was utilized, but not in
accordance with the original plans. Unfortunately, the leader of the technical assistance
team had to leave the country 14 months after his arrival due to disagreement with the
project management, and was not replaced. This disrupted the utilization of the technical
assistance as planned, because other members of the team had to be shifted from one



- 6 -
project component to the other to fill the gaps. For this reason, the impact of the technical
assistance was less than expected (Appendix B). Technical assistance proposed and
accepted by GOE for the redesigned phase, following the MTR, could not however be
implemented.
Forest Product Utilization and Prices
16.   Some of the early plantations have come to maturity and harvesting has just started.
The areas being harvested are mainly those from project managed (supervised) community
forests. The PAs are selling the standing trees on auction to the private sector, and the
project assisted them in this endeavour and at the same time recovering the plantation
establishment and management costs, although free of interest. There is an apparent
disagreement between the forest officers and farmers on the felling age of trees. While the
former recommend 7 to 8 years in line with their management plans to obtain larger
coppice stools, the latter opt for felling earlier because the construction poles mostly in
demand (4 m long and 6 cm in diameter) can be obtained within six years on good
plantation sites.
17. One of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) covenants sought to ensure the
establishment of a marketing and pricing system, which would allow cost recovery under
the SFP as well as cost recovery and adequate incentives in the case of the CFP. In spite of
continuous reminders from the Bank supervision missions, the Government did not fulfill
this requirement. Procurement and marketing of products continued to be undertaken by
the Fuel Wood and Construction Poles Marketing Enterprise (FCPME) at prices below
costs of production. However, with the change in Government and the ensuing
liberalization of prices, produce coming from the CFP was no longer required to be sold
through public marketing institutions at fixed prices. At present, the farmers involved in
the CFP, are free to sell their produce to whoever offers better prices, putting the FCPME
in crisis. It is not yet clear whether the FCPME will continue to procure and sell forest
products below cost. It is clear, however, that most of its depots in Addis Ababa are closed
for lack of supplies, contrary to the private depots which are full of fuelwood and
construction poles. The fate of the FCPME itself is in question as Government is in the
process of deciding among other things, on its privatization or liquidation. With regard to
the output of the State plantations, following the recent regionalization process, the regions
are determined to sell their forestry products under an auction system.
Resettlement of Farmers
18.   In accordance with a stipulation in the DCA, a resettlement plan for farmers was to
be submitted to IDA by December 31, 1987. However, apart from a plan for the small
project area in Bahir Dar in October 1988, no plan was prepared for the major project area
in spite of continuous reminders from IDA. In the meantime, the project resettled about
620 families instead of 4,200 planned during appraisal. However, more families were



- 7 -
moved from the project area by the Government independently from project activities
under the highly unpopular villagization program.
19.   The project attempted to provide compensation for the families relocated by it, viz.,
housing, agricultural land, schools and clinics, water and electricity supplies, as well as
employment in the plantation activities. However, relocated farmers have reported that
they were not given what they were promised and are now worse off than in their original
areas. They explain that they were not given sufficient land because the PAs adjacent to
them could not spare larger agricultural areas because of land scarcity. In addition, the
schools and clinics promised by the project did not materialize, and more recently the
income from employment in the forests has tapered off following project closure.
20.   The project staff have confirmed the farmers' statements and explained that the
delay in the construction of villages and social buildings was mainly due to the lack of
construction material. Furthermore, the plans for construction of schools and clinics under
the project were not coordinated with the line ministries. Thus, even the two schools and
one clinic already constructed have yet to be equipped, staffed and absorbed into the
normal activities of the ministries. Also, not surprisingly, the project did not have any
authority to ensure that the settler recipient PAs gave a fair share of land to the newcomers
being resettled. However, had an adequate resettlement plan been prepared in advance, the
availability of land and the modalities of sharing it would have been known and agreed
upon. The consequence of this lack of planning was the cessation of the new state planting
and the frustration of relocated farmers, which prompted some to go back to their original
areas (at the cost of the plantations). In view of the significant difficulties in ensuring
inter-ministerial, inter-sectoral coordination, and given the sensitivity of the situation, the
preparation of adequate resettlement plans, addressing key issues, e.g., health and
education services, allocation of land, etc.. should have been ensured earlier on; a
cooperative/ consultative process, whereby, the plans were drawn up with the participation
of the relevant central Government functionaries on the one hand, and the affected
communities on the other hand, would have contributed to enhancing the soundness of the
resettlement plans.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.   The closure of the project coincided with the implementation of the regionalization
program of the Government and the plantations have subsequently been divided among
three regions (para. 26). With regard to the community forestry plantations, these are likely
to be sustainable because beneficiary farmers are eager to see these prosper, and thereby
share in the returns from these plantations, either in terms of increased amenities such as
fuelwood for the community and/or in terms of cash. The communities are not likely to
accept the deterioration of the forests now that they have understood the high economic
value of the plantations, and particularly in view of the liberalization of marketing channels
and prices.



-8 -
22.   The sustainability of the State forests will depend on the level of commitment of
the regional public sector staff to the plantations, which in turn would in large measure be
affected by the level of Government budgetary resources made available for forest
management and conservation activities. From the discussions held with the senior project
staff in the regions, there appears to be a high level of commitment to manage and protect
the plantations as well as maintain the roads. They foresee little difficulty in obtaining
funds. If necessary, they propose to use the proceeds from the sale of forest products for
supporting the necessary management/conservation activities. Within the plantations
around Addis Ababa there is an uncertainty about 1,300 ha of State plantations which are
proposed to be set up as a national park with replacement of eucalyptus by indigenous
species such as juniper. A final decision on this matter has not been taken, but at least some
450 ha of eucalyptus plantation of this area adjacent to a historical palace and a church are
in danger of being felled and converted into a national park.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
23.   The Bank's performance at appraisal was not very satisfactory in that: it did not
identify unencumbered plantation sites early on; it accepted the deferral of an aerial
mapping exercise and a socio-economic study of the project areas until after appraisal (in
fact these surveys, which were essential for forest/plantation site planning purposes were
undertaken only after project effectiveness); it accepted, the rather ad hoc relocation of
farmers without an adequate resettlement plan having been developed; the project
implementation arrangements were not designed to ensure adequate coordination between
the PMU and other relevant technical/administrative bodies, leading to the former's
institutional isolation. There were a total of 10 supervision missions including the mid-
term review. The supervision missions sought to address the key issues affecting the
project's performance by taking these up with the Government, and directing their efforts
towards facilitating project implementation. Bank staff were also cognizant of the
country's political and social situation and its slowing effect on the project. However, at
times a firmer stance was needed, particularly with regard to ensuring that the PCC met
regularly, and in enforcing compliance with the covenant that required Government to raise
the prices of fuelwood and poles (to allow the recovery of plantation establishment costs),
or to ensure the preparation of adequate resettlement plans. Despite its economic
importance to growers and to the welfare of settlers, respectively, the former covenant was
never complied with, although MNRDEP did submit a proposal to the Council of Ministers
in 1993. On one occasion however, IDA did enforce a covenant, when it briefly suspended
disbursements in 1991 on account of delayed submission of audit reports.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.  In view of the political and social constraints that prevailed in the country, GOE's
performance has been moderately satisfactory, although the credit for the project's
achievements should be attributed more to the committed PMU staff, than to support from
the responsible line ministry. Non compliance with the covenants on forest product



- 9 -
marketing and pricing and on resettlement plans, may be cited as examples of major
shortfall in the Borrower's performance. Delays in procurement, in releasing funds and in
submitting audited accounts to IDA were other shortcomings in project implementation.
The delay in clearing the last supervision mission and the premature closing of the project
may also be interpreted as GOE's reduced commitment to the project.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.   Although the project was not implemented in accordance with the guidelines
developed at appraisal, and its execution was riddled with problems and shortcomings, the
overall outcome of the project may be deemed satisfactory. It has successfully increased
the supply of wood products and made a positive impact on the environment in terms of
soil and water conservation; a tangential benefit has been the increased wildlife,
particularly several species of birds, which have been attracted to the new plantation areas.
The positive environmental impact of the project is also vividly illustrated by the greenry
of the rehabilitated and new plantation areas around Addis Ababa. Based on beneficiary
reports, the financial returns from the State supervised community plantations have
become extremely attractive to farmers, particularly following the liberalization of wood
product prices. The project has also made a significant contribution to the national
economy by supplying highly demanded construction poles and fuelwood (para 6).
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
26.   The project is now divided among three administrative regions (regions 3, 4 and
14). Within the three regions, the forestry project is being looked after by the respective
Natural Resources Bureaus. Since the transfer of the project to the regions was effected
fairly recently, the plans for future operations (of the activities initiated under the project)
are still being developed. To avoid the shortage of operational funds, however, the regions
are inclined to establish a system of self-financing schemes, such as, utilizing the proceeds
from the sale of plantation output for meeting operating costs. The revenues thus
generated may be used either directly by the regional offices for the management/
conservation of the plantations, or alternately, management agreements with private
enterprises may be concluded for this purpose.
I. LESSONS LEARNED
27.         The following key lessons emerged from the project's implementation
experience:
(a)   Unencumbered plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal, and
the first year's plantation areas should already be demarcated before project
commencement in order to expedite plantation implementation.



- 10-
(b)    Relocation/resettlement activities should not commence before preparing
adequate resettlement plans. In view of the significant difficulties in
ensuring inter-ministerial, inter-sectoral coordination, and given the inherent
sensitivity and complexity of the subject, the preparation of adequate
resettlement plans, addressing key issues, e.g., health and education
services, allocation of land, etc., should have been ensured earlier on; a
cooperative/ consultative process, whereby. the plans were drawn up with
the participation of the relevant central Government functionaries on the one
hand, and the affected communities on the other hand, would have
contributed to development of sound resettlement plans, and ensured a more
efficient and equitable relocation process under the project.
(c)    Establishing State plantations in densely populated areas is likely to lead to
low survival rates. However, the risk of failure is greater if farmers are
evicted to give way to plantations.
(d)   A separate project management structure (without an adequate coordinating
mechanism in place), may lead to its institutional isolation from the
established  technical/administrative   bodies,  hence  reducing   its
effectiveness.
(e)   If a separate management unit is to be established, then it is better that it
acquires full management and operational autonomy without being obliged
to refer to other entities for approval or clearance on its mandated activities.
However, even then there is a need lor a coordination mechanism that can
enable its linkage with the technical and administrative line agencies and for
sustainable management after project closing.
(f)   It should be ensured that project covenanits are either complied with, or
formally excluded if they are unattainable. Retaining an unfulfilled
covenant throughout the implementation period, albeit with continuous
reminders, amounts to de-emphasizing the usefulness/seriousness of that
covenant.
(g)   An enhanced monitoring capability should be designed for projects with
environmental/natural resource conservation components, that not only
reviews physical achievements, but also assesses the environmental impact
of the project through key indicators and studies/ baseline surveys.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was estimated at 16% during appraisal. At project completion
the ERR has been estimated at 19 percent. Assumptions and basis for the economic analysis are given
in Appendix C. The re-estimated ERR is slightly higher than what was calculated at appraisal, because
project costs were lower than appraisal estimates and the project's output mix was changed in favour
of construction poles, which are of higher value compared to fuelwood. The construction boom has
boosted the demand for construction poles, and the bulk of project output was sold as poles instead of
fuelwood. In addition, the unexpected large area of up-graded plantations boosted economic returns,
mitigating the shortfalls in the establishment of new plantations.

FORESTRY PROJECT
APPENDIX A
AIDE-MEMOIRE






Appendix A
Aide-Memoire
A. Introduction
1.     A missionl/" from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme visited Ethiopia from 9th to
26th of January 1995 to prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the above project. The
mission worked mairly with the Ministry of Natural Resources, Development and Environmental
Protection (MNRDEP) and with the Regional administrations 3, 4 and 14 now responsible for the project
plantations. The mission held meetings with the Ministries of Finance, Energy and External Economic
Cooperation. Field visits were made to the three regions and discussions held with farmers and community
leaders.
2.     The mission is grateful to the officials of the MNRDEP and the former project staff for their
assistance in gathering the necessary information and organising successful field visits. Preliminary
impressions and findings of the mission are presented below, and are subject to modifications following
detailed analysis later on.
B. Background
3.     The forestry project, generally known as Addis - Bah Forestry Project, was appraised in
November 1985 and approved on 3rd July 1986. Subsequently, an IDA credit consisting of SDR 39.6
million (US$ 45 million) was signed on 28th August 1986 and became effective on 19th December 1986.
The credit, to be disbursed over 6 years, covered about 72% of the total project costs, the remainder was
to be financed by the Government of Ethiopia (GOE). The credit was closed in June 1994, after a one
year extension.
4.     The main objectives of the project were to increase fuelwood and building poles supplies to the
cities of Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar through new plantings and rehabilitating degraded forests. Project
components consisted of:
a) State forestry programme comprising: i) rehabilitation of 13,000 ha of existing coppice plantations; ii)
establishment of 11,000 new plantations and iii) construction of 17 forest villages to accommodate families
relocated from the new plantation sites.
b) Community forestry programme comprising: i) rehabilitation of 3,720 ha of existing plantations to be
managed by the Urban Dwellers Associations (UDAs) and Peasants Associations (PAs); ii) establishment,
/ Consisted of Messrs. Pietros Kidane (Mission Leader, Economist) and Chris Davis (Forestry Specialist). Mr Paul Ryan,
World Bank Task Manager for the Project, joined the mission part time from 9th - 12th January 1995.

under project supervision, of 1,600 ha of new plantation on PA land; iii) planting 250 ha by individual
peasants in their homesteads and around public institutions, and iv) establishment of 8,440 ha of
plantations for PA fuelwood self sufficiency through extension and supply of free planting materials.
c) Institution strengthening comprising: i) applied research in improved plantation management, nursery
techniques and extension methods; ii) overseas and in service training; iii) establishment of a Project
Management Unit (PMU) including a Monitoring and Evaluation Division; and iv) provision of 102 man
months of technical assistance in forestry and project management.
C. Inplementation Experience and Results
5.     The project start up was slow as a result of the combined effects of delays in the construction of
project buildings and other civil works, procurement of equipment and vehicles, as well as low and / or
untimely government budgeting. The project provided a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to undertake
two studies: aerial photographs with map preparation and a socio - economic study of the project areas to
enable the project to define the new plantation sites and to plan community forestry areas. However these
studies were undertaken only after the project became effective, hence defeating the purpose of the PPF.
Project implementation was further slowed down due to the change in Ethiopia's socio - economic policy
in 1990 from a centrally planned to a mixed economy in which farmers were no longer obliged to
surrender their land for forest plantations, and in 1991 the change of government following the collapse of
the previous regime. A summary of the project implementation by component is given below.
6.     State Plantations. Only 34 % of the planned new plantations was achieved. The main difficulty in
attempting this planting was the lack of availability of sizeable blocks of plantable land. Of the envisaged
17 forest villages to be built together with the necessary social amenities promised, including clinics and
schools, about 12 were constructed, and instead of 4,200 families only 620 were settled. However, some
of the clinics and schools which were built by the project suffered delays in construction and
commissioning as the Health and Education Ministries did not have advance knowledge about the project's
programmes and were not involved in their planning. Some of those persons resettled expressed the
opinion that they were better off in their original places, whilst others returned to their original places and
devastated the established plantations.
7.     Conununity Forestry. About 4,950 ha of community forests were established. The bulk of these
are supervised community forestry programmes, where the project established and managed the
plantations on land provided by the PAs and UDAs. At harvest and sale of the trees, the project recovers
its costs incurred from the farmers. Supervised community forestry is generally successful and farmers are
happy with these arrangements as they utilize the income received for community development and any
surplus for individual use. Homestead, institution and individual community planting have given mixed
results with the latter having the upper hand, particularly after the liberalization of prices and the
emergence of peace in the country.

8.     Forest Research. Achievements in forestry research were modest, because a number of trials
have been inconclusive. Some research advice notes were prepared by the project in the fields of nursery
soil mixtures, fertilizer applications and on planting and tending techniques. However the usefulness in
terms of increased benefits and/or decreased costs in plantation operation is not indicated. The research
component was totally under the PMU and operated in isolation from the State Forestry Research Institute
(FRC or SRC) - contrary to the original intentions of the project.
9.     Training. The staff training programme was carried out reasonably successfully, albeit with the
modification of the overseas degree training where only 3 of the programmed 10 degree courses were
achieved. This was mainly due to the opening of the forestry degree education programme in Ethiopia
during project implementation and the difficulty in sparing staff for several years of overseas training from
the already limited number of available foresters.
10.    Project management. The PMU  was established reasonably promptly and commenced its
operations on time. However, the PMU's initial efforts were directed towards the resolution of the issues
related to the construction of civil works, procurement of vehicles and other equipment, as well as in
obtaining adequate and timely funds from GOE. It was only after one year and a half of the project
effectiveness that planting and other field works began. In retrospect it could be said that the PMU was
seriously encumbered with too many tasks as it was responsible for all the technical and managerial
aspects of the project and for monitoring and evaluation of its operations, albeit with important technical
assistance inputs. A less than expected performance of the latter reduced the effectiveness of the PMU
particularly in plantation management, research and monitoring and evaluation. Little transfer of technical
knowhow has taken place from the technical assistance to the PMU staff.
11.    Although the PMU was a separate establishment from the line Ministry, it was nevertheless,
dependent on the Ministry for obtaining its budget, procurement of equipment and material and for
finalizing overseas fellowships. This situation made the PMU a less autonomous entity in spite of its
separate set up from the Ministerial structure, and emphasized its vulnerability. Delays in implementation
were often caused by low government budgetary allocations and slow Ministerial procurement
procedures. The Project Coordinating Committee has rarely met and did little to resolve these problems,
thus depriving the project of a necessary link with the technical departments of the MNRDEP.
Nevertheless, project management is to be commended for being able to maintain project activities during
the difficult times of the past regime and in protecting the project assets during the civil war.
12.    Mid Term Review/Project Reappraisal. Because of the war situation, the envisaged mid term
review took place only in 1992. during the review it was spelled out that the project faced difficulties in
attaining several of the plantation objectives (para 4.). Redesigning the project was, therefore suggested by
focussing on two main components: State plantation development and management and private/
institutional forestry. While the former was to be limited to plantation management, the latter was meant
to plant trees and to develop a framework for extension forestry. This project reappraisal was accepted by
both GOE and IDA and its closing date was extended by 18 months. However before it could be
3

Implementanon Completon Report
Appendlix A: Aide-Memoire
implemented, the Government changed its view about the project and requested IDA to close the project
six months before the new closing date. The reason for the change was to pursue the new Government
policy based on the dynamic role the private sector would be playing in plantation activities.
13.   It was apparent from the mid term review that the project had several design weaknesses. First of
all the project did not identify any planting land for new State plantations assuming that this would be
made easily available by relying on the previous regime's persuasive methods in relocating people from
plantable land. Little concern was given to the feelings and views of the farmers that would be moved
from their lands (the socio - economic study was completed only after the project became effective).
Secondly, the project should have anticipated that the envisaged settlement villages would be viewed as
part of the Government's notorious villagization programme, and thus detrimental to the project's good
image and sustainability of forcefully planted areas. A third weakness in project design was the
establishment of the PMU as a separate structure from the line Ministry but at the same time totally
dependent on the Ministry for administrative and management aspects as indicated above. In addition the
separate status of the PMU has not allowed it to benefit from the technical line departments as it tended to
operate in isolation.
14.    Project Cost and Financing. Total project costs amounted to about Birr 74.9 million or US $
26.8 million, that is 58% and 43% of the appraisal estimates respectively. IDA disbursed about US $ 22.0
million (SDR 16.4 million), financing 82% of the total project costs. About US $ 34 million or SDR 23.2
million of the credit remains undisbursed. The reasons for the lower project costs is a combination of
lesser accomplishment of project targets, particularly new plantations, and an overestimate of project costs
at appraisal, especially the civil works. The relatively low costs in US $ terms is mainly due to the
devaluation of the Birr starting from 1992, while the availability of more US $ in the credit is due to the
depreciation of the US $ vis-a-vis the SDR.
15.    Project Impact. The project has made a positive impact on the environment in terms of soil and
water conservation and attracting wildlife, particularly several species of birds in the new plantation areas.
The impact of project rehabilitated and planted areas around Addis Ababa is vivid by the greening
coverage of the surrounding hills. Based on beneficiary reports, the financial returns from the project
supervised community plantations have become extremely attractive to farmers after the prices of wood
products were liberalized. Although not quantified, the project has also made a significant contribution to
the national economy by supplying the highly demanded construction poles and fuelwood.
16.    Borrower and Bank Performance. Bank supervision missions were helpful in attempting to
solve the problems faced by the project by directing their efforts to induce GOE to facilitate project
implementation. They were also understanding of the country's political and social situation and its
slowing effect on the project. However, this lenient attitude was sometimes pushed too far, such as for
example, the negligence in enforcing the covenant that required GOE to raise the prices of fuelwood and
poles to allow at least the recovery of plantation establishment costs. In spite of its importance in financial
returns to the grower and incentive for communities to plant trees, this covenant was never met. Only on

one occasion has IDA enforced a covenant, when it briefly suspended disbursement in 1991 on account of
delayed submission of audit reports.
17.    Within the political and social constraints that prevailed in the country, GOE has generally
performed satisfactorily, although some deficiencies were recorded here and there. In particular, mention
can be made of the lack of fulfilment of the covenant on forest product marketing and pricing. Delays in
procurement and limiting budget to the project should also be considered as GOE's shortcomings in
project implementation. The relationship between GOE and IDA was generally cordial throughout the
implementation period with the possible exception of the small friction in the occasion of the last
supervision mission, following GOE's delay in clearing the mission.
D. Future Operations and Main Lessons Learned
18.    The project is now split among three administrative regions. Within the three regions, the Addis-
Bah project is being looked after by the respective Natural Resources Bureaux. The likely risk to the
sustainability of the project plantations is the lack of adequate funds to carry out the necessary silvicultural
operations and protection. Since the transfer of the project to the regions has just taken place, specifics of
future operations are still being worked out. The regions are inclined to establish a system of self
fmancing schemes to avoid the shortage of operational funds such as, for example, utilizing plantation
resources for this purpose, or entering into management agreements with third parties.
19.    Within region 14 in the Addis Ababa area, there is an uncertainty about 1,300 ha of State
plantation which is proposed as a national park with replacement of eucalypt by indigenous species such as
Juniper. Discussions between the Heritage group proposing the park and the government are at the
preliminary stage and little is known on the future operations of these plantations. It appears certain that at
least 450 ha of the area would be clearfelled to make way for the national heritage park.
20.    Main Lessons Learned:
Unencumbered plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal and the first year's
plantation areas should already be demarcated before project commencement to expedite
plantation implementation.
Project activities should shy away from  politically or ideologically controversial
programmes such as the villagization programme, as this could become a liability to the project.
Establishing State plantations in densely populated areas is a risky business for the trees.
But the risk becomes almost a certainty if farmers have been evicted to give way to the
plantation.

ETHIOPIA: Forestry Project (Cr 1722-EI)
Inplenenralion Completion Report
Appenlix A: Aide-Meroire
A separate project management structure may induce it to work in isolation from the
established technical bodies and hence forego the knowledge of up to date information and
technical findings.
High level support and guidance to the project is unlikely to come forward if the Project
Coordination Committee is inoperative.
If a separate management is to be established, then it is better that it acquires full
management and operational autonomy without being obliged to refer to other entities for
approval or clearance on its mandated activities.
Project components related to subjects pertaining to other Ministries such as Education
and Health should be formulated and implemented in collaboration with the ministries in order
to avoid unnecessary delays during project execution.
Project covenants should either be met or formally relaxed as continued reminders
thrughout the implementation period amount to de-emphasizing the usefulness of covenants.
E. Next Steps
21.    Upon return to Rome, the mission will prepare a draft ICR for submission to the IDA by the end
of February 1995. GOE is preparing its own completion report which will be submitted to IDA in due
course for incorporation in the final ICR.

Notes on Forestry and Project Implementation
A. Plantations
General
1.    Plantations prior to the Addis Bah project.Eucalvptus globulus forms over 99% of the plantation
species planted within 100 km of Addis Ababa and has been grown there for over 100 years outgrowing
all other species ( > 25 m3/ha/yr) planted there. At lower altitude and rainfall in Bahir Dar E. lobulus is
replaced by E.camaldulensis which grows at > 20 m3/ha year. Prior to the project commencement, ADB
and UNSO fuelwood plantations of E.globulus were being established around the Addis Ababa region.
Before the project start, about 20,000 ha of old degraded coppice of E.globulus existed but were
unmanaged and subject to unrestricted cutting by illegal fuelwood cutters, often on rotations of as little
as one year. A large area of these plantations were rehabilitated under the project.
Project Plantation Plan and Actual
2.    The project plan in 1986 was for the State to plant and/or rehabilitate 24,000 ha (11,000 ha new
planting, 13,000 ha of rehabilitation) of which 20,000 ha would be in Addis and the rest in Bahir Dar.
At the same time 14,010 ha of Community plantations (10,290 ha new plantation and 3,720 ha
rehabilitation) would be planted - 10,325 ha at Addis Ababa and 3,685 at Bahir Dar. At project end in
June 1994, new State plantations covered only about 3,330 ha. At Bahir Dar, some 200 ha of plantation
were destroyed and reconverted to farmland by dispossessed peasants after 1991/92. Of the SAR State
rehabilitation target of 13,000 ha some 6000 ha was to be gap planted and 7,000 ha to be protected. In
the event the corresponding actuals were 3,210 ha (54% of SAR target) and 23,961 ha taken into
protection (292% SAR target). Protection means redemarcating plantation boundaries and appointing
forest guards to watch the areas. Total community forest areas planted were 4,940 ha (35% of SAR
target) of which 860 ha were rehabilitated areas (23% SAR target). Community plantations in Addis
Ababa were 3,860 ha and Bahir Dar 1,085 ha. The project's early lack of plantation progress in
following the project plan may be attributed to its inability to acquire timely access to planting land. Land
was still occupied by peasants who resisted enforced villagization by the government. Plantations by type
and year are in attached table 1
Additional Area
3.           In 1994 Menagesha - Suba forest 15 km west of Addis Ababa was taken into the project
area. It consists of gross area of 9557 ha of which 3000 ha were are suitable for new afforestation and
the remainder were existing natural forest and plantations. Project expenditure on Menagesha - Suba was
incurred only in 1994. The ADB plantations amounting to some 12,100 ha were incorporated into the
project in the last few months of the project in 1994.

Plantation Management
4.    Plantation espacement in state plantations is generally 1.5 m x 1.5 m on level ground and 2 m
x 2 m on slopes, whilst community planting is I m x I m or even less to maximise the number of poles.
Increasingly, building poles have assumed greater importance and income than bulk cubic metres of
fuelwood. With thorough ground preparation, fertilization with 25 gm of DAP in year 1 and sometimes
another 40 gm of DAP year 2 and weeding in years I and 2 of establishment, annual increments have
been up to 27m3/ha per year but probably average some 24m3/halyear for E. globulus coppice on 6 year
coppice rotation on good sites. Corresponding average for E. camaldulensis appears to be 20 rm3/ha/year
on good sites in Bahir Dar (much less on vertisols). These figures assume good stocking rates and most
plantations are well stocked.
Rehabilitation of Old Coppice
5.    Rehabilitated plantations at Addis Ababa have been greatly improved with a wide range of age
classes and sizes instead of the uniform short scrub of 7 years previously which was never allowed to
develop.
Plantation Inputs and Yields
6.    The inputs vary with the type of plantation and espacement. A typical 1.5 m x 1.5 m E.globulus
plantation with full treatment to give at least 25 m3/ha/year may have the following inputs:

7.    In practice the shoot reduction and coppice felling may be done by contractors. Yields vary with
demands for poles or fuel. Currently most popular are 4 m poles of 6 cm butt diameter. Likely seedling
yields may be 70 % poles of various sizes at year 6 or some 2645 poles and the remainder fuelwood. In
the coppice rotations there will be some 9500 poles from 2 to 3 coppice shoots per stool. Intermediate
yields from shoot reduction in years 8 and 10 would amount to small poles and branchwood of 3 to 5 rn3
on each occasion.

8.    In the "Without Project" situation of up-graded or rehabilitated forests, the expected yield would
be taken every 2 years and would amount to about 10 m3 per ha - i.e. 5 m3/ha per year, due to the
impoverishment of the stools through too frequent cutting.

Future of Plantations
9.    Areas handed over to the regions at the end of the project include 16,320 ha of plantation (12,160
ha to region 4 and 4160 ha to region 14). The fate of the plantations will depend on whether the regions
will turn them into self financing forestry enterprises or community supervised plantations. Region 14
is facing possible dismemberment into Addis Ababa city building expansion and a 1300 ha park.
B. Research and Training
Research
10.   Research objectives. General support for the forestry research programme of the State Forest
Research Council (SRC) was supplied by SIDA from 1986. Research conducted under the project was
therefore to concentrate on applied research to assist project management to improve project
implementation and plantation technology. The Project Management Unit was responsible for research
development. It was to provide a research head, two assistants, two tabulators and support staff and to
work in close collaboration with SRC to ensure that project research was integrated with the national
research programme. Equipment including vehicles, computer and a greenhouse were to be provided.
Technical Consultancy services were to be provided to assist in trial designs and to forge links with
international research organisations and to promote visits of project research staff to these organisations.
11.   Research organisation and management. The project research unit was formed consisting of
the head of research, 2 foresters, 6 enumerators, a nursery foreman and between 1987 - 91 a total of 14
mm of a research consultant. Though SRC and the project offices were adjacent to one another and the
staff well known to one another very little liaison took place and the project worked in isolation from
other research bodies / institutes. Only about half the planned equipment was obtained and less than 1.1
million Birr was expended over 6 years compared to the budgeted 3.8 million Birr. Contacts were made
and maintained with research institutes outside Ethiopia, namely CSIRO Forest Research, Australia, FD
Michigan University, ICRAF Nairobi, NFTA and FFRED Hawaii. Tenuous local links were made with
ILCA in Addis Ababa and Alemaya University. Only the head of research spent 3 months in the OFI
Oxford on a research course overseas.
12.   Research achievements. Original research priorities were to improve: nursery techniques,
vegetative propagation by cuttings, soil site preparation including subsoiling and ploughing, fertilizer trials
of different fertilizers and rates of application, project species performance, spacing and rotation length,
green firebreaks, shelterbelt and windbreak demonstrations, fodder production and agroforestry
techniques. These were to take place on project sites and some trials would involve international
institutions. About 33 trials were written into the project research plan covering some of the above
subjects and also species trials, weeding, termite control, development of seed stands, utilization,
permanent sample plots and monitoring of climate, rivers and fauna and flora in project plantations. Of
the 33 trials, only about 30% were completed and only 11 have been published as Research Advice Notes
(RANs) for guidance to the project staff - the only communication they have received from research.
RANs do not include basic trial information including summary data which could help the reader assess
the research findings objectively. Of the 11 RANs, 4 concern nursery soil mixtures, 2 concern DAP
5

Implementation Completion Repon
Appendix B: Notes on Forestry and Project Implementation
fertilizer field application, the others covering optimum size of planting stock, plantation mulching, early
planting, numbers of coppice shoots per stool, and manual soil preparation in wet and sloping land.
13.   Gaps in basic research knowledge in the project. After being highlighted in the mid term
review report it is disappointing to note that action was not taken to fill the gaps identified by the report:
there is a conspicuous lack of information on growth rates of project plantation sites and though some
PSPs were made in 1989/90, only a few measurements of height growth were made up to 1993, whilst
the other growth parameters of basal area and volumes were last made in coppice areas in 1990. Few
species trials or species mixture trials have been done and no records and analysis of results were written
up; no expansion of the current high altitude afforestation trials; no registration of plus trees and no
calorific values of species made; no cuttings trials were done; no mechanized soil preparation trials were
carried out.
Training
14.   Training plan. Additional planned staffing for the project was to include 3 MSc, 6 BSc, 39
Diplomates, 179 Certificate and 36 Mertule Maryam (Community) persons. The training programme was
geared to provide these staff. It planned to carry out the training set out in Annex I Appendix 3 of the
SAR:
a)     10 undergraduates to attend overseas University for 4 years, in project years 1 - 5.
b)    60 to 70 Grade 12 persons to attend Alemaya University or Wondo Genet Forestry
Training College for 2 month courses in silviculture in project years 1 to 3.
c)     10 to 16 Grade 12 persons to attend 2 month courses at Mertule Maryam National centre
for Community Forestry in extension techniques in project years 1 - 3.
d)     Specialized training for 10 Site and Block managers with 2 weeks at Alemaya or Wondo
Genet on silviculture and large plantation management in year 2 and with annual week
long seminars at project sites in years 3 - 6. The same schedule for 24 Rangers but
concentrating on nursery work, fire protection, erosion control and plantation soil
preparation. Some 180 Technicians were to undergo week long courses given by guest
lecturers on the same subjects as for rangers but in years 4 and 5 only.
e)     About 10 Community Foresters were to attend an introductory month long course on
Extension Techniques and Agroforestry at Mertule Maryam in project year 2 and a week
study tour at ICRAF, Nairobi. Additionally , 36 foresters per year from project year 2 -
6, were to attend local one week seminars in extension services and agroforestry work
to train them as contact agents with farmers.
15.   Training output. The actual staff training and development varied somewhat from the plan,
basically because many of the academic courses were not provided both overseas and at Alemaya
University or Woldo Genet College or the staff could not be released from key duties for training. As
6



ETHIOPIA: Forestry Project (Cr. 1722-ET)
Implementation Completion Report
Appendix B: Notes on Forestry and Project Implementation
a result, training tended to be in short courses and study tours. Community Forestry and farmer training
was very little and that after the project mid term review and shortly before project closure.
a)    Graduate  training  overseas. At project commencement, GOE  preferred  that
undergraduates be trained in country at Alemaya University which had in the meantime
initiated degree courses, rather than overseas. In the event Alemaya did not have the
necessary staff to carry out the courses and the project management said they could not
afford to lose the services of some key staff to go for long training. As a result only 3
undergraduates, out of 10 scheduled, went for overseas training in the Philippines and
only for 3 years.
b)     Short training and study tours.
i)     Overseas. The Project Manager (PM), Site managers, Research Officer, Senior
Community Officer, training Officer, Block Managers and Senior Rangers attended short
study tours of about 1 to 2 months in a variety of countries, mostly between 1988 and
1992. Countries included Brazil, Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland, Czechoslovakia and Korea.
The Research Officer attended the 3 month Research course at OFI Oxford UK in 1992.
Between 1989 and 1992 the PM, Research Officer, Accountants, Statisticians and
Secretaries had computer training of about one month duration.
ii)    Local. In 1992, 55 staff comprising Site Managers, Block Managers, Rangers and
Technicians attended 7 day refresher courses in Forestry. In the same year 30 senior staff
of the PMU, Site and Block Managers and experts conducted a 2 day workshop on
Project Objectives and Project Restructuring after the mid term review had changed the
nature of the project - emphasizing community forestry rather than State plantations.
c)    Junior staff training. Covered 30 nursery staff for 10 days on nurseries; 42 drivers for
2 days vehicle maintenance; 21 Rangers, Technicians or Foremen for 6 weeks on
motorcycle usage skills and maintenance; 9 storemen for 1 week on stores procedures;
1 Service head for 3 weeks on materials management and 2 persons for 3 weeks on audit
procedures. 37 staff attended 6 weeks of military training.
d)     Farmer training. In May - June 1993 some 337 farmers in Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar
were given a 3 day training course on basic forestry, nursery management, soil
conservation and agroforestry systems.
C. Technical Assistance
16.   The SAR allowed for 102 mm of Technical Assistance and this was used between 1987 and 1991.
The allocation to various experts was changed. The Financial controller was never recruited. The Senior
Forestry expert departed after 14 months of a proposed 24 months due at the request of GOE. A Forestry
Management Consultant was not originally listed, but was recruited for three spells between 1987 and
7



ETHIOPIA: Forestry Project (Cr. 1722-ET)
Implementation Completion Report
Appendix B: Notes on Forestry and Project Implementation
1989. The Monitoring and Evaluation expert originally allocated 24 months, assumed many of the duties
outside of M & E and served for 44 months.
17.    The technical assistance component was modified during implementation and this was not for the
better. First of all the financial controller was not recruited and this has entailed a lot of difficulties in
preparing project accounts promptly prepared and audited in line with the Development Credit
Agreement. Secondly, following a disagreement with project management the leader of the technical
assistance team had to leave the project prematurely only after 14 months of stay. Since no replacement
was required by the project management, the latter was obliged to re-distribute the tasks of the technical
assistance team. The forester involved with the monitoring and evaluation was therefore made to work
for a total of 44 months in different disciplines. In addition the forestry specialist was employed only for
14 months, instead of 24, which may explain the inconclusive results of some research works. At the
Mid-Term Review technical assistance for improved plantation management, mapping and inventory of
plantations, and forestry extension practices was agreed to, but was not recruited due to the premature
curtailing of activities, and little implementation of the agreed to action plan.
D. Labour Costs
18.    At the project start the cost of unskilled labour was Birr 3 per day in State plantations and Birr
2.3 in community plantations. In 1990 the cost had become Birr 3.50 per day and in 1995 is Birr
4.50/day. Most of the forestry operations are, however, based on piecework or rather task work, rather
than day work. Thus the norms for 4 jobs are: Birr 0.01, Birr 0.08, Birr 0.06 and Birr 0.06 per unit for
pot filling, pitting, planting and for cultivation and weeding respectively. Daily rates for some workers
are as shown below:

20.   The Socio Economic Study of 1987 was supposed to have been done under the World Bank's
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) prior to project start. In the event the project began in December 1986
and the study began in early 1987. The study identified that without the cooperation of local people the
project would have to operate in a hostile environment like parts of the ongoing ADB fuelwood project.
The persons who would be resettled stated that they did not want valley bottom lands as those resettled
in the ADB areas, as these were generally sticky vertisols. They preferred the gentle sloping land above
the bottoms. The study recommended planting land steeper than 30%. On upgrading of coppice areas the
study saw little but future problems with disaffected fuelwood cutters and squatters and overcutting. The
community approach to developing peri urban plantations would be more appropriate.
21.   The Marketing of Fuelwood and Poles for Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar Study of 1989 was useful
at the time as a means to get the market prices for forest produce upgraded to meet the covenant agreed
between GOE and the World Bank. The study was given to the Minister responsible for the project but
without result in its purpose.
22.   The Study for the Redesign of Addis Bah Forestry Development Project of 1992 was carried out
in close association with the project management. It was the basis of a reorientation from State planting
and community planting to a consolidation of the State planted area with management and continued and
increased planting with Farm Forestry under the Community forestry prograrmme promoted with a rapid
expansion of the State Forestry extension service. It did not come to fruition as the Government decided
to close the project prematurely.

Note on Economic Analysis
General
1.     The project aimed at increasing the supply of fuetwood and construction poles and protecting
the environment. These objectives have been achieved. However, the expected production mix of 70%
fuelwood and 30% construction poles was reversed, probably due to the construction boom that has
followed the end of civil war and the change of government. This production mix has resulted in
increased incomes to producers and better returns to the economy, given the higher value of
construction poles compared to fuelwood.
Production
2.     The plantations under the project can be divided into two broad categories: i) new plantations
established by the project and ii) rehabilitated old plantations. Under the new plantations, State
forestry, community plantations and individual self help plantations can be distinguished. Again within
the rehabilitated forest plantations, up-grading of coppice plantations - entailing filling of gaps - and
simple management of old plantations were carried out. All these plantation types have different
management approaches and incremental yields are different. Yield estimates of the project plantations
are given in Appendix B. Yields without the project for the new plantation sites has been assumed to be
zero because of difficulties in assessing the value of the grass grazed in the hilly areas. In any case,
since the area of the new plantation is only a small part of the total project plantations, the impact on
the overall project by way of overestimation of benefits will be minimal. Without project yields for the
existing degraded plantation have been assumed to be about 5 m3 per year of fuelwood bundles and
sticks. Based on the yield assumptions and rotations shown in Appendix B, total project production is
estimated as follows:

Project Costs
3.     Annual project costs have been provided by the project management and are shown in Tables 1
and 2 in Birr and US$ terms respectively. These costs are much lower than what was estimated at
appraisal. The main reason for this is the lower physical implementation of some components, such as
the establishment of plantations, or the reduced unit costs of others, such as civil works. Costs for
maintaining and protecting the forests after completion are estimated at Birr 37 per ha per year, i.e.
Birr 33 per ha for road maintenance and forest protection and Birr 4 per ha for overheads.
Market and Prices
4.     Demand for project output is increasing continuously, particularly for construction poles
triggered by the construction boom that resulted after the civil war ended and the Government changed.
Eucalyptus poles are still the most economic construction material compared to bricks, stones or to
hollow blocks made of cement and other materials. Therefore, medium to low income families are
relying on wooden poles for constructing their houses in Addis Ababa and in Bahir Dar. Poles
produced in Bahir Dar area are utilized also in distant wood deficit places, and may be transported as
far as 400 kms away. At present, most of the project output is sold as construction poles and the bulk
of it is expected to be consumed as construction poles in the future also. This is contrary to what was
expected at appraisal. It has been conservatively assumed that about two-thirds of the project produce
would be sold as construction poles and one third as fuelwood.
5.     After the liberalization of prices and deregulation of markets, poles and fuelwood are freely
sold above the indicative prices given by public marketing enterprises. Poles are sold in a number of
lengths from 2 m up to 15 m. The current market appears to be for the so called 6 cm diameter by 4 m
length, and it sells at about Birr 4.5 each, or Birr 360/m3, and at slightly higher prices in Bahir Dar.
Poles larger than 6 cm diameter by 4 m do not fetch a higher price per m3. Smaller building poles of
3-4 cm diameter by 4 m sell for Birr 1 each or Birr 355/m3. On the basis of the price structure assumed
at appraisal, that farm-gate price is equivalent to about 20% of the market price, the farm-gate price of
the 6 cm x 4 m  and 3 cm x 4 m would be Birr 72 per m3 and Birr 68 per m3 respectively. In order to
take account of the lower value poles, an average economic price of Birr 70 per m3 has been used in
the analysis.
6.     Fuelwood prices also vary widely particularly in the Addis Ababa market. Prices of bundles of
leaves and twigs sell for Birr 50-70 per mi, while that of more solid fuelwood vary from Birr 190 to
320 per m3 depending on the product quality and level of retail. Assuming the appraisal price structure,
the farmgate price of the latter would vary from Birr 38 to 64 per m3. However, in the case of
fuelwood, an economic price based on liquified petroleum gas (LPG) has been adopted, because, as
fuelwood gets scarce, more households are converting to LPG utilization, i.e., more than kerosene and
electricity. Therefore LPG has been assumed to be a substitute for fuelwood. As shown in table 4, the
economic value of fuelwood in LPG terms has been calculated at Birr 54 per m3 and this has been used
in the analysis.
Economic Rate of Return
7.     An economic rate of return has been calculated for the project over 32 years. Costs for the past
years were made current to January 1995 prices using the consumer price index. Project equipment has
been assumed to be totally depreciated. Because the project is divided into three regions, it was difficult
2



ETHIOPIA: Forestry Project (Cr. 1722-ET)
Implementation Completion Report
Appendix C: Note on Economic Analysis
to establish an equipment replacement schedule nor to apportion the costs of staff accurately. An annual
cost per ha per year has, therefore, been estimated (para.3) and applied over all the project plantations.
Output of construction poles and fuelwood were valued at Birr 70 and Birr 54 per m respectively using
the yields and rotations indicated in Appendix B.
8.     Based on these assumptions, an economic rate of return (ERR) of 19% has been calculated for
the project (table 5). The ERR is slightly higher than the 16% calculated at appraisal. This is mainly
due to the lower project costs and greater utilization of high value construction poles than expected at
appraisal.
Sensitivity Analysis
9.     Sensitivity analysis using switching values shows that the ERR is not sensitive to reasonable
increase in costs and decrease in benefits. Costs have to double or benefits to decrease by half for the
ERR to drop to 10% (table 5).

Appendix C: Note on Economic Analysis
Table 4. Calculation of Energy Equivalents for Wood
1. TOE Values (I TOE = 10,000 k/cal)
I Ton of Oil Equivalent (TOE) = 42.60 GJ
1 MWh Electricity = 3.60 GJ = 0.09 TOE
1,000 Nm3 of LPG   = 45.20 GJ = 1.08 TOE
1 ton Kerosene = 43.49 GJ = 1.04 TOE
I ton of dry Fuelwood = 13.51 GJ = 0.32 TOE
I ton of oven dry Fuelwood = 19.00 GJ = 0.45 TOE
2. Conversion Values
1 Nm3 LPG    =  1,080 kg
I Ton Kerosene = 1,100 litres
I Ton Fuelwood = 1.4 m3 solid
3. Prices of Energy Units in Addis Ababa
12.5 kg LPG = Birr 31.5
1 litre Kerosene = Birr 1
I KWh Electricity = Birr 0.15
4. To calculate forest gate price of fuelwood:
Fuelwood                        LPG
Heat value                   0.32 TOE b/                     1.08 TOE
Cooking efficiency           10%                             45%
Useful heat                  0.032                           0.49
Conversion                   1                               15
Price 2,520 Birr/tonne
I tonne of Fuelwood in LPG terms = Birr 168
or I m3 of Fuelwood in LPG terms = Birr 120 in Addis Ababa market
Deduct costs of:
Harvesting 4 md/m3  =  Birr 14/m3 solid
Transport 60 km tar road + )
30 km all weather road  +  ) = 52 Birr/m3
20 km forest tract
Sub-total:             66 Birr/m3
Forest gate price of fuelwood = 54 Birr/m3
a/ Liquified petroleum gas.
b/ 0.32 TOE is dor dry wood. For oven dry wood the value goes up to 0.45. Fuelwood users would be using
the former.
