supplies of fuelwood and building poles to Addis Ababa and\n            Bahir Dar by establishing plantations and upgrading existing\n            plantations in nearby areas.  Approaches used will be\n            through direct Government control and management of\n            plantation operations and through mobilizing the cooperation\n            of members of Peasant and Urban Dwellers' Associations\n            in community tree planting activities.  The project will\n            finance the establishment of 11,000 ha of state forest\n            plantations and the upgrading of 13,000 ha of existing\n            plantations occuring in large blocks.  Community forestry\n            activities will consist of three components.  They will\n            involve (i) state supervised forestry activities for the\n            establishment of 1,600 ha of new plantations and upgrading\n            of 1,000 ha of existing plantations; and (ii) self-help\n            forestry activities for the establishment of about 8,500 ha\n            of new plantations and upgrading of existing plantations; as\n            well as (iii) planting trees around homesteads and community\n            buildings, amounting altogether to about 250 ha.  The\n            project will further support applied forestry research aimed\n            at improving forest plantation technology, in-service and\n            post graduate training to update staff knowledge and provide\n            the necessary graduate forestry staff."}, "docdt": "1986-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
