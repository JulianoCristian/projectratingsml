MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN IRRIGATED LAND AND WATERSHED MANAGEMENT
PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Dominican Republic for the equivalent of US$28.0 million
to help finance a project for irrigated land and watershed management. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including five years' grace.
2.    Background. With rich natural resources, abundant labor, and close
proximity to major international markets, the Dominican Republic has good potential
as an export-oriented, private-sector-led economy. The country has conditions
favorable for agricultural development, especially of sugar, coffee, cocoa, tobacco,
beef, fruits, and vegetables. Despite this potential, agricultural growth has been
disappointing; growth in agricultural GDP averaged less than 1 percent in 1988-92.
Indeed growth in the entire economy has been disappointing, averaging 1.2 percent
on the period 1988-92. In real terms, GDP per capita was lower in 1992 than in
1980; the rapid growth of tourism and the free trade zones has not been enough to
offset the decline in merchandise exports, most of which are of agricultural origin.
3.    Agriculture accounts for 15 percent of the Dominican Republic's GDP and
over 40 percent of the country's earnings from merchandise exports. The
Government has invested heavily in irrigation. Investments in dams and irrigation
canals averaged about 10 percent of total Government expenditures on capital
formation in the last decade-- or about 40 percent of all public investments in
agriculture. Little attention has been paid, however, to infrastructure maintenance,
on-farm development, water management, and the development of productive support
services. The proposed project reflects the Government's shift of emphasis from
capital-intensive projects to projects that can generate quick returns without relying
heavily on the public sector. With the liberalization of prices and the transfer of the
marketing of most crops to the private sector, a full exploitation of irrigation offers
the best and quickest means to increase agricultural production and incomes. The
irrigated land and watershed management project is one of six priority projects
economywide for which the Government has sought support from the international
community.
4.    Project Design and Strategy. The project design has been kept small in
scope and as simple as possible to test the implementation capacity of the executing
agency and to ensure that the project can be implemented adequately in five years. If
implementation goes smoothly, a follow-up project with larger scope and scale is
envisaged. The project design incorporates lessons learned from other projects in the
Dominican Republic and LAC, as well as the more general lessons from wider Bank
lending in irrigation and watershed management. Generally, Bank lending has shown
a need to improve the operational performance and sustainability of irrigation
projects. The project would be the third Bank-financed investment in the agricultural



-2-
sector. It differs markedly, however, from the previous projects in that it would rely
primarily on private user associations instead of Government for implementation. In
a related shift, sustainable development and environmental issues would be addressed
as part of the project; rather than being considered as an "irrigation project", the
proposed project is more an irrigated land and watershed management project with
considerable emphasis on support services from the private sector.
5.    Project Objectives. The project's main objective is to improve small-farmer
income in the selected areas and to test and develop methodologies that can be
replicated nationwide both for efficient production support services, water
management, and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems and for sustainable
and environmentally sound watershed management. The criteria for selection of the
three irrigation areas were based on agronomic and economic potential as well as the
strength of local water users' associations, which are key project beneficiaries and
implementing agencies. The project will also rehabilitate and improve existing
irrigation systems and strengthen user associations for the development and
management of the selected irrigated areas and the Nizao watershed. The Nizao
watershed was chosen because of its importance to downstream hydroelectric and
irrigation facilities, and because of the existence of a strong, local NGO that will
play a key role in mobilizing community participation in the Project. Last, the
project should help reduce the fiscal cost of irrigation schemes to the Government
through appropriate cost-recovery policies.
6.    Project Description. The project would consist of five components: (i)
Irrigation Infrastructure (US$11.8 million, 36.8 percent of total base cost), financing
the completion or rehabilitation of irrigation distribution systems, the upgrading of
main canals and control structures, and the completion or rehabilitation of surface
drainage and land leveling in the selected areas; (ii) Nizao Watershed Management
Treatments (US$2.36 million, 7.4 percent of total base cost), using community grants
administered by a local NGO (ADESJO) to finance seeds or planting material and
fertilizer package for the first year for village communities who have agreed on a
village management plan on community lands and who will adopt the recommended
treatments; (iii) Agricultural Development (US$3.0 million, 9.3 percent of total base
cost), providing financing for farmer associations in the selected areas to contract
private firms or NGOs to provide adaptive research, technology transfer and
agricultural extension services; (iv) Institutional Development (US$13.93 million,
43.5 percent of total base cost), in order to strengthen both user groups and the
National Water Resources Institute (INDRHI); and (v) Studies (US$0.91 million, 3
percent of total base cost) of both a technical and policy nature, relevant to the
Project. Up to $800,000 of retroactive financing has been made available for project
start-up activities prior to effectiveness. This is justifiable on the grounds that
substantial amounts of international technical assistance will be necessary early in
Project implementation, for which foreign exchange is required. Schedule A of this
Memorandum presents Estimated Project Costs; Schedule B a Summary of Proposed
Procurement Arrangements and Disbursements Table; Schedule C the Project
Timetable and Key Project Processing Events; and Schedule D the Status of Bank
Group Operations in the Dominican Republic. Staff Appraisal Report No. 12233-
DO, dated January 19, 1995, is also attached.

7.    Project Implementation. INDRHI would be responsible for overall project
execution. INDRHI has generally strong implementation capacity, which is expected
to be further strengthened under Project's Institutional Strengthening component.
Canal maintenance and water management would be the responsibility of the water
user associations. Contractual arrangements would be made between water user
associations and specialized firms for support services, namely technology transfer
and applied research. Extension agents would be recruited directly by the different
user associations. Management of the Rio Nizao watershed component, to be
subcontracted to a local NGO (ADESJO), would involve the same approach,
emphasizing participation and responsibility of the farming community for designing
and implementing the pilot program. A project execution unit, comprising technical,
financial, and administrative staff, would be set up in INDRHI and would report
directly to the general manager. The project execution unit would contract a
specialized firm for the monitoring and evaluation of project activities as well as for
establishing an Environmental Monitoring System.
8.    Project Sustainability. The project would help strengthen the user
associations in the selected project areas. Considerable emphasis has been put on the
participation of the farming community for the design and the implementation of cost
recovery procedures. In the project irrigated areas, the rehabilitation and
improvement of the existing irrigation systems, as well as the improvement of
support services through contractual arrangements between users and private firms
would improve substantially small-farmer income and allow the Water User
Associations to finance full operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation systems.
While the realization of the full benefits in the watershed will take some 10 years,
the active participation of the beneficiaries during preparation and implementation
will build up their capacity to self manage the natural resources of the area on the
longer term.
9.    Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The Bank Group has financed
two projects in the irrigation subsector in the Dominican Republic: a US$13.0
million IDA credit for the Yaque del Norte Irrigation Project, approved in 1973, and
a US$27.0 million Bank loan for the Nizao Irrigation Project, approved in 1979.
Neither project was successful. Because of past institutional weaknesses of INDRHI
and a lack of counterpart funds, only 50 percent of civil works and 10 percent of
planned on-farm development were completed in the Yaque del Norte project. The
Nizao project's objectives were to rehabilitate 64 kilometers of main canal to serve
13,700 hectares and carry out on-farm development on 2,330 hectares of new land.
This last component was dropped because it proved uneconomical. The project
focused excessively on engineering aspects and little attention was paid to on-farm
development of the main project beneficiaries on 13,700 hectares. The main lesson
learned is that the approach to irrigation development has to be revamped. In light
of institutional weaknesses of INDRHI and of the Ministry of Agriculture, sustainable
irrigated farming development requires much greater involvement of the private
sector. Support for public institutions should be limited to ensuring adequate



monitoring, coherent policies, and a long-term investment strategy. At the same
time, the full participation of farmers and farmer groups is needed--a bottom-up
approach to development that utilizes farmner participation in program design and
implementation.
10.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with
the objectives enunciated in the Country Assistance Strategy that accompanies this
memorandum, of broadening the benefits of economic growth and promoting
sustainable natural resource use. There are currently no agricultural projects under
implementation in the Dominican Republic. The Bank is renewing its policy
dialogue on agriculture through in-depth sector work which has identified measures
that can be used to help agriculture benefit fully from the post 1990 macro reforms.
The report entitled: "Creating a Framework for Sustainable Agricultural Growth" has
been completed and will be presented shortly to the Government. The proposed
project will complement this sector work aimed at renewed dialogue and involvement
in the Dominican Republic through limited hands-on participation in an effort that
can achieve useful results while sectorwide issues are addressed concurrently through
our economic dialogue. The project builds on two lessons from the past: the need
for strong Government ownership, while encouraging as much private sector
participation as possible--after a careful assessment of risks. This approach is
preferable to relying on weak Government institutions. The Government has
assigned highest priorities to investments in the irrigation sector. The proposed
project also would enable the Bank to help the Government to strengthen and reorient
numerous supporting activities--extension, watershed management, cost recovery,
transfers of responsibility for operation and maintenance to farmer groups, land
titling, and defining the roles of the public and private sectors. The Bank has
extensive experience in these issues in Latin America and elsewhere. Moreover,
participation in the agriculture sector will help the Bank understand on-the-ground
constraints in agriculture thereby complementing our sector and policy dialogue.
11.   Major Actions Agreed during Negotiations. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with the Government on the following main actions:
(a)   Conditions of Effectiveness. Signing of the Subsidiary Agreement
transferring the proceeds of the loan to INDRHI; opening of a Project
Account with an initial deposit of US$1.0 million or its equivalent in
Pesos to cover counterpart expenditures; adoption of accounting
procedures satisfactory to the Bank; presentation of an Annual
Operating Plan for 1995 satisfactory to the Bank; establishment of a
project execution unit in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and fully
staffed.
(b)   Conditions of Disbursement. Before the Bank would disburse against
civil works expenditures in the respective areas, evidence would be
presented, satisfactory to the Bank, that INDRHI had submitted to the
appropriate agency the documentation required to initiate the legal
actions for the award of final land titles to at least 80 percent of
farmers living in each of the irrigated areas. The Bank would only



- 5 -
disburse against grants to communities for soil and water management
measures in the Nizao watershed once the INDRHI-ADESJO
Agreement and subgrant (ADESJO-community) agreements have been
signed, and only if community land management has been adequately
delegated to communities and a comprehensive natural resources
management plan for the selected microcatchment has been agreed by
INDRHI, the project execution unit, related communities, and the
Bank. For disbursement against the Agricultural Development
component, the criteria and procedures for carrying out the component
must have been finalized to the satisfaction of the Bank, and a short-
list of firms for participatory research and development support service
contracts must have been presented to the Bank for approval.
(c)   Other Agreements and Assurances. The Government would
establish a special account in the Banco Central de la Repuiblica
Dominicana in U.S. dollars; the Government would provide the
necessary annual counterpart funding to INDRHI according to an
annual work program which would be agreed with the Bank; INDRHI
would maintain the project execution unit with staffing, functions, and
organizational structure satisfactory to the Bank; and INDRHI shall
refrain from presenting to the Bank withdrawl applications in respect
of expenditures not included in the POA approved for the year in
question. Support service contracts would be signed no later than June
30, 1995. The irrigation control studies would be completed by no
later than December 31, 1995; the recommendations of such studies
would be reviewed jointly with the Bank by no later than June 30,
1996 and immediately thereafter, such recommendations would be
implemented in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. A land title
distribution program for the Nizao watershed would be prepared and
sent to the Bank before December 31, 1996 and implementation of the
program would start before June 30, 1997 to be completed before June
30, 1999. The design of management information systems of project
activities and of environmental aspects would be completed in a
manner satisfactory not later than December 31, 1995, and
immediately thereafter such systems would be implemented in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank. An action plan, satisfactory to the
Bank would be presented, to raise, by no later than June 30, 1996, the
level of water charges to recover all operation and maintenance costs,
and to introduce, by no later than June 30, 1997, measures that will
enable INDRHI to recover from farmers holding more than 6.3
hectares of irrigated land a significant portion of capital cost of the
investments. By no later than December 1997, a mid-term project
evaluation review and an end-evaluation review would be conducted by
the Government and the Bank; the Government would adjust the
project if necessary as agreed with the Bank.
12.   Pbverty Category. The project is classified as a program of targeted
interventions under the poverty alleviation category. Poverty reduction measures



- 6 -
include investments in irrigation infrastructure in irrigated small-farm areas, a
watershed management program for farmers living below the rural poverty threshold,
and establishment of eligibility criteria for the allocation of research and extension
programs to ensure that these programs meet the needs of the small farmers in the
project areas. The water users' associations in the three project areas are highly
representative of the smallholding, rural poor: in Nizao, 68% of farmers work less
than 2.5 hectares of land, in Azua 95 %, and in Santiago 78%.
13.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been placed in environmental
category "B". The project, under the Institutional Strengthening component, would
develop an environmental monitoring system within INDRHI to be implemented and
monitored in each irrigated area and in the Nizao watershed. A field-based
environmental review concluded that the project would have a positive effect on
environmental conditions because of its focus on improving water and land use
through investments in the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation infrastructure,
leveling and drainage, promotion of improved water and land management in the
irrigated areas and in the Nizao watershed, promotion of integrated pest management,
support for special studies, and institutional strengthening and training.
14.   Program Objective Categories. Project objectives are focused on (i) Poverty
reduction and Human resource development, (ii) Private sector development through
contractual arrangements for agricultural support services, and (iii) Environmentally
sustainable development through integrated pest management (under the Agricultural
Development component) and improved soil and water management.
15.   Participatory Approach. The water users' associations, and the community
organizations belonging to the Association for the Development of San Jose de Ocoa
(ADESJO), have been extensively consulted in project design and have actively
participated in project preparation. The emphasis on beneficiary participation is
intended to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with large-scale public irrigation
schemes. Water users associations will participate and be responsible for all aspects
of irrigation operation and maintenance. Management of the Rio Nizao watershed
would involve the same approach, emphasizing participation and responsibility of the
farming community for designing and implementing the pilot program.
16.   Project Benefits. The project would increase productivity, employment, and
incomes on about 5,000 small farms from irrigated zones that are currently well
below their potential; reduce poverty in the Nizao watershed; develop and test
methodologies for sustainable watershed and irrigated land management; produce
savings in operation and maintenance expenditures as a result of the rehabilitation
and improvement of irrigation infrastructure, improved maintenance, and reduced
water losses; save water through more efficient on-farm water use; reduce the use of
pesticides; strengthen the role of the private sector, thus improving efficiency and
flexibility in the management of existing irrigated schemes and in the provision of
agricultural support services; and -- because of anticipated revenues from increased
cost recovery -- reduce costs to the Government. The project would also foster a
rational nationwide long-terrn strategy and policy for irrigated farming and watershed
development.



17.   Project Risks. The risks involve the Government's willingness to move
towards more privatization of the irrigation subsector and rural development
generally, the availability of adequate counterpart funds, and the enforcement of cost-
recovery and self-financing schemes. These risks would be minimized by front-
loading the actions associated with the conditions of effectiveness and disbursement,
and other assurances, requiring transference of responsibility to water users'
associations, community organizations, NGOs and the private sector; and by
including in the institutional strengthening of these organizations, support for
effective cost recovery. Bank missions would be scheduled to participate in
formulating and reviewing annual operation plans and budgets. The project is
placing considerable emphasis on user participation in research and development in
order to ensure effective use of the improved irrigation systems and better
exploitation of market opportunities. The limited size and complexity of the
proposed project appear to be within the capacity of INDRHI and the private
organizations involved, the water users associations and ADESJO.
18.   Recommendations. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
