Likewise, both the Bank\n            and Borrower performances were unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            outline the following, but most strikingly, the importance\n            of a significant analysis of risks for fulfilling\n            developmental objectives, particularly when dealing with\n            known agencies within borrowers facing difficult\n            circumstances. Among the many lessons, some specific ones\n            reinforce and convey that projects with the objective to\n            test methodologies for public interventions in the rural\n            sector, need to ensure that baseline studies are available,\n            and monitoring and evaluation systems in place to evaluate\n            those methodologies, at the early stages of project\n            preparation. This also leads to the issue of transfers of\n            irrigation schemes from the public sector to water user\n            organizations (WUOs), a process that requires political\n            will, and adequate transfer policies and processes. In these\n            cases, the Bank should make clear agreements with the\n            Borrower before, or during loan negotiations on those\n            policies and processes, and on the specific support needed\n            to implement such processes. In addition, the participatory\n            process of technology transfer requires both agronomic, and\n            agro-economic analyses, therefore the monitoring system\n            should carry out agronomic and agro-economic studies to\n            ensure that technologies and methodologies are profitable\n            and sustainable. Notwithstanding, the costs per beneficiary\n            of training, technical assistance, investment support and\n            administration should be closely monitored, and contained\n            within limits that are acceptable from a replicable point of view."}, "docdt": "2005-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
