      Management Project will improve small-farmer income in the\n            selected areas and will test and develop methodologies that\n            can be replicated nationwide both for efficient production\n            support services, water management, and operation and\n            maintenance of irrigation systems and for sustainable and\n            environmentally sound watershed management. The criteria for\n            selection of the three irrigation areas were based on\n            agronomic and economic potential as well as the strength of\n            local water users' associations, which are key project\n            beneficiaries and implementing agencies. The project will\n            also rehabilitate and improve existing irrigation systems\n            and strengthen user associations for the development and\n            management of the selected irrigated areas and the Nizao\n            watershed. The Nizao watershed was chosen because of the\n            existence of a strong, local nongovernmental organization\n            that will play a key role in mobilizing community\n            participation in the project. Last, the project should help\n            reduce the fiscal cost of irrigation schemes to the\n            government through appropriate cost-recovery policies."}, "docdt": "1995-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
