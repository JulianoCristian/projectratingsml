This will imply waiving on an exceptional\n            basis in regard to the Refinancing of a PPF, thus allowing\n            that the refinancing costs of the above PPF be funded\n            through this loan. As per the Constitution of the Dominican\n            Republic, this amendment will have to be ratified by\n            Congress. Nevertheless, the amendment will serve the\n            country's needs, and support their recovery efforts in\n            this critical macroeconomic juncture; as such, it should be\n            approved by the Board. Despite years of sustained growth,\n            the country entered a period of recession, which although\n            not fully evaluated, the social impacts of the crisis are\n            dramatic, and the economy continues in crisis. The tight\n            fiscal discipline required to meet the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) targets, in addition to postponing the\n            proposed project, is precluding the Government to proceed\n            with an immediate repayment of the PPF advance, and accrued\n            interests to the Bank. Given the above reasons, and the\n            proper utilization of advance funds, the Board shall amend\n            the Loan Agreement to include a new component that would\n            cover the re-payment of the PPF through this Loan."}, "docdt": "2004-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
