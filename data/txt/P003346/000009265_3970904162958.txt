SECOND RANGOON PORT PROJECT (Credit 671-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This report presents a performance analysis of the Burma Second
Port Project for which the Executive Directors approved Credit 671-BA in
the amount of US$10 million on December 31, 1976. The Credit was closed in
March 1982. This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
South Asia Regional Office (ASN) based on a PCR prepared in mid-1982 by
the Borrower (Burma Ports Corporation (BPC) on behalf of the Government of
the Union of Burma). Since the ASN version is essentially the same as
that prepared by BPC, except for modifications which were extensively
discussed with BPC and agreed upon, the PCR was not sent to the Borrower
for comments. Comments by a consultant, who assisted BPC on implementation
of the project have been added as Annex H, and have been cross-referenced
throughout the text.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
staff but the project was not audited by OED.

BURMA
SECOND RANGOON PORT PROJECT (Credit 671-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
Introduction
1.      The Association was asked to assist in financing a project for
deepening the Rangoon Port sea access channel (through rehabilitation of
dredgers) and the provision of cargo handling equipment, spares for exist-
ing equipment and vessels and materials for the replacement of pontoons.
The request followed a UNDP-financed study in 1974/75 which recommended a
long-term investment program for the Port of Rangoon and confirmed the
feasibility of deepening the channel by three feet. The channel deepening
was intended to permit vessels of up to 15,000 dwt to enter and leave the
port at most states of the tide. At the time of implementation, the
condition of the channel limited access of ships 10,000 dwt to the port.
Burma Ports Corporation (BPC), the state economic enterprise in charge of
Rangoon Port, and the eight outports, was also hampered by vessels and
equipment being out of service through usage and old age and lack of
essential spare parts, resulting in increased cargo handling costs for the
port. The credit comprised the foreign exchange cost of investments in
the last year of the Second 4-Year Plan (1977/78) and the first two years
of the Third 4-Year Plan (1978/79-1979/80).
Project Content
2.      The project emphasized rehabilitation, maintenance and improvement
in the utilization of available transport capacity, and contributed to the
expansion of exports and the reduction of the costs of imports.
3.      The Credit was signed on 1/13/77 with a closing date of 12/31/81.
It was for US$10 million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of
the project. Total project cost was estimated at US$16 million equivalent
(the Government of Burma (GOB) would finance the local currency costs).
Credit proceeds were for:



(a) rehabilitation and repair of two dredgers;
(b) purchase of Electronic position finders and navigational
aids; cargo handling equipment and associated spare
parts; construction equipment for pontoons, bridges and
ancillaries; and
(c) training of port personnel and rehabilitation and repairs
to survey, buoy and pilot vessels (PCR para 2.11).
An important addition to the project was made in 1980 when IDA approved
BPC's application to use unallocated funds to procure a computer, and
associated software, jointly with Post and Telecommunications Corporation
(PTC), for the accounting and management information needed by the respec-
tive organizations (PCR paras 3.61-3.65). This was a notable achievement
because the high cost would have debarred acquisition by either organiza-
tion individually. However, cooperation has resulted in the establishment
of the joint computer center at much reduced cost to the respective
organizations and the country.
Delays in Implementation and Disbursement
4.      There were major delays in the rehabilitation of the suction
dredger 'Thaung Naing Yay" (PCR paras 3.19-3.25 and 7.02) completion of
which was originally planned for December 31, 1977, and was achieved only
by May 30, 1979, due to lengthy administrative procedures.
5.      There also were delays in the procurement of the Electronic posi-
tion finding equipment for which the final disbursement was made in March
1982, after the closing date (PCR para 3.37). This was due to a con-
troversy over installation and training charges with the original ten-
derers, which culminated in cancellation of the bids and an invitation for
fresh bids (PCR-para 7.04). The delay had significant implications for
the channel dredging operation, which was not completed by the closing
date, due to the absence of the position finding equipment on the dredger,
and consequently the economic benefits of this component have been delayed
and are expected to accrue in the coming years (see also para 4).
6.      Actual cumulative disbursements were behind schedule during the
the second part of the project, but only the payment for the Electronic
position finding equipment (mentioned above) was still outstanding at the
closing of the Credit (PCR Table 3).
7.      A comparison of actual foreign exchange costs with those estimated
at appraisal shows that rehabilitating the dredger had a 12 per cent
overrun; the Electronic position finding equipment had an overrun of 35.5
per cent. These overruns were compensated for by underruns in the other
project categories, so that actual project costs corresponded with the
appraisal estimates (PCR paras 3.67 and Table 1).



Economic Re-evaluation
8.      By 1980/81 traffic at Rangoon Port was running at 127 per cent of
appraisal forecasts, especially because of increase3 in the throughput of
rice and petroleum, in the export sector (PCR para 4.01). In spite of the
increased traffic, there was an improvement in cargo handling operations
(PCR para 4.02).
9.      Exports handled per gang/shift improved by 43 per cent and imports
by 20 per cent over the rates existing at appraisal time. Cargo handling
costs per ton fell by 22 per cent due to the project. The actual economic
rate of return for the cargo handling equipment was 53 per cent as com-
pared to 50 per cent at appraisal (Annex G). 1/
10.     One of the objectives of the project was to maintain a target
depth of 15' below datum depth in the sea access channel, allowing 15,000
dwt ships to enter port at most states of the tide. This target could not
be achieved at the inner bar for various reasons stated in the PCR (paras
4.08-4.10). However, all technical measures necessary for proper dredging
are now in place and it is expected that it wil' be achieved next season.
Therefore, the full potential economic benefits cannot be ascertained at
present.
11. Points of Reference for Future Project Design
(a) BPC feels that the Bank's advice to utilize outside purchasing
agents was not appropriate, as the objective of relieving BPC of
part of the administrative burden was not achieved (PCR para
3.80). The use of outside agents was suggested in the light of
previous Bank experience on projects in Burma, but unfortunately
the performance of the purchasing agents was not felt to have come
up to expected standards..!/Had performance expectations been met,
the agents' use would have been worthwhile. BPC's comments will
be taken into account in designing future projects in Burma.
(b) BPC's reference to suppliers complaints regarding delayed payments
(PCR para 3.69) indicates that suppliers should be made aware of
the various Bank Group disbursement procedures available for
effecting payment and procurement. The delays in effecting pay-
ment could not have beLa reduced unless the borrower had been
ready to adopt a method of disbursement other than the one that
was in effect throughout the project.
1/ Benefits on the cargo handling component of the project and other
improvements have been quantified in Annex G.
2/ See also Annex H for consultant's comments.

Conclusion
12.     Overall, the project has been of benefit to BPC and to the Burmese
economy. It enabled BPC to contain deterioration of channel depths and to
improve cargo handling operations. Traffic volume and financial results
surpassed appraisal expectations (PCR paras 4.01 and 5.01). Reporting
requirements were observed and the covenants were met. Actual total
project costs were as estimated at appraisal (PCR para 3.67). Further
economic benefits from reduced shipping costs are expected to be realized
in the coming years.



I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
1.01    The Port of Rangoon was devastated during the Second World War by the
British Army on their retreat from Rangoon in 1942 and again by the Japanese
on their retreat in 1945. Three cargo berths were totally destroyed and the
others were severely damaged. Storage accommodations were almost
non-existent. Navigation channels were obstructed by mines and shipwrecks.
1.02    On return of the British in May 1945,the British Military Administra-
tion formed a Port Administration Unit and emergency measures were taken to
accommodate ships for landing military cargoes, and clear mines and obstruc-
tions in the Rangoon River to keep the channel navigable. However, no major
efforts were taken to rehabilitate the war-torn port facilities.
1.03    The Port of Rangoon handled almost 100 per cent of the country's
imports and about 85 per cent of the exports and, therefore, the need for
rehabilitation of the Port of Rangoon was of vital importance to the
country's economy. After Burma regained independence in 1948, efforts were
made to rehabilitate port facilities, but due to lack of funds, coupled with
worldwide shortage of essential materials, no major works could be undertaken
and only emergency needs could be met with available resources. In 1951
through 1953, with the introduction of ECA aid, some covered storage accom-
modations were constructed at Brooking Street Wharves Berth No. 2, Sule
Pagoda Wharves Berth No. 4, and Ahlone Wharf, to replace temporary storage
sheds. Some pontoons were also replaced with Japanese reparation funds.
1.04    In 1951, the Government of Burma signed an agreement with consultants
for the overall planning of Burma's economy. Their report submitted in 1953
contained, among other things, a program for rehabilitation of the Port of
Rangoon. Based on this report, the Port Authority sought the assistance of
IBRD through the Ministry of National Planning. The rehabilitation program
consisted of reconstruction of Sule Pagoda Wharves Berth Nos. 5, 6 and 7 with
Transit Sheds and Anc_lllary Buildings, purchase of Cargo Handling Equipment,
procurement of a Suction Dredger, a Bucket Dredger, a Buoy Vessel, a Pilot
Vessel, a Sea-going Tug and 4 other harbor craft and some Mooring Buoys,
including accessories.
1.05    In May 1956, IBRD granted a loan of US$14 million equivalent to BPC
to finance the foreign exchange cost of the rehabilitation program. The loan
carried an interest rate of 4.75 per cent per annum repayable in 20 years
including a grace period of 4 years. The rehabilitation works took six years
and were completed in 1962. The total cost of rehabilitation was about Kyats
100 million including the proceeds of the IBRD Loan. The loan was fully
repaid on April 15, 1976.

B. The Problem
1.06    In the early 1960s a problem arose as regards shipping along the
navigational clhannels in the Rangoon River. The draft of ships calling at
the Port of Rangoon was controlled by the depths available at the Outer Bar
(about 25 miles from the Harbor) at the Rangoon River mouth, and those at the
Inner Bar at Monkey Point (about 3 miles from the Harbor). In the post-war
years the Spit Channel area of the Western Channel of the Outer Bar
deteriorated and when the channel came down to 7 feet of water in 1962, the
Spit channel was closed and the Eastern Channel of the outer Bar which car-
ried 13 feet of water was used in its place. In 1965, the Eastern Channel
also deteriorated and it had to be shifted progressively towards the east
every year necessitating shifting of whole sets of channel marking buoys.
During 1968 this channel took a very steep bend towards the sea, making
navigation most difficult. About this time the original Eastern Channel
showed better water again with a depth of 12 feet.
1.07    At that time the draft of vessels entering the Port of Rangoon was
limited to 27 feet. With the worldwide trend to using larger size vessels,
it was considered that a depth of at least 30 feet would be required. To
solve this problem BPC sought the assistance of Netherlands Engineering
Consultants (NEDECO) and experts from the Federal Republic of Germany. These
experts after proper surveys suggested that the best way to increase the
draft of the channel would be to dredge the area, for which detailed studies
needed to be conducted. The experts estimated that the studies would cost
US$908,000 (including foreign exchange of US$486,000) and take about 20
months.
1.08    The port was one of the most important elements of the transportation
system of the country and it was, therefore, felt that ways and mwans should
be found to solve the problem of the channel without further delay. As the
expenditure for conducting the detailed studies was beyond the means of BPC,
especially the foreign exchange cost, it was decided to seek the aPSistance
of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
C. Financial Assistance
1.09    In September 1971, a request was submitted by BPC to the Ministry of
Planning and Finance through the Ministry of Transport and Communication, to
include the Rangoon River Project in the 1972-76 UNDP Country Program. The
Ministry of Planning and Finance transmitted to UNDP the Burma Country
Program in which was included US$536,000 for the Rangoon River Project. In
March 1973, the UNDP entrusted IBRD to prepare a Draft Project Document on
Rangoon River Project and to act as the Executing Agency for the Project.
1.10    In July 1973, IBRD completed the Terms of Reference and invited five
consultant firms to submit proposals for conducting the studies. In October
1973, a joint venture, Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners (Gibb)/NEDECO, was



-3-
selected for carrying out the study. In December 1973, a project d .ament
was signed between the Government, UNDP and IBRD. Total Project cost
included US$536,000 in Foreign Exchange to be contributed by UNDP and
K 3,600,000 to be borne by the Government.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Feasibility Study
2.01    The objective of the study, as described in the Terms of Reference,
was to provide Burma Ports Corporation recommendations for:
(a) stabilizing the existing, or an alternative equivalent, channel at
present published depths, including all technical steps necessary and
the economic and financial consequences of such steps; and
(b) deepening the channel to an optimum depth defined by a comparison of
the costs of such deepening with the economic and financial benefits
to be gained; such costs to include improvement of operating
facilities within the port area in instances where this would be
necessary by reason of forecast changes in the ship sizes or traffic
types and volumes which would arise from the increased depth of the
access channel.
2.02    The consultants commenced work in January 1974.  The team consisted
of experts in the fields of hydraulics, hydrography, dredging, shipping, port
operation, economics, finance and engineering. The consultants were assisted
by a team of counterpart staff provided by BPC in various fields. BPC also
provided the consultants with transport and other facilities during their
field investigations.
2.03    The study was divided into two main parts, namely, the Technical
Evaluation, and the Economic, Traffic and Financial Studies. Each part of
the study was briefly described as follows:
(a) Technical Evaluations. For the purpose of technical evaluation the
consultants reviewed all available technical data already in hand
supplied by BPC and associated departments of the Government and at
the same time conducted detailed field investigations on hydraulic
and geotechnical aspects as far as necessary. They also investigated
the existing pattern and cargo facilities and prepared cost estimates
for any major works considered appropriate for future requirements.
(b) Economic, Traffic and Financial Studies. This part of the study was
to determine the economic schemes developed as a result of the tech-
nical evaluation. The consultants carried out an economic evaluation



-4-
for the alternatives of providing a stabilized channel and deepening
the channel. They determined (i) the optimum solution; and (ii) the
optimnm timing for implementating in stages the deepening. The
consultants collected sufficient data to consider savings due to
reduction of vessel waiting time and service time, savings in cargo-
handling cost and port maintenance cost and lower freight rates due
to the stabilized, or improved access channel. The consultants
studied in detail the present shipping and traffic pattern, and
analyzed all available data. They proposed detailed forecasts of
major comnodities and commodity groups, ship types, sizes and
required numbers corresponding the cargo through-put forecast. The
consultants also analyzed the financial situation of BPC and made
financial forecasts based on assumptions of a realistically
attainable level of efficiency in port operating procedures and the
-administrative structure including estimates of annual capital,
maintenance and administrative costs. Based on the analyses the
consultants determined the internal rate of return of the proposed
investments and for this purpose estimated the first year benefits to
be obtained from the stabilized, or deepened access channel in the
form of reduced freight rates, demurrage, etc. and the estimated
annual increase in future benefits.
2.04    The consultants took 14 months to complete the study and submitted
a draft final report to BPC and IBRD in May 1975. IBRD requested BPC in July
1975 to study the draft final report and to offer comments for incorporation
in the final report. BPC's comments were transmitted to IBRD in September
1975. The consultants revised the draft final report and submitted their
final report in March 1976 with their findings and recommendations.
B. Appraisal of a Second Port Project
2.05    In May/June 1976, IBRD sent a three-member appraisal mission to hold
discussions with authorities of the Government and BPC for possible financing
of part of the foreign exchange cost of BPC's investment program during the
three years 1977/78 to 1979/80. The visit of the mission was the result of
the recommendations contained in the final report.
2.06    The appraisal mission studied current developments since the sui=is-
sion of the consultant's draft final report in 1975. The mission also held
discussions with authorities of the Government, BPC and other associated
agencies and obtained information on various aspects concerning development
of the Port of Rangoon.
2.07    Finally, agreement was reached on various points with the Goverament
and BPC, and an Appraisal Report was prepared recommending an International
Development Association (IDA) Credit of US$10.0 million equivalent, to the
Government. The Government was to relend the proceeds of the Credit to BPC



at 9 per cent per annum interest for a term of 15 years, including a
three-year grace period.
C. The Credit
2.08    Ir. October 1976, IBRD invited the Government and BPC to send a nego-
tiating team to Washington for discussion of the terms for the proposed
credit. A three-member negotiating team, headed by the Deputy Minister of
Planning and Finance, discussed and agreed the terms and conditions of the
Credit.
2.09    The draft Credit Agreement was approved by the Council of Ministers
and was signed on January 13, 1977. The Credit was free of interest, but a
service charge at the rate of 3/4 of 1 per cent per annum was to be paid to
IDA on the principal amount of the Credit withdrawn and outstanding from time
to tine. The principal amount of the Credit was to be repaid to IDA in
semi-annual installments commencing January 15, 1987 and ending July 15,
2026, each installment to, and including the installment on July 15, 1996 to
be 1/2 of 1 per cent of such principal amount, and each installment there-
after to be 1-1/2 per cent of such principal amount.
2.10    As provided in para 3.01 of the Credit Agreement, the Government was
to relend the proceeds of the Credit to BPC under a Subsidiary Loan Agree-
ment. Accordingly, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement was signed between the
Government and BPC on January 31, 1977. The Subsidiary Loan carried an
interest of 9 per cent per annum of the principal amount and outstanding from
time to time payable annually on September 30, each year. BPC had to repay
the principal amount in 24 equal semi-annual installments commencing Septem-
ber 30, 1980 and ending March 31, 1992. This is being repaid as agreed.
2.11    The Credit Agreement provided USS10.00 million equivalent to be
utilized as under:

III. PROJECT IMPLEENTATION AND COST
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01    Although the Developmenc Credit Agreement was signed on January 13,
1977, it was to become effective only when the Credit Agreement and the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement were duly authorized by the Government, and the
opinion of the Central Law Office, as to the admissibility of the provisions
of the Agreements under the rules and regulations of the Socialist Republic
of the Union of Burma, was obtained. The authorization of the Government and
opinion of the legal authorities were obtained and transmitted to IDA on
February 19, 1977. The Development Credit Agreement became effective on
March 18, 1977.



-7-
3.02    At start-up BPC formed a Project Section with selected personnel,
who were familiar with IDA guidelines and procedures and had gained good
experience in the project works in the course of execution of the first World
Bank Loan in 1956-62. Technical Committees were formed to advise on the
evaluation and selection of tenders. The Managing Director of BPC was desig-
nated as the authorized representative of the borrower under Section 2.09 for
withdrawal cf funds and for taking any other actions required to be taken
under the provisions of Section 2.02 of the Credit Agreement. Invitations
for submission of qualification data for the rehabilitation of the Suction
Dredger "Thauag Naing Yay- were issued in February 1977. Negotiations were
started in March 1977 with a consultant firm for appointment as the interna-
tional purchasing agents for procurement of certain major items of equipment.
Draft tender documents for procurement of materials and components for the
construction of pontoons and bridges were prepared and forwarded to IDA. in
early May 1977. Quotations for specific spare parts for the repair of exist-
ing cargo handling equipment were issued in March 1977 and purchase orders
were issued in June 1977. Thanks to the effort of project staff and the
cooperation of IDA, no serious problems arose in the start-up or in the
course of project implementation.
B. Revision
3.03    The project origiaally included six items as listed in para 2.11 with
a provision of US$1,670,000 as an unallocated sum which was reserved for
utilization as necessary to supplement any likely deficiencies in funds
allocated for the six categories.
3.04    Except for the addition of -Accounting machines and associated equip-
ment and materials-, there was no change in the categories. However, slight
changes had to be made in the type and quantity of equipment within each
category. Those additions and changes were supplementary requirements to
suit the situation prevailing from time to time in the course of project
implementation. The reasons for such changes are given in relevant
paragraphs. The original allocations, revisions and final utilized amount
are shown in Annex A. Full and timely cooperation of IDA was obtained in all
such cases.
C. Implementation Schedule
3.05    The project was expected to be completed in four years, by
December 31, 1980, and the implementation schedule was drawn up in line with
the expected completion date. Actually, 90 per cent of the work was success-
fully completed within the period specified. The remaining 10 per cent was
composed of two sizable items, namely , Electronic position finding equip-
ment and "Accounting machine and associated equipment and materials.   The
reasons for the delay in the procurement of the Electronic position finding
equipment are briefly stated in the relevant paragraphs. Regarding procure-
ment of the accounting machines, this item was not included in the original



-8-
implementation schedule and was an addition, negotiated and agreed in early
1980. Moreover, the accounting machines were to be jointly owned with the
Post and Telecommnications Corporation (PTC) and procurement was undertaken
by PTC.
3.06    The Electronic position finding equipment was intended to be used
in the dredging operations and to be ready at the same time the rehabilita-
tiou of the suction dredger was completed. The rehabilitation was completed
in May 1979 but because of the delays in procuring the Electronic position
finding equipment the dredging operations in the inner bar had to be carried
out without the equipment. A detailed report on the dredging operations is
described in Chapter IV. The implementation schedule and actual performance
are shown in Annex B.
3.07    An insignificant but pertinent incident caused by the delayed
procurement, was that payments for the late items could not be affected
before the Closing Date. BPC had to request IDA to keep open the books of
the Credit account until such time payments could be completed. IDA was
agreeable to BPC's request and all payments were completed in March 1982.
D. Reporting
3.08    Apart from occasional special requests there were three types of
reports which BPC furnished IDA at regular intervals:
Ca) Quarterly progress report;
(b) Monthly return of commitments; and
_c) Certified copies of annual financial statements and audit report.
The quarterly progress report dealt with details of progress, preparation of
tender documents, invitations to tender evaluations of bids, contract awards,
delivery of materials, and details of the implementation schedule. This
report was supplemented by (i) import and export tonnages by principal com-
modities for the quarter and cumulative figures for the year to date with
corresponding figures for the preceeding year; (ii) a summary account of
revenue and expenditure showing figures for the relative quarterly periods of
the year in comparison with figures for the preceeding year. The monthly
_ommitments showed the amounts committed, indicating orders placed during the
month and status of total commitments to date under the various categories.
Certified copies of annual financial statement and audit reports were fur-
nished to IDA not later than four months after the end of each financial
year. During the entire course of project implementation, BPC experienced no
difficulty in fulfilling these requirements and the reports were furnished
to IDA regularly.



-9-
E. Procurement
General Guidelines
3.09    Except as indicated in para 3.10 below, contracts for the purchase of
goods were procured in accordance with procedures set forth in Part A of the
"Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits". Bidders
for the rehabilitation of dredgers "Thaung Naing Yay" and "Kyant Khaing Yay"
were pre-qualified as described in para 1.3 of Part A of the Guidelines,
before inviting bids.
3.10    Components and spare parts that were agreed with IDA could be
procured under procedures other than those referred to in para 3.09.
Review of Invitations to Bid
3.11    For all contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more, except for
contracts for components and spare parts as described in para 3.10, the
invitation to bid, specifications, and other bidding documents including the
advertising procedures were furnished to IDA for concurrence.
3.12    Similarly, for prequalification, IDA was requested for concurrence
to the list of prequalified bidders, together with their qualifications, and
the reasons for exclusion of any applicant had to be furnished to IDA.
Review of Proposed Awards and Final Contracts
3.13    After bids had been received and evaluated, BPC informed IDA of the
name of the bidder to whom the award was intended to be made, furnished a
detailed report on the evaluation and a comparison of the bids received. On
receipt of IDA's concurrence, contracts were signed or orders issued to
successful bidders.
3.14    Promptly after execution, prior to the submission of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account in respect of
a contract/firm order two copies of the contract/firm order were sent to IDA.
International Purchasing Agents
3.15    As agreed during the negotiations, a consultant firm was appointed as
international purchasing agents for certain items under category (2),
cargo-handling equipment, category (4) except spare parts, and Plant,
Machinery and Equipment under category (5).



-10-
Project Items and Costs
3.16    In June 1977, in consultation with IDA, a list was prepared showing
the items to be procured and their estimated cost in foreign currency for the
three years beginning with financial year 1977-78. This list was made to
conform to the individual category of the list of goods cove-ed by the Credit
and was to serve as a guide for making withdrawals from the Credit. The
details of items and their cost were slightly different from those shown in
the appraisal report and are produced in Annex C.
Execution
3.17    For efficiently carrying out the tasks connected with procurement of
various items of equipment and to deal with the large volume of correspon-
dence in accordance with IDA procedures, a separate establishment was created
and headed by a Project Manager and consisted of an assistant officer and
five staff members. In addition to the foregoing, a Dredging Manager was
appointed to advise on the rehabilitation of the dredgers, to train dredger
crews and to assist in improving the operation of the suction dredger and
bucket dredger.
3.18    In describing the process of project execution, a brief statement
enumerating the steps taken, difficulties experienced and other pertinent
features in the course of execution, is given. The description is also given
for each category of project items successively as shown in para 2.11 of the
previous chapter.
Category (1) Rehabilitation of Dredgers
(a) Suction Dredger -Thaung Naing Yay" (TNY)
Prequalification
3.19    As described in para 3.12, qualification papers were sent to IDA on
January 10, 1977 for concurrence. In addition, BPC suggested to limit the
invitation to the region extending from Pakistan to Japan in consideration of
the cost of sailing the dredger to and from the dockyard where it would be
rehabilitated. IDA's concurrence was received on February 2, 1977.
3.20    To examine and evaluate qualifications, bids and tenders a
three-member technical committee was formed, consisting of the Master Atten-
dant as chairman and the Dredging Manager and the Chief Mechanical Engineer
as members. The duties of the technical committee were to prepare specifica-
tions and tender documents, open tenders, examine and evaluate tenders and
report on tenders received with recommendations.



-l1-
3.21    Bids for qualifications were closed on May 2, 1977 and 24 dockyards
and shipbuilding firms participated. The technical committee selected eight.
IDAts concurrence was sought and an affirmative reply was received on July
12, 1977.
Invitation of Tenders
3.22    BPC, with the approval of IDA, selected consultants for the prepara-
tion of tender documents, including specifications and the evaluation of
tenders. It took three months to complete the preparation of tender docu-
ments, and to receive the approval of the FERD, the Central Law Office and
IDA. The tender documents were issued to the prequalified bidders on the
December 14, 1977, with a closing date fixed for January 28, 1978.
Tender Evaluation and Award of Contract
3.24    Seven firms submitted quotations.  The tenders were evaluated by the
consultants with the cooperation of BPC's technical committee. The tender
submitted by Keppel Shipyard, Singapore was selected and IDA concurred.
Government approval to the award of contract was received on August 19, 1978
and the contract was formally signed on August 19, 1978. The contract price
was S$ 2,798,641.00.*
Rehabilitation of Dredger
3.25    The Contract provided six months for construction of the components
and spare parts and 45 days for repairs and rehabilitation. The dredger TNY
left for Singapore on March 24, 1979 and arrived at Rangoon on Nay 30, 1979
after rehabilitation. 1/ Actual total contract expenditure was
S$ 2,774,358.90.
(b) Bucket Dredger 'Kyant Khaing Yay" (KKY) Proposed Rehabilitation
3.26    BPC had proposed to entrust the rehabilitation of the dredger to the
original manufacturer, who was requested to submit a firm quotation which
amounted to S$ 3,127,154. The quotation was later revised to S$ 2,097,854
after dropping certain items which were considered not immediately necessary.
As the quotation was much higher than the sum allocated, IDA was requested in
December 1977 to give its opinion on how the extra costs could be met.
* Singapore Dollars
1/ Completion of rehabilitation had been fixed for December 31, 1977. Delay
was due to lengthy administrative procedures concerning tender submission
and selection.



-12-
3.27    In March 1978, IDA and BPC authorities agreed to abandon the idea
of rehabilitatEng the dredger with the original manufacturer and to invite
quotations from eight prequalified bidders, with specifications confined to
most essential items.
Tender Invitation
3.28    The technical committee drew up the specifications and tender docu-
ments, and with the approval of IDA, tender documents were issued to eight
prequalified bidders on May 30 with the closing date fixed for July 15, 1978.
Tender Evaluation and Award of Contract
3.29    Only six firms submitted quotations.  The quotations were examined by
the technical committee and clarifications were sought from the prospective
bidders. After lengthy negotiations and discussions, the quotation submitted
by Nippon Kokan Kaisha (NKK), Japan was recommended.  IDA concurred and a
contract was signed on April 24, 1979. The contract price was Yen
101,586,400.
Rehabilitation of Dredger
3.30    The contract provided four months for the manufacture of the bucket
ladder and new buckets, and 25 days for the repairs and rehabilitation. The
bucket dredger left for Japan on August 15, 1979, but due to a mechanical
breakdown on the way, the dredger arrived at the NKK Shipyard in Yokohama
only on October 27, 1979. The dredger was docked on October 28, 1979 and
work started the same day. The rehabilitation work was completed on Novem-
ber 16, 1979. The dredger KKY, left Yokohama on November 22, 1979 and
arrived at Rangoon on December 31, 1979. Total contract expenditure was
Yen 101,326,400. In addition to the contract expenditure, a sum of
Yen 16,483,000 was incurred for repair works not covered by the contract.



-13-
(c) Grab Dredgers
3.31    BPC had three grab dredgers purchased from Messrs. Priestman Brothers
Ltd., England. Spare parts worth of US$74,838.56 were procured from the
specific manufacturers to repair the dredgers. Work was successfully com-
pleted in 1978.
Category (2) Repairs to Survey, Buoy and Pilot Vessels
3.32    Spare parts and equipment worth US$275,694.56 were purchased from
specific manufacturers to repair the survey, buoy and pilot vessels. The
necessary repair work was carried out in BPC's workshops and dockyard and was
successfully completed in 1978.
Category (3) Position Finders and Navigational Aids
(a) Position Finders
3.33    BPC had entrusted the procurement of position finding equipment to
the purchasing agents. Since the equipment was unknown to BPC, the purchas-
ing agents were provided with general specifications only. The first quota-
tion ieceived from the purchasng agent was fouud not suitable for use in the
Rangoon Port area. With IDA's approval, fresh tenders were invited from
three selected firms for a 'trisponder system' position finding equipment.
Three tenders were received in January 1979. However, as the tenderers
failed to comply with certain technical and contractual conditions required
by BPC, the selection of tender was eventually rescinded. 1/
3.34    In January 1980, BPC suggested to invite international competitive
bids without specifying the make and type of systems. With IDA's advice, the
specifications and tender documents were prepared and tender invitations were
issued on October 15, 1980 fixing the closing date for November 29, 1980.
3.35    Six tenders were received.  The tenders were examined by BPC's tech-
nical committee and after thorough examination and clarifications from the
two lowest bidders the technical committee recommended accepting the second
lowest bid submitted by Messrs. Decca Survey (France). IDA's concurrence was
sought on March 19, 1981. A two-member IDA mission which visited Rangoon in
April to discuss some technical information contained in the recommendation
1/ A controversy arose with the original tenderers over installation and
training charges. It took a long time to sort out matters and since BPC
was unfamiliar with the equipment, and questioned its need, BPC had to be
reconvinced that the equipment was essential (PCR paras 4.09, 4.10 and
7.04).



-14-
of BPC's technical committee, agreed to the acceptance of the bid submitted
by Messrs. Decca Survey (France), subject to further negotiating with the
supplier certain technical requirements, installation of the equipment in
Rangoon and training of two BPC technicians in France.
3.36    Final agreement was reached and contract formally signed on May  11,
1981.
3.37    The Electronic position finding equipment and associated components
were received in Rangoon in the first week of November 1981. As provided in
the contract, an engineer from Decca Survey (France) arrived on November 19,
1981 to install the equipment and to conduct on-the-job training for a period
of one month. However, due to the inadvertent shipping of some wrong com-
ponents the installation work was delayed for 33 days. After proper testing
of newly arrived components, actual installation and testing operations
comenced on January 18, 1982. The equipment was formally accepted on
March 5, 1982.
3.38    In accordance with the provisions of the contract, one hydrographer
and an electronic engineer left for France on August 31, 1981 for practical
training on operating and mairntaining the equipment. They returned to
Rangoon on November 6, 1981 after satisfactory completion of training.
(b) Navigational Aids
3.39    BPC had been using the lighted buoys and associated equipment
manufactured by Messrs. Aga Navigational Aids Ltd., England. Therefore,
IDA's approval was sought to procure lighted buoys and associated equipment
from Messrs. Aga Navigational Aids Ltd., without inviting international
competitive bids. IDA agreed and navigational aids worth US$388,788.72 were
purchased from Messrs. Aga Navigational Aids Ltd., England. They were
installed during the years 1978 and 1979.
Category (4) Cargo Handling Equipment and Spare Parts
3.40    Procurement was divided into three parts:  pro-urement of new cargo
handling equipment, procurement of workshop tools and equipment, and procure-
ment of spare parts for existing cargo handling equipment. The procurement
of new cargo handling equipment and workshop tools and equipment was
entrusted to the purchasing agents.
(a) New Cargo Handling Equipment
List of Equipment
3.41    It was originally intended to procure 14 items of equipment
(Annex C). However, as the need for bulk grain equipment was not immediate
procurement of this item was dropped with IDA agreement and extra quantities



-15-
of five more essential items and two new items was added to the list
originally prepared.
Procurement
3.42    Procurement was arranged in two batches.  For the first specifica-
tions were prepared by the technical committee consisting of the Chief Traf-
fic Manager the Deputy Traffic Manager (Equipment) and the Chief Mechanical
Engineer and were sent to the purchasing agents in July 1977. The purchasing
agents issued tender documents in September 1977 and tenders were closed in
November 1977. The purchasing agents submitted a report to BPC together with
a tender evaluation statements and recommendation in January 1978. The
purchasing agents' report and recommendations were reviewed by the technical
committee and the tender committee and IDA concurred in May 1978. Orders
were placed by the purchasing agents in June/July 1978. The first batch of
cargo handling equipment was received in Rangoon during 1979.
3.43    The second batch of the cargo handling equipment consisted of seven
items for which specifications were sent to the purchasing agents in March
1979. The purchasing agents issued tender documents in July 1979 and tenders
were closed in September 1979. The purchasing agents submitted their report
and recommendations in December 1979. The purchasing agent's report and
recommendations were examined by the technical committee and the tender
commilttee and orders were placed in March/April 1980 with IDA's concurrence.
The second batch of the cargo handling equipment was received in Rangoon
during the year 1980/81. The list of equipment procured is shown in Annex D.
(b) Workshop Tools and Equipment
3.44    Specifications for 7orkshop tools and equipment were sent to the
purchasing agent in July 1977. However, because of the complicated nature of
the equipment, the specifications were revised and the revised specifications
were ready for tender in late April 1978. The purchasing agent issued tender
invitations in May 1978 fixing the closing date on July 17, 1978.
3.45    Thirty nine firms participated for 21 assorted equipment. Due to the
large volume of work involved in evaluating the tenders, the purchasing
agents took three months to complete the evaluation and submitted their
report and recommendations only in November 1978. The purchasing agents'
report and recommendations were examined by the technical committee and
contract proposals for 19 items were submitted to IDA for concurrence. IDA
concurred and orders were issued in March 1979.
3.46    For the other two items fresh tenders were invited by the purchasing
agent in April 1979 with revised specifications. Tenders were received in
June 1979 and after proper evaluation and selection, orders were issued in
July 1979 with the concurrence of IDA. All the equipment was received during
1980. The detailed list of equipment is shown in Annex E.

3.47   BPC was using various types c: cranes, forklift trucks, tractors and
trailers of different makes numbering 355 units, 110 units were beyond
repairs. A sum of US$395,000 was allocated for procuring spare parts for the
remaining 245 units. Quotations were invited from the nine manufacturers of
the various equipment, and spare parts valued US$378,565.29 were procured
during the years 1977-79.
Category (5) Plant, Machinery and Materials for
Construction of Pontoons, Etc.

(b) Additional Materials for Pontoons, Etc.
3.49   A sum of US$300,000 remained available and IDA was accordingly
requested in September 1978 to agree to purchase nore construction materials
to renovate old and worn out pontoons. IDA agreed and international competi-
tive bids were invited in November 1978 to supply the following construction
materials:
(1) Mild Steel Sections        675 u/tons
(2) Marine Paints              4,000 Imp/Gals
(3) Mooring Chains             70 lengths
(4) Steel Wire Ropes          205 coils
3.50   Bids were received in January 1979 and after evaluation and with
IDA's concurrence orders were placed in March 1979. All materials were
received in September 1979. With the materials received, renovation works on
the following items were carried out in BPC's yards:

(4) 30 ft Span Steel Bridges           4 No.
Cc) Plant and Machinery
3.51   Procurement of plant and machinery was entrusted to the purchasing
agents. Specifications were drawn up by the technical committee for 11 items
of equipment and sent to the purchasing agents in July 1977. The purchasing
agent issued tender documents on December 8, 1977 A total of 20 suppliers
submitted quotations for various items . The purchasing agents evaluated the
bids received and submitted their report and recommendation on March 2, 1978.
The report and recommendation of the purchasing agents were examined and IDA
concurred to award contracts. Orders wsere placed by the purchasing agents
with respective supplers in June 1978. All the equipment was received in
Rangoon during 1979. The details of the plant and machinery are shown in
Annex F.

Category (6) Training
3.52    The IDA Credit provided training of Port personnel in the following
three fields:
(a) Training of Dredger Crew;
(b) Training of Workshops Personnel; and
(c) Training in Planning and Finance.
The following is the brief description of the training undertaken.
(a) Training of Dredger Crew
3.53    In October 1978 negotiations were started with the Adriaan Volker
Dredging Company (AVECO) Dredging Firm from the Netherlands for training a
dredger crew. Agreement was reached in November 1978 and with the concur-
rence of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and IDA a formal con-
tract was signed on January 29, 1979. The program covered by the contract
consisted of two parts:
(a) the training of two Burmese dredgemasters in The Netherlands for a
period of two months;
(b) the training of a dredger crew on board the BPC dredgers in the
Rangoon river channels by two dredging experts to be provided by
AVECO for a period of 16 weeks. The training was to take place for
two brief periods of eight weeks each, one in the monsoon months of
July/August 1979 and the other in the post-monsoon months of
November/ December 1979.
3.54    Two Burmese dredgemasters left for The Netherlands on February 8,
1979. They under went intensive practical training on board the dredgers of
the port of Rotterdam and attended lectures on dredging technique conducted
by dredging experts of the AVECO Dredging Firm. They arrived back to Rangoon
on April 13, 1979 after successful completion of the training.
3.55    An expert engineer and dredger commander from the AVECO arrived in
Rangoon on July 2, 1979 for the monsoon season training. A training program
was drawn up by the expert engineer and training of dredger crew commenced on
July 9, 1979 on board the suction dredger  Thaung Naing Yay  by practical
dredging in the Inner Bar. The training on the Outer Bar Channel took place
on August 22, 1979 and the first phase training was completed on September 2,
1979. During the entire training period, the AVECO dredging commander was
assisted by the two Burmese dredgemasters trained in The Netherlands.



-19-
3.56    For the second stage it was originally intended to have the dredger
crew trained for four weeks each on board the Thaung Naing Yay  and the
"Kyant Khaing Yay." However, as the -Kyant Rhaing Yay' was delayed it was
decided to curtail the training to four weeks and to invite only one dredging
expert. The AVECO dredging expert came to Rangoon on November 2, 1979 and
the training took place in Outer Bar area. The AVECO dredging expert
returned to The Netherlands on December 3, 1979 after successful completion
of training.
(b) Training of Workshops Personnel
3.57    For training of workshops personnel, a training expert from the
Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT), Switzerland was
invited to prepare a report and draw up a training program on how the train-
ing classes could best be conducted. The expert's report was received in May
1979 and based on it a training contract was drawn up and signed with World
ORT Union. The contract provided for training equipment and aids and two
training specialists to conduct classes on four trades:
(a) Motor Truck Mecbanics;
(b) Marine Engine Mechanics;
(c) Metal Construction and Welding; and
(d) General Maintenance and Repair Fitting.
3.58    The two Specialists arrived in Rangoon on May 31, 1980 and training
classes started on June 9, 1980. The first two courses were completed on
August 29, 1980 and the second two courses were completed on November 14,
1980.
Cc) Training - Planning and Finance
3.59    Three teams of two port officials were sent to Singapore for a
four-week course with the Port of Singapore Authority for training on the
following subjects:
(a) Port Operation/Management - August/September 1979
(b) Planning and Operation of
Container Terminal        - October/November 1979
(c) Conventional Cargo
Handling Methods          - August/September 1980
3.60    A study group of five port officials headed by the Managing Director
visited the ports of Southampton, Felixstowe and Liverpool in the United



-20-
Kingdom for three weeks in September/October 1980 to update their knowledge
of port operations and planning in western ports. Similarly, another group
of five port officials headed by the General Manager visited ports of Hong
Kong, Manila, Singapore and Bangkok for four weeks in November 1980. With a
view to widen the knowledge of worldwide port activities and future trends on
port planning, the Managing Director of BPC attended the 12th Biennial
Conference of International Association of Ports and Harbors held in Nagoya,
Japan from May 23-30, 1981.
Category (7) Accounting Machines and Associated Equipment and Materials
3.61    This equipment was not included in the original list of goods to be
purchased with proceeds of the Credit. Since 1947, BPC had employed punch
card accounting machines for accounting and statistical work. The machines
were hired from the then British Tabulating Co. Ltd., later changed to
International Computers Ltd. Rental and maintenance charges were paid
monthly in local currency to the Rangoon branch of the Company. In early
1975 International Computers Ltd., notified BPC that they were not in a
position to continue maintaining the machines after December 31, 1975 and
suggested that ways and means should be sought to switch to other suitable
data processing system. International Computers Ltd., however, agreed to a
request from BPC to help maintain the existing machines until a suitable new
system was inaugurated so that the work would not be stopped.
3.62    BPC sought advice both from the Rangoon University Computer Center
and other experts on procurement of a suitable data processing unit to cope
with the required volume of work. An expert was deputed to BPC and recom-
mended the employment of a Mini Computer System similar to ICL 203 model 40.
The estimated foreign exchange cost was US$370,000. As the cost was con-
siderable, BPC decided to seek assistance from IDA for provision of-funds out
of the unallocated category of the Credit.
3.63    A proposal was submitted to IDA.  In January 1980, IDA informed BPC
that US$400,000 was appropriated to a new category entitled -Accounting
Machines and Associated Equipment and Materials.- In early March 1980, an
expert from IDA Computing Activities Department visited Rangoon to review the
type of equipment and training needed for BPC. The IDA expert recommended
that a Joint Computer Center be set up between the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and BPC, sharing the foreign exchange
cost equally out of IDA Credits 958-BA of PTC and 671-BA of BPC. With the
concurrence of IDA, an agreement was signed between the PTC and BPC for the
establishment of Joint Computer Center outlining the conditions for the use
of the equipment and sharing of the capital cost of the equipment and yearly
maintenance cost.
3.64    The invitation of international competitive bids, tender evaluation
and selection of the tender were undertaken by PTC and concurrence of IDA, a
contract was signed on January 10, 1981 between the PTC/BPC and Messrs.



-21-
Control Data (Thailand) Ltd., Thailand. The total contract price was
US$776,096 and BPC's share of the cost was US$302,686.
3.65    The accounting machine and associated equipment and materials arrived
in Rangoon during August/September 1981. As provided in the contract tech-
nicians from the PTC and BPC were trained in Thailand in the operation and
maintenance of the equipment. The installation of the equipment was carried
out during November 1981 by Control Data (Thailand) Ltd., with useful col-
laboration by technicians from the Rangoon University Computer Center and
after successful test operations, an opening ceremony was held on December
23, 1981.
F. Project Cost
3.66    The total estimated cost of the project as per appraisal report was
US$16.156 million, including foreign exchange component of US$9.996 million.
The actual total expenditure was US$16.160 million, including foreign
exchange cost of US$9.996 million. A breakdown of actual and estimated
project costs by major equipment, works and services is in Table 1. For
purpose of fair comparison, the estimated cost of each major item was
suitably modified incorporating the physical and cost contingencies and
comodities and services tax which were shown separately in the original
appraisal estimates.
3.67    Overall project costs were not much different than the appraisal
estimates. This was due to the fact that the Credit amount was utilized to
the full extent and there was no change in local tax structure since the time
of preparing project cost estimates. Cost contingencies of 8 per cent per
annum expected for the years 1977/78 through 1979/80 did not fully
materialize. A surplus remained after all items of equipment and materials
had been fully committed. Because of this BPC was able to procure additional
equipment and spare parts for vessels and cargo handling equipment and the
accounting machines and associated equipment and materials. 1/
G. Disbursement and Financial Sources
Disbursements
3.68   Actual disbursements surpassed expectations up to the end of 1979.
From then actual disbursements lagged behind. This situation was due to
1/ A 12 per cent overrun in dredger rehabilitation estimates and a 35.5 per
cent overrun in Electronic position finding equipment were compensated
for by under-runs in the other procurement categories.



-22-
certain time lags in the procurement of the additional cargo handling equip-
ment for which firm orders were issued only in 1980, and to delays in procur-
ing the Electronic position finding equipment and the accounting machines.
3.69    There were no significant delays or problems in disbursements
(Table 2). However, a minor but notable incidenu is brought to the attention
of IDA. Usur,lly it took from 30 to 35 days from the date of submission of
withdrawal applications to actual disbursements and on some occasions the
beneficiaries complained about delays in receipt of payment. It was under-
stood tnat the mail service took about 14 days to reach Washington and
processing disbursement by IDA another 15 to-20 days. It would perhaps be
better for Borrowers if such disbursement times could be shortened. 1/
Financial Sources
3.70    Before the financial year 1976/77, BPC's surplus cash had to be
deposited in the Union Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF). This system was
discontinued from April 1, 1976 and BPC was able to accumulate cash surpluses
on its own account.   K6.2 million had been accumulated when the project
started in 1977. In addition, an annual cash surplus during the succeeding
four years to 1980/81 averaged K26.1 million. Therefore, BPC was able to
meet the local costs and other debt obligations without recourse to outside
sources.
H. The Role of International Purchasing Agents
3.71    The idea of utilizing international purchasing agents was suggested
by IDA. during negotiations for the proposed Credit. In the negotiation the
Burmese delegation contended that since BPC had sufficiently experienced and
competent personnel to perform the procurement work, international purchasing
agents were not necessary, and that the Government would not be in favor of
employing such an agency. However, IDA urged the Government to reconsider,
at least for the major items in the project, emphasizing that such line of
action would reduce the administrative burden on BPC, and assist in speedy
procurement which would minimize inflationary price increases. The Burmese
delegation agreed with IDA and employed a purchasing agent.
1/ GOB chose to use IDA's disbursement arrangements for issuing agreements
to reimburse to commercial banks which provide prefinancing of goods
imported for the project. This requires use of the mail services and
accounts for delays. Disbursements under this procedure normally only
take place after the commercial banks receive IDA's agreement to reim-
burse arl to claim reimbursement from IDA. Therefore, the delays men-
tioned were unavoidable unless other Bank Group disbursement procedures
had been utilized.



-23-
3.72    BPC entrusted the purchasing agents with the procurement of some
vessel equipment and accessories under category (2), cargo handling and
workshops equipment under category (4) and plant and machinery under category
(5). The duties and functions of the purchasing agents consisted of:
(a) inviting to tender;
(b) adjudicating and evaluating the tenders;
(c) reporting;
(d) recommending to BPC the award of contracts, and subsequently placing
contracts and associated negotiations;
(e) progressing of contracts;
(f) preparing progress reports;
(g) arranging shipment;
(h) checking of invoices; and
Ci) preparing withdrawal applications on BPC's behalf and submitting them
to IDA for payment to suppliers.
3.73    In order to proceed with the duties outlined, BPC furnished the
purchasing agents with detailed specifications of the equipment required to
be purchased. For their services, the purchasing agents were paid commis-
sions at varying rates depending on the value of individual orders or con-
tracts issued. BPC also authorized the purchasing agents to submit
withdrawal applications directly from IDA for payment of cost of goods as
well as the commission.
3.74    The purchasing agents procured the following:
(a) Vessels Equipment                             4 Items
(b) Cargo Handling Equipment                     15 Items
(c) Workshop Tools and Equipment                 21 Items
(d) Civil Engineering Plant and Machinery        11 Items
The total cost was US$4,261,285.08 and commission and other charges paid was
US$103,953.68. The performance by the purchasing agents is described below.
3.75    As mentioned, the basic aim of utilizing the services of interna-
tional purchasing agents was to help reduce the administrative burden on BPC,



-24-
to assist speedy procurement to minimize the effect of inflation. BPC was
much impressed by the record of services performed by the purchasing agents
and was fully confident that the basic aims would be successfully
accomplished. However, in actual practice the performance by the purchasing
agents was, to say the least, below expected standard, if not tnsatisfactory.
The following few instances, among several others, are worthy of mention to
justify BPC's contention. 1/
3.76    In the procurement of cargo handling equipment, the procurement
consisted of, among others, two types of forklift trucks. The purchasing
agents, in their evaluation of tenders, grossly omitted two tenders, both in
the price comparison and, consequently, in their report and recommendations.
This omission might not be serious and could normally be treated as an over-
look if the resulting effect did not materially change the selection.
However, the two omitted tenders happened to be the lowest evaluated bidders
and were finally selected. From then on BPC was unable to rely on the pur-
chasing agents' work and had to make every effort to check and re-evaluate
tenders and recommendations submitted by the purchasing agents. This
involved considerable office work and time so that the aim of reducing the
administrative burden and speedy procurement was not achieved.
3.77    A second instance involved the procurement of 10-ton mobile cranes.
BPC required mobile cranes with a lifting capacity of 10-ton at a radius of 4
feet beyond bumper tip, and specifications were furnished to the purchasing
agents accordingly. But the purchasing agents, in inviting tenders added a
capacity of "10-ton free-on-wheels" clause to the specification without
informing BPC. Accordingly, when the tendersi had been finally evaluated, the
purchasing agents recommended for a crane with the capacity of "10-ton
free-on-wheels" which was heavier than that required by BPC and was almost 50
per cent more expensive than the ordinary cranes with 10-ton capacity at a
radius of 4 feet from bumper tip. The proposal of the technical committee
and the recommendation of the purchasing agents were submitted to IDA for
decision. IDA suggested that alternative bids should be invited for cranes
with 10-ton capacity at 4 feet outreach from bumper tip with outriggers. The
matter was finally settled in favor of BPC's wishes but procurement was
unnecessarily delayed for three moRths.
3.78    A third significant instance occurred in the procurement of a fuel
injection pump testing machine. The price contained a discount allowance of
10 per cent for payments within 14 days. When an application was submitted
to IDA for payment of the machine, the purchasing agents put a claim of
i 768.99 over and above the contract price. A dispute followed between BPC
and the purchasing agents over the legality of the claim. BPC gave reasons
why such a claim was inadmissible (since no expressed stipulation was men-
tioned in the contract for reducing the discount allowance if payment was
delayed beyond 14 days) and although the matter was finally settled with the
purchasing agents admitting their mistake, this event was very tiresome.
1/ For consultant's comments see Annex H.



-25-
3.79    Another unfortunate incident were the delays in shipment. Some of
the shipments were much behind scheduled delivery dates. In certain cases,
delays were caused by failure on the part of the purchasing agents, to imple-
ment formal commercial regulations within reasonable time, for example,
delays in opening Letters of Credit. An example: the contract for the supply
of forklift trucks was issued in June 1978; the forklift trucks were to be
shipped within three months after the receipt of the Letter of Credit, yet
the purchasing agents opened the Letter of Credit only in November 1978 and
shipment was delayed for five months. In another case, the delays were
caused by default of the suppliers to adhere to the scheduled delivery dates.
In one extreme case the order for supply of some welding equipment was issued
in July 1979. Although shipment of the equipment was to be completed within
two months, i.e., by the end of August 1979, the supplier was only able to
complete the shipment in February 1981, a delay of 17 morhs. Such cases
were not infrequent and although there was no monetary loss by the delays,
BPC suffered liquidated damages since the equipment could not be put in
operation within the appropriate time to the best possible advantage.
3.80    By citing these unfortunate events, BPC does not imply that the
purchasing agents were incompetent or handled the cases without undue care.
There was hardly any doubt that the purchasing agents had tried their best,
and taken some pains to perform the duties entrusted to them, to the satis-
faction of BPC. In fact, BPC was considerably relieved of the voluminous and
tedious paper work of preparing tenders, contract documents and other related
correspondence. However, it is felt that if BPC had undertaken the procure-
ment on its own, the work could have been accomplished with the same success
and speed without incurring precious foreign exchange expenditure paid to
the purchasing agents. The conclusion is that, in the future, the employment
of outside services should be confined to absolutely necessary cases which
require special technical skill and are beyond the capability of BPC's own
personnel. 1/
1/ Previous experience with procurement delays on other projects in Burma
led to the recommendation to employ international purchasing agents. The
Bank will take BPC's comments into account when developing and designing
new transport projects in Burma.



-26-
I. Effect of Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations
3.81    It would be pertinent to mention that fluctuations in the US Dollar
exchange rate were an important factor in project implementation. Since the
Credit was specified in US Dollars, all payments made in other eligible
currencies were valued in US Dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the
date of payment. Therefore, great care had to be exercised in making commit-
ments for payment out of the Credit. The changes in the exchange rates were
so swift and the spreads so great from month to month, that it was found very
difficult to make accurate forecasts. The following examples show the range
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US Dollar against two major
eligible currencies:
Year       Pound Sterling (L)    Japanese Yen (Y)
1978         .51/.55                 195/241
1979         .43/.50                 1951249
1980         .41/.50                 213/249
1981         .42/.54                 203/232
3.82    1980 happened to be a year hard hit by exchange fluctuations.  At the
beginning of the year the exchange rates of one US Dollar against Pound
Sterling and Japanese Yen, two of the currencies in which most of the trans-
actions were carried out, were L 0.485 and Y 249, respectively. When pay-
ments fell due in October 1980, the exchange values of the US Dollar was down
to L 0.417 and Y 215 and the effect of exchange fluctuatiou cost more than
US$85,000 over the originally committed amount on four transactions alone.
BPC had to exercise restraint in making commitments and the procurement of
certain spare parts for vessels had to be rescinded. By the end of March
1981, the amount expended and committed reached US$9.996 million at the then
prevailing exchange rates, but in May 1981 the value of US Dollar rose and in
August 1981 a savings of US$50,000 approximately was available. By that time
there was little chance of making further commitments since all payments were
to be completed on or before the closing date of December 31, 1981. However,
the uncommitted balance was utilized in purchasing additional accounting
equipment readily available in the market. IDA agreed to extend the disbur-
sement period to the end of March 1982 to spend the balance.
IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A. Seaborne Traffic
4.01    Table 3 shows forecast and actual traffic handled by the port from
the appraisal year 1976/77 through 1980/81, by major commodities. Exports
exceeded appraisal expectations because of considerable increase in the
export of rice and rice products, and POL (Petrol, Oil and Lubricants). The
volume of general cargo import increased more than expected too, but there



-27-
was a shortfall in coal and POL imported which had no significant effect on
general cargo handling operations. These latter were handled in specialized
terminals at Hteedan Coal Berth and Syriam, respectively.
4.02    Although there were marked variations in the volume of exports and
imports handled from year to year, the port operated efficiently and there
were no undue delays, or problems in loading and unloading cargoes, or con-
gestion and storage problems. This improved cargo handling efficiency was
undoubtedly attributable to intensive usp nf new equipment (see Annex G).
B. Inland Traffic
4.03    The project was mainly aimed at Burma's foreign trade, as only in
this trade were ships used which would benefit from deepening of the sea
access channels. However, the progect also included improvement of pontoons,
jetties and steel span bridges used for coastal and inland traffic. The
following inland traffic was shipped and landed at the pontoon jetties during
the five year period:
Year       Shipped      Landed      Total
gmX-(       t-ons)
1976/77     380,020     894,134   1,274,154

C. Shipping
4 .04    The number of ships (excluding schooners) entering the port increased
from 591 in 1976/77 (appraisal year) to 800 in 1980/81. Berth occupancy by
ships alongside wharves correspondingly increased. Total number of ships and
hours spent alongside wharves each year were as follows:
Year       No. of Ships Entered      Hours Spent Alongside
1976/77            591                       65,648
1977/78            597                       67,799
1978/79            713                       ;2,963

-28-
Although the number of ships increased, delays and waiting times were
appreciably reduced:
Year       No. of Ships Delayed      Hours Delayed
1976/77             26                    1,594
1977/78              7                      301
1978/79             13                      986
1979/80              1                       55
1980/81             11                      427
4.05    There were no significant changes in the size and draft of ships
entering the port during the years of project Implementation. This was
because the problem of draft restrictions to cross the Inner Bar persisted
although the Outer Bar was deepened to well over 15 feet below datum, which
was the main concern under the project. This subject is briefly discussed in
the following paragraphs.
D. Dredging
4.06    The main purpose of the project was to maintain the depths in the
Outer Bar and Inner Bar access channels to a Aepth of 15 feet below datum,
thus allowing 15,000 dwt ships to enter and leave the port on high tides. To
achieve this aim, the line of action was to:
(a) overhaul the existing suction dredger TNY;
(b) give specialized training to dredgemasters and crew; and
(c) procure Electronic position finding equipment to be attached to the
suction dredger and survey vessel.
The overhauling of suction dredger 'TNY" was completed in May 1979. Two BPC
dredgemasters received specialized training in the field of dredging in the
Netherlands for two months from February to March 1979. As a follow up, two
dredging specialists from the Netherlands conducted practical training of the
two dredgemasters and the dredger crew on board the suction dredger TNY at
Rangoon for two months in the monsoon season of July and August 1979 and for
one month in post-monsoon period of November 1979. Electronic position
finding equipment was procured, but was not available for use until March
1982.
4.07    As stated earlier, dredging of the Outer Bar became unnecessary due
to the deepening of the natural channel since 1976. But the Inner Bar
remained a limitation to port access as the depth could not be adequately
maintained. Therefore, a work plan was drawn up to dredge the Inner Bar



-29-
chanmel at a critical area 40 hours a week from Monday to Friday, 8 hours per
day, leaving Saturday and Sunday for maintenance.
4.08    The intensive dredging of the Inner Bar channel with the TNY com-
menced in January 1980. The annual volume of maintenanc3 dredging for the
years ending 1980 and 1981 were 605,881 m3 and 594,607 m , respectively.
Regular post dredging hydrographic surveys were carried out weekly in order
to keep a close watch on the extent of development in this channel from week
to week.  aowever, in spite of the effor  to remove more than the predicted
malntenance dredging volume of 140,000 m annually at the Inner Bar, it
appears that the 15 feet depth along the shipping channel could not be main-
tained in all seasons.
4.09    The reason f r the extra dredging carried out annually, 300,000 m2
instead of 100,000 m , as originally recommended by the consultants, is a
compromise to navigators who have raised doubts whether a channel width of
100 meters at a confluence of three rivers can be maintained.  BPC has
decided t2 dredge in channel measuring approximated (1,200 m x 150 m) -
180,000 m  which undoubtedly could be a favorable solution but this must be
confined to the narrow channel with the help of the Electronic position
finding equipment, if depth of 15 ft is to be achieved.
4.10    The extra dredging carried out, was done in too wide a channel
because of lack of the position finding equipment which has now been
installed and is already in operation.  With the help of this, it is hoped
that the 15 feet depth in the Inner Bar channel would be achieved throughout
the year.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Income and Expenditure Accounts
5.01    Table 4 shows forecast and actual income and rzpenditure accounts
from the appraisal year 1976/77 through 1980/81. There was considerable
increase in traffic income from the year 1979/80 corretponding to the growth
in the exports volume of rice products and POL. Demurrage income had doubled
appraisal estimates in 1979/80 and tripled in 1980/81. Although this source
of Income contributed to BPCts finances, such an outcome was undesirable from
the operational point of view. On the expenditure side, there was a steady
increase from year to year, following the same pattern of appraisal estimates
although the actuals fell short of expectations. One of the covenants in the
Credit Agreement was that the annual net earnings from operations should be
not less than 6 per cent of the average value of net fixed assets of BPC.
BPC was able to fulfill this covenant throughout the years of project
implementation. The return on fixed assets was abnormally high in 1979/80



-30-
and 1980/81 reaching 28.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively, which was
the result of increases in demurrage income. However, even without such
increases, rates of return would still be as high as 23.9 per cent and 18.2
per cent, respectively. 1/ A more meritable erceumstance was that BPC had
achieved this important goal without the nect_sity of tariff increases as
recommended in the Appraisal Report.
B. Source and Disposition of Funds
5.02    From April 1, 1976, BPC, in common with other state enterprises, was
given greater degree of financial autonomy and allowed to retain cash
surpluses and make payments out of own resources. During the course of five
years, BPC had accumulated a surplus cash balance of K 147.0 million at the
end of March 1981. Therefore, BPC was in sound financial position to be able
to meet debts commitments and meet local cost requirements of development
projects. A statement of the source and disposition of funds is shown in
Table 5.
C. Balance Sheets
5.03    The balance sheet of BPC for the years 1977-81 is shown in Table 6.
The accounts are self explanatory except for Account Receivable- and 'Invest-
ment.- In the former account is included K 48.1 million temporarily financed
by BPC for purchase of dredgers for Waterways Department of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications, for which BPC acted as procurement agent. This
sum was recoverable from Waterways Department and at the time of writing this
report K 32.5 million had already been recovered. As regards 'Investments-,
BPC had accumulated a cash balance out of which a sum of K 130.7 million was
invested in the purchase of short-term Government Saving Bonds renewable
every three months. The investment yields an interest rate of 1 per cent per
annum and can be encashed at short notice.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Objectives
6.01    Before proceeding with economic re-evaluation, it should be pointed
out that since the project was completed only a short time ago, no tentative
economic results could be produced with reliable precision. Furthermore, the
time available was too short to be able to collect or frame any useful data
1/ The high rate of return on fixed assets is partly due to BPC practice
of transferring work in progress items to fixed asset account only when
project items are fully acquired or completed.



-31-
to show any appreciable result arising out of the project. To present infor-
mation without reliable data would merely be a conjecture. Therefore, the
best approach would be to assess how far assumptions and forecasts made in
the Appraisal Report had materialized during the short-term interval from the
start to the completion of the project.
6.02    In the Appraisal Report, the proiect benefits had been calculated as
difference in shipping and cargo handling -without" and "with" the project.
Savings consisted of the following three components:
(a) reduced ship-waiting times for arriving and departing ocean-going
vessels as a result of the channel deepening;
(b) reduced shipping costs per ton of exports and imports resulting from
the use of larger ships made possible by the deeper channel; and
(c) reduced cargo handling costs in Rangoon Port as a result of improved
cargo handling equipment.
Reduced Ship-Waiting Times
6.03    Ship-waiting time entering and leaving Rangoon Port were caused, in
addition to the channel depth by volume of traffic, type and size of ships,
tidal and seasonal variations in trade. Without the project, it was assumed
the shipping pattern would continue as before and most probably the channel
would deteriorate from the then existing 12 ft below datum, to 10 ft below
datum. This would result in increased ship-waiting time and increasingly
restrict use of the existing 10,000 dwt ton vessels which were standard for
Burma. With the project, it was assumed that a gradual introduction of
larger and more economical 15,000 dwt vessels would take place and a con-
siderable portion of trade would be carried by those ships. By deepening the
channel depth to 15 ft below datum, it was calculated that 10,000 dwt ships
would not experience any difficulty in entering and leaving the port and
their w&iting time would be zero although waiting time for a 15,000 dwt ship
was estimated to be 0.64 days per arrival and departure. This would result
in considerable saving in daily ship operating cost.
Reduced Shipping Costs
6.04    The cost of shipping per ton of exports and imports would be reduced
for two reasons:
(a) with increasing size, the ship costs increased proportionally
less than the carrying capacity; and
(b) the ship turnaround time in Rangoon Port was reduced because of
improved cargo loading and unloading rates.



-32-
6.05    With the introduction of larger ships, it was assumed that increases
in annual cargo carrying capacity of ships and annual ships operating costs
would be as under:
Increase in Cargo   Increase in Ship
Shipping Route    Carrying Capacity    Operating Cost
Northern Europe          45%                 33%
Japan/Far East           38%                 33%
From the above, it was calculated that the difference (saving) per ton of
exports and imports would be US$3.00 per ton for Japan/Far East and US$6.75
per ton for Northern Europe.
Reduced Cargo Handling Costs
6.06    The average cost of cargo handling per ton of exports and imports in
the Rangoon Port, prior to the project, was estimated to be US$4.00 per ton.
With the deteriorating condition of the existing cargo handling equipment,
cost of cargo handling was estimated at US$4.50 per ton, without the project.
The project included, therefore, a considerable number of equipment, spares
and workshop equipment. With the introduction of the new equipment, cost of
cargo handling would be reduced to US$3.75 per ton thus representing a saving
of US$0.75 per ton.
Estimated Project Benefits
6.07    With the expected reductions in ship-waiting times and shipping costs
per ton of exports and imports as the result of deepening the channel and
improved cargo handling conditions, the economic rate of return had been
calculated at 37 per cent. It was further qualified that with the assumed
20 per cent increase in the project cost (which already included 20 per cent
in contingencies) and a corresponding decrease in benefits, the economic
return would still be as high as 25 per cent on the initial project cost of
US$13.0 million equivalent.
B. Overall Assessment of Project Benefits
6.08    Reductions in ship-waiting times and shipping costs were dependent on
the deepening of access channels in the Outer and Inner Bar areas to 15 ft
below datum. As has been mentioned in Chapter IV, the depth of water in the
Outer Bar channel was naturally deepened to over 15 ft below datum. But in
spite of intensive dredging to deepen the Inner Bar channel the required
depth of 15 ft could not be maintained throughout the year. Therefore, the
draft limitation still existed for larger ships in certain seasons of the
year. However, the affirmative benefit was that the channel had not
deteriorated to 10 ft below datum, as was expected without the project. On
the other hand, although the number and size of ships entering the port had



-33-
been considerable over the years, only few ships had experienced delays in
crossing the Inner Bar in certain seasons of the year which showed a marked
improvement in reducing ship-waiting times.
6.09    Another source of improvement was the increased efficiency in cargo
handling which in turn contributed to the quicker ship turnaround. As shown
in Table 3, the volume of trade handled in the port had increased from 1.8
million tons in 1976/77 to 2.5 million tons in 1979/80 and 1980/81.
Similarly, the number of ships entering the port had increased from 591 in
1976/77 to around 800 in 1979/80 and 1980/81. In spite of such increases in
shipping and trade volumes, the port was working efficiently and only few
ships had to wait for berthing facilities. There were practically no
cargo-congestion problems throughout the project implementation years. The
actual economic rate of return for the cargo handling component was 53 per
cent as compared to 50 per cent at appraisal (Annex G).
C. Future Prospects
6.10    As mentioned in paragraph 4.10, it is hopeful that dredging in the
Inner Bar area by suction dredger TNY, attached with the Electronic position
finding equipment, would produce the required depth of 15 ft below datum
throughout the year. Presently, over 60 per cent imports and about 25 per
cent exports are carried by the vessels of Burma Five Star Shipping
Corporation (BFSSC). BFSSC had a fleet of 12 foreign-going ships, of which 2
were 11,700 dtw ton vessels, and it is understood that 6 more 11,700 ton
vessels would be added to the existing fleet between 1982 and 1984. With
the expected improvement of the Inner Bar channel, these 11,700 dwt ton
vessels would be able to cross the Inner Bar channel without difficulty.
Moreover, with the introduction of larger ships, the BFSSC fleet would be
able to take share of bigger percentage of imports and exports. An appreci-
able economic rate of return is, therefore, expected within the next two or
three years.

VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
A. Project Justification and Objective
7.01    The Port of Rangoon had restrictions to shipping, as the draft of
ships entering the port was controlled by the depths of the two access chan-
nels which were deteriorating. BPC and the Government sought the assistance
of IDA in solving this problem and in improving port facilities. IDA was
convinced that the port was important to transportation and a credit of
US$10.0 million was granted. The major objectives of the project were to
deepen the port access channel to 15 ft below datum to permit vessels of up
to 15,000 dwt to enter and leave the port at most states of the tide, and to
improve the operating facilities within the port area.
B. Project Implementation and Supervision
7.02    Project preparation requirements were reasonable and BPC had no
difficulties in following them. However, in some cases, IDA's requirements
were not very realistic. For example, the Credit Agreement (Section 3.06)
states that the rehabilitation of the dredger -Thaung Naing Yay was to be
completed not later than December 31, 1977. Yet the procedure for
rehabilitation of the dredger involved the following steps:
(a) preparation and submission of qualification papers and details of
bidding procedure for Bank's concurrence prior to bid invitations;
(b) invitation of bids for prequalification;
(c) submission of list of prequalified bidders together with the state-
ment of their qualification to the Bank for concurrence;
(d) preparation and submission of specifications and bidding documents to
the Bank for concurrence prior to bids invitation;
(e) invitation of bids;
(f) evaluation of bids and submission of detailed report of evaluation
for Bank's concurrence, prior to award of contract; and
(g) award of contract and dredger rehabilitation.
(Please refer to Schedule 3, Part C, of the Credit Agreement).



-35-
It was unreasonable to expect these requirements to be fulfilled within nine
months. However, BPC took every possible effort to fulfill these require-
ments to the Bank's satisfaction.
7.03   Another Bank condition was to employ international purchasing agents
to procure some items in the project. The reasons given for this line of
action was that it would reduce the administrative burden on BPC and assist
in speedy procurement which would minimize the effects of inflation.
Although it amounted to under-estimation of BPC's procurement capacities, the
Bank's sincere intentions and anxieties were very much appreciated. The Bank
might, by experience, find such a thing necessary for some of its borrowers
but it is considered unnecessary for a borrower like BPC.
7.04   There were instances in which differences of opinion existed between
the Bank and BPC, but most of the differences were on minor procurement
issues which deserved no particular mention. A particular instance was the
procurement of Electronic position finding equipment. BPC had doubts that
such equipment was necessary since the Outer Bar channel had been stable over
the past year, and the equipment might be too sophisticated for BPC's needs.
However, the Bank rightly pointed out that, from the past experience the
Outer Bar channel was subject to cyclical changes of position and consequent
depth and when that occurred close maintenance and prompt dredging would be
essential.
7.05    Bank supervision of the project was adequate.  Supervision missions
visited BPC about twice a year to assess progress. Their visits were of help
in discussing important and outstanding issues. Mission advice and guidance
were appreciated.
C. Working Relationship
7.06   The working relationship between the Bank and BPC was good, frank and
cordial. BPC received all help and advice it required during project
implementation. In return, BPC always furnished the Bank all the information
and reports without burden.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01    The report started with the background information and series of
steps taken from time to time for development of port facilities of the
war-torn Port of Rangoon, since the end of Second World War in order to give
the readers a brief description of events leading to the present Second Port
Development Project.
8.02    In Chapter III was described the scope of works carried out by the
borrower in implementation of the project, with brief discussions on proce-
dures to be followed on procurement items as contained in the project. It
also contained problems and delays in the process of procurement, and revi-
sions of project items such as additions and omissions, wherever necessary,
and the reasons for such delays and revision requirements. Some pertinent
comnmen  were also given on the performance of the international purchasing
agents-hnd also the effect of exchange rate fluctuations of the US Dollar
against other international currencies in order to produce lessons,whether to
learn or avoid these in the handling of future projects.
8.03    In Chapters IV and V were described the operating and financial
performances by the borrower during the project implementation years, giving
a vivid picture of the trade and shipping pattern in the port and appropriate
financial figures compared with appraisal expectations, with brief comments
'wherever necessary. Chapter VI dealt with economic re-evaluation of the
project, with an overall assessment of benefits derived in the interim
period, and also promising signs of improvement fairly predictable in the
near future.
8.04    It is clear from the reports and comments discussed in Chapter VI
that partial benefits could be accounted for with respect to savings in
ship-waiting time costs as a result of improvements in the channel depth in
the Inner Bar area, and also the reductions in cargo handling costs with the
introduction of new cargo handling equipment and spare parts, coupled with
increased efficiency of operation and maintenance personnel, gained through
proper training facilities. The only problem remaining to be tackled was how
to maintain the Inner Bar channel to a depth of 15 ft below datum throughout
all seasons   The consultant firm which conducted the feasibility study for
the Second Port Project, and which have just completed a study on the new
port development, after reviewing the dredging needs in the Inner Bar area,
have stated in their draft final report as under:
-Reconsideration of sedimentation rates indicates that annual deposi-
tion in a 15 feet dee  channel act oss the Inner Bar will be between
200,000 and 300,000 m  (140,000 mi  according to previous study) but
to remove this amount effectively it will be necessary to:
1/ For consultant's comments see Annex H.



-37-
(a) concentrate dredging operations in the period November to June;
natural scouring due to higher discharges very much reduces
dredging needs at other times o)f year; and
(b) restrict dredging to the shallow lengths of the narrowest channel
practicable for shipping to negotiate, rather than over bottom
channel widths presently exceeding 250 m.-
In light of the consultants' above remarks, a further intensive dredging
should be conducted in the next post-monsoon season on the lines suggested by
the consultants with the Electronic position finding equipment attached to
the dredger. A bright outcome from such intensive dredging is expected very
much in earnest.
8.05    In any case, the project was of considerable benefit to BPC
primarily, and to the economy in general. As discussed in Chapter VI, the
volume of trade and shipping handled by the port in the years 1979-80 and
1980-81 (the latest two years for which figures were available) increased by
more than 30 per cent over the similar volume handled in the pre-project
years. In spite of such increases, BPC was able to handle them very effi-
ciently without employing extra labor force or any other subsidies. This was
solely attributable to the intensive use of cargo handling equipment and
continuous maintenance of port access channels to a considerable degree made
available by the project. This favorable situation resulted an increase in
the earnings of BPC by more than 30 per cent over the appraisal estimates,
nuotably without resort to tariff increase envisaged in the Project Appraisal
Report. BPC was, therefore, able to maintain sufficient operating surpluses
and after meeting loan repayment and debt interest charges,' had accumulated a
cash rese-ve of K 147 million at the end of 1980-81 for meeting future
development needs. This was an undeniably approved benefit derived from the
project. Furthermore, the efficiency in the cargo handling operations had
reduced the ship turnround time in the port which in turn resulted saving in
daily ship operating cost.
8.06    On the other hand, by continuous intensive dredging by the newly
rehabilitated suction dredger Thaung Naing Yay", BPC was not only able to
prevent deterioration in the Inner Bar Channel which would perhaps be
deteriorated to 10 feet below datum, without the project as assumed by the
consultants and IBRD Project Appraisal mission, but also to maintain con-
tinuously at an adequate depth (even though the required depth of 15 feet
below datum has yet to be maintained in all seasons) to allow the prevailing
shipping to enter and leave the port without serious difficulty. Thus
ship-waiting time was considerably reduced and coupled with a significant
faster ship turnround time, which was achieved as the result of improved
cargo handling rates, obviously due to the utilization of new cargo handling
equipment acquired recently under the present Second Port Project, has led to
appreciable savings in the daily ship operating cost. The BFSSC, the only
national shipping line in Burma, has accordingly benefited from the above



-38-
saving in the ship operating cost. With the published depth maintained at 15
feet below datum at the Inner Bar Channel by systematic dredging with the
recently rehabilitated suction trailer hopper dredger 'Thaung Naing Yay", it
is expected that larger ships of 15,000 dwt would be able to call at the Port
of Rangoon. As such, it is envisaged that the benefit would be further
increased not only by way of saving in ship operating cost but also by way of
reducing shipping cost made available by handling increased tonnage carried
by vessels comparatively larger than the present ships calling at Rangoon.
8.07    While the project brings considerable benefit with the improvements
achieved, further development of the port facilities is considered still
necessary to meet future medium and long-term demands. If the present trend
of trade and shipping continues to take place as expected, the volume of
exports and Imports are expected to increase to a minimum level of 3 million
tons by 1985-86 and to 3.5 million tons by 1990-91 wita the corresponding
increase in the number of ships probably introducing more larger ships to
accommodate increased trade tonnage. With the prospect of expected increases
in trade and shipping, further demand for increased port facilities is bound
to occur. A feasibility study for future port development had, therefore,
been conducted since January 1981 by a team of consultants, with the assis-
tance of UNDP. The study covered the overall medium and long-term needs of
the port facilities to accommodate future growth. Based on the findings of
the study, a Third Port Project is currently being prepared for financing by
IDA.

SECOND RANGOON -ORT PROJECT (Credit 671-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Economic Re-evaluation 1/
1.        General
At appraisal, the project's economic evaluation consisted of an
overall view of expected benefits which fell into three categories:
Ca)   reduced ship waiting times for arriving and departing ocean
vessels as a result of the channel deepening;
(b)   reduced shipping costs per ton of exports and imports
resulting from the use of larger ships made possible
by the deeper channel; and
(e)   rede-ed cargo handling costs as well as improved ship
turnaround times in Rangoon Port as a result of improved
cargo handling equipment.
With these cost reductions, the overall economic rate of return
was calculated over the project life to be 37%. This was a conservative
assessment since it did not include the benefits of avoided lighterage.
At this high level, the rate of return was not very sensitive to any
realistically forseeable variations in basic parameters with an assumed
20% increase in project costs and a corresponding 20% decrease in project
benefits, the return was still calculated to be as high as 25Z. Since the
actual project costs did not exceed forecasts (PCR Table 1) it is unlikelY
that interrelated reductions in the economic rate of return will take
place.
Based on the expected potential benefits, GOB has taken steps to
take advantage of reduced shipping costs by including in its Fourth 5-Year

four 10,000 dwt cargo vessels and to construct three 15,000 dwt cargo
vessels. 2/ This means that the percentage of vessels over 10,000 dwt in
the total BFSSC international fleet will increase from 582 to 73%. This
expanded capacity would increase BFSSC's share of total traffic through
Rangoon Port from its present level of 60X of exports and 25Z of imports.
As mentioned in the PCR, the channel dredging operation was not
fully equipped until March 1982 due to various reasons (PCi paras
4.08-4.10). Therefore, the target depth of 15 ft below datum has not yet
been achieved, but it is expected that operations will be undertaken in
the next dredging season (November 1982 to June 1983) to achieve this.
Therefore an economic rate of return for this component cannot be calcu-
lated at this time. In due course, as the channel is deepened and the
shipping industry realizes that adequate depths are available at Rangoon
Port, it is expected that larger ships will use the port; consequently,
economic benefits due to items l(a) and l(b) mentioned above will accrue
in the coming years as the channel depth of 15 ft is achieved and main-
tained.
3.        Cargo Handling
The cargo handling improvements have been quantified as follows:
(a)   the improvements in cargo handling rates (see l(c) above) which
have enabled BPC to handle the increased traffic;
(b)   to calculate an economic rate of return for the economic
benefits resulting from the investmerit in cargo handling equip-
ment and spare parts. 1/
(a)   Cargo Handling Rates
(i)  At appraisal it was assumed that without the project and
its provisions for replacement and repair of cargo handling
machinery and workshop equipment, cargo handling rates for
exports and imports would increase by 10% from the existing
level (from US$4 per ton to US$4.50). With the project a
cost reduction of 5% to 10% (to US$3.75) was expected.
Therefore the difference in cargo handling costs was

and Finance, GOB.

handling equipment category.

estimated to be between 15% to 20Z with and without the
project, representing a saving of about US$0.75 per ton
handled. 2/
(ii)  By 1980/81 cargo handling costs had reduced to US$3.50 which
represented a saving of US$1.00 per ton handled and an
improvement of 22% as compared to the 15% to 20% improvement
hoped for at appraisal.
(iii)  Cargo tons handled per 12-hour gang shift improved by 43%
for exports (from 125 tons per shift at appraisal to 179
tons per shift). Cargo tons handled per 12-hour gang shift
for imports improved by 20% (from 75 tons per shift to 90
tons per shift). Thus the port was able to cope with the
increased traffic throughput (from 1.8 million tons in
1976/77 to 2.5 million tons in 1979/80 and 1980/81) without
need for port expansion or use of lighterage operations.
The improvement is also reflected in the average service
time per ship (PCR para 4.04) which fell fLom 111 hours per
ship in 1976/77 to 106 hours per ship in 1980/81. Therefore
the objective of improved turnaround time per ship has been
achieved.
Cb)   Economic Rate of Return
As stated earlier, a separate economic rate of return for the
cargo handling component has now been calculated both at
appraisal and after project completion. The cargo handling
equipment category comprised 42% of Credit 671-BA's proceeds.
Table 7 summarizes the investment costs and stream of benefits
for the cargo handling equipment category. This leads to an
actual economic rate of return of 53Z as compared to the 50%
rate of return indicated in the appraisal report.
Compared to the appraisal estimates, actual investment costs
were higher due to purchase of more equipment than envisaged at
appraisal. This resulted in a larger stream of benefits which
will further increase as Rangoon's traffic throughput increases.

SECOND PORT PROJECT, Credit 671-BA
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
Consultant's Comments
A consultant mentioned in the PCR prepared by the Borrower was
given the opportunity to express his views on the points raised by the
Borrower. In the following, an edited summary of the consultant's lengthy
comments is presented.
"We have been concerned to learn that in the course of preparing
the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second Burma Ports Project,
the value of the role of the consultant was questioned and his capability
to fulfill the function for the project was criticised. All our
experience in working for developing countries convinces us that efficient
procurement, plays a very significant part in a successful project, and
frequently it is not present. It is difficult to judge the accuracy of
the claim that the Burma Ports Corporation (BPC) had the capability to
carry out the international procurement. However, a number of
difficulties which we encountered in completing the assignment make us
think that the report may have underestimated the administrative task and
experience involved in the issue of tender documents to some 500 suppliers
worldwide, the appraisal of some 200 tenders, the placing of 45 contracts
for capital equipment and 1,000 associated items as well as revising many
of the specifications.
So far as the complaints about performance are concerned, most of
the events date back to 1977 and 1978. Our investigation shows that in
most cases the specifications which we received were inadequate as a basis
for the preparation of international tendering and we were involved in
much work outside our terms of reference. This caused delays and
misunderstandings with the BPC. Experience in similar assignments since
this project, has shown us the desirability for one or two members of our
staff, with experience of the equipment, to visit the client to determine
specifications before work on tender preparation commences. The fact that
the specifications were received were inadequate and the need to query
them was not understood by the BPC. There was indeed one case in which we
were unable to proceed with the procurement because we could not obtain
acceptable specifications without an on-site survey of the requirement.
Taking the specific cases where the consultant is said to have
caused unnecessary delay:



-49-
Annex H
Page 2 of 3
1. Evaluation of Tenders for Fork Lift Trucks
Both the technical evaluation and the commercial evaluation were
sent to BPC together with all bid documents received from suppliers. In
the event BPC opted for the higher-priced alternative, presumably on the
basis of our technical evaluation. We accept that the commercial
evaluation taken on its own was misleading, but both documents were
intended to be, and in the event apparently were taken into account in
reaching a decision.
2. Specification of 10-ton Cranes
The specification we received was silent on two important points,
whether the lifting capacity was 'free on wheels', and what stability
margin was required. To have omitted these from the specification would
bave made a proper comparison of tenders impossible. Our buyer
accordingly prepared the draft tender documents on the basis of the
stricter criteria and sent them to BPC and IDA for approval. He received
confirmation to proceed from IDA but no comment was received from BPC.
We, accordingly, issued the tender as drafted. A copy of our letter
explaining the background to this situation was written to BPC.
3. Fuel Injection Pump Testing Machine
The Buyer handling this item did not appreciate that BPC, unlike many of
our clients, had no funds available to effect prompt payment. In
accordance with out standard procedure, he pressed the supplier for
maximum discounts and was offered 10% for prompt payment and the lower
price was passed to BPC. In the circumstances of an IDA credit, payment
within 14 days was not, of course, possible and the manufacturer insisted
on receiving the full price which involved an uplift of a small amount.
Once BPC had declined to accept the additional sum called for, we were
ill-advised to have pressed BPC for payment, bearing in mind that we
should not have passed on to BPC the lower quotation in the first place.
In the event we settled with the supplier and no delay in delivery was
caused by this episode and BPC received the right equipment at the lower
price.
A general complaint about delays in the opening of certain Letters
of Credit and in shipping is also made. The complaint about delays in
certain Letters of Credit is justified. The difficulty arose because our
country's exchange control regulations at that time prohibited us from
opening Letters of Credit in favor of foreign suppliers in respect of
orders being shipped to non-residents without ourselves having received
foreign exchange or being the beneficiaries of a back-to-back credit. To
overcome this difficulty we sought and obtained a conditional guarantee
from IDA following Case VI procedure, only to find that this was



-50-
Annex H
Page 3 of 3
unacceptable to our Central Bank who required an irrevocable credit in
our favor. We reverted to IDA with a request for this under Case V
procedure but were told that this procedure was not available in this
instance and that Case VI should be accepted. In the face of an apparent
impasse the Central Bank was persuaded to accept Case VI procedure and
the Letters of Credit were issued. This episode caused a delay of some
four r-'nths which should never have arisen. The facts were fully
explained aud our apologies expressed to BPC in our -itter of November 30,
1978.
Shipping delays were outside our direct control as we were
required to place orders on c.i.f. terms in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines. We were, however, aware of delays and instituted vigorous
progress action, but in spite of this we believe lack of space on vessels
and congestion in Rangoon gave rise to considerable delays.
In spite of the difficulties, most of which arose because of
inadequate integration of the function we were performing with the end
user in the BPC, we believe that we made a significant contribution to
the project. With hindsight, arrangements should have been made for
closer consultation between our engineering staff and BPC. As it was, the
attempt to prepare and/or edit specifications to ensure conformity with
IBRD guidelines without a proper brief and at a distance of 7,000 miles
was fraught with difficulty and led to unnecessary misunderstanding."
