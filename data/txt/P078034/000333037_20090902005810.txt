 Introduction

  1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Regional Vice President for a
 second-order restructuring o f the Global Coral Reef Targeted Research and Capacity
 Building for Management Project, TFO53909, PO 780% and any accompanying
 amendments to the project's legal documents, if required. The proposed changes in this
 restructuring include a simplification and reordering o f the K e y Performance Indicators
 as described in the P A D and the Project Implementation Manual. There i s no change in
 the Global Environmental Objective or in the Project Development Objective.

 Background and Reasons for Restructuring

 2.      The GEF Grant o f US$11.O million was approved by the Board o f Executive
 Directors o n September 23,2004 and became effective o n April 11,2005. The original
 Global Environment Objective i s to fill critical gaps in our global understanding o f what
determines coral reef ecosystem vulnerability and resilience to a range o f key stressors -
from localized human stress to climate change - and to inform policies and management
interventions o n behalf o f coral reefs and the communities that depend o n them. The
Project Development Objective i s to align, for the first time, the expertise and resources
of the global coral r e e f community around key research questions related to the resilience
and vulnerability o f coral r e e f ecosystems, to integrate the results, and to disseminate
them in formats readily accessible to managers and decision-makers. The P A D states
that a related objective i s to build much-needed capacity for science-based management
of coral reefs in developing countries, where the majority o f reefs are found.

3.       Original Project Description. The Targeted Research project was designed as
the first phase of a longer term Global Partnership Program (GPP) to be implemented in 3
five year phases. This initial phase will support the establishment o f an applied research
framework and build capacity for science-based management o f coral reefs in areas with
significant coral r e e f resources and Bank/GEF investments. These include sites in
Mesoamerica, East Africa, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific/Australasia. While the
impacts of the project are expected to be realized well beyond the five year time frame o f
the initial phase, expected outcomes include a coordinated process to fill critical
knowledge gaps, improved capacity for science-based management o f coral reef
ecosystems and development and uptake o f new knowledge products to enhance decision
making. The project has four components: Component 1: Addressing Knowledge and
Technology Gaps; Component 2: Promoting Scientific Learning and Capacity Building;
Component 3 : Linking Scientific Knowledge to Management and Policy; and Component
4: Project Administration.

4.      Progress Made. The project had made good progress towards achieving its
development and global environment objectives and in fact has met several o f its
indicators. In terms o f i t s GEO indicators, six international working groups comprised o f
developed and developing country scientists have been formed around key questions and
research undertaken in collaboration with 4 research institutions in the Philippines,
Tanzania, Mexico and Australia, which are being established as regional Centers o f


                                             2
     Excellence (COEs) for science-based management o f coral reefs. The COEs have
     become a focal point for coral r e e f research under the Project. A s a result, over 200
    papers which received funding from the project have been published in peer reviewed
    journals.`
    5.      A Mid-Term Review found the overall quality o f research to be excellent.
    Research findings are making their way into some policy reforms as well, including
    protection o f key herbivore species on coral reefs and greater protection o f mangroves as
    essential components o f healthy coral r e e f ecosystems. Local government and
    communities are incorporating guidance into their coastal management plans on marine
    protected areas, restoration o f damaged reefs, and the need to protect coastal water
    quality from municipal waste and coastal development, as well as fish cage culture
    effluents. Predictions about the loss o f key coral r e e f ecosystem services with increasing
    C 0 2 concentrations and associated tipping points for these mega-diverse systems have
    been incorporated into major policy briefs and the upcoming WDR 2010 on Climate
    Change.

    6. With regards to the PDO and the dissemination o f results into formats easily
accessible to local managers, the project i s developing a suite o f knowledge products,
manuals and guidelines that will form a toolkit for coastal managers. These knowledge
products have been widely circulated to managers, NGOs and to Bank projects dealing
with coral reefs. GEF International Waters Experience Notes have also been prepared to
help guide the design o f f i t u r e GEF projects dealing with coral reefs and drivers o f
ecosystem change.

    7.     The second part o f the PDO--Capacity building in countries where coral reefs are
    found-- has been a major thrust o f this initial phase. This has been achieved through
    collaboration within and between international working groups and the COEs in world
    class research on coral reef sustainability. Capacity building includes delivery o f
    numerous training workshops and the demonstration o f state o f the art field techniques
    drawing o n participants throughout the regions in which the COEs serve as regional
    hubs for information exchange. And, finally, capacity building has targeted young,
    developing country scientists through mentoring and institutional twinning
    arrangements, scholarship support for post-graduate degrees including MS, PhD and
    postdoctoral work, and south-south networks. An example o f the latter i s the Future
    Leaders Forum, a network to prepare the best and the brightest young coral reef
    researchers to become tomorrow's leader in the field o f coral reef management.

8.       In terms o f implementation and management, the project has consistently
performed well and has been cited as good practice for financial management by the
Bank's FM specialist. The GEF grant TF053909 has disbursed 99.171% o f i t s allocation
o f U S $ l 1.OM. We expect that the project will be fully disbursed by the closing date o f
December 3 1,2009.

 Proposed Changes and Justification

10.     Through this project paper, we are seeking clearance for a second-order
restructuring that would formalize the reformulation o f the KPIs to make them more
robust and track more closely with the GEO and the PDOs, as suggested in the Mid-Term
Review and as agreed with the University o f Queensland in a signed amendment to the
Project Implementation Manual (attached). Neither the GEO nor the PDO has changed.

 11.    The outcome indicators in the P A D were developed within a L o g Frame which
was the framework during the time that the project was designed in 2004-2005.
Transitioning into a Results Agreement required refinement o f the performance
indicators. The indicators were deemed not sufficiently robust and too numerous to
monitor so the original indicators were consolidated into proposed indicators found in
Annex 1. In consultation with the University o f Queensland, we agreed on the revised
indicators which have been reflected in the ISR since February 2007. The project's
progress has been tracked using these indicators since then. During the Mid-Term
Review in November 2008, it was agreed to formalize the change. The performance
indicators are not part o f the Grant Agreement but o f the Project Implementation Manual
(PIM). Upon receipt o f the request from the University o f Queensland and after
consultation with the Legal Department, an adjustment to the PIM was prepared and
signed by the Bank and the University.

 12.   The change in the indicators i s a simplification and reordering so that each
indicator i s linked to the GEO or PDO.

Analysis

 13.    These changes will not have a major effect on the original economic, financial,
technical, institutional or social aspects o f the project as appraised. The proposed change
will not raise the environmental category or the project or trigger new safeguard policies
nor involve exceptions to Bank policies.

14.    The restructuring will not affect the Project's Development or Global
Environment objectives. The monitoring indicators will be simplified. These are
presented in a table (attached in Annex 1) for comparison with the original KPIs and
Outcome/Impact Indicators.


                                             4
Expected Outcomes

15.      The expected outcomes from the Project have not changed and the K e y
Performance Indicators are similar in substance to the original K P I s in the PAD and the
Project Implementation Manual. The K P I s have been reformulated and realigned with
either the GEO (as more global level indicators) or with the PDOs (as intermediate
outcome indicators) for ease o f monitoring in the ISR results agreement framework.

Benefits and Risks

16.    The potential benefits o f the project are not affected by the reformulated KPIs, nor
are any of the risks increased. The main project risk, i.e., that research findings do not
lead to demonstrable improvements in management o f policies affecting coral reefs,
remains unchanged.
