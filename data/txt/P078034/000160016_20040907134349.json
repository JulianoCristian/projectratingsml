A related\n            objective is to build much-needed capacity for science-based\n            management of coral reefs in developing countries, where the\n            majority of reefs are found. These objectives will be\n            achieved through targeted investigations involving networks\n            of scientists, in consultation with managers, and the\n            dissemination of knowledge within and across regions to\n            decision makers. There are three project components, which\n            are organized around the following six major themes:  1.\n            Bleaching and Local Ecological Response: The physiological\n            mechanisms and ecological consequences of large area (or\n            massive) coral reef bleaching, particularly in response to\n            sea surface temperature anomalies; to nutrient and sediment\n            influxes; and the potential consequences of changes in\n            frequency of coral taxa in response to such stressors on\n            coral reef integrity and function; 2. Disease: The nature,\n            severity and spread of coral reef diseases, some of which\n            may be responsible for major shifts in the structure,\n            function, health and sustainability of coral reefs; 3.\n            Connectivity: The importance of physical and biological\n            connections (or \"connectivity\") between coral\n            reefs, whether within or between different regions of\n            International Waters. This also has direct bearing on the\n            environmental conditions and key design factors needed to\n            establish and sustain effective Marine Protected Areas\n            (MPAs); 4. Restoration and Remediation: The tools,\n            technologies and efficacy of restoring coral reefs that have\n            been severely degraded or destroyed, and the key organisms\n            and environmental conditions to consider when rehabilitating\n            a given coral reef environment, and the circumstances under\n            which such restoration may be cost-effective; 5. Remote\n            Sensing: The application of remote sensing to refine\n            information and enhance the rate and scale at which\n            knowledge can be generated and applied. This includes the\n            need to modify remote sensing applications and related\n            technologies so that they can be practically deployed and\n            sustained within developing countries;  A sixth theme\n            focuses on the development of Decision Support Tools to help\n            managers and policymakers understand the likely\n            pressure/response behavior of coral reef ecosystems to a\n            range of local and climate change related stressors, and the\n            types of interventions that could mitigate these effects."}, "docdt": "2004-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
