equivalent to $1,250,000 to  be  withdrawn  from the Grant Account

2.
Except as the  Administrator  shall otherwise agree, payments
out  of  the  Revolving  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively for
eligible expenditures in  accordance  with  the provisions of this
Schedule.
3.
After the Administrator has received evidence satisfactory to
it that the Revolving Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and  subsequent withdrawals to replenish
the Revolving Account may be made as follows:
 
(a)
On the basis of a  request  or requests by the Recipient
for a deposit or deposits which  add up to the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation, the  Administrator  shall, on behalf of
the Recipient, withdraw from the  Grant Account and deposit in the
Revolving Account such amount  or  amounts  as the Recipient shall
have requested.
(b)
The  Recipient  shall   furnish   to  the  Administrator
requests  for  replenishment  of  the  Revolving  Account  at such
intervals as the Administrator shall specify. On the basis of such
requests, the  Bank  shall  withdraw  from  the  Grant Account and
deposit into  the  Revolving  Account  such  amounts  as  shall be
required to  replenish  the  Revolving  Account  with  amounts not
exceeding the amount of payments made out of the Revolving Account
for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by
the Administrator  from  the  Grant  Account  under the respective
eligible Categories, and in  the respective equivalent amounts, as
shall have been justified  by  the evidence supporting the request
for  such  deposit  furnished  pursuant  to  paragraph
4
of this
Schedule.

For each payment made by  the  Recipient out of the Revolving
Account for which the Recipient requests replenishment pursuant to
paragraph

(b)
of this Schedule, the Recipient shall fur- nish to
the Administrator, prior to or  at  the time of such request, such
documents and other evidence as the Administrator shall reasonably
request,  showing  that  such   payment   was  made  for  eligible
expenditures.
5.   (a)
Notwithstanding the provisions  of  paragraph
3
of this
Schedule, no further deposit  into  the Revolving Account shall be
made by the Administrator when  either of the following situations
first arises:
(i)
the Administrator  shall  have  determined  that     all
further withdrawals  should  be  made  by  the Recipient
directly from the Grant  Account  in accordance with the
provisions of Article  V  of  the General Conditions and
paragraph
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
 
(ii) the total unwithdrawn amount  of  the Grant allocated to

outstanding special  commitment  entered    into  by the
Administrator pursuant to  Section
5.02
of the General
Conditions with respect to  the  Project, shall be equal
to the equivalent of twice  the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Grant  Account of the
remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Grant  allocated  to  the
eligible  Categories   shall   follow   such   procedures  as  the
Administrator shall  specify  by  notice  to  the  Recipient. Such
further withdrawals shall be  made  only  after  and to the extent
that the Administrator  shall  have  been  satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit  in  the  Revolving Account as of the
date of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making payments for
eligible expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Administrator shall  have  determined at any time
that any payment out of  the  Revolving  Account: (i) was made for
any  expenditure  or  in  any  amount  not  eligible  pursuant  to
paragraph
2
of this  Schedule,  or
(ii)
was not justified by the
evidence furnished pursuant to  paragraph
4
of this Schedule, the
Recipient shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the Administrator,
deposit into the Revolving Account
(or, if the Administrator shall
so request, refund to  the  Administrator)
an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or  the  portion thereof not so eligible or
justified.
No  further  deposit  by  the  Administrator  into the
Revolving Account shall be made  until the Recipient has made such
deposit or refund.
 
(b)
If the Administrator shall  have  determined at any time
that  any amount outstanding in  the Revolving Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures,  the
Recipient shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the Administrator,
refund to the Administrator  such outstanding amount for crediting
to the Grant Account.
