Overall the project outcome is rated\n            moderately satisfactory. The project substantially achieved\n            all of its physical objectives, but in several of the\n            project components there were significant problems. The PPAR\n            mission was able to ascertain that the institutional\n            capacity developed initially in the Reconstruction Unit (RU)\n            and implementing agencies is alive and well, albeit sitting\n            in new positions in the public and NGO sectors. Given the\n            amount of time that has elapsed since the project closed,\n            its sustainability can be rated on observed rather than\n            predicted performance. Some of the infrastructure developed\n            under the project has problems: the housing is made with\n            poor-quality materials, and a number of communities have\n            been built in areas safer from earthquakes but vulnerable to\n            run-off and landslides. The Bank responded quickly after the\n            1986 earthquake. The appraisal mission was staffed by some\n            of the Bank's foremost disaster experts. Bank staff\n            helped to design a project that addressed the problems\n            caused by the earthquake in a comprehensive way. The\n            government reports that the Bank also supported the work of\n            the RU quite effectively. Although there were problems with\n            reporting and accounts, the deconstruction Program is widely\n            considered to be a major government achievement.\n            Project-built infrastructure that remained in public hands\n            has been well maintained, and, notwithstanding all the\n            difficulties described in this report, government commitment\n            to cost recovery in the housing component is noteworthy."}, "docdt": "2004-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
