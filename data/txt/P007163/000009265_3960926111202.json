The project also hopes to (iii) rehabilitate\n            the microenterprise sector; and (iv) strengthen the\n            Government's capacity to plan and manage the\n            reconstruction efforts and enhance its preparedness to deal\n            with national emergencies.  To this end, the project\n            involves several components which are aimed at helping San\n            Salvador to recover from this natural disaster.  They\n            include:  (a) housing lines of credit; (b) schools and\n            public buildings; (c) roads and public services; and (d)\n            micro-enterprise credits.  The project further includes (e)\n            training; as well as (f) studies and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1987-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
