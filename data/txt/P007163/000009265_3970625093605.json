Some lessons learned included: more attention\n            should be placed on the institutional appraisal of the\n            implementing agency, both with regard to awareness of\n            Bank's procurement procedures and of its capacity to\n            administer and manage the contracting of goods and services.\n            Prior to initiating bidding procedures, the implementing\n            agency should undertake an intensive review of completed\n            designs, plans, cost estimates, and bidding documents. Prior\n            to awarding civil works contracts, the necessary right of\n            way should be legally acquired in order to avoid delays in\n            the execution of works and corresponding increases in\n            project costs and possible claims. Beneficiaries of housing\n            credits also benefit from technical assistance in areas such\n            as energy saving technology, maintenance schedules, etc.\n            There are advantages in working with financial\n            intermediaries from the nongovernmental sector. During\n            procurement, an implementing agency should take into account\n            the scope of work, the project's complexity and the\n            capacity of local contractors in estimating the construction\n            period for project execution. In order to avoid long delays\n            in processing payments to contractors, disbursements should\n            be made from the project's special account directly to\n            the contractor."}, "docdt": "1996-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
