Restructuring Project for Nepal were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            delays can be largely due to unanticipated political\n            developments and the perceived inability of the transitional\n            government to take necessary decisions to implement the\n            agreed reforms. Moreover, the capacity of weak institutions\n            to implement difficult reforms must be taken into account.\n            The project design should take into account the local rules\n            and practices that may cause significant delays if they are\n            contradictory to those of the Bank, which the Borrower may\n            not flag before project launch. It should have been evident\n            that Government of Nepal (GoN) was unlikely to take timely\n            procurement action on a critical component such as the\n            extension of the management contract of the external team on\n            a sole source basis, even with all justifications, as it\n            violated its own procurement rules of competitive bidding\n            process. The need for a cabinet approval for this to happen,\n            given the precarious nature of the multi-party coalition\n            government, made this a politically unfeasible option. Given\n            the importance of continuing the same management consulting\n            services to protect the past gains, the contract period\n            should have been made longer at the outset."}, "docdt": "2010-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
