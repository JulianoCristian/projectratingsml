                                              Introduction

 When the Nepal Financial Sector RestructuringProject (FSRP) was presented to the boardo f Directors
 o f the World Bank on March 9,2004, it was agreed that the project team update semi-annually the
 Performance Indicators established as benchmarks for measuringthe performance o f the two
 Management Teams which have beenplaced inthese two institutions. The primary function o f these
 Management Teams i s to restructure these banks and prepare them for privatization. This i s the first o f
 such reports to be furnishedto the Boardevery six months. The indicators are computed usingdata for
 the six-month periodendingmid-July2004.

 ChoiceofPerformanceIndicators

 The Bank and His Majesty Government o fNepal (HMGN) discussed at lengthwith the two
 management teams inNepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya BanijyaBank (RBB) the choice o f
 indicators to be usedfor monitoring and measuring the performance o f the two banks. Itwas decided,
 after extensive debate and brain-storming, to the following indicatorsbased on the following eight
 headings:

      1. Debtrecovery
      2. Business andrevenue growth indicators
      3. Operating efficiency
      4. Profitability
      5. StaffEfficiency
      6. Capital Fund
      7. Computerization o f Branches
      8. Disclosure Requirement

The indicators used under eachheadingand their corresponding numbers are given inthe respective
Tables for each bank. The following paragraphs summarize the keyresults achieved and present the
project's assessment o f the performance o f the management ineach o f the two state-controlledbanks.




A.       NepalBankLimited(NBL)

Debt recovery efforts havebeennoteworthy duringthe periodunder review. Against a NPArecovery
target (incash) o f Rs. 2,125 million, NBLrealized Rs. 1,787 million- which represents 84 percent o f
the target. Recovery from a few large defaulters didnot materialize as envisaged due to problems
encounteredinthe judicial system-with court stay orders favoring the borrowers, and delaying the
judicial process.

However, the NPA level as a percentage o f the loan portfolio, declined to a better than expected 53.7
percent against a target o f 57.2 percent. A major reason for this was an increase inthe total loan
portfolio. It may, however, be noted HMGNhas not hllyhonored NBLclaims under Government
Guarantees nor met their promises to pay arrears inGovemment companies. The World Bank team i s
working with the Government on this issue.

Businessandrevenuegrowthindicatorshave generally beenachieved. The "good loan" portfolio
increased by over Rsl.O billion-with new loans safely collateralized by National Saving Bonds
(government) and commercial bank shares. A large inward flow o fremittances has also contributed to
maintaining o f the deposits and to an increase incommission income. Interest earnings have also

 substantially improvedwith more performing loans inthe overall portfolio apart from collection o f
 interest on NPAs

 Most o f the operating efficiencyindicatorshave beenmet while some have been exceeded. Net
 interest spreads and margins have improvedas deposit rates have beenbrought inline withprevailing
market realities. Net Operating income has been strengthened withbetter interest collections on loans,
 lower interest payments on deposits, and the consolidation o f assets. Overhead expenses, including
 staffcosts, have beenreduced significantly, with the implementation o f the VRS, contributing to a more
efficient operation.

Profitabilitytargets havebeenexceeded. Netprofits substantiallyincreased owingto better operating
income and reduced expenses. There has been a major write-back o f provisions that were no longer
required after the collection o f fully provided baddebts. Extraordinary income, mainly coming from
the sale o f investments (particularly those in Standard CharteredBank shares ) has further boosted
profitability - albeit on a one offbasis. The bank's Return on Assets i s now inline with that achieved
byprivatelyoperated banks inNepal.

Staffefficiency levels have improvedover FY2003 but fall short o fthe target set for FY2004. The
staffrationalization process comprised implementation o f the VRS intwo phaseswithin FY 2004.
Although the first phase o fthe VRS was very successful, the second phase was less so. As the
anticipated overall staffreductiondidnot materialize within FY 2004, staff efficiency ratios interms o f
Income were not achieved. However, staffcosts have been substantially reduced to meet the other cost
ratios.

The NetWorth ofthe bank,although still negative, improvedwith the target exceeded as a result of
increasingly profitable operations. The General loan loss provisions increased with the increase innew
PASS loans andrestructur;ed loans. The Specific loanloss provision, however, is less than projected-
reflecting the reduction inthe NPA level and write-back o f loan loss provision following cash
collection o f fully-provided loans and advances

Computerizationhasbeensomewhat slower than anticipated due to delays inconducting a trial runo f
new software inthe first branch. Data validation and (lack of) stafftraining have been major
impediments to the rolling out o f the computerizationprogram. These issues are now being addressed
and the bank is expected to have its 44 mainbranches computerizedby the second quarter, 2005.

Disclosurerequirementshavebeenmet with audit o ffinancials beingcompletedwithin the scheduled
the timeframe -both for audited (within5 months) and provisional (within 1month) financials.

 DebtRecovery was substantial duringthe periodunderreview-at aroundRs 3.O billion. Nonetheless,
 while RBB exceeded its target inrecovering cash from delinquent borrowers (principal and interest),
 the projectedreduction inNPA was not achieved as some o f the good portfolio deterioratedinto
 substandard category. Judicial intervention by way o f interimstay orders favoring large delinquent
 borrowers, a deteriorating law and order situation inthe country resultingina reducednet worth o f
 borrowers, and a lack o f efficient and skilled manpower have been serious impediments to debt
recovery. The NPA level as a percent o f the total loanportfolio stood at 56 percent against a target o f
 52 percent (but considerablybetter than the 60 percent figure 12months earlier).

 The results for businessand revenue growthtargets are mixed. The lending portfolio (good assets)
was short o f the target level due to a scaling back o fnew lending ina market that has a lower demand
 for credit -and where good lending opportunities are few. However, Net Interest Income exceeded the
target, due to a reductioninthe cost o f funds (emanating from a significant loweringo f interest rates on
 deposits). Whereas the deposit mix (non-interest bearing deposits as a share of total deposits) has
improvedcompared to the previous year, the transfer o f the staffretirement fund into savings deposits
meant that the bank was unable to reachthe target set for non-interest bearing deposits.

Results pertaining to OperatingEfficiencyindicatorshave been largely on target. The Net Spread
and Interest Margin are both well above targets -and significantly higher than the very low levels that
they hadbeen 12months earlier (negative inthe case o fnet interest margin). Net Operating Income to
Total Assets, however, was slightly below target due to lower than expected income from fees and
commissions (non-interest income). Nevertheless, effective budgetary control over costs have helped
the bank exceed its targeted cost to income ratio. All o f these operating efficiency indicators represent
a substantial improvement over the situation prevailing in the proceeding year.

Profitabilitytargetshavebeenachieved, signifyinga complete turnaround fiom the massive losses
(negative Rs.4.8 billion) incurred inthe previous year. Indeed, this was the first time that the bank had
made a profit over the past eight years. Major factors that contributed to a goodbottomline included a
reduction inthe cost o f funds, strong budgetary control inmanaging costs, and reasonably good debt
recovery. As a result, the Return on Asset i s now inline with the industryaverage.

The target set for staff rationalization didnot materialize due to a delay inthe implementation o fthe
second phase o f the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS 11). Moreover, investigations into the
credentials o fretiring staff (relating to fake educational certificates) further delayed the retirement
process -as these cases hadbeenreferred to the Corruption Authority for investigation andno action
could be taken untilthey had completed their review. Although staffefficiency levels have
significantly improved compared to previous years, they fell short o f target.

Whilst the NetWorth of the Bankcontinues to be highlynegative, there has been a significant
improvement from the previous year -andthe target was exceeded.

The Computerizationprocess has been adversely impacted by un-anticipated delays inthe
procurement process. The problemi s beingaddressed and it i s expected that more branches will be
computerized by the time the second semi-annualreport i s submitted to the Board.

Disclosurerequirementshave beenpartiallymet. The audit o fthe annual financial statements was
delayed due to the late appointment (by the Office o f the Auditor General) o f statutory auditors.
However, un-audited(provisional) financials were publishedon schedule.
