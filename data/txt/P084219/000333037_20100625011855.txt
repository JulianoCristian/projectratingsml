F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objective of the project is to support the on-going efforts to develop a healthier
financial sector in Nepal which intermediates funds more efficiently and effectively to the
benefit of all segments of society and in a manner which supports private sector
development, increased investment, and faster growth.Specifically, the project
development objectives are:

  1. To improve corporate governance through provision of management support to the
two large commercial banks.




                                                ii
  The development objective of this component is to substantially improve their
operating capacity and commercial viability; to move them as swiftly as possible into the
private sector; and thereafter, develop the government's oversight and supervisory
capacity over them and other banking institutions.

  2. To improve market structure by reducing the state-owned segment of the banking
system.

  3. To sustain and deepen the banking reforms. This entails further strengthening of the
central bank of Nepal (Nepal Rastra Bank) through an on going program of bank
supervision strengthening; accounting and auditing development; human resource re-
engineering; information technology upgradation; and other support. The objective is to
also further enhance the professional status of the central bank and its capacity to oversee
the development of a prudently operated financial sector in line with its own medium
term vision as enunciated in the FSSS.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background

Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries, with an annual per capita income of about
US$470 with many indicators showing a very poor quality of life. Progress in the fight
against poverty has been hampered by a number of factors, including a succession of
unstable Governments. The challenge intensified during the decade long conflict that
formally ended in November 2006. Although the country voted in a Constituent
Assembly, elected a Prime Minister and formed a coalition government in 2008, the
country faced a transition once again in May 2009, when the Prime Minister resigned and
a new government had to be formed. Together with the global economic slowdown that
has adversely impacted Nepal's trade-dependent economy, these domestic events led to a
sharp downturn in economic activity. Related to this was potential fiscal stress, as public
spending had been obliged to accommodate increased security demands.

At the time this Project was approved, Nepal had 17 commercial banks ­ including the
two large banks Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) in which
the government has a dominant shareholding; 6 Joint Venture Banks, which are mixed
Nepali/foreign owned (foreign ownership is constrained to 67 percent); and 9 local (100
percent Nepali) banks. It also had 2 large development banks ­ the Agricultural
Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) and the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation
(NIDC) which also undertook some commercial banking activities. The system also
operated with 54 finance companies, 13 insurance companies, numerous micro-finance
institutions, 7 Grameen Replicator Banks, 35 financial cooperatives, 25 financial Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs), and a stock exchange. The two largest commercial
banks ­ RBB and NBL ­ accounted for around 50 percent of total banking system assets,
and were in a very precarious financial position. Political intervention, weak



                                            13
management, poor financial information systems, and a deeply entrenched culture of non-
repayment of loans resulted in a rapid deterioration of their financial health.

The historical lack of autonomy of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) ­ the Central Bank--
hindered its ability to supervise and regulate the banking system. Political influence and
intervention in RBB and NBL ­ and their dominance in the banking system ­ also placed
these banks outside the influence and control of the Central Bank.

Nepal historically suffered from a proliferation of both laws and regulations that are
institutionally rather than functionally focused. This created a fragmented legal
environment. Moreover, a weak accounting and auditing tradition meant that the
timeliness and reliability of financial data from banks was poor. Corporate accounting
was also weak, making lending decisions difficult for the banks. The financial sector
environment needed to be strengthened in several other important areas. Credit
information systems needed to be made more reliable and effective; the Nepal Stock
Exchange required urgent reform; and access to finance for many millions of rural
Nepalis needed to be addressed.

Over the past few years preceding the approval of this Project, the Government had
undertaken general reform measures in the financial sector. These included interest rate
deregulation, the phase out of Statutory Liquidity Requirements (SLR), reduction in Cash
Reserve Requirement (CRR), introduction of modern banking regulations, and foreign
exchange liberalization. However, a lot remained to be done, particularly with respect to
institutional reform. To help establish a medium term framework, the Government
formulated a Financial Sector Strategy Statement (FSSS) that consolidated its thinking
and developed a comprehensive and interlinked reform program. This FSSS had been
adopted as official Government policy and was publicly released and published in the
Nepali and English press at the end of 2000. The main elements of the FSSS included:

   ·   Reducing the role of the Government in the financial sector as a direct owner of
       financial institutions while strengthening its role as a supervisor and regulator;
   ·   Requiring strong corporate governance by ensuring that banks (in particular the
       two largest commercial banks) are owned and managed by "fit and proper"
       private investors;
   ·   Strengthening the role of Nepal Rastra Bank by drafting a new Central Bank Act
       to provide autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy, banking system
       regulation and supervision, and the licensing of banks and nonbanks;
   ·   Improving existing banking and financial legislation and judicial processes for
       enforcing financial contracts;
   ·   Improving auditing and accountancy standards within the banking sector; and
   ·   Promoting financial discipline through adequate disclosure and competition.

Since the Government of Nepal demonstrated a seriousness and commitment to banking
reform and had not wavered in moving ahead with the difficult agenda, it provided IDA
the comfort, that the Government was willing to transparently and decisively address the
issues at hand, to go ahead with the operation.


                                           14
Rationale for Bank assistance

The rationale for Bank engagement stemmed from its comparative advantage gained
from its experience in similar operations in South Asia. The objective of this operation
was to support the efforts of Government of Nepal (GON) to improve the financial
sector. This represented the second phase of a larger financial sector reform effort ­
which began with the FSTA. Assuming on-going commitment to reform, this project
would have led ultimately to a third phase involving bank privatization. Phase I involved
bringing in three management consultant teams to: restructure and re-engineer the
Central Bank; and reform the two large commercial banks (Rastriya Banijya Bank and
Nepal Bank Limited). This second phase was to assist in (i) right-sizing the two
commercial banks through the implementation of Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS)
to reduce operating costs and make them viable for privatization; (ii) bringing in a Sales
Advisor to assist in the privatization; (iii) providing further assistance to a second phase
of Central Bank re-engineering; and (iv) supporting the continuation of professional
management team support up until the point of bank privatization. Phase III (not
included in this project) would involve support for financial re-engineering of the banks
(re-capitalization) at the point of sale after satisfactory changes in governance
arrangements and cost restructuring had taken place.

The operation supported the then Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY 2004-07 outcomes
in the financial sector as well as governance objectives. Improvement in the banking
sector was and remains one of the key growth-enhancing structural reforms that Nepal
must undertake in order to stimulate a more pro-poor and inclusive growth process. The
CAS recognized that a strong financial system is critical for private sector development.
On-going progress with respect to banking reform was a key trigger for Nepal to remain
in a base case lending scenario.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The main objective of the project was to support the on-going efforts to develop a
healthier financial sector in Nepal which intermediates funds more efficiently and
effectively to the benefit of all segments of society and in a manner which supports
private sector development, increased investment, and faster growth. Specifically, the
project development objectives were: 1. To improve corporate governance through
provision of management support to the two large commercial banks. The development
objective of this component was to substantially improve their operating capacity and
commercial viability; to move them as swiftly as possible into the private sector; and
thereafter, develop the government's oversight and supervisory capacity over them and
other banking institutions. 2. To improve market structure by reducing the state-owned
segment of the banking system. 3. To sustain and deepen the banking reforms. This
entailed further strengthening of the Central Bank of Nepal (Nepal Rastra Bank) through
an ongoing program of bank supervision strengthening; accounting and auditing
development; human resource re-engineering; information technology upgradation; and
other support. The objective was to also further enhance the professional status of the



                                            15
Central Bank and its capacity to oversee the development of a prudently operated
financial sector in line with its own medium term vision as enunciated in the FSSS.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The project aimed to establish better regulatory and intermediation functions within the
banking system so that funds can flow to their most productive economic use ­ thereby
benefiting the entire economy in terms of more rational investment decisions, more
sustained employment opportunities, increased production and exports ­ and ultimately
enhanced growth. In order to achieve this goal, institution wise, the most direct
beneficiaries of the project funds were the Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Bank Limited and
Rastriya Banijya Bank; and the secondary level of beneficiaries were the whole financial
sector.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had four main components:

Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) (US$56.5 million). The largest component was
designed to support the VRS in RBB and NBL in an effort to reduce their costs and
ultimately assist in making them more saleable/privatizable institutions.

Hiring of Sales Advisors (US$3.0 million). The Sales (Privatization) Advisors would
undertake proper due diligence, prepare a prospectus for the banks, and then undertake a
road show to bring them to the point of sale to "fit and proper" private sector buyers as
rapidly as possible. This component was aimed to be financed using the IDA Grant
component.

2003, the FSRP complemented the overall sectoral reform agenda to ensure that NRB's
capacity was enhanced to oversee a prudently operated banking system. Whereas the
Phase I reforms in banking supervision focused on developing an appropriate off-site
reporting system and a minimalist amount of on-site bank supervisory assistance, the
Phase II reforms were aimed to assist in augmenting the on-site supervisory capacities to
oversee the commercial banks.

Management Team Support (US$ 6.0 million). As it was felt that the pre-privatization
restructuring process may take longer than three years, which was the maximum tenure of
the then existing Management Teams, it was necessary to include funding for a
contingent liability to cover the costs of continuing management team support up until
the point of privatization.

1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

A significant change was the partial cancellation of undisbursed funds carried out on May
31, 2008, when some of the activities envisioned under FSRP had been reallocated to a
restructured Financial Sector TA Project (FSTAP3). These included: strengthening
Central Bank's supervision; hiring of Bank Restructuring Advisor for end game
resolution of NBL and RBB; strengthening the capacity of the Debt Recovery Tribunal;
and establishing the Secured Transaction Registry. Although this project was expected to
be closed immediately after the reallocation of some of its activities to FSTAP in August
2008, it could not be closed because of some pending payments that had to be made for
expenditures incurred earlier. Therefore, the cancellation of the remaining amount of the
Credit could only be effected in March 2009, after all payments under the project were
completed. The project was then left to close according to the original Closing Date.

  The FSTAP has been effective since July 1, 2003, and restructured on August 3, 2008, with a revised
Closing date of December 31, 2011. The Project focuses on : (a) helping to restructure and re-engineer the
Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank - NRB), so that it can effectively perform its key central banking
functions; (b) commencing commercial banking reform in the two large ailing commercial banks that
dominate the sector (Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL)) -- by introducing
stronger bank management that protects the financial integrity of the two banks and would take on a
conservator role to prepare the banks for the next steps of restructuring; and (c) supporting a better
environment for financial sector reform in areas such as enhanced credit information, better financial news
reporting, and better training for staff in financial institutions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project development objectives were set directly in response to the needs of the
country and agreed through cross-consultation with various stakeholders, including other
donors such as IMF and DfID. However, the definition of PDOs and results indicators
chosen at entry level were very complex and ambitious given the track record of political
instability and pace of reforms in the financial sector.

The FSRP incorporated lessons learned from the previous reform initiatives in Nepal and
other South Asian countries. The Government had taken some impressive actions to
improve banking supervision and governance arrangements within the state-owned
banks, including the placing of external management teams within these banks.
Moreover, the Government's strategy statement provided an overarching framework for
future reforms. However, some key project risks relating to the government's ability to
follow-through on difficult reforms affecting powerful vested interests during a period of
conflict and tremendous political change were not properly identified. Hence, an
appropriate strategy to address these potential risks was not considered. Since the key
project risks could not be properly identified, the relevant mitigation measures could not
be put in place. The validity of a strong commitment of GON as well as their willingness
to assume risks in the face of political instability were not considered.

A series of project alternative approaches was considered to deal with Nepal's financial
sector problems. For example, the possibility of processing the project as an adjustment
operation was considered. However, it was determined that an investment operation
would achieve the objectives of the project better as disbursement would be tied strictly
to full implementation of the reform measures. In addition, there was an important need
for on-going technical assistance to ensure smooth implementation of the project ­ such
as hiring the sales advisors and the NRB re-engineering technical support ­ which was
better suited to an investment operation.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation of the FSRP was affected by various macro factors, including a
succession of unstable Governments, the decade long conflict and lingering instability in
the Government. At the time of project inception, the key policy makers in the GON had
full commitment to reduce the government ownership and control from the two banks,
NBL and RBB. However, the state-owned segment of the banking system could not be
reduced substantially due to government's indecision regarding the end-game resolution
of these two large state-controlled banks even after the needed restructuring. The reasons
were mostly as follows:

   ·   Transition towards a stable government has been very long; hence, lack of
       decision-making stalled the implementation of the project.



                                           18
   ·   There were frequent changes in government and decision makers; thus, the
       commitment towards the ultimate aim of privatization of RBB and NBL could not
       be sustained.
   ·   The decision about the fate of these two banks has always been politically driven;
       thus, the Bank's supervision team faced tremendous challenges throughout the
       project.
   ·   Although attempts were made to hire a Sales Advisor, the procurement process
       could not be completed as the government was undecided about the end game
       resolution of the two banks.
   ·   The Financial Sector High Level Committee was unable to reach a firm decision
       on the privatization of the two banks and hence could not convince the
       government to privatize them.
   ·   Nepal Rastra Bank did not have full control over these two banks; hence it could
       not exercise Prompt Corrective Action although both the banks had a huge capital
       shortfall. NRB could not also take the lead on the end game strategy.

A Mid-term Review of the FSRP carried out by the Bank team in May 2007, also
confirmed that the GON appeared to have backtracked from the undertaking given in its
Letter of Financial Policies in which the end-game of privatization was endorsed as a way
forward for resolving the governance problems in the two state-controlled banks. The
understanding between the World Bank and GON, and as laid out in the Letter of
Financial Policies, was that NRB would continue to exert full control over NBL under
Section 86 of the NRB Act until the bank is privatized. GON would also ensure that the
existing shareholders of NBL do not benefit from the restructuring exercise and do not
impede the restructuring process. The Government would ensure this by maintaining the
suspension of trading of NBL shares until privatization and ensure that the shares are
delisted from Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) by the end of 2003; by writing down the
capital of NBL prior to privatization; by divesting the shares of current shareholders to
"fit and proper" persons; and if writing down capital is not possible ­ by moving with the
process of vesting NBL to a fit and proper institution. During the MTR it was clear that
this understanding was not being implemented.

However, the Mid-term Review evaluated the progress of restructuring of the two
troubled banks as satisfactory, even though some of the key performance indicators were
not met, and the progress in NRB re-engineering was found unsatisfactory because of
NRB's inability to hire consultants as planned and resolve the dispute over payments to
IT Expert for preparing bidding documents, which seriously affected loan disbursement
and project implementation. In fact, throughout the project, strengthening efforts in the
NRB faced a series of setbacks due to changes in Government and shifting priorities and
commitments. The most critical incident that had a lasting adverse impact on the project
was the accusation of the Governor and the Executive Director (ED) of NRB on
corruption charges in July 2007. The CIAA filed a case in the Court, after the contract of
the Supervision Consultant was terminated by NRB for non-performance, alleging that
the procurement of the consulting firm was flawed due to fraud and corruption. The
court ordered the removal of the Governor and the position remained vacant for about
one and a half years. During this time, all reform activities at NRB practically came to a


                                           19
halt. Although a new Governor was put in place in January 2009, his tenure lasted for
only six months when the Appellate Court absolved the earlier Governor from all charges
of corruption and reinstated him in July 2009. The reinstated Governor retired at the end
of January 2010, and the position remains vacant as of March 15, 2010.

The engagement of the Bank team with the successive Governments and the new
management of the Central Bank did not help in sustaining the commitment made at the
time of project inception. This ultimately led to the early closure of the project with
partial cancellations of undisbursed funds. A summary of the project outputs is given in
Annex 2.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project set forth benchmarks and many performance indicators to monitor progress
toward PDOs. A Results Framework and Monitoring arrangement, including utilization
of results for decision-making, was agreed upon during negotiations and it was expected
that the indicators would be reviewed periodically to determine the effectiveness against
performance standards and implementation schedules.

The Coordination and Support Team (CST) that was formed within the NRB in the Bank
and Non-Bank Financial Institution Regulations Department, under the FSTAP,
continued to administer the FSRP and, thus, was in charge of M&E implementation and
utilization. Although CST managed to provide some data to the Bank team during
missions or on demand on an ad hoc basis, the absence of a good Management
Information System (MIS) or database hindered the effective monitoring of
implementation progress at the project office. Data were haphazardly collected and filed.
No periodic evaluations, using the Results Framework, were conducted at project level to
determine the progress towards achieving the PDOs.

Furthermore, there were provisions in the project for conducting two types of surveys: (i)
Exit/retraining Survey, and (ii) subsequent Social Tracking Survey. These were
conducted mostly at the time of earlier phases of VRS payments in 2004 and 2005, with
DfID's funding.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard:

None of the Bank's Safeguard policies were triggered by this project ­ therefore issues
pertaining to the identification and minimization of safeguards did not apply. However,
considering the social implications of the implementation of the VRS in the banks, social
safeguard issues were considered by the project team during the preparation of this
project. As a result, exit and social tracking surveys were conducted at the earlier phases
of VRS payments. These surveys confirmed the lack of demand for retraining and
counseling needs of retrenched people who just wanted the cash compensation.



                                            20
Fiduciary Aspect

Financial Management: Overall, the financial management at the project level was
moderately satisfactory. The project had adequate staff to manage the project accounts.
The existing Financial Management expert of FSTAP had familiarized himself with the
World Bank's FM policy and procedures, and he continued working in the new project,
FSRP, until end-2007. The same CST was in charge of Financial Management aspects of
both the FSRP and FSTAP. The system was maintained by using Excel spreadsheets.
Trimester Financial Monitoring Reports were generally submitted on time. The audit
reports were also generally submitted on time. Internal audits which were carried out by
the Internal Audit Department of the NRB were generally overdue.

At the entity level, the overall financial management system needed improvements. In
the earlier years, the submission of the entity financial statements used to be late and
would take about 8 to 9 months after the end of fiscal year. This improved gradually over
the last few years. In 2008, the entity financial statement for NRB for FY2007/08 was
received within the due date. This has been a remarkable achievement for NRB. At
project completion, both the NRB and the Auditors are aiming to submit the entity
financial payments within four months as required by NRB Act. The entity reports were
always qualified reports. The key concerns raised by the Auditors were related to (i) the
non-compliance with the NRB Act, 2002, (ii) the non-compliance with the International
Auditing Standards (IAS) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
and (iii) the weak financial management system including internal control and internal
audit. Every year, the Bank sent the management letter enquiring about audit
observations and suggesting improvements to cover the deficiencies observed by the
Auditors. Following are some key areas that remained necessary for improvements in
NRB's financial management system:

       ·   Moving towards compliance to the IAS and IFRS;
       ·   Establishing systems for accounts preparation;
       ·   Establishing systems for asset management;
       ·   Improving control weaknesses in banking transactions and accounting
           systems;
       ·   Improving compliance with NRB Act, 2002; and
       ·   Improving internal audit system.

In order to address the financial management issues, a high level committee chaired by
one of the board members has been formed to monitor the issues raised by the auditors on
compliance with IAS/IFRS. NRB also took initiative to prepare a new Accounting
Manual incorporating the IAS/IFRS requirements. NRB is now taking steps to
implement the new Manual. NRB is also taking steps to install new software procured
for inventory management. NRB is addressing the financial management weaknesses
through a realistic action plan to gradually improve its system. Although provision was
included under the FSRP to strengthen the financial management system of the NRB,
NRB management decided not to use the Credit funds for this purpose, mainly because of




                                           21
the Foreign Aid Policy that discouraged the use of Credits for international TA and the
bitter experience of the Governor.

Procurement: At the start of the project, CST had hired a local individual procurement
consultant. In addition to assisting CST in carrying out procurement activities, the
consultant's Terms of Reference (TOR) also required him to impart on-the-job training to
and capacity building of the counterpart staff. During his contract period, it was found
that the consultant was well versed in goods procurement, but had limited knowledge of
procuring consultant services. Additionally, the consultant did not adequately fulfill the
other important responsibility of training his counterpart personnel. Therefore, the
consultant's contract was not extended for the latter part of the project's duration.

Because of the above, the procurement skills of the staff supervising the consultant, in
critical areas such as consultant selection, contract administration (especially of
consultant contracts) and overall project procurement monitoring, needed upgrading.
This was important given that Phase II called for many significant and novel consultant
contracts whose selection procedures, documents, etc. needed to be carefully designed.
NRB, however, did not consider solutions to address this capacity constraint. Thus, no
CST staff was sent for specialized training on consultant selection and contract
administration. Furthermore, because of the removal of the Governor on procurement
related charges, the project officials were very hesitant to carry out procurement or to
take timely procurement decisions. As a result, procurement progress was extremely
slow and unsatisfactory.

The implementation of the procurement related major activities as envisaged in the phase
II of FSRP were as follows:

·   As part of the NRB Re-engineering component, NRB needed to acquire hardware,
    software and networking for the development of its IT platform. However, all
    procurement at NRB ceased after the removal of the Governor in Mid-2007. Due to
    the virtual cessation of procurement at NRB, limited progress has been achieved in
    NRB Re-engineering component, and this activity was transferred to FSTAP as per
    amended Development Credit Agreement (DCA) that became effective from August
    3, 2008.
·   To restart this critical activity, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided
    the services of an international procurement consultant through its capacity building
    TA. The consultant helped prepare the specifications and the bid document for the
    procurement of the banking system IT platform and in developing the evaluation
    criteria and methodology.
·   No progress could also be achieved in hiring the Bank Restructuring Advisor (Sales
    Advisors) and this activity was transferred to FSTAP.
·   No progress could be achieved in hiring a CEO for NBL.

As a result of the lack in progress of procurement under the project and NRB's limited
procurement capacity, the rating for overall procurement progress till the end of the
project remained as "Moderately Unsatisfactory".



                                            22
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

On May 31, 2008, and March 5, 2009, the undisbursed funds (SDR 13.7 million) of the
FSRP were partially cancelled ahead of the original Closing Date of September 30, 2009,
and the implementation of most of the activities envisioned under FSRP were transferred
to a restructured FSTAP (with no funds being transferred). The amended DCA for
FSTAP became effective on August 3, 2008. As a result, all the activities under FSRP
virtually ceased from that date.




                                           23
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objective of developing a healthier financial sector remains
highly relevant to the development of Nepal, when looking at the current situation in the
banking sector. The joint IDA-IFC Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for 2009-2011 also
reiterates the need for continued reforms, as it states that "...The past three years have
seen a rapid expansion of financial institutions and credit fueled by loose monetary
conditions and aggressive lending by smaller, newer banks. Non-performing, politically
motivated lending and willful defaulters, along with weak regulation and compliance,
underscore the vulnerabilities of the system and the need for continued strengthening of
the financial sector."

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

None of the PDOs were fully achieved by the end of the project although there were
some outputs recorded during the project life. The overall assessment with regard to
achievement of PDOs is described below:

The performance/result monitoring indicators (including PDOs or outcome indicators to
measure project development objectives and intermediate outcome or output indicators to
measure component performance) were either partially achieved or not achieved at all in
some cases. The six main outcome indicators used to assess the PDO achievement are as
follows:

1. The first outcome indicator: High Profile non-repayment cases, in which corruption is
suspected, referred to the Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority
(CIAA), has not been achieved. Although NBL forwarded one high profile default case to
CIAA, no legal action was taken against the defaulter and the case was returned to NBL.
Therefore, the original goal of breaking the default culture through some high profile
cases pursued by CIAA was not fully achieved although the message was clear ­ that
borrowed loans were meant to be repaid on time.

2. The second outcome indicator: Establishment and commencement of operation of Debt
Recovery Tribunals and Appellate Tribunal, has been partially achieved. Although Debt
Recovery Tribunals (DRT) were established in 2003, their case resolution record have
been below expectation. Since inception through end of the project, 2,513 default cases
were referred to DRT, of which 1,698 cases have been adjudicated and the balance of 815
cases remained pending as of September 30, 2009. The target for case turnaround and
appeal resolution timelines (150 and 90 days respectively) was not met. Although very
simple cases or appeals could be resolved within the timelines stipulated in the DRT Act,
most of the cases went beyond the targeted time limit.

Total outstanding loans of the cases adjudicated by DRT were Rs.20.41 billion, of which
only Rs.6.99 billion or 34 percent were practically recovered. However, a significant


                                           24
portion of the cases amounting to Rs.5.21 billion or 25.5 percent were settled out-of-
court.

The DRT's enforcement has been delayed often by the following factors: (i) inadequate
collateral security, or security with lower value compared to loan outstanding; (ii)
difficulties in tracing out other assets of the borrower; (iii) lack of adequate information
on borrowers; and (iv) shortage of Debt Recovery Officers.

3. The third outcome indicator: Enforcement of the Blacklisting Directive, has been
partially achieved. NRB issued the Blacklisting Directives 2006 and subsequently, the
Cabinet also adopted the measure to seize passports and preclude sale of property
belonging to big willful defaulters. Seizure of passport was later incorporated in the
Directive. This induced some top blacklisted names to restructure their loans but again
some of them did not stick to the revised amortization schedule and started defaulting
again. A total of 3,476 defaulters were blacklisted, of which 1,383 repaid/restructured
the loans and Rs.3.5 billion was recovered. Of the 355 passports seized, only 26 have
been returned so far. Although the Credit Information Centre Limited (CICL) was
established in March 2005, it is not governed by any Act. It is, however, being
strengthened with support from the FSTAP.

4. The fourth outcome indicator: Retrenchment of staff of NBL and RBB by 40 percent
and rationalization of branch networks to reduce cost structure; Outsourcing of non-core
activities, has been partially achieved. Through the implementation of VRS, the largest
component of the project, staff strength in NBL was reduced by 45 percent to 2,900, and
that in RBB by 48 percent to 2,862. However, because of an upward adjustment, made in
2009, in the salary of all staff in line with the rise in civil service pay scale, staff costs in
both NBL and RBB have almost doubled.

Branch network has been increased to138 in case of NBL and reduced to 123 in case of
RBB. Although some branches were closed during the conflict, they were reopened
mostly last year due to either business or political reasons. In NBL, 24 branches were
closed and/or merged with other branches and 8 were reopened. In RBB, 19 branches
were closed and 8 were reopened. It has been claimed by the management of both the
banks that the branch network has been extended mostly on business need.

5. The fifth outcome indicator: NBL and RBB privatized, was not achieved. Although the
Government amended the NRB Act to empower NRB to take corrective action against
troubled banks, the state-controlled banks have been kept out of NRB's domain. Thus,
NRB had no authority to reduce that segment of the banking system. Due to
Government's continued reluctance to privatize them, the end-game resolution of NBL
and RBB could not be materialized.

6. The sixth outcome indicator: Enhanced Supervisory and Regulatory capacity at NRB,
was partially achieved. Although NRB took some corrective action against private
commercial banks, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) could not be enforced against
state-controlled banks; the amendments to strengthen BAFIA have not yet been tabled in



                                               25
Parliament; and NRB's regulatory and supervisory capacity could not be enhanced as
NRB was unwilling to hire experts to assist them. Moreover, enforcement continues to
be a problem and even the new regulations that have come into effect have had weak
enforcement.

Overall, the end game and exit strategy of external management-team in NBL and RBB
remains unclear by the end of FSRP. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the project
largely failed to achieve its development objectives.


3.3 Efficiency

The Economic or Financial Rate of Return (ERR) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is not
calculated at project completion due to the impossibility of quantifying the expected
economic returns of a financial sector operation of this nature. Other than the VRS, most
of the reforms were not completed. Therefore, the potential economic benefits did not
materialize. In terms of the time dimensions of efficiency as well, the ultimate objectives
were not achieved by the end of the project.

There were, however, some indications of direct financial benefits to NRB and RBB.
The gross non-performing asset (NPAs) went down for both banks, NBL and RBB, from
61 percent and 60 percent respectively at the project appraisal to 5.9 percent and 15.6
respectively at the end. Moreover, cash flow turned around from negative to positive
figures. Although the impact of VRS continues in the long term, a financial analysis
(Annex 3) of impact of VRS on NBL, on a sample basis, shows that there was total cost
savings of US$15.8 million (average US$2.7 million annually) by NBL during FY04 to
FY09, with 45 percent IRR and Payback of below 4 years. Moreover, the successful
implementation of the VRS component of $53.6 million or 70 percent of the project cost,
contributed to the profitability, staff rationalization (right-sized by almost half), cash flow
and other benefits. In addition, pricing of different banking products were made nearly
competitive to market, which also adds to the financial gains made by the both banks.

However, overall efficiency of these banks is reduced by the fact that they are subject to
government's loan waiver program and directed lending as well as a high level of staff
that accounts for a big chunk of staff cost. As noted before, staff salary was increased
recently at par with the national pay scale because of its link to the salary of bank staff.
In addition, other operational costs in both the banks continue to remain high.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

The project development objectives continue to remain highly relevant to the
development of Nepal. Although financial sector reform was considered as one of the
development priorities by the Government, actions and implementation fell short of
expectations and agreed targets.


                                              26
None of the three main PDOs of FSRP was fully achieved, which basically made this
project unsuccessful at closing. The following PDO results would further substantiate the
project's rating:

1. Strengthening of NRB's capacity. The strengthening efforts in the NRB faced a
series of setbacks with the change in Government and its influence on the reform
activities. All reform activities at NRB virtually ceased after the Governor and the
Executive Director were charged with corruption in 2007. Considering the importance of
this project in achieving the country's development objectives, GON requested the Bank
in mid-May 2008, to transfer the NRB Re-engineering component of the FSRP to a
restructured FSTAP as per the Amended DCA that became effective from August 3,
2008. Therefore, the objective of this component remained unachieved by the end of the
project.

2. Improvement in corporate governance of NBL and RBB. There has been only a
slight improvement in the corporate governance of NBL and RBB brought about by the
management teams in these two banks. Although staff size was rationalized through
implementation of VRS, due to the delay in resolving the status of these banks, all the
gains achieved so far risk being lost. Both banks had to increase staff salaries in line with
increase in civil service salaries as bank staff are considered to be civil servants.
Moreover, NBL is still being managed by NRB, and efforts to hire a new CEO did not
meet with success till the end of the project.

3. Reduction in state-owned segment of banking system. The state-owned segment of
the banking system could not be reduced due to government's indecision regarding the
end-game resolution of NBL and RBB. Moreover, the hiring of Sales Advisor was kept
on hold throughout the project due to possible resistance from political parties in
privatizing SOEs under an uncertain political climate. Moreover, there has been a visible
sign of change in the attitudes of the GON regarding privatization upon which the
restructuring of NBL and RBB was premised.

On the efficiency front, although there were some direct financial benefits to NBL and
RBB as seen in their financial statements, the potential economic gains from privatization
remained unattained.

Therefore, based on the findings at project completion and the availability of data, as
summarized above, the ICR team rates the Overall Outcome as "Unsatisfactory"; this
reflects the relevance, degree of achievement of the PDOs and the efficiency of the
project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The potentially positive poverty impact envisaged in the project by way of supporting the
development of a healthier financial sector in Nepal could not be achieved, although


                                             27
access to financial services for the poor went up through opening of closed rural branches
and improvement in services offered by the two large banks.

Some indirect impact on poverty may have occurred through: (i) computerization of more
than 80 percent of the deposit and loan accounts in NBL and RBB, which has ensured
better service to their customers; (ii) introduction of a wider range of banking services;
(iii) safety of small saver's money in the banks due to curbs on willful defaults through
Debt Recovery Tribunals, Blacklisting, and PCAs.

The social implication of the implementation of VRS in the banks was important. In the
absence of any tracking studies that were envisaged in PAD, no clear picture of social
implication was apparent to the policy makers about the social lives of the people who
chose to voluntarily retire early from NBL and RBB.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Besides the technical assistance to NRB and management support to RBB and NBL,
FSRP also had provisions for the capacity building of all these institutions. Re-
engineering of NRB component was targeted to upgrade NRB's professional status by
enhancing the capacity of its staff to oversee the financial sector, and install a fully
integrated MIS and computerized General Ledger system to assist in more efficient
discharge of central banking responsibilities. The NRB Re-engineering component was
dedicated to achieve these goals. However, the IT sub-component for NRB could not be
completed as the IT Consultant failed to respond to NRB's needs. On the other hand,
although the GON amended NRB Act to empower NRB to take corrective action against
troubled banks, the state-controlled banks remained outside their domain. However, the
NRB on-site inspection cycle was brought back on track and NRB accounts started to get
audited within 6 months. A new HR policy was adopted, but installation of a new HR
MIS did not take place. Therefore, NRB's MIS capability is still weak and remains a
cause for concern.

Similarly, with the management support in both the NBL and RBB, there has been a
slight improvement in the corporate governance in these banks. A significant portion of
branch accounts has been computerized and better services are being delivered.
However, due to the delay in resolving the status of these banks, all the gains achieved so
far risk being lost.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One major unintended outcome was that the project was virtually closed, with partial
cancellation of funds and transfer of three components to FSTAP, more than a year ahead
of the original Closing date of September 30, 2009.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The feedback acquired from stakeholders during the ICR mission is summarized below:



                                            28
·   Lack of Government commitment, political interference and change in NRB
    leadership were identified as major causes of FSRP's not attaining its PDOs.
·   NRB could play a more active role in managing the banking sector's exposure to
    asset bubbles. Two such bubbles, one in the stock market and the other in real estate
    caused serious risk to the entire financial system and could have been avoided by a
    more vigilant Central Bank.
·   The real estate bubble has been a boon for NBL and RBB as these banks have been
    able to reduce their non-performing assets substantially. As the value of the collateral
    rose beyond the loan outstanding, defaulters came forward to repay their loans and
    get their collateral back. Other factors that also contributed were: the threat of DRT
    leading to out-of-court settlements, blacklisting, and loan recovery drive by the staff.
    However, if the real estate prices fall in the near future, the NPLs may start to rise
    again.
·   In some cases, defaulting loans of the public banks have been taken over by the new
    and aggressive private banks, thus contributing to further reduction in NPA levels of
    NBL and RBB. The bankers considered this as a potential threat for the whole sector.
·   There has been an increase in the quality of supervision of NRB, especially in the on-
    site area, but far more improvement is required in the credit risk area. NRB's focus
    appears to be only on the day to day activities and "credit" is over emphasized while
    overlooking the operational risk
·   Communication between state-controlled banks' head office and local offices has
    improved and in many cases the earlier system of paper-based reporting has been
    replaced by emails.
·   NRB is reactive not proactive, and they should only penalize errant banks rather than
    all FIs (through a new directive for the whole sector).
·   Supervision capacity and strength has been diluted by the propensity of the Central
    Bank to issue new licenses. NRB needs a policy of developing Specialists, especially
    in bank supervision, and should avoid the current policy of transferring staff from one
    Department to another often after a short duration.
·   The blacklisting system has been effective in reducing willful defaults but DRT
    verdicts cannot be enforced in many cases.
·   The lack of automation in NRB is a big challenge for setting up the automated
    clearing house.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The expected development outcomes under this project were not achieved during the
project's life and do not seem to be realizable in the foreseeable future as these have been
and still are exposed to political, financial, regulatory, governance, and institutional risks.
Moreover, given the realities on the ground, GON's reform agenda may have also
changed. In the face of the global financial crisis, it is perhaps no longer feasible to adopt
privatization as a means of achieving better corporate governance in state-controlled
banks, and the international financial environment may also reduce the likelihood of this
being a viable option. It may, therefore, be more realistic to achieve the same objective
through more politically acceptable means like restructuring, tighter "fit and proper" test
rules for Board directors and management, and more transparency and greater public
disclosure of banks' accounts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The FSRP design was consistent with project designs in this sector at the time but clearly
suffered from two flaws: (i) an overly complex definition of objectives (see PDO of 10
lines) where it is really difficult to see that the project financing is mostly about
retrenchment and bank restructuring, and (ii) results indicators chosen at entry were far
too ambitious and specific. This latter issue is probably one of the causes of perceived
poor performance over the life of the project. Moreover, the PAD states that phase II
(supported by FSRP) was to assist in restructuring the NBL and RBL to make them
viable for privatization, and the goal of recapitalization and ultimate privatization was to
be achieved under a possible phase III. In that sense, the PDO of reducing the state-
owned segment of the banking system through privatization within FSRP was flawed.

The other factor, which is also probably easier to judge with hindsight, is the difficult
political economy surrounding the project. The project passed through a decade long
conflict, several political governments and difficult economic conditions. Transition
governments found it difficult to go against politically and financially influential
defaulters and often shied away from implementing the agreed reforms. Although a risk
mitigation plan was put in place for identified risks, the mitigation measures turned out to
be insufficient during implementation and new risks emerged in the complex political
transitions and the Bank was unable to handle the interferences on the reform agenda.

The project preparation, however, went through a series of cross-consultation with
various stakeholders, including commercial/development banks and other donors such as
IMF and DfID. However, a formal stakeholder analysis was not carried out. The policy
reforms agreed with the Government were based on the Financial Sector Strategy
Statement (FSSS) formulated by the GON that consolidated its thinking and developed a
comprehensive and interlinked reform program. The PDOs of the both FSTAP and FSRP
were derivatives of the reform goals as set out in the FSSS. In addition, the three-phased
approach had been designed to build upon the foundations of the FSTAP and allowed
GON ample opportunity to demonstrate commitment to reform and willingness to
confront difficult issues.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

It is evident that the Bank team had close supervision throughout the project through: (a)
regular supervision from the field office; (b) semiannual supervision missions; and (c) a
midterm review in Mid-2007. Field office supervision had frequent interactions with the
GON and all relevant stakeholders, including the Bank's management. However, while



                                            31
the supervision focused on monitoring of implementation progress, not much emphasis
was placed on achievement of results and outcomes.

It took 5 years and about $58 million to: (i) realize that the project did not manage
procurement adequately; and (ii) the government did not move forward with the most
important reforms proposed under the project. The main PDO objectives were not being
met during project implementation, and the team should have been less optimistic about
results. Although ISRs flagged major obstacles around the project, they do not indicate
that the team foresaw the possible failure of the project. Only the final ISR rated the
project Development Objective (DO) as "unsatisfactory".

Although the task team did their best to navigate through the difficult political and
changing situation, the project could have been restructured during the Mid-Term Review
since both GoN and NRB were no longer supporting the main reforms proposed under
the project. At the least, the project should have been closed when the funds were
cancelled in May 2008.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Bank's performance was moderately unsatisfactory because of the fact that
the project objectives were complex and unrealistic given political reality and that the
project was not restructured even when it was fairly clear that the PDOs could not be
achieved.

 5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The biggest setback to the project was the inability of the Central Bank to improve its
supervision capacity and its inability to change the culture of willful default by large and
influential borrowers.

The second major setback was caused by the unwarranted case filed against the Governor
and ED by the CIAA. The case which took two years to be finally resolved in favor of
the Governor and ED, caused all reform activities, especially within NRB, to come to a
complete halt. Neither the staff nor the top management at NRB felt secure enough to
continue the reform activities during those two years and even after the Governor was
reinstated in July 2009, he did not feel confident enough to pursue the reforms or to hire
consultants and advisors using IDA funds. As a result, most of the project development
objectives could not be achieved.

Finally, the Government's inability to honor the commitments made in the Letter of
Financial Policies dated December 9, 2003, regarding the ultimate resolution of NBL and
RBB have seriously put at risk all the gains achieved through the restructuring of the two
state-controlled banks. During implementation, the Government and NRB stopped the
recruitment of the Sales Advisor half-way through the procurement process, and decided


                                            32
not to initiate the end-game resolution of the two banks. The ICR team recognizes the
fact that the country passed through three Governments during the life of this project.
However, the last two Governments had set up a High Level Financial Sector Committee
to decide on this issue. But the Committee has failed to reach a consensus on the issue
even as of now.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Although the primary responsibility for the achievement of project development
objectives lay upon NRB, it could hardly play an active role in implementing the project
due to several reasons. First, as stated before, the unwarranted case against the Governor
and ED shook the confidence of the staff and top management of NRB and virtually
stalled all reform activities Second, NRB was leaderless for one and a half years as it
was forced to operate without a Governor (the Deputy Governor held charge) and hence
without any vision or mission. Third, NBL and RBB have been kept outside the purview
of the Prompt Corrective Action which denies NRB the right to intervene in these two
banks which have a huge capital shortfall. Finally, NRB failed to utilize the resources
made available to it under this project for increasing its skill, capacity and effectiveness.

Although CST at NRB prepared Financial Monitoring reports as per the legal agreement,
the actual M&E design was not followed at the project level to monitor and report on the
progress of the PDO indicators. There was no database maintained to feed into the results
matrix, which was obvious at the time of preparation of the ICR. This shortcoming was
not identified or corrected by the Bank's supervision team. To make things worse, with
the frequent change in project coordinator and other staff except for an accountant,
institutional memory, drive and/or skills were lost at the CST level. No fiduciary
trainings were taken by the project staff during the life of the project. Although NRB has
improved its financial management skills, the procurement capacity continued to remain
very limited by the end of the project.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Borrower's performance was moderately unsatisfactory. It was evaluated in
terms of: (a) the huge difference in the level of commitment of the GoN between the
periods of project preparation and implementation; (b) political influence to change
project activities, including those in NRB; (c) lack of leadership at NRB and disconnect
between NRB's top management and staff and the main objectives of the project; (d) lack
of proactive and bold decision making by the High Level Financial Sector Committee, for
which it was formed; (e) lack of enhancement in the supervisory (off-site) or advisory
capacity of NRB and their delayed decisions on reform initiatives; and (f) lack of
achievement of the three main PDOs of the project: (i) improvement in corporate
governance of NBL and RBB; (ii) reduction in state-owned segment of banking system;
and (iii) strengthening of NRB's capacity.

6. Lessons Learned

Some of the useful lessons that can be drawn from Nepal's experience with financial
sector reforms include the following:

1. Financial sector reform is a continuous process that requires firm commitment
   from government and all stakeholders on a sustainable basis. The firm
   commitment of the government at the appraisal stage was not sustained during
   implementation by successive governments. Lack of boldness and/or capacity to take
   decisions, political interference in reform activities undoubtedly impacted negatively
   on the project. While some progress has been made under FSRP, the unevenness of
   performance underlines the importance of having widespread support for significant
   reforms to be completed (such as privatization of state-owned banks). The wavering
   commitment of successive governments over the life of this project points to the need
   for renewing commitment to project objectives by a new government in order for the
   project to continue its operations.

2. Reform projects invariably face implementation delays. Delays can be largely
   due to unanticipated political developments and the perceived inability of the
   transitional government to take necessary decisions to implement the agreed reforms.
   Moreover, the capacity of weak institutions to implement difficult reforms must be
   taken into account.

3. More time should be deployed during project preparation on risk mitigation
   measures for the critical risks to the Development Outcomes of the project.
   While some risks were identified at project preparation ­ that the fragile security
   situation and continuing political uncertainty may stymie the reform process ­ the
   mitigation measure consisting of maintaining good lines of communication with
   politicians across the spectrum and banking on continued political support turned out
   to be insufficient. It is imperative at project appraisal to spend more time simulating
   alternative scenarios, identifying respective risks and mitigation measures, and finally
   reaching consensus. One possible, although ambitious, mitigation measure could be
   to build a South Asia Regional consensus, through an MOU amongst governments or
   regulators, on financial sector reforms by which each country could benefit from the
   experience of the other and by peer-pressure to carry out reforms. Such South-South
   cooperation has proven to be valuable in many cases.

4. The project design should take into account the local rules and practices that may
   cause significant delays if they are contradictory to those of the Bank, which the
   Borrower may not flag before project launch. It should have been evident that GON
   was unlikely to take timely procurement action on a critical component such as the
   extension of the management contract of the external team on a sole source basis,


                                            34
   even with all justifications, as it violated its own procurement rules of competitive
   bidding process. The need for a Cabinet approval for this to happen ­ given the
   precarious nature of the multi-party coalition government ­ made this a politically
   unfeasible option. Given the importance of continuing the same management
   consulting services to protect the past gains, the contract period should have been
   made longer at the outset.

5. It is important to strike a better balance between project goals, the design of
   project instruments, and a country's political realities. In addition to the long-
   term objective of strengthening the financial sector in a country, project goals should
   include specific intermediate objectives. When the design of policy instruments in a
   project emphasizes the enactment/amendment of laws and regulations, as in the case
   of Nepal, it is crucial that the feasibility analysis include an assessment of the
   country's political climate and the likelihood of parliament approval for each piece of
   legislation. No matter how well-intentioned a Government's commitment to the
   passage of key financial sector legislation may be, the Bank needs to perform a reality
   check.

6. Sequencing is important for successful financial sector reforms, especially in
   privatizing banks. To ensure smooth transition from a nationalized to a privatized
   bank, it is recommended that all public sector commercial banks undergo a thorough
   cost and operational restructuring before privatization. Any injection of capital into
   RBB and NBL should only be supported at the point of privatization/liquidation or
   some other acceptable change in governance arrangements in these banks.

7. Cultural change in the organization must be inculcated prior to privatization.
   The seeds for the new corporate culture should be sown way ahead of taking bold
   action towards handing over a bank to new owners. For instance, the hiring of Sales
   Advisor was kept on hold also due to resistance from the Unions at RBB and NBL in
   privatizing them. Since these Unions were backed by political parties, they had
   powerful influence on the management of these banks. An effective change
   management process should, therefore, have been initiated at the very outset of the
   reform implementation to convince the Unions of the benefits of privatization.

8. It is likely that project components which are pre-designed and are already under
   implementation before the project launch have the greatest chance of success. In
   this respect, the VRS ­ the largest monetary component of the proposed project ­ had
   been completely pre-designed to a level acceptable to the World Bank, and was
   operationalized even before the project became effective.

9. The sustainability of financing any retrenchment program is crucial for
   project's success. In spite of financing a fairly important retrenchment program
   under FSRP, the sustainability of the investment is not obvious given the fact that the
   main reforms are still stalling.




                                           35
10. Irrespective of costs, restructuring in large public sector banks is necessary to
    restore the safety and soundness of the financial system since inaction to avoid
    fiscal costs could result in "meltdown' and much bigger fiscal costs later.

11. It is prudent to be more conservative in assessing borrower's capacity to
    implement reforms and thus be less ambitious in project design. It was obvious
    that even the best of intentions of a few selected bureaucrats, for example, those at
    NRB and MOF, was not sufficient to carry out the reforms toward end-game
    resolution given the lack of strong political commitment. A realistic assessment of
    Financial Management and Procurement capacity of the Borrower, at implementation
    agency level, is also of paramount importance.

12. The Government, the implementation unit and the World Bank need to share
    and agree on the management of the monitoring and evaluation system of the
    project from its very launch. Irrespective of any parallel initiative in this area, all
    projects should consider allocation of some resources to train the project staff at
    implementing agency, at the least, on how to deal with M&E and perform fiduciary
    responsibilities while implementing the project.

13. It is a good idea for the Bank team to consider a "training and counseling"
    component in an effort to meet the genuine retraining needs of the public sector
    staff while devising a severance payment scheme (VRS), and to address potential
    criticisms and reputation risk arising from the implementation of such a scheme. This
    has to be demand driven too. In the case of FSRP, incorporation of such a component
    was considered but dropped eventually following confirmation of lack of demand
    from the retirees as determined by a social assessment.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

During the ICR mission, the Borrower commented that this Credit could contribute
immensely toward supporting financial sector reforms and that due to various
uncontrollable factors it was not possible to realize the project development objectives.
MoF, especially, mentioned that the strengthening of the Central Bank is crucial and it is
hoped that the Bank's ongoing FSTA project would attain some of the unrealized
outcomes of the FSRP. It was also learnt during the mission that the GON is considering
a recapitalization plan for both NBL and RBB.

The Borrower's contribution to the ICR is attached at Annex 7.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Below is the summary of the outputs by project components and those detailed factors
relevant to the development outcomes:

1. Phase II: NRB Re-engineering: Enhancing the capacity of NRB to oversee a
   prudently operated banking system was the prime objective of this project, which is
   complimentary to the parallel FSTA project which had already started in 2003. The
   accounting component was supposed to assist NRB in meeting the IMF's Safeguard
   Assessment milestones, including the production of an international audit of the
   bank's accounts to IAS. The Human Resources (HR) reforms were supposed to build
   upon the newly introduced HR policies, recent efforts by the Central Bank to reduce
   overall staffing levels, and the development of a new training plan to help move NRB
   towards the establishment of a more professionally managed staffing cadre. The
   Information Technology (IT) component was aimed at the modernization process
   within the bank.

   Implementation Results: Although, initially NRB started gaining in a few areas
   through FRSP interventions, due to stoppage of procurement at NRB in the wake of
   leadership crisis following the removal of the Governor on corruption charges,
   limited progress has been achieved in NRB Re-engineering and this activity has been
   transferred to FSTA project as per amended DCA that became effective from August
   3, 2008.

   Since Re-engineering in NRB was supported by two simultaneous projects (FSTAP
   and FSRP), the respective contributions could not be segregated completely. A
   detailed assessment of the specific areas of intervention in NRB by the FSRP is
   presented below:

   Bank Supervision: In general, NRB's on-site supervision capability has improved
   during the project period as reported by the banks. Off-site reports are issued within
   45 days. On-site supervision is done annually and report issued within 30 days.

   However, the Bank supervision sub-component remained stalled throughout the
   project after the contract with IEF was terminated for non-performance three years
   ago followed by a CIAA charge against the Governor. The NRB staff became
   demoralized following this charge and was reluctant to proceed with any further
   procurement. NRB had, later on, indicated that it would not like to engage long-term
   consultants to strengthen its supervision capacity. Over the past two years, they have
   been seeking assistance from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
   Institutions (OSFI), Canada. OSFI conducted a "Bank Supervision Workshop" in
   January 2007, from which NRB supervisors benefitted substantially and hence, NRB
   preferred to continue that arrangement. Moreover, with the help of initial support
   from IMF, NRB is in the process of preparing the policy, manuals and guidelines for
   risk-based supervision.




                                          39
   NRB has also implemented its policy of conducting onsite supervision of each bank
   every year and publishing the annual supervision report which includes major
   findings and directives given to commercial banks during the onsite examinations. It
   has been using the Early Warning System to plan onsite inspection and special
   inspections if warranted.

   NRB intervention to enforce prudential regulations and relevant banking legislation
   has been enhanced to some extent during the project life of FSRP. It took actions to
   liquidate a troubled bank, suspended the Board of a bank, and invited a team from
   State Bank of Pakistan to assist NRB in setting up stress testing of the banking
   system. Moreover, together with the Credit Information Center Ltd. (CICL), NRB
   has initiated the procurement of hardware and software for the automation of CICL.

   NRB has issued a Directive on Prompt Corrective Action. Although Government
   amended the NRB Act to empower NRB to take corrective action against troubled
   banks, the state-owned segment of the banking system has been kept outside the
   purview of the Prompt Corrective Action framework.

   Human Resource Development: The Human Resources (HR) reforms at NRB were
   supported by hiring an HR Consultant under FSRP. Although its Board of Directors
   decided to implement completely the recommendations of the HR Consultant hired
   under FSRP, NRB management has yet to put in place a new, open and participative
   Performance Management System. The hiring of a new HR Advisor to assist in the
   streamlining of processes for recruitment, training, transfer, and promotion did not
   taken place, even though the previous HR Advisor completed the systematic
   manpower assessment and gap analysis and the Medium Term Strategic Human
   Resources policy, several years back. This is an area that would provide a high pay-
   off in terms of motivating staff and increasing staff productivity. All of these have
   also led to the failure in achieving the target of non-professional staff to professional
   staff ratio, installation of new HR MIS, and most of all, moving towards the
   establishment of a more professionally managed staffing cadre in NRB.

   Automation (IT): The IT sub-component remained stalled throughout the project
   due to the failure of the IT consultant in not delivering the outputs and the resulting
   payment disputes between NRB and the consultant. Moreover, support for IT
   automation from the NRB Governor, skills level of the NRB business and IT staff and
   lack of a committed IT leadership were equal factors in the failure of this component.

   Accounting Support: This was dropped at the very outset of the project as it is
   supported under FSTAP.

2. Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) in RBB and NBL: The largest component
   supported the VRS in RBB and NBL in an effort to reduce their costs and ultimately
   assist in bring them to the point of privatization. The two main components of high
   cost in these banks had been identified as non-performing loans and staff costs. The
   first of these was dealt with by the new Management Teams in these banks,



                                            40
   supported/financed by the Bank's FSTAP and complemented by the FSRP covenants,
   while the VRS was supported fully under the FSRP project. Of all the components of
   FSRP, only the VRS component was carried out fully at a cost of US$53.63 million,
   and staff strength has been reduced in NBL from 5,270 to 2,900 (45 percent) and in
   RBB from 5,522 to 2,862 (48 percent). Staff cost to income, however, increased to
   56 percent in NBL and reduced to 32 percent in RBB as of Mid-2009, mainly due to
   hikes in civil service pay in 2009.

3. Hiring of Sales Advisors and Ongoing Management team Support: Although the
   procurement of Sales Advisors was initiated, the process was not completed as
   government was not eager to privatize RBB and NBL. No progress could also be
   achieved in hiring the new Management Team at NBL as NRB took inordinate time
   in completing the procurement process and better qualified candidates lost interest.
   Subsequently, through a restructuring of FSTAP in 2008, these activities have been
   transferred from FSRP to FSTAP. The management team at RBB is continuing with
   only two advisors in place of four and a new management team is yet to be put in
   place at NBL where NRB officials are managing the bank at the moment.

   Although here has been a slight improvement in the corporate governance of NBL
   and RBB brought about by the management teams in these two banks, the gains
   achieved so far risk being lost due to the delay in resolving the status of these banks.
   Both banks had to increase staff salaries in line with increase in civil service salaries,
   and they might again be subjected to government's future loan waiver programs.

   Despite huge accumulated losses in both NBL and RBB at the end of the project,
   FSRP's management support helped the banks in certain aspects, such as, making
   operational profits and turning in a positive cash flow last year, reducing NPAs
   significantly, introducing new products, automation (partial), preparing operational
   policies/guidelines, and better staffing. NPA has come down to 5.9 percent in case of
   NBL and 15.6 percent in case of RBB from their original levels of 61 percent and 60
   percent respectively. More than 80 percent of the deposit and loan accounts are
   computerized. Pricing of their products is mostly competitive and new products are
   being introduced. The negative net worth has also come down to Rs.5.2 billion in
   NBL and to Rs.13.4 billion in RBB.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Economic or Financial Rate of Return (FRR) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the
whole project is not calculated at project completion due to the impossibility to quantify
the expected economic returns of a financial sector operation of this nature. Other than
VRS payments, most of the reforms did not take place. Therefore, the potential
economic benefits would not be high. In terms of the time dimension of efficiency as
well, its ultimate objectives were not achieved by the end of the project.

The return to the Bank's investment operation, however, can be the quantifiable benefits
in terms of cost savings and the unquantifiable benefits in terms of increased efficiency of
the banking system through lower lending spread and wider choice of banking services.
As part of this ICR, there has been an attempt made to conduct an analysis that was
mostly restricted to the cost savings aspect due to the VRS component. There was a big
impact on annual cost savings in the books of RBB and NBL due to VRS payments of
US$53.63 million. An analysis is done for NBL to gauge the impact of such VRS
intervention on the books of the bank. It was found that the total cost savings in NBL
due to VRS has been about $15.8 million (average $2.7 million annually) from FY04
through FY09, with 45 percent financial IRR and a payback period of just below four
years. This indicates a very good return on the investment from this Credit. This
analysis is also consistent with other experiences in South Asian public sector institutions
which indicate that payouts are high, but payback periods are extremely low. Obviously,
in the long run, the nonfinancial and economic benefits of such scheme would be much
higher than the simple calculations as presented in the below table.

                                                44
Notes/ Main Assumptions:

   1. As the incentive portion built into the VRS scheme was only 20.1 percent of the
      total disbursement, the same rate was used as the investment cost for the project at
      appraisal (see annex 9 of PAD). The similar assumption/methodology is used at
      the completion with actual figures.
   2. Incremental costs for NBL due to VRS are also considered as total financial costs
      of VRS for the cost-benefit analysis purpose. Similarly, additional savings in the
      operating and other expenses are also considered.
   3. The calculations included figures from FY04 through FY09 as supplied by NBL.
   4. The cost of funds was assumed to stand close to 10%, and all cash flows
      (benefits/costs) were discounted at that rate.

There were also some indications of gaining operational efficiency by NBL and RBB,
which directly or indirectly would add up to their profitability. The gross non-performing
asset (NPAs) levels went down for the both banks, NBL and RBB, from 61 percent and
60 percent respectively at the project appraisal to 5.9 percent and 15.67 respectively at
the end. Moreover, cash flow turned around from negative to positive figures.

Based on provisional financial statements, the operating profit of NBL during FY09 was
Rs.338 million, an increase of 52 percent from the previous year. Despite NBL's efforts
in reducing its number of staff significantly (48 percent reduction from FY03 level), its
excessively high staff cost remains a major obstacle to improving staff efficiency. Staff
cost as a percentage of total operating income further increased to 56 percent due to
government mandated salary increases and the accompanying increase in benefits. Going
forward, NBL plans to reduce its number of staff via natural attrition in lieu of VRS. The
Net Worth still remained negative, at Rs.5.2 billion. Computerization progress has been
made, with a total of 58 branches operating on a "live" mode. At present, 77 percent of
the deposit base and 88 percent of loans are covered by the IT platform.

On the other hand, during FY09, RBB has registered an operating profit of Rs.898
million last year and wrote off around Rs.999 million worth of Non Performing Assets
(NPA), thereby reducing the NPA level to 15.6 percent from 21.6 percent in the
preceding year and 60 percent in FY03. The Cost to Income Ratio further increased to 57
due to staff related costs, including increased salary allowances and additional provision
of Rs.440 million for employee retirement benefits triggered by the hike in civil service
salaries. Despite achievement in staff strength reduction of 45 percent from the FY03
level, salary increases and employee retirement benefits all adversely impacted other staff
efficiency indicators. The Net Worth of the Bank remained negative, at Rs.13.4 billion.
Computerization of branches has been largely on target with 95% of deposits and 98% of
loans modernized.

Another financial benefit that could be attributed to FSRP is the recovered outstanding
default loans that were referred to DRT, through DRT decision or out-of-court settlement.
While about Rs.7 billion was recovered following DRT's decision, Rs.5.2 billion was
settled out-of-court. However, about half of the default cases that were referred to DRT
are still pending.
