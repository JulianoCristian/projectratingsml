                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As LGSP I draws to close, the team is working closely with the Government and other stakeholders to prepare LGSP II and to expand engagement on broader reforms that
                         strengthen the overall local government system. LGSP II preappraisal is being concluded with LGSP supervision mission. It is expected that LGSP II will be presented to IDA Board in
                         the first quarter of FY 12.
