Parishads in the Bangladesh Local Governance Support\n            Project for Community Infrastructure Works (CIWs). To avoid\n            any potential adverse impact all prospective CIWs will be\n            screened, and to decrease potential negative adaptations\n            will be made in design, location, or execution; cumulative\n            impacts will be prevented or mitigated, positive impacts\n            will be enhanced, and added stress on environmentally\n            sensitive areas will be avoided. The project will exclude\n            CIWs which may cause the following environmental impacts:\n            works that close gaps or culverts in existing roads, which\n            may affect water flow; tube-wells with arsenic contamination\n            higher than the national standard or based below the 10-year\n            flood level; water supply schemes with a high probability of\n            bacterial contamination or characteristics which may make\n            water unsuitable for drinking; health facilities without\n            adequate hazardous waste management capacity; new or\n            significant expansion of disposal facilities with negative\n            health impacts to nearby water sources or population, or of\n            disposal sites requiring involuntary public participation;\n            building or repairing mechanized tube-wells for irrigation\n            in deep aquifers leading to aquifer depletion or seasonal\n            dams with adverse downstream effects; draining traditional\n            wetlands for agricultural use; subprojects requiring\n            pesticides; and activities supporting commercial logging in\n            forested areas, or using unsustainable, harvested timber or\n            fuelwood, or involving significant conversion or degradation\n            of critical natural habitats.
