The reallocation is\n            necessary to for the reasons noted below: (1) there is an\n            overall reduction in credit amount due to transfer of funds\n            for the Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project.\n            This has led to a shortfall in financing the final tranche\n            of expanded block grants and other components; (2) it was\n            jointly decided between International Development\n            Association (IDA) and the Government (and recorded in\n            mission aide-memoires as well as management letters) that\n            component five social protection pilot (US$2.1M) will be\n            canceled because of substantial institutional hurdles faced\n            with its implementation, and the credit proceeds will be\n            reallocated to component one fiscal transfers; and (3) the\n            performance grants under component one, which were to be\n            rolled out across the country has not taken place because\n            the planned arrangements for designing and implementing\n            performance grants required more time than anticipated.\n            Hence it was jointly agreed between IDA and the Government\n            that the funds will be reallocated for expanded block\n            grants.
