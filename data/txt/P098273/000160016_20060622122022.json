community priorities, using a predictable\n            and transparent fiscal transfer system. There are five\n            project components. Component 1, funds fiscal transfers to\n            eligible local governments for basic local service delivery\n            and provides incentives for good governance and service\n            delivery performance. Component 2 supports direct\n            mobilization of communities to prioritize development needs,\n            and community and government monitoring systems. Component 3\n            supports core local government capacity development in\n            implementing the block grant. Component 4 supports the\n            Government in conducting regular, outcomes-based evaluations\n            of the project in the context of the evolution of the local\n            governance system. Component 5 supports a social protection\n            pilot which will test the use of conditional transfers for\n            national functions that can be devolved to local governments."}, "docdt": "2006-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
