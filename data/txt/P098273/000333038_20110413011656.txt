2.      Briefly summarize project implementation progress.

The project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. The most recent ISR ratings
regarding progress towards achievement of PDO and overall implementation progress are

                                                4
Satisfactory. The project will close on June 30, 2011. The most important remaining tasks
are disbursing the final tranche of Expanded Block Grants, completion of final year of
audits and audit reviews (which will also form the audits for the first year of the proposed
second Local Governance Support Project), completion of the end-of-the-project survey
(which will also form the baseline survey for the follow up project), and completion of
remaining capacity training at the district and sub-district levels. These actions are
delayed and need to be expedited to make sure that the project is successfully closed on
time.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to for the reasons noted below. The
reallocation will neither alter the PDO nor impact its achievement in any manner.

   ·   There is an overall reduction in credit amount due to transfer of funds for the
       Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project. This has led to a shortfall
       in financing the final tranche of Expanded Block Grants and other components.

   ·   It was jointly decided between IDA and the Government (and recorded in mission
       Aide-memoires as well as Management Letters) that Component 5 -- Social
       Protection Pilot (US$2.1M) would be canceled because of substantial institutional
       hurdles faced with its implementation, and the credit proceeds would be
       reallocated to Component 1 -- Fiscal Transfers.

   ·   The performance grants under Component 1, which were to be rolled out across
       the country has not taken place because the planned arrangements for designing
       and implementing performance grants required more time than anticipated. Hence
       it was jointly agreed between IDA and the Government that the funds would be
       reallocated for Expanded Block Grants. Further, it was also agreed that
       performance grants will be rolled out under the proposed Second Local
       Governance Support Project.
