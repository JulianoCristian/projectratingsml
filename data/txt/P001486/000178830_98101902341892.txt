BANKIN'NY INDOSTRIA (BNI)
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:              Democratic Republic of Madagascar
Beneficiary:           Bankin'ny Indostria (BNI)
Amount:                US$5.0 million
Terms:                 Standard
Onlending Terms:       1.  The Government would onlend US$4.5
million of the proceeds of the credit to BNI
at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum plus
0.75% commitment fee for a period substantially
in conformity with the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of the subloans,
except for US$0.5 million for financing
artisan/SSE projects, which would be repaid
under a fixed amortization schedule.
2. BNI would onlend the proceeds at a minimum
rate of 8.5% per annum to its IDA-financed
clients. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by all medium and large-scale borrowers.
The Government, however, would bear the
foreign exchange risk for the small-scale
borrowers, who would pay a fee of 1% per
annum.
3. The Government would pass on US$0.5
million of the proceeds of the credit to BNI
for technical assistance/training/studies
within BNI, as a loan without interest
but with 0.75% service charge. This
amount, for which the Government would
also assume the foreign exchange
risk, would be repaid under a fixed
amortization schedule.
Project Description:  The project would support the country's
growing industrial sector and BNI's crucial
role by: (i) providing BNI with part
of its foreign exchange requirements to
finance its projected lending to artisans/SSEs
and medium-scale industrial enterprises
during the period September 1979 through
December 1981; and (ii) strengthening BNI
and providing funds for technical assistance
to the institution.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR THE BANKIN'NY INDOSTRIA (BNI)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the equiva-
lent of US$5.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign
exchange requirements of the Bankin'ny Indostria (Banque Nationale pour le
Developpement Industriel - BNI) for the period 1979-81. US$4.5 million of
the proceeds of the credit would be onlent to BNI at an interest rate of 7.5
percent per annum with a 0.75% commitment fee; US$0.5 million for the
technical assistance/training/feasibility studies component would be passed
on by the Government to BNI as a loan without interest at a service charge
of 0.75%.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Madagascar - Recent Economic Developments and
Future Prospects" was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 24,
1979. A summary of its findings is set out below. Country data sheets are
provided in Annex 1.
3.        With a population of 8.0 million and a GNP per capita estimated at
US$240 in 1977, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. It
is predominantly an agricultural country and 85 percent of its population live
in rural areas with a per capita income of about US$120 per annum. In many
areas the standard of living is at the subsistence level. Although the
country is sparsely populated (an average of 14 inhabitants per square kilo-
meter), there is great pressure on cultivable land in some regions. Owing
mainly to different ecological conditions, the highlands are more advanced
than the coastal areas, and the south is particularly poor with a harsh, arid
climate and infertile soils. The east coast is rich agriculturally, but crops
are frequently devastated by cyclones. Internal migration is common and has
accelerated as improved roads have provided access to new areas. However,
poor roads remain a major constraint to development; many of the main highways
are not passable during the rainy season in a country where production centers
may be as far as 800 kilometers from main points of consumption. Many areas
are cut off from the rest of the country for several months each year.
4.        Over the past few years the growth of the economy continued to be
slow and uneven. Having risen but marginally in 1975, real GDP fell in 1976
by 2.9 percent owing to a slight decline in agricultural production and a
steep drop of about 14 percent in manufacturing output. GDP is estimated to
have increased by 3.9 percent in 1977; even so, output of goods and services
showed only a slight increase over the period since 1974; and, with population



- 2 -
increasing by about 2.5 percent annually, per capita GDP fell by about 5
percent. Budgetary investment outlays were stepped up considerably after
1975; but the investment rate remained practically unchanged at about 14
percent as the sharp rise in Government capital expenditures was largely
offset by a substantial decline in private investment. The savings rate also
continued to be fairly stable and fluctuated around 10-11 percent. The
resource gap as a consequence has been maintained at a low level.
5.        Agricultural production has not recorded any marked growth over
the last three or four years.  Even over the longer period since 1970 it has
increased at an annual rate of only about 1 percent. Despite periodic good
crops, paddy production did not keep pace with demand; and production in 1977,
estimated at 2.0 million tons, was only about 7 percent higher than in 1970.
Groundnut production, after rising significantly in 1976, fell back to
47,000 tons in 1977, while meat production did not register any significant
rise. Imports of rice and edible oils have increased to 105,000 tons
and 16,000 tons, respectively, and were about three to four times as large
in 1977 as in 1970-71. Sugarcane production continued to stagnate as there
has been no addition to the refinery capacity for several years. Among other
cash and export crops, coffee production, except for a 6 percent drop in 1976,
has been rising steadily, reaching some 89,000 tons in 1977. However, raw
cotton production, which had been increasing fairly fast, levelled off after
1975 due to shortages of fertilizers and pesticides; vanilla output declined,
while pepper showed no noticeable increase.
6.        The development of the industrial sector after independence in 1960
was encouraged by promotional measures such as fiscal incentives, protection
against competition from imports and provision of institutional term financing.
Industrial production now accounts for about 14 percent of GDP. Despite
significant diversification of capacity that has taken place, manufacturing is
still dominated by food processing, textiles and apparel industries. Together
they account for close to 70 percent of the manufacturing output. Among other
industries the important ones include tobacco manufactures, chemicals (mainly
soap and matches), petroleum refining and production of construction materials.
7.        Industrial growth since 1972 has been erratic.  Following a marked
9.3 percent rise in 1974 the industrial production index declined again in
1975 and 1976; and despite recovering somewhat in 1977 it remained below the
level attained in 1974. Within the manufacturing sector itself, however,
performance varied between different industry groups. While the output of
processed foods and textiles followed a stagnant or a declining trend after
1974, some of the comparatively minor industries, such as chemicals, tobacco
manufactures, rubber and paper products maintained a fairly steady growth.
8.        Over the past few years a number of industrial establishments consid-
ered to be of national importance were taken over by the State. Some unprofit-
able enterprises facing closure were also nationalized to prevent layoff of
workers. In some other cases the State assumed majority control. The important
foreign-owned industrial enterprises that were nationalized include the oil
refinery (January 1976), the power and water supply company (January 1976) and
two sugar firms (December 1976). At present, the State owns, or has acquired
majority participation in, all major industrial units employing a thousand or
more workers.



- 3 -
9.        Madagascar's fiscal situation deteriorated considerably after 1975,
due to a sudden and sharp rise in current budget expenditure and Government
spending on capital development. Current expenditures rose steeply with the
rising wage bill of the Government and increasing outlay on maintenance; and
the current budget surplus, which used to be substantial, dwindled as revenues
failed to keep pace with the growth of expenditures. Furthermore, as Govern-
ment intensified its efforts to raise investment levels and stimulate the
economy, public investment expenditure rose from 11.2 billion FMG in 1975 to
20.5 billion FMG in 1977. The outlays on the consumer rice subsidy, although
they declined in 1976, rose again to 3.6 billion FMG in the subsequent year.
The overall Treasury deficit, which more than doubled to 20 billion FMG
between 1975 and 1977, was financed increasingly through recourse to Central
Bank advances. The budget for 1978 envisaged a 26 percent increase in total
outlay as compared to the estimated actual expenditures in 1977, while capital
spending was proposed to be raised by nearly 80 percent to 36.4 billion FMG.
Revenues also were expected to go up sharply, partly as a result of tax reform
measures. The overall deficit, however, might turn out to be somewhat larger
than the projected 16.1 billion FMG owing to underestimation of expenditure on
personnel and the settlement of payments deferred from 1977, on the one hand,
and shortfalls in revenues on the other. Even so, the overall fiscal situation
is likely to have shown some improvement in 1978 as compared to the preceding
year. The Government is contemplating economies in current expenditure,
particularly by paring consumer subsidies, so as to minimize the burden of
unproductive outlays in the future.
10.       Monetary and credit developments since 1975 have been influenced
mainly by the Government's deficit financing needs.  Outstanding domestic
credit went up by more than 50 percent to 126 billion FMG during 1975-77, due,
for the most part, to the steep and continued rise in net claims on Government.
As a result, money supply, which had been increasing moderately, rose by 15
percent in 1976 and as much as 25 percent in 1977.  Despite this monetary
expansion and little growth in the output of goods and services, the annual
inflation rate has been moderate -- about 9-10 percent during 1976-77, largely
because of increasing demand for cash balances and the consequent accumulation
of idle funds.
11.       The balance of payments situation which had been deteriorating
showed a substantial improvement in 1976, when a surplus of 2 billion FMG was
recorded; but the payments surplus in 1977 is now estimated to have been much
smaller. The turnaround in the balance of payments situation occurring in
1976 is attributable more to exogenous factors than to any significant im-
provement in the structure of the balance of payments. Trade surpluses were
recorded in 1976 and 1977 as a result of (a) a sharp rise in prices of exports,
particularly coffee, which reversed the continuing deterioration in the terms
of trade, and (b) the imposition of more strict quantitative restrictions on
imports in 1976. There was a substantial decline in the availability of
imports after 1975. On the other hand, the volume of exports dropped sharply
in 1976, and continued to fall in 1977, while there was no lasting reduction
in the services deficit, nor any sustained rise in capital inflows.



12.       The growth and development of the Malagasy economy have over a
fairly long period been affected by constraints resulting from shortage of
savings, slow growth in markets for major primary exports and low productivity
of traditional agriculture. The country, however, is relatively well-endowed
with natural resources and has a well-established administrative set-up. With
appropriate policies and adequate external capital assistance, medium and
long-term prospects for the economy should be favorable. There is consider-
able scope for the expansion of agriculture and livestock production. Only
about a fifth of the arable land is at present being cultivated, while fer-
tilizer consumption, estimated to be some 14,000 tons in 1976, is still rather
small. The irrigation potential has as yet been only partially exploited.
The outlook for further development of manufacturing based on locally avail-
able materials is promising. On the whole, sustained growth at an average
annual rate of 4-5 percent appears to be feasible.
13.       The Government has been taking far-reaching steps to strengthen
national control of the economy. As a part of this process, economic and
financial institutions, productive sectors, foreign trade and internal market-
ing have undergone extensive reorganization. Inspired by the basic needs
approach, the Government has also formulated long-term development objectives
which envisage a more egalitarian income distribution and satisfaction of
specified minimum consumption requirements of the population by the end of
the century. The Government also stresses national self-sufficiency and the
eventual establishment of an industrial base large and diversified enough to
meet the domestic demand for basic equipment and other essential consumer
goods.
14.       A Three-Year Plan, which is to be the first of a series of medium-
term investment programs designed to attain these long-run development objec-
tives, was launched in 1978. The Plan envisages overall expansion of the
economy at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent during 1978-80. The rate of
investment is projected to rise to 17.1 percent of GDP by 1980 from the Plan
estimate of 11.5 percent in 1977. The savings rate is to be stepped up,
partly through the mobilization of additional budgetary resources for capital
development. But about a quarter of the investment outlays during the Plan
period is expected to be financed through external loans and grants. Greater
emphasis will be placed on the development of food crops; and household con-
sumption is targeted to rise, in real terms, by 3.6 percent per year. The
plan accords high priority to manufacturing, particularly basic industry
and processing of agricultural raw materials.
15.       Madagascar's external public debt, outstanding and disbursed,
amounted to US$202.8 million at the end of 1977. Slightly over half of it
(US$102.3 million) was owed to the Bank Group, and as much as 37.8 percent to
IDA alone. The Bank Group share of debt service in 1977 was 20.8 percent.
Among bilateral donors France and the Federal Republic of Germany are the most
prominent, each holding about 14 percent of the disbursed debt. Japan and the
People's Republic of China rank next in importance (about 5 percent each)
followed by the USA (3 percent) and Italy (1.1 percent). Suppliers' credits
and commercial borrowing (4.6 percent of the disbursed debt) have been rela-
tively unimportant. The Government, in fact, has been generally prudent with



regaid, external indebtedness; the outstanding disbursed debt at the end of
1976 thus amc-inted to nearly 11 percent of GNP as compared to the average of
21 percent for low-income countries. Because of relatively limited reliance
on external assistance and concessionary terms of most loans and credits, debt
service payments have remained small. The estimated debt service ratio of 3.5
percent in 1976 was only marginally higher than in 1970.
16.       The Bank Group should be prepared, in appropriate cases, to provide
some local cost financing. In terms of performance, Madagascar appears to
have performed about as well as other countries at the same level of develop-
ment encountering similar constraints.  Its current 'iomestic savings rate of
10 - 11 percent compares favorably with the average of 8 percent for countries
in the low-income group, indicating that Madagascar has made a reasonable
effort to mobilize domestic savings; but its savings fall far short of the
country's requirements. The Government's policy of emphasizing self-reliance
has contributed further to scarcity of external resources. Despite consid-
erable restrictions on imports, the country's balance of payments and reserve
position have continued to be weak.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MADAGASCAR
17.       Outstanding IDA credits to Madagascar amount to US$206.51 million
and Bank loans total US$31.98 million. About 54 percent of Bank Group lending
has been for transport, 14 percent for electric power, 24 percent for agricul-
ture and 8 percent for education. IFC's first investment was made in March
1977 with an equity investment of US$290,000 and a loan of US$11.0 million for
the expansion of a textile mill; other projects in leather and ferrochrome are
under consideration. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits, and of IFC investments as of December 31, 1979, as well as notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       The priority given to transport investment recognizes that improve-
ment in communications is a precondition for Madagascar's development. Four
projects have been for the construction of all-weather highway links between
the island's different regions; a fifth highway project for road maintenance
was signed on July 30, 1979. There has been a project for improving Mada-
gascar's main port of Toamasina and one for modernizing the railway line
between Toamasina and the capital, Antananarivo; a second project supporting
the railways' modernization efforts was signed on June 25, 1979. Bank Group
lending for agriculture consists of two livestock development projects, two
irrigation projects and a forestry project. A credit for an agricultural
development project in the Mangoky delta was signed on May 17, 1979. A study
of the problem of agricultural marketing and meat pricing is being executed
with the assistance of an international consultancy firm. Bank Group involve-
ment in the utility sector includes the financing by IDA of part of the cost
of the large Andekaleka hydroelectric project for which substantial bilateral
assistance was secured by the Government. Recently, additional financing
of US$10 million was negotiated to help cover a doubling in cost of civil
works, which will be submitted to the Executive Directors for their consideration
on a date to be determined.



- 6 -
19.       In the past, problems have arisen in the course of execution of
several projects. There were delays in execution, cost overruns and
deficiencies in institution building, especially in agriculture. The
Morondava Project had to be substantially reduced, and the Government has
prepared a plan of action to deal with the remaining problems. The main
aspects of this plan include a redefinition of the implementing agency's
(SODEMO) responsibilities and financial structure, completion and audit of
overdue accounts, and preparation of an investment program and budget for
development of the Morondava area. Implementation of the plan of action
has started and is being closely monitored by the Government and the
Association.  Implementation of the Village Livestock Project has improved
substantially. The first three highway projects have been completed. The
fourth project is still being implemented; the road construction component
is nearly completed and the maintenance studies have been completed.
However, there has been a delay in the start of the recommended training
program for personnel in the Ministry of Public Works on highway main-
tenance. Since training local staff is essential, Government has agreed
that training consultants will be employed and that construction of training
facilities will begin by April 1, 1980.
20.       In our future lending to Madagascar, we expect agriculture to
absorb a larger share of Bank Group lending, in line with Government
strategy stated in its long-term development plan where it is recognized
that expansion of agricultural production is a prerequisite for further
development of the country. A pipeline of possible projects has been
identified in a sector memorandum discussed with the Government in mid-1979;
IDA is assisting the Government in preparing an agricultural credit project,
two rural development projects, a small-scale irrigation project, a third
livestock project and a second forestry project. We will also continue
to support infrastructure development through such projects as the Antananarivo
Water Supply and Sanitation project (recently negotiated), education, urban
development, roads, railways and ports. A petroleum exploration promotion
project was appraised in October 1979, and is expected to be submitted to the
Executive Directors by May 1980. We expect the Government to seek cofinancing
from external lenders for some of the projects, and we intend to assist the
Government in its efforts to mobilize new external sources of financing.
PART III - INDUSTRY AND BANKING
The Industrial Sector
21.       Industrial production at Independence (1960) consisted mainly of
food and mineral processing for local consumption or export. At present,
textiles and food and beverages each account for about one-third of total
industrial output. High costs and local transport difficulties, as well as
the country's location far from export markets, have hindered development of
the industry. Furthermore, industrial enterprises were mostly foreign-owned
and as of 1974, the largest 80 industrial enterprises with an estimated 70 to
75 percent of value added in the sector were controlled by French interests.
Industrial development has, however, been encouraged by the Government and
value added by industry was estimated to have increased by 6 percent per annum
in real terms from 1966 to 1971.



- 7 -
22.       More recently, however, industrial output, which still consists
mainly of textiles and processed foods, has been stagnant or has even de-
clined; although some of the minor industries--chemicals, tobacco manufac-
tures, rubber, paper products--maintained fairly steady growth. The setback
to industrial growth in the years since 1975 was caused by a number of factors:
strained capacity and aging equipment, due partly to declining private invest-
ment, uncertain and inadequate availability of agricultural materials for
processing industries, shortages of imported inputs, and, in some cases, even
low demand. These factors reflect to some extent the effects of the uncertainty
that accompanied the shift to greater Government control from a predominantly
free market system. In particular, private investment in industry was discour-
aged and maintenance of industrial plant suffered.
23.       Recent performance in the sector shows that textiles, paper, cement
and chemical industries worked close to capacity in recent years, while capa-
city utilization in the food industry, construction materials (other than
cement), transport equipment and petroleum products was relatively low. In
many industries, though, capacity has already been considerably reduced by
plant age and condition. Based on some estimates, investments in industry in
real terms in 1976/77 were less than half of those in 1972. Manufacturing
employment in 1976 was estimated at 45,000 and the sector contributed about
14% of GDP.
24.       The still current Investment Code of 1973 provides investment
incentives through tax and other concessions negotiated on a case-by-case
basis. Enterprises that are judged to be of particular national economic
benefit are eligible for the Code's incentives. Purely domestic commercial
enterprises are excluded. The beneficiaries undertake to fulfill a compre-
hensive program, including production targets, prices, training, "malgachi-
zation" and reinvestment of profits. This Code is presently being revised to
provide more explicitly for socialist enterprises, but its main provisions are
likely to remain unchanged.
25.       In May 1978, the Government promulgated the Charter of Socialist
Enterprises, which gave formal ideological and economic meaning to actions
that had been previously decreed piecemeal. It includes among the objectives
of the Government eventual control of the principal means of production and
the nationalization of all mineral wealth. It also advocates reducing
Madagascar's heavy dependence on foreign trade. The Charter clarified the new
system which is designed to permit the state to determine the overall direc-
tion of the economy by means of the enterprises and corporations it controls,
while granting the autonomy necessary for efficient management.
26.       The Charter of Socialist Enterprises defines as socialist enter-
prises those of strategic importance in which the state owns or controls,
directly or through the holdings of other state enterprises, 51 percent or more
of the shares. Each enterprise is to be managed by a committee composed of
representatives of the state, of local institutions (when appropriate), of
workers' representatives, and of partners of the state, meaning private
investors and organizations belonging to other cooperating countries. In
addition, the enterprises will have a managing director nominated by the Prime



-8-
Minister on the advice of the Managing Committee, and bound by a personal
contract to the enterprise. Socialist enterprises are grouped into sectors,
the industrial sectors being textiles and leathers; wood and derivative
products; foodstuffs; mechanical and electrical industries and the chemical
industry.
27.       Since most of the large-scale industrial schemes currently under
Government consideration will require substantial foreign participation--in
terms of financing, management and marketing activities--Madagascar will
undoubtedly need to provide flexibility in the Charter's application. The
Government's main objective is to control the economic decision-making insti-
tutions and define their activities based on national needs and priorities.
In view of Madagascar's current dependence upon imports, policies in the
industrial sector are mainly geared towards building a domestic industry able
to satisfy local needs. Employment creation has priority but is superseded,
when necessary, by the need to develop or create strategically important
industries which may require more capital-intensive involvement.
28.       Small-Scale Industries.  In Madagascar, Small-Scale Industries
(SSI's) are generally defined as enterprises which employ from 5 to 30 workers
and have assets of up to FMG15 million (US$70,000). SSI's are larger than
artisan shops and ownership and management can differ. The sector's main
activities include food processing, printing, transport, and construction.
Production techniques are generally outdated and operators frequently lack
required technical and financial know-how. Constraints to SSI development
are basically the same as those encountered in the artisan sector.
29.       Artisans.  Malagasy legislation defines the artisan as a manual
worker working alone, with members of his family or with a few helpers.
Artisans in Madagascar number about 100,000 i.e., 2.8 percent of the labor
force. The sector reportedly provides a substantial amount of the country's
consumer goods and tools. There is export potential, particularly for basketry
and gemstone crafts. Artisan activity is spread throughout the country but
heavily concentrated around the city of Tananarive. Most private artisan
workshops are either inside or adjacent to the owner's house while cooperatives
are often in makeshift quarters. Most rural artisans perform seasonal work,
from May to September; the rest of the year they are farmers. Constraints to
artisan development include: difficulty in obtaining local and imported raw
materials at reasonable prices; lack of adequate technical and design know-how;
difficult access to both the wider domestic and the export markets; and diffi-
culty in securing loans for expansion and improvement of work facilities and
for working capital. The Government is aware of both the potential of this
subsector and its problems and is presently implementing a National Development
Plan for the sector on which the Bank Group had the opportunity to comment and
offer assistance.
Financial Environment
30.       Until mid-1975, the banking system in Madagascar consisted of the
Central Bank; four commercial banks, partly foreign-owned; and a development
bank (Banque Nationale Malagasy de Developpement, BNM) owned by the Malagasy



- 9 -
Government but with shares held by the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE). In 1975, the Malagasy Government assumed control of the
entire banking sector by purchasing CCCE's participation in BNM, by nationaliz-
ing the four commercial banks and by appointing Malagasy nationals as managers
of the financial institutions. The structure of the banking system, however,
remained unchanged until 1977 when BNM and the four commercial banks merged
into three sectorally-specialized banks: The National Industrial Development
Bank (BNI), the National Bank for Rural Development (BTM), and the National
Bank for Commerce (BFV). Despite their sectoral specialization, the three
banks compete for deposits and extend credit to borrowers outside their
specialized sectors. They often pool resources in consortium loans to meet
corporate financing needs. Assets of the three banks at December 31, 1978
were as follows: BNI: FMG60.9 billion; BTM: FMG45.7 billion; and BFV:
FMG46.8 billion.
31.       Considering the size and stage of development of the economy, the
system of financial institutions is well established and has attained a
certain degree of sophistication. The banking habit is also developing
although the growth of time deposits has been affected by low interest rates.
In Madagascar the elasticity of budget revenues is likely to be small even
over a longer period of time because of the slow rate of growth of the economy,
and interest rate policy should, therefore, be a preferred means of assuring
sufficient funds for investment. Furthermore, financial intermediation
presents certain advantages from the standpoint of overall financial planning,
since it is a more flexible instrument of resource mobilization than fiscal
measures.
32.       Resource allocation, however, is based increasingly on centralized
decisions, with market forces as expressed by interest rate levels and struc-
ture playing a secondary role. Interest levels and structure have hardly
changed since 1974. The Central Bank's rediscount rate for short-term paper
is set at 5.50 percent (except for export bills where the rate is 4 percent).
The rediscount rate for medium-term paper stands at 5 percent, except for
small business credits of less than FMG5 million on which the rate is 3.75
percent for Malagasy nationals.
33.       The Central Bank relies on quantitative and qualitative instruments
for credit control and allocation. Quantitative controls consist of overall
targets on credit for consumption, production and exports and on monthly
rediscount ceilings which are periodically set for each individual bank
based on its liquidity position and expected needs. The qualitative instru-
ments consist of: (1) advance Central Bank authorization for short-term
credit to firms whose total outstanding bank credit exceeds FMG100 million;
and (2) minimum ratios according to which banks are mandatorily required to
devote 6.5 percent of their demand deposits to finance medium-term loans and
15 percent for short-term credit to Malagasy nationals.
34.       On medium-term loans (2-5 years) rediscountable by the Central
Bank, the three banks charge to all except small-scale enterprises rates
which vary between 6.25 and 7.25 percent, depending upon the risk associated



- 10 -
with the specific lending operation. Loans to small-scale enterprises vary
between 5 and 5.75 percent. The rate on consumer and housing loans is 7.50
percent. Interest rates on deposits range from 0.75 percent to 7.5 percent,
depending upon maturity and deposit size. The overall interest rate structure
in Madagascar is low, particularly when compared with inflation, which averaged
over 7 percent during the past three years and is estimated to have exceeded
10 percent in 1978. The Government is reviewing its interest rate structure.
Socialist and agricultural enterprises will, however, probably continue to be
favored in resource allocation to stimulate their development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The project proposal was prepared by the Government and the
Bankin'ny Indostria (BNI), with assistance from the IDA appraisal mission.
The project was appraised in November 1978. Negotiations were held
in Washington from October 30 - November 2, 1979. The Government delegation
was led by Mr. Leon Rajaobelina, Governor of the Central Bank and BNI was
represented by its General Manager, Mr. Alfred Rakotonjanahary. The main
features of the Project are outlined in the Credit and Project Summary and
the Supplemental Project Data Sheet of this report. A report entitled
"Madagascar: Staff Appraisal Report of a First IDA Credit, Bankin'ny
Indostria (BNI)", Report No. 2456a-MAG, dated January 10, 1980, is being
circulated separately.
Background
36.       As indicated above, the Bankin'ny Indostria (BNI) was created
in January 1977. It took over the term loans and equity portfolio of the
former Banque Nationale Malagasy de Developpement (BNM) in the industrial
sector and assumed the industrial loan portfolio of the former Banque pour le
Commerce et l'Industrie de Madagascar (BCIM), a commercial bank nation-
alized in 1976. BNI is primarily responsible for promoting industry and
handicraft development through short, medium and long-term loans and equity
investments. It also finances individual and collective housing and provides
loans for household equipment.
Project Objectives and Description
37.       The main objectives of the credit are to support the country's
growing industrial sector and BNI's crucial role by providing the foreign
exchange needed for capital investment and the technical assistance needed
for the training of the staff, the institutionalization of its procedures and
the setting up of a Promotion Department. The institution-building impact of
the proposed credit should thus have a significant impact on the sector as
it would strengthen BNI, the main institution responsible for industrial
financing in the country. Another objective of the credit will be to
provide--on a pilot basis--financial assistance to artisan/small-scale
enterprises.



- 11 -
38.       The proposed project would have the following five compon-
ents:
(a) Medium and Large Project Financing. US$4.0
million would be allocated to medium industrial,
agroindustrial, and tourism projects.
(b) Artisan/SSE Financing. US$0.5 million would
be allocated to small-scale industrial enter-
prises, including transport, defined as those
with fixed assets below FMG15 million (about
US$70,000) and artisan enterprises.
(c) Feasibility Studies. US$0.3 million would
be allocated to financing feasibility studies
for industrial and tourism projects selected
by BNI.
(d) Training of BNI's Staff. US$0.1 million would
go to finance the training of BNI's staff speci-
fically in project promotion and appraisal.
(e) Technical Assistance. US$0.1 million would be
allocated to the financing of up to two man-
years of foreign experts' services to set up
BNI's Promotion Department and improve its Project
Preparation Department.
39.       Projects under study at the end of 1978 consisted of 18
industrial projects totalling more than FMG25 billion (US$119 million) in
investments, of which more than FMG17 billion (US$81 million) are in foreign
exchange, and requiring possible term/equity financing from BNI of about
FMG6.9 billion (US$33 million)--close to 28 percent of total cost. Agro-
industry is by far the leading sector, followed by textiles and chemicals.
The Government holds controlling interest in the majority of these projects
but more than half of them are joint ventures with foreign partners. As in
the past, half of the project proposals are new and the rest are extensions
and modernizations of existing units. They are regionally well-distributed.
40.       The US$0.5 million artisan/SSE component would be a pilot effort
and would eventually complement the technical assistance to be offered to
artisans under the National Artisan Development Plan. Financing would,
however, be available to all artisans regardless of whether or not they are
part of the National Plan. At present more than half of SSE's are concen-
trated in the Province of Tananarive, but there appears to be some potential
for further SSE development in the context of a revival of the country's
private sector. BNI will use a simplified appraisal format satisfactory to
IDA for these projects. It has been agreed that IDA will review extensively
the first five projects submitted under this component to ensure the adequacy
of BNI's appraisal, which will be monitored thereafter by IDA supervision
missions   (Section 2.02(b), draft Development Credit Agreement).



- 12 -
41.       The component for feasibility studies would supplement BNI's
efforts to set up or improve its Promotion and Project Preparation Depart-
ments. This should thus benefit both BNI and the overall industrial sector
(Section 3.01(ii) and (iv), draft Development Credit Agreement and
Section 2.10, draft Project Agreement). Consultants for these studies
would be chosen by BNI from among qualified consultants and employed under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section 2.09, draft
Project Agreement). BNI shall complete these studies by December 31, 1982
(Section 2.10, draft Project Agreement).
Management and Organization
42.       BNI is a socialist enterprise with a share capital of FMG2 billion
which is held by the State (85%), the Central Bank (10%) and the Social
Security Fund (5%). BNI's Board is chaired by the Minister of Finance and
Planning and consists of the General Managers of the Central Bank, the
Finance Ministry and the former General Manager of the Ministry of Economy
and Commerce. According to the Charter of Socialist Enterprises (ref para-
graph 26), BNI's board may be modified to include representatives of BNI
staff and management. The Board meets on an ad hoc basis to examine projects
submitted by BNI's management or to discuss policy matters. They play an
effective role in supporting and guiding BNI management. BNI's General
Manager is authorized to approve without Board consultation secured loans
up to FMG100 million, unsecured loans up to FMG20 million and equity invest-
ments up to FMG20 million.
43.       BNI is headed by a Malagasy, the former General Manager of the
BNM, assisted by managers formerly with BNM and BCIM. BNI management
is competent, experienced, and dynamic. BNI's organization reflects its
dual role as a development and a commercial bank and is adequate for the
institution. However, BNI's technical capabilities for project preparation
and appraisal need to be strengthened. Management is aware of these
deficiencies and is correcting them through staff recruitment and training.
Policies and Procedures
44.       Present policies on industrial medium and long-term loans are
adequate, but some matters such as exchange risk on foreign borrowing,
overall and individual project exposure and project selection require
clarification. During negotiations, a draft General Policy Statement or
Rules of Operation, as BNI calls them, was agreed with BNI management and
adopted by BNI's Board on December 14, 1979. BNI shall exchange views
with the Association on any proposal to modify its Statutes or Rules of
Operation (Section 2.08, draft Project Agreement).
45.       Essentially, BNI's strategy is to assist the Government in
developing Madagascar's industrial base. In that role BNI is already
acting as a financial adviser to Government and is expected to be more
active in industrial project promotion. BNI management is preparing a
strategy paper to be cleared with the responsible Ministries (Finance and
Planning, Economy and Commerce). BNI's procedures for project appraisal



- 13 -
and follow-up needed improvement. A more comprehensive format for appraisal
reports and new supervision policies and procedures were reviewed during
negotiations and found satisfactory. BNI's present procurement practices are
adequate and will be strengthened by the projected expansion of its technical
staff. Disbursement procedures are adequate.
Operations
46.       As of December 31, 1977, well over half of BNI's term portfolio of
FMG8.1 billion was in industrial projects, 15 percent in housing, 10 percent
in public works, 6 percent in transportation and small percentages in tourism
and agriculture. Equity investments of FMG2.4 billion were almost entirely in
the industrial sector. The industrial portfolio is well diversified: textiles
and agro-industries, wood-working, construction materials, and chemicals and
metal-working. The portfolio is well-distributed geographically with 60
percent outside Tananarive. While public enterprises account for 65 percent
of the total portfolio, private enterprises account for 60 percent--with
substantial foreign participation--of the equity portfolio. During 1977 term
credit approvals totalled only FMGO.4 billion and equity investments FMGO.2
billion. However, operations increased substantially in 1978, when term
loans totalling FMG2.9 billion and equity investments amounting to FMG500
million were approved. At September 30, 1979, FMG1.8 billion in term loans
and equity investments of FMG500 million had been approved. Manufacturing
operations represented 70 percent of 1978 approvals and 53 percent of approvals
as of September 30, 1979.
Financial Position
47.       In BNI's summarized balance sheet of for 1977-79, assets at
9/30/79 totalled FMG75.5 billion, of which the loan portfolio represented
FMG52.9 billion and the equity portfolio FMG3.7 billion. Capital, reserves
and surplus totalled FMG7.2 billion and term borrowings FMG3.6 billion.
BNI's debt/equity ratio is thus 0.5:1, a rather low proportion for a
combined commercial and development bank, allowing for substantial addi-
tional borrowing capacity. Accounts at September 30, 1979 confirm that,
overall, BNI's financial position is sound.
48.       Total assets are projected to reach about FMG92 billion (US$438
million) by 1982 from the FMG56 billion (US$267 million) at end 1977 while its
finances would remain sound. BNI would maintain a satisfactory liquidity
position of better than 1:1 and keep its conventional debt to equity ratio
constant around 3:1 -- even after practically doubling its outstanding term
borrowings throughout the period. BNI is also expected to remain profitable.
Administrative expenses are well controlled and likely to be maintained at a
reasonable level. Gross profits are expected to be rather high (from 3.7
percent of average total assets in 1978 to 4.2 percent in 1982). At the same
time, provision will be made to cover risks in the portfolio -- representing
3.3 percent of total portfolio at the end of the period -- while dividends
could continue to be distributed at the 1977 level (42 percent of net profit),
representing a substantial return on average equity of 8.9 percent in 1979 to
9.9 percent in 1982.



- 14 -
49.      Resource Requirements.  BNI's resource requirements from September
1979 to December 1981 are expected to amount to FMG6 billion (US$29.0 million),
of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at FMG3.8 billion (US$18
million). BNI has started negotiations with some foreign financial institu-
tions and expects to sign a FMG1.0 billion (US$4.8 million) tied line of credit
from the Italian Government and to renegotiate with KfW an additional line of
credit of FMG300 million (US$1.4 million) to be available by 1980. In addition,
BNI's term operations could continue being refinanced on a case-by-case basis
by the Central Bank and also by CCCE up to about FMG1.0 billion (US$4.8 million).
The proposed IDA credit would cover about 24% of BNI's foreign exchange require-
ments or 15% of total resource requirements between September 1979 and December
1981.
Terms and Conditions
50.       The proposed first line of credit to BNI would carry the following
terms and conditions:
(a) Limit per Project. To avoid the line of credit being used
for a few large projects, the IDA funds would be used only
to finance projects with total costs up to FMG500 million
(US$2.4 million) and the maximum credit granted by BNI to
a single project out of the IDA credit would be limited
to US$750,000 (Section 2.01(b), draft Project Agreement).
These limitations are in line with BNI's definition of
medium size enterprises and would, on the average, concen-
trate IDA financing on projects with total costs between
FMG300 million and FMG450 million (US$1.4 million-US$2.1
million).
(b) Onlending Rate. To provide BNI with a 1% spread on the IDA
funds, the credit will be onlent by the Government to BNI
at 7.5% with a 0.75% commitment fee on the undisbursed
amount except for the technical assistance/training/feasibility
studies component of US$0.5 million which would be passed on by
the Government to BNI at the IDA service charge (Section 3.01(b),
draft Development Credit Agreement). The onlending rate by BNI
would be a minimum of 8.5% to its IDA-financed clients (Section
2.01(b), draft Project Agreement). There would be a flexible
amortization schedule conforming to the aggregate amortization
schedule of BNI's subloans, none of which should in principle
exceed a maximum of 15 years, for the US$4.0 million component
to finance medium/large scale industrial enterprises. The
US$0.5 million to finance artisans/SSE projects and the



- 15 -
US$0.5 million technical assistance component would be repaid
under fixed amortization schedules, to be set up in the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be concluded between the Govern-
ment and BNI.
(c) Foreign Exchange Risk. The foreign exchange risk would be
passed on to all medium and large-scale borrowers. For small-
scale enterprises (defined as those with fixed assets below
FMG15 million or about US$70,000), the Government would carry
the foreign exchange risk at a 1% fee on the outstanding balance
(Section 3.05(b), draft Project Agreement and Section 3.03, draft
Development Credit Agreement).
(d)  Economic Analysis of Subprojects.  BNI would provide a complete
economic analysis, including calculation of the internal finan-
cial rate of return on all medium/large scale industrial sub-
projects submitted to IDA for financing (Section 2.02(b)(ii), draft
Project Agreement). Sub-loans and investments shall be restricted
to financing investment projects which, except for small-scale
investment projects, will show an economic rate of return of at
least 10 percent or such lower rate as the Association may accept
(Section 2.01(b), draft Project Agreement). The free limit
for projects in all sectors should be US$150,000 and the aggregate
free limit US$1.5 million (Section 2.02(b), draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Reporting and Audit
51.       BNI would be required to submit quarterly reports which would in-
clude financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears and notes
on subprojects encountering serious operational difficulties. BNI would also
be required to submit annual audit reports (in accordance with IDA guidelines
for audits of DFCs) prepared by qualified accountants acceptable to IDA,
along with BNI's annual report.
52.       In the past BNI accounts were reviewed by external accountants
("commissaires aux comptes") but were not audited. BNI management has agreed
that in the future, the accounts would be audited annually by a qualified CPA
firm (Section 3.02, draft Project Agreement). BNI's audited accounts for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 1978 have been submitted to IDA.
Procurement and Disbursement
53.       Procurement for the subprojects financed under the credit would be
in accordance with the standard IDA practice for development banks. The
proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed on BNI subloans as follows:
100% of the foreign cost of imported goods or services for eligible subprojects;
85% of the cost of previously imported equipment which is purchased locally
for the subprojects; 70% of the local cost of equipment substantially produced
in Madagascar from previously imported components or raw materials; 55% of
the cost of construction works included in subprojects and carried out by
national contractors; and 100% of foreign expenditures or 80% of local



- 16 -
expenditures for experts and consultants' services and training of BNI's
staff (Section 2.02(a) and (f), draft Development Credit Agreement). The
credit component is expected to be fully committed by December 1981 and to be
fully disbursed by March 1984.
Benefits and Risks
54.       While the new Government initially showed relatively little interest
in the industrial sector, its attitude has recently changed. The search for
foreign partners to launch several industrial projects and Government's
request for Bank Group assistance to the sector are examples. An IDA credit
would permit the Bank Group to participate in the development of an important
part of Madagascar's economy. The credit would finance projects requiring
a total investment of about FMG25 billion and create about 6000 jobs even
with the pessimistic assumption that past cost per job of about $20,000
is maintained. Employment generation will be considerably larger as BNI
moves increasingly into project promotion, mostly SSEs, and if artisan fi-
nancing is taken into consideration.
55.       Despite the generally positive attitude of the Government, there
still remain some uncertainties about how the sector will evolve in the
future, particularly in the context of transition toward a system of socialist
enterprises. This may create a climate not conducive to private investment,
particularly foreign. Although this could result in somewhat reduced indus-
trial growth, it should not materially affect utilization of the proposed
credit as: (i) its amount is small in comparison with BNI's expected needs;
and, (ii) private investment has been given little weight in evaluating BNI's
financial needs in the near future. These risks, though, should not detract
from the validity of the main objectives of the proposed credit, particularly
the strengthening of BNI and IDA support of the overall industrial sector
and the artisan/SSE activities.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of Madagascar and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and the National Industrial Development Bank, and the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Association are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
57.       An additional condition of effectiveness is that the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and BNI shall have been signed (Section 5.01,
draft Development Credit Agreement).



- 17 -
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed IDA Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Credit No. 322-MAG:      Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
US$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: April 30, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
Initially, the project was to rehabilitate and extend, in the
Morondava area, existing irrigation systems, and develop 9,300 ha (4,700 ha
for smallholder rice, 2,700 ha for a tobacco state farm and 1,900 ha for a
cotton state farm); village development, roads, schools and health facilities
were included. The project as revised and substantially reduced in February
1976 will complete major civil works envisaged at appraisal, implement on-
farm development works on 2,500 ha of rice areas, establish an applied
research station, and provide agricultural support services, roads and health
facilities.
Major civil works (including construction of a diversion weir at
Dabara, rehabilitation of the Dabara Canal and the North Canal, construction
of secondary irrigation and drainage canals, and construction of the 8.1 km
road between Mahabo and Ankilivalo) are almost completed and work has been
satisfactory. However, SODEMO, the agency responsible for on-farm development
and agricultural services, faces serious management and financial problems and
as a result, on-farm development and construction works have lagged behind
schedule and agricultural production is poorly organized, with a small area
cultivated and very low yields. The Government and IDA have agreed on a plan
of action to clarify SODEMO's responsibilities and financial plan and to
improve overall management, but this will require careful monitoring in the
coming months. The closing date was recently extended to allow SODEMO time to
carry out the project as it has been revised and to permit land development,
which has just begun.
Credit No. 506-MAG:      Village Livestock and Rural Development Project:
US$9.6 million credit of August 21, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: June 17, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project encountered serious problems in the three years follow-
ing credit signature, and, principally because of legal and organizational
difficulties, little progress was made. Following significant changes in
institutional and management arrangements, the Credit Agreement was exten-
sively amended; the Amended Agreement became effective September 1, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Page 3
The project's situation is much improved. FAFIFAMA, the principal
project implementing agency, is now well-established and operational, with
a full staff complement. Implementation of the project's most important
component - the development of veterinary and livestock services for village
producers - is proceeding well. Pasture improvement experiments are being
undertaken. Schools and health centers are being constructed, and the Ministry
of Health is preparing a utilization plan for the health centers. The develop-
ment of water points and road improvement continue satisfactorily. Cooperation
with fokonolona institutions in all aspects of FAFIFAMA's work is excellent.
In the middle west, OMBY continues to provide machine services to villages
surrounding the ranches established under the IBRD-financed Beef Cattle
Development Project. The pilot pig program and ODEMO cattle share fattening
programs have barely begun, with action limited to construction of some
buildings. Financing and administration arrangements have been worked out
however, and the share fattening program should get underway shortly. The pig
program would be launched in early 1980 with cooperatives and on the basis of
breeding pigs to be imported. The study of cattle marketing and meat prices
has been completed and is being reviewed; so are the evaluation of the current
project and the preparation report of the second phase.
Loan No. 1065-MAG:       Mangoro Forestry Project; US$6.75 million loan and
Credit No. 525-MAG       US$6.75 million credit both of December 23, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: July 8, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31. 1980
The project assists in the planting of 35,000 ha of pine plantations
as part of an overall planting program of 96,000 ha, which it is proposed will
eventually supply a future pulp mill to provide pulp for export. The planting
program is progressing according to the schedule and cost estimates are
in line with forecasts, despite a reorganization of the project which entails
more building and infrastructure than originally estimated, and the need for
more intensive soil preparation than foreseen at appraisal. Technical diffi-
culties which occurred at the early stages of the project have been resolved.
Credit No. 641-MAG:      Fourth Highways Project; US$22.0 million credit of
June 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 19,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government in the construction of two major
roads with a view to reducing transport costs and providing access to areas
with a high agricultural potential. It also includes training and strengthen-
ing of the country's road maintenance organization. Project implementation
is satisfactory. However, start of the training program for personnel in the
Ministry of Public Works on highway maintenance has been delayed.
Credit No. 663-MAG:      Second Education Project; US$14.0 million credit of
December 10, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 15,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to assist the Government in decentralizing
educational control and to improve the quality of basic education. It in-
cludes five Regional Education Centres and vehicles for school inspectorate,
one Teaching Materials Production Centre and funds for textbook development,
technical assistance and fellowships.

Architectural design work on all project institutions is now com-
plete. Detailed operational planning for the Teaching Materials Production
Centre is being carried out. The two key technical advisors for this Centre,
provided by ORT (Organisation for Rehabilitation through Training) arrived in
Madagascar during September 1977. Architectural work has generally been well
executed although this has taken much longer than expected. Work on the major
project components, the Regional Education Centres, was completed about 14
months behind the appraisal schedule, although with ORT assistance, the plan-
ning schedule for the Teaching Materials Production Centre has been maintained.
The project is presently about one year behind schedule due to cum-
bersome Government approval/decision procedures, and the Government's recent
proposals for the "socialisation" of the construction industry has introduced
a further element of uncertainty which may adversely affect project imple-
mentation. Serious delays have also been encountered on: the preparation
of an educational sector survey; the establishment of task forces for educa-
tion evaluation; proposals for decentralization of education; and textbook
production.
Norway requested 50 percent participation in the project, and an
agreement to that effect was signed on December 16, 1977. The US$7.0 million
of IDA monies thus saved was used for other projects in Madagascar.
Credit No. 817-MAG:      Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project; US$33.0 million
credit of June 19, 1978; Terminal Date of Effec-
tiveness: May 30, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project would meet the growth in electricity demand until
1992 in the Antananarivo area and provide for the strengthening of JIRAMA,
Madagascar's national electricity and water corporation. It includes a
concrete diversion dam and an intake structure; a 4-km tunnel, underground
power house, tailrace and access tunnels; two turbines and two generators;
electrical and mechanical equipment; a transmission line to Antananarivo;
engineering services; preliminary investigation and design for a storage
reservoir; and technical assistance and training for JIRAMA Staff.
Contracts have been awarded for the civil works and all major
equipment and supplies. Total project costs are about 20% higher than
estimated at appraisal. However, even at the higher cost, the Project is
still the least cost solution for the supply of power in Madagascar. A
supplementary credit of US$10 million was negotiated in November 1980, and
will be distributed to the Executive Directors for their consideration on a
date to be determined.

Credit No. 881-MAG:       Mangoky Agricultural Development Project;
US$12.0 million credit of March 6, 1979;
Terminal Date of Effectiveness: April 1, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The Project would support the development of about 3,700 ha for
production of rice and cotton, to be farmed by about 3,200 families. It would
complete an irrigation system serving about 10,000 ha in the Lower Mangoky
Valley which has been under development since the early 1960s. These invest-
ments are based on a long-term master plan for the region which aims ultimately
to bring about 100,000 ha of land into production. The Project will be imple-
mented over a five-year period and would comprise: development of irrigation
and drainage networks, and road infrastructure for 3,300 ha including pro-
duction of concrete canal segments; improvement of water supply for about 400
ha of traditional rice fields; consultant services for design and supervision;
applied agricultural research; social infrastructure; training and project
preparation for agriculture and rural development projects. IFAD is financing
for completion of the documentation.
The terminal date of effectiveness was extended to April 1,
1980 to enable the Borrower to meet effectiveness conditions.
Credit No. 938-MAG:       Fifth Highway Project; US$24.0 million credit of
June 21, 1979; Terminal Date of Effectiveness:
April 1, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The Project would prevent further deterioration of the paved high-
way network, thus reducing transport cost and avoiding early and costly
reconstruction works. It would also increase the maintenance capacity of
the Ministry of Public Works and provide for an all-weather road connection
between the regional district of Antomboka and the capital, Antananarivo.
Co-financing will be provided by a European Economic Community Special Action
Account credit of US$10 million. The Credit was signed on July 30, 1979.
The terminal date of effectiveness was extended to April 1, 1980 to allow
receipt of the legal opinion.
Credit No. 903-MAG:       Second Railways Project; US$13.0 million credit of
May 8, 1979; Terminal Date of Effectiveness:
April 1, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The objectives of the Project are to help RNCFM to renew and
modernize its facilities, improve the reliability and efficiency of its
operations and improve its financial management and accounting methods.
The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) provided US$20.5
million in cofinancing.
The terminal date of effectiveness was extended to April 1,
1980 to allow for signature of the subsidiary loan agreement between the
borrower and the Railways (RNCFM).
