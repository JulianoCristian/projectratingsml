REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE PANMA
WITH THE GUARANZTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PAIAMA
FOR A SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP) with the guarantee of the Republic
of Panama for the equivalent of US$7.5 million to help finance a fisheries
project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3-1/2 years of
grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the country in September/October 1975.
An "Updating Report on the Economy of Panama" (1066a-PAN) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 17, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
3.        In the 1960's, the Panamanian economy expanded rapidly with limited
Government participation and an efficient use of investment. World trade
flourished during that decade and Panama was able to benefit from its unique
geographic location owing to liberal trade legislation, free use of the United
States dollar as the domestic currency, and the Colon Free Zone. The domestic
market offered opportunities for small-scale industrialization and there still
was much accessible virgin land that could be brought under production. The
situation changed in the present decade. There are fewer opportunities for
import-substitution. Further expansion of agriculture requires more capital
and specialized manpower, whether to improve yields and cropping patterns or
to extend the frontier to new, less accessible lands. The recession which
affected world trade in 1974-75 lowered the growth of the export oriented
service sector, and the recovery since then has been slow, owing in part to
changing trade patterns as a consequence of the reopening of the Suez Canal.
Panama's open economy was also severely hit by the sharp rise in the cost of
imports, particularly fuels. Net of exports of refined petroleum products,
Panama's petroleum import bill rose from 1 percent of GDP in 1973 to 3 percent
in 1975, and from 4.2 percent of non-petroleum imports to 14.1 percent in the
same period. Finally, these unfavorable developments were compounded by the
end of a private construction boom in high income housing and office buildings,
and by a severe drought in 1976. As a result, the rate of GDP growth, which
had averaged 8 percent per year in 1959-71, has been falling steadily to 1.7
percent in 1975 and to an estimated 1.0 percent in 1976. This prolonged
slowdown is particularly serious because population is growing at an annual
rate above 3 percent. Although the recorded rate of open unemployment has
increased only from 6.8 percent of the labor force in 1972 to 7.2 percent in
1976, unofficial estimates of unemployment which include workers who abandoned
the search for a job suggest an increase from 7.5 percent in 1972 to 12.9
percent in March 1976.

4.        The retrenchment of private investment which occurred in 1974-76
(not only in construction) has reflected, in addition to a response to the
recession, concern regarding the implementation of the 1972 Labor Code. Some
provisions of the Labor Code were believed to have led to increased absenteeism
and reduced productivity. Private investment has also been held back by what
was perceived to be slow progress in the negotiations with the United States
on a new Panama Canal Treaty. On balance, private investment fell from 21.8
percent of GDP in 1971 to 16.1 percent in 1975, and is estimated to have
dropped further to 11.3 percent in 1976.
5.        The Government has responded to the slackening of economic growth
by formulating a short-term program to reactivate the economy and a longer
term development strategy, embodied in the draft National Development Plan,
1976-80. The Government's short-term program includes (a) incentives equiv-
alent to 20 percent of value added for non-traditional exports; (b) a scheme
to guarantee commercial bank mortgage loans for low and middle-income housing
and a facility to rediscount these loans after eight years; (c) lowering of
commercial banks' capital and reserve requirements; (d) fiscal incentives to
promote investment, including accelerated depreciation, investment credits and
income tax exoneration for reinvested corporate profits; and (e) special
income tax deductions for firms hiring additional low-income workers. The
Government has recently modified the Labor Code, making its provisions more
flexible. Collective wage contracts have been extended for two years; during
this period there are to be no collective demands for new benefits and labor
conflicts will be resolved through compulsory arbitration.
6.        The Government has offset the drop in private investment by in-
creasing public investment sharply. Aggregate investment fluctuated around 28
percent of GDP during 1971-76 in spite of the sharp drop in private investment,
as public investment increased from 6 percent of GDP in 1971 to 11.9 percent
in 1975 and an estimated 16.9 percent of GDP in 1976. The volume of public
investment planned for the rest of the decade is twice as large in constant
terms as in the 1971-75 period. It includes a number of large projects in
infrastructure and in directly productive investment aimed at taking advan-
tage of the country's potential for providing services to international trade
-- including expansion of the successful industrial and commercial complex in
the Colon Free Zone -- and at developing more intensively the country's
natural resources, including large copper deposits, the hydroelectric poten-
tial, and agriculture. The program should also open up new opportunities for
the private sector and improve income distribution further through better
infrastructure and social services for the lower income groups and through
complementary measures to increase the productivity of small-scale farmers.
The priorities of the public investment program are sound, but the timing of
outlays may have to be stretched out to allow for administrative and financial
constraints.
7.        A major expansion in social and economic programs began in 1968, and
total public sector outlays have risen steadily since then. The authorities
have made efforts to raise the level of public sector savings to finance these



-3-
programs. Several new taxes were adopted during the past few years, tax
administration improved and the growth of current outlays was restrained.
Nonetheless, public savings have not kept pace with investment outlays, and
the Government has relied increasingly on external borrowing, much of it from
commercial banks. In 1976, owing to a recession-induced B/. 32 million short-
fall in tax revenues, and although current outlays were held B/. 10 million
below budgeted levels, the Central Government had a B/. 21 million current
account deficit. This, together with higher than estimated capital transfers
from the Central Government to public sector enterprises, resulted in sub-
stantial new borrowing. As of December 1976, the disbursed external public
debt amounted to US$854 million, almost four times more than five years
earlier. Panama has negotiated nine stand-by arrangements with the IMF. The
last one expired in November 1976. A new stand-by arrangement is being
negotiated and is expected to be finalized shortly.
8.        As a result of the high level of external debt and of the large
proportion of private bank credits (69 percent of total public debt in 1976),
the debt service obligations of the public sector have increased at a faster
rate than public savings. (The conventional ratio of debt service to export
earnings is not a meaningful indicator of creditworthiness in Panama where the
US dollar is the domestic currency.) The Government has been readily able to
refinance its commercial debt, but realizes that measures to ensure that
public savings grow faster than debt service obligations are required to
strengthen the public sector's creditworthiness. It has recently taken further
important steps to strengthen the Central Government revenue structure by
making it more responsive to economic growth; this includes the introduction
of a 5 percent value-added sales tax, increased taxes on beer, cigarettes,
liquor, gasoline, hotel services and on dividends. Tax administration has
been tightened and the growth of current outlays has been restrained. Public
sector consumption expenditures dropped from 14.8 percent of GDP in 1972 to
12.5 percent in 1975. Furthermore, electric power rates were modified as of
January 1, 1977, to yield a 12.5 percent increase in revenues and further
increases are taking place. Telephone rates have been doubled and water rates
raised by 30 percent. These increases are expected to reduce the need for
Central Government transfers to help finance the investment programs of the
utilities. Finally, the Government intends to carry out the public investment
program with flexibility and to adapt the timing of individual projects to
changes in its financial position.
9.        Although in recent years economic growth has been disappointingly
low, the Government has taken measures to minimize the adverse effects of the
recession on the lower income strata of the population. More than most Latin
American countries, it has addressed social ills that had been neglected for
decades and has succeeded in extending health and education services to the
rural population. In the period 1960-75, infant mortality was reduced from 58
to 34 per thousand, life expectancy at birth increased from 60.9 to 66.5
years, the primary school enrollment ratio rose by 20 percent and the income
share of the poorest 40 percent of the population rose from 13.4 to 15.2 per-
cent. As noted earlier, the authorities have compensated for the decline in



-4 -
private investment and have formulated an ambitious investment program. How-
ever, the Government's ability to pursue anticyclical policies is limited
by the need for fiscal prudence. In this respect, serious efforts have been
made to raise public sector savings at a time when both recession and infla-
tion add to the pressures to spend, and make tax and utility rate increases
difficult. Panama is creditworthy for lending on conventional terms provided
that the authorities continue to take measures required to ensure that the
growth of public borrowing remains manageable. In view of the high level and
relatively unfavorable structure of the public sector debt, Panama should make
a special effort to obtain external loans on better than commercial terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       The Bank has to date made twelve loans to Panama totalling US$154
million. Of these, five loans for US$18 million, are fully disbursed (two
for roads totalling US$13 million; two for agriculture totalling US$1
million, and one for power for US$4 million). Ongoing projects include a
power generation project for which the Bank lent US$42 million in 1970; an
airport project (Tocumen International Airport) for which the Bank lent
US$20 million, and a fisheries credit project for which the 3ank lent US$3.4
million, both in 1971; a livestock credit project for which the Bank made a
US$4.7 million loan and a power transmission project for which the Bank made
a US$30 million loan both in 1973; a fishing port project for which the Bank
made a US$24 million loan in 1975; and a US$12 million loan for a water supply
project in 1976. Documents regarding a proposed loan of US$8.0 million to
finance a livestock project were distributed for consideration by the Executive
Directors. Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory, although substantial delays and cost overruns have occurred
particularly with respect to the airport and power projects. While the major
causes of delay have been overcome, the cost overruns created financial
problems in the case of IRHE, the power company. The Government and IRHE have
initiated a program of substantial tariff increases which will improve IRHE's
financial position.
11.       IFC has made one investment in Panama:   a commitment in 1971 to
acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero S.A.
and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million to build a new international
hotel. This project was satisfactorily completed and the hotel is open for
business. Annex II contains a Summary Statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of January 31, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's devel-
opment strategy, particularly as regards the development of Panama's dynamic
service industries and the diversification of production and exports. Specif-
ically, the Bank's assistance is oriented towards those sectors in which it
can make a special contribution in terms of strengthening policies and insti-
tutions, removing infrastructure bottlenecks and utilizing the country's
natural resources. Lending for the livestock and fisheries projects aims



primarily at assisting the Government in meeting its objective of diversifying
production and exports. The La Fortuna hydroelectric project, to be submitted
for consideration of the Executive Directors by mid-1977, is a fundamental
component of the country's public investment program, and will contribute to
reducing Panama's heavy dependence on thermal generation. Through the pro-
posed loan for power development, the Bank will continue to assist the power
company in strengthening its organization, taxed by the rapid expansion of
services. In addition, the Bank is working with the Government on a project
designed to improve highway maintenance operations and administration. We
also expect to continue supporting the government's program of expanding the
water supply and sewerage facilities in the fast-growing urban areas.
13.       The principal sources of official external financing to Panama in
the past are summarized as follows:

/1   Excluding $0.5 million which was cancelled.
/2   Including a $60 million grant from the U.S. Government for
completion of the Darien Gap portion of the Pan-American Highway.
14.       Both USAID and IDB have lent heavily for agriculture and for social
services. This pattern is likely to persist as the Government prefers bor-
rowing on highly concessionary terms for those sectors, while utilizing assist-
ance received on harder terms for projects which are expected to result in
more immediate economic benefits. The IDB is also financing road construction,
and tourism. In addition, it is considering assistance, in cooperation with
the Bank, to finance Panama's hydroelectric power expansion program.



- 6 -
15.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly guaranteed external debt out-
standing and disbursed was 10.2 percent at the end of 1976 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was 6.2 percent. Because of the high
levels of borrowing from commercial banks programmed by the Government, these
percentages are expected to drop by 1980 to 7.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively.
PART III - FISHERIES
The Fisheries Industry
16.       Panama's access to fishing grounds in both the Pacific Ocean and the
Caribbean Sea has allowed the development of a fishing industry and has given
it advantages in serving the international tuna fleets that fish off the
Pacific coast. On the Pacific side of Panama's coastline of 1,780 km, the
waters are rich in fish resources, especially in the Gulf of Panama where
several rivers deposit alluvia and where seasonal upwellings form a layer of
mud along the coast, creating a favorable habitat for shrimp. The Caribbean
side (880 km of coastline) is rather poor in fish resources. The main
fisheries activities are shrimp trawling, reduction to fishmeal of anchovy and
herring, coastal fishing for the local market and servicing of the interna-
tional tuna fleet, which may fish in the eastern Pacific (under international
regulations) only in the first quarter of each year. Tuna boats increasingly
trans-ship their catch in Panama to avoid time consuming trips back to their
home ports.
17.       The fisheries industry accounts for about 4 percent of GDP and
employs some 4,600 people, or 1 percent of the economically active population.
It began in the early 1950's and has grown steadily since then. It is an
important source of foreign exchange, earning about US$21 million annually in
the 1973/75 period. The shrimp industry alone employs more than 1,200 people
and accounts for over 80 percent of fisheries exports. In 1975, fish and
shrimp exports ranked third in merchandise exports, after bananas and sugar,
and accounted for 15.2 percent of such exports. Since 1964, Panama's shrimp
has been exported exclusively to the U.S. On the other hand, Panama also
imports fish, mainly salted cod, canned sardines and tuna; these imports
averaged US$1.7 million annually over the 1971/74 period and rose to US$3.0
million in 1975.
18.       Notwithstanding the industry's growth in the last two decades, it
has not yet realized its full potential as an earner of foreign exchange or
as a source of food for domestic consumption. The main obstacles to its past
growth have been: (1) lack of adequate port facilities; (2) overexploitation
of shrimp resources; (3) obsolescence of the local fishing fleet; (4) lack of
a detailed inventory of fish resources, and (5) inadequate local marketing
facilities, which explains the relatively low per capita consumption of fish
(about 3.2 kg per annum).



-7-
Government Role
19.       Development of fisheries is one of the priorities of the 1976-80
National Development Plan which aims at expanding fisheries exports by 20
percent by 1978; increasing the per capita consumption of fish for nutritional
purposes; improving the level of employment in the sector and protecting
marine resources by restraining exploitation. In addition, the Government is
seeking to modernize the fishing fleet, improve port facilities and diversify
fishing activities. With the help of FAO/UNDP, the Government will begin a
research program in 1978 to identify further fisheries resources and to
introduce improved fishing techniques.
20.       A number of government agencies are involved in the fisheries
sector, the most important being the Directorate General of Marine Resources
(DMR) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Directorate administers
fishing laws; issues licences; collects, analyzes and publishes fisheries
statistics and, in general is responsible for development of the sector. It
is also entrusted with the conservation of marine resources. The Ministry of
Agricultural Development (MIDA) is responsible for inland fisheries and, with
the DMR, for domestic fish marketing and for fisheries cooperatives. Other
ministries connected with the sector are the Treasury, which registers ships,
issues sailing permits, inspects vessels, their captains and mechanics and is
responsible for external trade; the Ministry of Health which supervises
sanitary conditions and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security which
supervises compliance with labor legislation. The National Port Authority
is responsible for planning, construction and operation of ports and for
navigational aids.
Credit Facilities
21.       Although commercial bank deposits amounted to US$7,473 million as
of December 31, 1975 and the aggregate volume of commercial bank lending in
Panama was US$1,239 million, commercial credit has been available on stringent
terms (three years with no grace period) and only to processing plants and the
more affluent ship owners. Credit has become even tighter since 1975, as
commercial banks are increasingly cautious following the end of the residen-
tial construction boom which led to several foreclosures. In this situation,
low-income fishermen encounter serious difficulty in obtaining credit. Often,
owner-operators obtain credit from processing companies against an agreement
to sell their catch to the plants, usually at unfavorable prices. In view of
the risks inherent to the industry, it is unlikely that enough credit will be
available commercially to meet its needs. The government-owned Banco Nacional
de Panama (BNP), which carries out commercial, mortgage and developmental
banking business, is the main source of credit for individual fishermen.
Long-term credit for fishermen has been provided by the Bank, through BNP,
and by the IDB for an artisanal fisheries project through the Agricultural
Development Bank (BDA).
22.       BNP serves as fiscal and fiduciary agent for Government and is the
country's largest commercial bank. It is a competently run institution, but
pressures on it to expand its lending in the context of a recessionary econ-
omic situation led to an increase in the level of loans in arrears, to a high



- 8 -
level of borrowing from commercial banks and to a decline in profitability.
BNP is well aware of these trends, and during 1976 took a number of measures
to reverse them. These measures include tightening loan collections and
reorganization of a unit specialized in debt recovery as well as measures
designed to reduce operating costs. Most importantly, BNP has agreed with
the Government of Panama to limit its lending to the public sector, thereby
enabling BNP to graduate the increase in its overall lending to the growth
of its deposits and equity while concentrating its lending on the most profit-
able components of its portfolio. BNP's financial situation has already im-
proved as shown by a decline in its level of total arrears from 11.6 percent
at the end of 1975 to 8.3 percent at the end of 1976.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Fisheries Project - Panama"
(No. 1383-PAN), dated March 23, 1977, is being distributed separately. The
main features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III. The project
was prepared by the Government of Panama and was appraised in August 1976.
Negotiations were held in Washington from February 23 to February 25, 1977.
The Panamanian Delegation was led by Mr. Roberto Barragan, Executive Manager
for Development of BNP.
Background
24.       The proposed loan would help finance a third project to carry out the
ongoing modernization of the Panamanian fisheries sector. Under the First
Fisheries Project, (Loan 784-PAN of 1971), the Bank provided US$3.4 million to
help finance the replacement of about 40 old wooden vessels by modern steel
shrimp trawlers. The loan also financed technical assistance for the design
and construction of trawlers; for training of trawler captains and for a fish-
ing port feasibility study. Only 3 percent of the loan remains undisbursed
at present and it will be fully disbursed by the end of May 1977, some eight
months behind schedule. Implementation was delayed following the failure of
the first bidding and the subsequent need to redraft specifications and to
prequalify bidders. The First Fisheries Project was severely affected by
worldwide inflation and, as a result, only 26 trawlers were constructed
instead of the 40 first envisaged. Except for the initial delay, the project
has been well administered, even though the period of implementation saw sharp
increases in operating costs and a temporary weakening in the export market
for shrimp in 1974. Based on 1976 data, financial results of project vessels
are satisfactory; the 26 vessels (10 percent of trawlers in operation) accoun-
ted for 14 percent of the national shrimp catch and net earnings per vessel
(US$27,000) were 35 percent higher than the appraisal estimate. The second
operation in support of the sector was a US$24 million loan (Loan 1114-PAN of
1975), to assist in financing the construction of a fishing port at Punta
Vacamonte. Despite some initial delays, it is expected that the port will be
in operation substantially on schedule by mid-1979.



- 9 -
25.       Experience under t'he First Fisheries Project has influenced the
design of the Second Project in three ways: (a) it pointed out the need to
regulate the fisheries industry with particular regard to operating standards
and to the protection of resources through a balance between the size of the
shrimp fleet and maximum sustainable annual yields; (b) it highlighted the
need for an expanded technical training program for vessel owners and captains,
to include those not directly participating in the project; (c) in line with
government policy and on the basis of local research carried out with FAO/UNDP
assistance, it resulted in the inclusion of an inland fisheries component in
the Second Project; and (d) it pointed to the need for quality control of
shrimp exports.
Project Description
26.       The project would be carried out over a four-year period.    It would
complete the modernization of the shrimp fleet and help in the relocation
and upgrading of the shrimp processing plants, initiate the modernization of
the purse seiner fleet, develop inland fisheries, establish operational and
quality standards and improve the operational efficiency of fishing vessels.
In addition, the project would indirectly help the urbanization program for
Panama City through the relocation of shrimp processing plants which now
contribute heavily to pollution there. Finally, the project would assist the
Government in adopting and implementing measures to achieve a balance between
fleet capacity and fish resources, and in establishing quality control stan-
dards for the seafood processing industry.
Project Components
27.       Shrimp Trawlers:   The project would replace five obsolete wooden
trawlers by five modern steel trawlers equipped with stainless steel brine
freezing tanks allowing storage of the shrimp catch for voyages of up to
two weeks. The vessels would be equipped with magnetic compass, radio-
telephone and echo sounders to gauge the depth of water as different shrimp
species are caught at different depths. Because of the increased cost of
trawlers and high operating costs for fuel and wages, independent boat owners
prefer relatively smaller vessels: the steel trawlers included in the project
would have an overall length of 50 feet and a 220 hp engine, as opposed to the
67 foot, 240 hp trawlers included in the First Project. In addition, it is
proposed to rehabilitate 10 obsolete wooden trawlers (15-20 years old) extend-
ing their working life by about eight years.
28.       The Government has recently enacted comprehensive legislation
enabling it to effectively control fleet size and to bring fleet capacity
into balance with shrimp resources. In view of presently existing over-
capacity (estimated at about 10,000 effective horsepower (EHP)), this policy
will involve freezing construction of new shrimp trawlers until 1980. After
1980, a construction and rehabilitation program, of about 3,260 EHP annually
would maintain a reasonable balance. Vessels constructed or rehabilitated
under the project would only enter into service in 1980, but their design and
construction would take place in 1978/79. Assurances were obtained that the



- 10 -
Government would (a) prohibit constructiDn of new shrimp vessels until
January 1, 1980; (b) restrict maximum construction of new vessels and the
rehabilitation of old wooden boats to a total of 3,260 EHP each year during
the 1980-85 period; and (c) furnish the Bank, by the end of 1980, with a
program outlining how this restriction would be enforced and regulation of the
industry thereby accomplished (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 4.03). The
authorities are also planning to establish standards aimed at improving
trawler seaworthiness, operating safety and efficiency.
29.        Purse Seiners:   The project would help finance the acquisition of
10 new steel seiners, with a hold capacity of 100 short tons and powered by
260 hp diesel engines. Each vessel would have a magnetic compass, radio
telephone, echo sounder and sonar for the detection of schools of red herring
in deep water. Most of the new vessels would replace obsolete wooden fish
purse seiners, which are often converted, second hand shrimp trawlers.
30.       Although the fleet's present capacity is below the potential catch
(25 percent of the fleet is obsolete), the Government intends to enact legis-
lation to avoid over-exploitation by limiting the holding capacity of purse
seiners to less than 150 short tons and to reduce to 15 (from 20) the number
of vessels owned by each of the three processing plants now in existence
(Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement and Section 7.01(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement). This would still make possible, within the next four
years, a catch of 100,000 metric tons of industrial fish; in the longer run, a
catch of 300,000 metric tons could be attained with the use of fish detection
devices. The maximum recorded catch in recent years was 70,000 metric tons in
1973.
31.        Relocation of Processing Plants:   The project would help relocate
six shrimp processing plants from Panama City to the new fishing port at Punta
Vacamonte, which is being constructed under Loan 1114-PAN. In connection with
that loan, Panama enacted legislation requiring the eventual transfer of shrimp
processing plants from Panama City to the fishing port. The Port Authority
would, together with each processor, determine the space allocations and
rental for each of the bays. A significant aspect of the project is an attempt
to meet the crucial needs of Panama in establishing quality control standards
over shrimp exports to the U.S. Expert assistance would be provided to the
Ministry of Health to help it develop quality standards and practices for
plants and good handling methods for shrimp vessels; to train local inspectors
in methods of control and inspection, and to develop sanitary manufacturing
practices for shrimp processing and train plant personnel in their application.
32.        Inland Fisheries:   The project would develop inland fisheries
through the construction of some 400 fish ponds covering about 75 ha.    It
would increase fish production through the establishment of an economically
viable aquaculture system for selected species. Panama has already initiated
a fish farming program and research has been carried out to select species
suitable for pond cultivation. The project would therefore expand existing
research and focus on the development of commercial freshwater fish farming in
selected rural areas. On the basis of experiments carried out in a series of



- 11 -
hatcheries, a total of 12 demonstration ponds would be built in various parts
of the country to introduce farmers to fish farming practices in natural or
constructed pools or in river tributaries. Fingerlings developed in the
hatcheries would be distributed to farmers free of charge for the first phase
of the project, until farmers become established, when they would be charged
nominal amounts for the fingerlings (about US$0.02).
33.       At full development, 1,000 families would participate in the program.
Total production is expected to reach about 350 metric tons of fish and
participating farmers would earn cash incomes varying from US$180 to US$240
per annum from the sale of fish. In subsequent phases, farmer participation
and fishpond areas could be doubled.
34.        Oyster Farming.   At present, there is no cultivated oyster farming
in Panama. In 1975, a joint Government/FAO study identified areas suitable
for oyster cultivation and provided a basis for further research and experi-
mentation to develop commercial oyster farming. The project would help set
up five experimental oyster farms in the Bocas de Toro area on Panama's
northwest coast and would help develop mangrove oyster farming on a commercial
basis by small farmers who now have limited means of earning cash incomes.
It is estimated that commercial production could begin by the third year of
the project, attaining 28 metric tons of oyster meat in the fourth year,
rising to 34 metric tons at full development.
Consulting and Expert Services
35.        The proposed loan would cover the cost of six consultants (111 man-
months) to assist BNP and the Government in specific project activities. The
consultants to be provided are a naval architect, a fishing operations train-
ing officer, a fresh water fish farming expert, a food processing engineer, a
quality control expert and an oyster farming expert. The cost of these con-
sultants is US$4,000 per man-month. BNP would expand the local staff of the
Project Unit by the addition of two credit specialists, on a part-time basis,
to assist it in evaluating sub-loan applications. In addition, MIDA would
recruit six assistant biologists to work with the National Aquaculture Direc-
torate in connection with the fish culture program; the Directorate of Marine
Resources of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry would employ a biologist
and an assistant biologist for the Research Center at Bocas de Toro. The
Ministry of Health would employ two food inspectors for the quality control
program. (Section 3.02 and Schedule 5, Section III of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Project Administration
36.        Overall project administration and accounting would be entrusted to
the Project Unit of BNP, established under the First Fisheries Project. The
Project Unit would have a full-time director, acceptable to the Bank, assisted
by qualified staff and consultants. Appointment of a full-time Project
Director would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Sections 3.03, 3.04 and
7.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).   The Project Unit would enter into



- 12 -
operational agreements with: (a) MIDA, regarding the fresh water fish farming
program; (b) DMR, of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, for the oyster
farming program; and (c) the Ministry of Health regarding the quality control
program to be developed for the shrimp processing plants. The signing of
operational agreements between BNP and these entities would be a condition of
disbursement for the fresh water fish farming, oyster farming and processing
plant relocation components of the project (Section 3.08, Schedule 1, para-
graph 4, and Schedule 5, Part II, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment). In addition, the Project Unit would benefit from the advisory assis-
tance of a Fisheries Project Committee (composed of representatives of BNP,
DMR, the Fishermen's Association and independent fishermen) on matters rela-
ting to vessel specifications and the evaluation of bids for construction or
rehabilitation of vessels (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Lending Arrangements
37.        BNP would lend directly to sub-borrowers for the purchase of
trawlers and purse seiners, for the rehabilitation of old wooden trawlers and
for the relocation of shrimp processing plants. BNP's analyses of sub-loan
applications would be reviewed by the Bank before final approval of sub-loans
(Schedule 5, Part I D of the draft Loan Agreement). Sub-loans would carry an
interest rate of 11.5 percent and a technical service fee of 0.5 percent on
outstanding sub-loan balances. This interest rate is expected to be positive
in real terms since the rate of inflation in an open economy such as Panama's
is likely to remain in line with international price movements, i.e., in the
order of 7 percent p.a. during the next few years. Inflation in Panama, after
accelerating to over 20 percent in 1974/75, declined to around 6 percent in
1976. The repayment period of sub-loans would be (a) 10 years, including 1
year of grace, for the purchase of new trawlers and purse seiners, and (b) 8
years, including one year of grace, for the rehabilitation of old trawlers and
purse seiners and for the relocation of shrimp processing plants. Sub-borrowers
will be required to contribute (i) five percent of the estimated cost of shrimp
vessel construction or rehabilitation; (ii) fifteen percent of the cost of
purse seiner construction; and (iii) twenty percent of the cost of plant re-
location (Schedule 5, Part I C of the draft Loan Agreement). In selecting
sub-borrowers, priority will be given to small, independent boat operators
and to groups of fishing captains in the case of purse seiners. The Govern-
ment would bear the foreign exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan (Section
2.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
38.        The total cost of the project, excluding identifiable taxes, is
estimated at about US$12.6 million, of which US$7.5 million would be foreign
exchange. A detailed breakdown of costs is given in Annex III. The major
components would be the purchase of 10 purse seiners (46 percent of costs
excluding contingencies); credit for relocation of shrimp processing plants
(28 percent of costs) and administrative and technical services (12 percent of
costs). The cost estimates include physical contingencies of 10 percent of
base cost on all items and price contingencies calculated at varying rates and
amounting to about 21 percent of base costs.



- 13 -
39.        The proposed loan of US$7.5 million would cover the full foreign
exchange cost of the project, including contingencies. BNP would lend US$2.1
million equivalent of its own funds to project beneficiaries who would invest
about US$1.6 million of their own funds in the various project components.
Government funds of about US$0.7 million would be made available as a grant to
BNP for the inland fisheries and oyster farming components, and for related
technical and administrative services. BNP would, in addition, contribute
US$0.6 million for project administration and technical services. (Section
2.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement and Section 3.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Procurement
40.        Contracts for construction of new fishing vessels (five shrimp trawl-
ers and 10 anchovy purse seiners), at a total cost of US$4.9 million (excluding
contingencies), would be awarded by BNP following international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Local bidders
would be allowed a preference margin of the lower of applicable customs duties
or 15 percent of the CIF price. Shrimp vessels would be procured in a single
lot and purse seiners in a single lot, or in two lots of five; each vessel
would be bid as a unit including main engine, equipment and fishing gear.
International competitive bidding would also apply to the equipment needed by
the shrimp processing plants, estimated to cost US$1.1 million, excluding
contingencies. Equipment and materials for the rehabilitation of vessels
amounting to US$0.4 million net of contingencies would be procured in lots of
less than US$100,000 under local competitive bidding arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank. Equipment and materials for the inland fisheries and oyster
development components (US$0.3 million net of contingencies) would also be
obtained through local competitive bidding satisfactory to the Bank. Similar-
ly, local competitive bidding would apply to the plant construction component
(US$1.2 million net of contingencies). Panamanian legislation currently pro-
hibits the importation of fishing vessels and requires the retirement of
foreign-built purse seiners. These restrictions, insofar as they applied to
shrimp trawlers, were waived for the purposes of the First Fisheries Project.
A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be that Panama had
exempted goods (including vessels) required for the project from any and all
regulations prohibiting their importation into Panama or restricting their
period of operation in Panama (Section 7.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Disbursement
41.        The proposed loan would be disbursed over a 4-year period against
the foreign exchange component of the project, as follows: (a) 76 percent of
amounts disbursed by BNP for subloans for the cost of construction, rehabili-
tation and equipment of fishing vessels, including gear and equipment; and of
plant relocation costs, including the cost of new equipment; (b) 39 percent of
the cost of the fresh water fish and oyster farming programs, and (c) 100
percent of foreign exchange expenditures for consulting services.



- 14 -
-oject Monitoring and Evaluation
42.        A Project Monitoring and Evaluation Section will be set up and
attached to the Project Unit within BNP to monitor project activities and
evaluate performance. The Section will make periodic evaluations of the
credit component of the project, examine the training program for skippers
and collect and study results and trends of each of the project's components,
the fishing fleet capacity and the performance of the fisheries industry.
Assurances were obtained that the Section would be established and that,
thereafter, it would prepare reports on the progress and operating results of
the Project on a quarterly basis for submission to BNP and the Bank (Section
3.07 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Audit
43.        BNP's accounts, including the Project Account, would be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Auditor's report will be
furnished to the Bank within four months of the end of each fiscal year
(Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the draft Loan Agreement). The Office of the
Controller-General of Panama has been carrying out these audits under the
First Fisheries and Livestock Projects.
Project Benefits and Risks
44.        The overall economic rate of return for the project, including
administrative and technical overhead costs, is 15 percent. This rate of
return excludes the processing plant relocation component whose costs and
benefits were taken into account in the economic analysis of the Fishing Port
Project (Loan 1114-PAN). The economic rate of return for the various project
components, excluding administrative and technical overheads, is as follows:
30.8 percent for the new shrimp trawlers (cost: US$0.8 million); 20.6 percent
for the rehabilitated shrimp trawlers (cost: US$0.7 million); 19 percent for
the purse seiner component (cost: US$5.4 million); 12.9 percent for the fresh
water fish farming component (cost: US$0.3 million) and 17.6 percent for the
oyster farming component (cost: US$0.1 million).
45.       There are no special technical, financial, managerial or marketing
risks to the success of the project. The events most likely to affect the
project would fluctuations in the industrial fish catch and increases in
capital and operating costs of production. The economic rate of return would
still be 10 percent in the event of: (a) a 10 percent decrease in the catch
of industrial fish; (b) a 10 percent increase in operating costs, or (c) a 10
percent increase in capital costs.
46.        The fishing industry, as a whole, would benefit from the project
through increased efficiency of the fishing fleet and processing plants and
through better utilization and preservation of fisheries resources. Average
annual incremental production would amount to 57,000 metric tons of industrial
fish; 134 metric tons of shrimp; 28 metric tons of oyster and 243 metric tons
of fresh water fish. The project would create about 200 new jobs.



- 15 -
47.        By making credit available to small, independent shrimping vessel
operators, the project would assist the Government in its objective of keep-
ing such operators in business and in preventing the concentration of the
shrimping industry in the hands of processors and large companies. Moreover,
the project would help the Government in adopting and implementing measures
to regulate the growth of the industry by maintaining a reasonable balance
between fisheries resources and fleet capacity.
48.        The financial rates of return for the fishing vessels range from
22 percent to 40 percent. Net earnings per vessel per annum are estimated at
US$33,368 for a new shrimp trawler; US$26,698 for a rehabilitated shrimp
trawler, and US$73,080 for an industrial purse seiner. Farmers raising fresh
water fish would earn additional cash incomes of between US$180 to US$240 per
annum while oyster farmers would earn additional cash incomes of about US$250
per year. Besides contributing to the overall efficiency of the shrimp
industry, investments in the shrimp plant relocation program would generate
about US$90,000 in cost savings and an additional US$200,000 by permitting a
better quality product to be exported (by reducing the rejection rate at
United States ports), and an additional US$1 million by 1989 through develop-
ment of new shrimp products.
Ecological Impact
49.        The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact.
The relocation of shrimp processing plants from Panama City to the new fishing
port will improve the environment of the City and facilitate implementation of
the Government's urbanization program. Moreover, the processing plants
at the fishing port would be provided with facilities to treat waste products
so as to prevent pollution of the environment. The inland fisheries and
oyster farming components would not alter the water regime or have an adverse
effect on the rural population. Finally, obtaining a balance between fleet
size and fisheries resources would serve to protect the self-renewing nature
of the resources.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco Nacional
de Panama, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approv-
ing the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of
Annex IV.
51.        Conditions of effectiveness would be (a) that a full-time
Project Director had been appointed to head the Project Unit within the Banco
Nacional de Panama, (b) that legislation had been enacted limiting the size
of purse seiners and the number of licenses granted to any licensee, and



- 16 -
(c) that goods (including vessels) required for the project had been exempted
from all regulations prohibiting their entry into Panama or restricting their
period of operation in Panama. A condition of disbursement for the fresh
water fish and oyster farming components would be the signing of operational
agreements between BNP and the Ministry of Agriculture and the Directorate of
Marine Resources and a condition for disbursement for the processing plant
relocation would be the signing of an operational agreement between BNP and
the Ministry of Health.
52.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 661: Second Power Project; US$42 Million Loan of March 16, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project is almost completed with an expected 18-month delay for
the major component, the Bayano hydroelectric plant, which will reach full
output by mid-1977. The other major components, the Las Minas 40 MW unit and
associated transmission, have been commissioned. The project cost is now
estimated at US$96.6 million or 84 percent above appraisal estimates. Delays
in project execution resulted from shortage of materials and difficulties with
the contractor. The cost overruns are due mainly to larger than forecast
inflation in Panama and abroad during the project execution period, and con-
struction problems. The Bank has reached agreement with the Government and
IRHE, the power company, on cost overrun financing and tariff adjustments to
increase IRHE's revenues.
Loan No. 783: Tocumen International Airport Project; US$20 Million Loan of
August 2, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project, which consists of construction of a new airport terminal
building, runway and auxiliary facilities for Panama City, is about 18 months
behind schedule and has had a 100 percent cost overrun. Delays in project
execution have resulted in large part from changes in design and bad weather
conditions at the beginning of construction which made earthworks difficult
to execute. The overrun is due to delays in project execution and inflation.
Runway paving and the construction of the terminal building are now progressing
satisfactorily and the loan should be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date
of December 1977. The financial position of the borrower continues to be
strong in spite of the worldwide slowdown in international air transportation.
The shortfall in the project financing plan, caused by cost increases, will
be covered by additional government equity funds.
Loan No. 784: Fisheries Project; US$3.4 Million Loan of August 2, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project, which is designed to increase efficiency of the
Panamanian shrimp industry, consists of (1) construction of shrimp trawlers;
(2) a trawler captains' training program; and (3) a fishing port feasibility
study. The construction of trawlers is completed; however, the scope of the
Project had to be reduced from the originally intended 40 trawlers to 26
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

trawlers due to escalation of costs. The captains' training program has also
been completed. The fishing port feasibility study was completed in February
1974, and led to the preparation of a project for which the Executive Directors
approved a loan in April 1975. As of January 31, 1977, the loan was 97
percent disbursed.
Loan No. 901: Livestock Development Project; US$4.7 Million Loan of
June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project finances cattle enterprises, including land reform
settlements, involved in dairying, beef breeding and fattening; and technical
services, including an ongoing study of the livestock potential in the Atlantic
Coast Region. As of December 31, 1976, the loan was 93 percent committed and
60 percent disbursed. The loan should be fully disbursed on schedule even
though commitments have lagged behind appraisal estimates, due mainly to
initial delays in organizing the project unit.
Loan No. 948: Third Power Project; US$30 Million Loan of December 4, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The project is designed to integrate three of the four isolated
major regional electricity systems into a national grid. Project implemen-
tation is about 10 months behind schedule because of initial delays in engi-
neering, bidding, and procurement of major items--the 28 MW diesels, 230
kV lines, and substations. Project costs are currently estimated at 25
percent above appraisal estimates in large part due to inflation.
Loan No. 1114: Fishing Port Project; US$24 Million Loan of May 27, 1975;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
The project consists of construction of a new fishing port at Punta
Vacamonte on the Pacific. The first contract, for marine works, has been
awarded. It is expected that small delays which resulted during bidding will
be recovered in construction. Project costs are estimated at 26 percent above
appraisal estimates, but the project still yields an acceptable economic rate
of return.
Loan 1280: Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Closing Date:   December 31, 1980.
The project, which includes financing for improved water supply and
sewerage in the cities of Panama, Colon, Arraijan, Chorrera and Vacamonte,
and a metering program, is proceeding on schedule. Technical proposals for
the major design works have been received, and it is expected that final
selection of the engineering consulting firm to carry out this work will take
place this month. Detailed design of some components of the project has been
started by the Borrower, and it is also expected that construction will begin
in July. The metering program is expected to begin in July.
