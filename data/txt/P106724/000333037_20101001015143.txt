1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

   a. Macro-economic context at appraisal

At the time of appraisal, Uruguay's macroeconomic framework was satisfactory, with
higher than projected growth, strong fiscal performance, and inflation low and stable.
Public debt sustainability also had improved faster than anticipated in the CAS: the
debt/GDP ratio had fallen about 64 percent by end 2006, compared to 72 percent
estimated in the CAS. Last, structural reforms were being implemented in public sector
management, the financial sector, and social programs, which provided a platform for
deeper reforms.

Uruguay had largely recovered from the 2002 crisis triggered by events in Argentina,
which caused an 11 percent drop in GDP. Moreover, its growth and fiscal outcomes
outperformed those projected in the 2002 CAS. For example, the economy grew 6.6
percent in 2005 and an estimated 6.8 percent in 2006, compared to 6 percent and 4
percent, respectively, projected in the CAS. On the other hand, the Government projected
a decline in economic growth over the medium term tapering off to an equilibrium near
the historical average.

The public debt burden also lessened after the crisis. The improved fiscal position, strong
growth, and lower interest rates coupled with the strength of the currency all contributed
to a lower public sector debt-to-GDP ratio. Debt management policies also have been
successful since 2003. By 2006, the Government was able to smooth repayment peaks,
refinance expensive emergency financing, and gradually increase the peso share debt.

In addition, the 2007-08 current account deficit was expected to be modest. Not counting
the substantial imports related to the concentration of pulp mill projects, the deficit was
expected to remain in the range of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007-08. Current account risks
were mitigated by reducing public debt and diversifying exports. However, the risks to
growth persisted in the form of potential current account shocks caused by international
interest rates and adverse regional developments.

The baseline macroeconomic scenario showed the public sector debt ratio falling from 64
percent of GDP in 2006 to 50 percent in 2010. This outcome was contingent on
maintaining a primary surplus. The fiscal policy of the Government at the time was
targeted at achieving a 4 percent primary surplus from 2007 onward. The Government
track record of maintaining prudent macroeconomic stabilization policies and subsequent
strong fiscal performance lent credibility to this scenario.

Economic and financial risks were considered likely because of the high level of public
sector debt and guarantees, and the still high dollarization in the economy. Hence, public
sector debt was considered an important fiscal risk. The Government's debt service

                                            1
capacity remained dependent on a combination of factors including continued fiscal
discipline, moderate world interest rates, low sovereign risk premiums, sustained
economic growth, and active debt management. Much of the debt (over 90 percent by end
June 2006) was denominated in foreign currency. This exposed the public sector debt to
exchange rate fluctuations. The Government also had large contingent liabilities from
explicit and implicit guarantees to state banks and non-banking financial institutions and
the large public sector pension system. Other liabilities were inherent in the large public
enterprises that dominated Uruguay's public services and infrastructure. Financial sector
vulnerabilities, an external shock caused by adverse movement in global interest rates,
and a delay in the structural reform program of the administration also were factors at the
time of the DPL.

At the time of PRIDPL II, growth, performance had exceeded expectations, averaging 8
percent over 2005-08, which allowed Uruguay to consolidate economic gains made since
the 2002 crisis. The country also benefitted from a generally favorable external
environment until mid-2008, with high regional growth and buoyant agricultural
commodity prices, though partially offset by recent years of high oil and gas prices. The
economy was expected to expand by 10.6 percent in 2008, driven by foreign direct
investment in pulp mill projects, expanding commerce and telecom services, and a strong
construction sector. Nevertheless, baseline economic projection used in debt
sustainability analysis assumed a slowdown in growth from 2008 onward.

   b. Core issues prior to loan approval

At the time the operation was designed, core issues centered on growth challenges. The
strategy delineated in the Bank's 2005 Uruguay Sources of Growth study rested on three
pillars: policies and reforms needed for consolidation of macroeconomic stability (Pillar
I); improvements in the business climate and the allocation efficiency of the factors of
production (Pillar II); and private-sector-led growth driven by innovation (Pillar III).

Tax reform was seen as fostering fiscal consolidation and thereby contributing to
medium-term macroeconomic stability. Medium-term growth prospects were also seen as
linked to an increase in the quality and quantity of investment. Moreover, within the
business climate agenda, the initial focus was on upgrading the bankruptcy framework
and improving information disclosure--in addition to reformatting the tax system.
Capital market development was another priority identified by the Government as a
contributor to macroeconomic stability.

For perspective, during the 2002 crisis unemployment and poverty had increased to levels
unprecedented in Uruguay. By mid-2006 moderate poverty had declined to about 28
percent and extreme poverty to 3 percent, below the record 4 percent during 2005, but
more than twice the percentage five years earlier. For this reason, a key priority became
strengthening the social protection system, focused on ensuring broad and sustainable
coverage. One of the main concerns informing Uruguay's social protection policies
centered on including poor workers and families not participating in the formal labor
market. Another concern pertained to the pension system, known as the most expensive

                                            2
in the region--due in part to its extensive coverage. A better managed and regulated
system appeared needed to complement this broad coverage--supported by appropriately
higher revenue collection.

   c. Alignment of the DPL program with Government and Bank strategies

The Bank PRIDPL I program was designed to be the first in a series of two Development
Policy Loans (DPLs), the second operation (PRIDPL II) following approximately one
year later. The objectives were directly linked to both the Government's explicit
objectives as well as those of the CAS.

The PRIDPL program was designed as fully consistent with the reform agenda set out by
the Government. In 2006, the Minister of Finance summarized the economic policy
objective of the Government as sustained growth at higher than historical rates,
combating poverty, poverty and exclusion, and ensuing equitable access to opportunities
for human progress. Macroeconomic stabilization remained at the core of the
Government's policy program for both DPLs. The Government set as a strategic priority
investment climate policies to increase firm-level productivity, by enhancing innovation
and upgrading worker capacity through training The other critical path investment
climate policies continued to be tax reform, investment promotion, new competition and
insolvency and enterprise reorganization (bankruptcy) laws, in addition to capital markets
reform.

For public sector management, the three priority areas for reform, supported by the Bank
and the CAS, which mirrored the Government's strategy, included tax administration and
tax policy, expenditure management, and institutional reform. In the case of taxes,
improving equity of the tax system was a priority, in addition to focusing on improving
the administration of tax collection required to maintain the primary surplus. On
expenditure management, the reform of social transfer schemes was identified as critical,
with potential for broad institutional reform. In the financial sector, emphasis was on
strengthening the institutional framework for supervision, on continuing bank
restructuring, and on policies to promote the deepening of capital markets. The social
context focus was on health and pension reform to improve overall social welfare, while
contributing to fiscal stability and expenditure switching policies. Thus, the necessary
framework was in place for a policy-based loan.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The overall program development objective of the two Programmatic Reform
Implementation Development Policy Loan (PRIDPL) programs supported
implementation of priority economic and social sector reforms as determined by the
Government. The original Program Development Objectives supported the Government's
reform program in three key areas: (i) tax reform, (ii) business climate and capital
markets development, and (iii) improving the social protection system.



                                            3
The key indicators for the respective PDOs were: (i) tax--increase the efficiency and
equity of the tax system, while maintaining Government revenues at the level to meet the
overall balance target necessary for macroeconomic stability; (ii) business climate--
increase the quality and quantity of investment and thereby contribute to growth; (iii)
social protection--promote social inclusion so that all individuals in society benefit from
development and Government programs.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

PRIDPL I highlighted the reform of the securities and settlement payment system through
a trigger. PRIDPL II added a corresponding PDO on the implementation of the payment
and securities payment strategy. PDO indicators that relied for measurement on the
"Doing Business" database were dropped on the advice of the World Bank team under
DPL II, as it gave a misleading measure of economic expansion which was not possible
to evaluate with DB indicators.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

Three policy reforms areas were supported by the two DPLs: tax reform, business climate
and capital markets development, and policies aimed at strengthening social protection.
Under tax reform, the intention was to reduce distortions and render the tax system more
equitable, while maintaining requisite Government revenues to meet the primary surplus
target necessary for macroeconomic stability. Measures supported by the program were:
(i) Parliamentary approval of the tax reform law by end December 2006; (ii) adaptation
of Banco de Protección Social (BPS) operational systems to combine collection of IRPF
and social security contributions.

Under business climate and capital market development the intention was to create
conditions that encouraged investment through improving the business climate and
increasing overall transparency of the corporate and financial sectors. Measures
supported by the program were: (i) MEF in collaboration with BCU, to produce an
overall strategy and implementation plan for capital markets reform; (ii) submission to
Parliament of a bill on Insolvency and Corporate Reorganization (Bankruptcy Law); and
(iii) MEF, in collaboration with BCU, AIN, TCR, and CPNCA, produce an
implementation plan for improving transparency of information.

Under strengthening social protection the intention was to expand and consolidate the
social protection system, reinforce the protection of the poor and vulnerable, and increase
the efficiency, transparency and accountability of social protection institutions. Measures
supported by the program were: (i) BPS continued to register beneficiaries for the non-
contributory family allowances program; and (ii) BPS introduced changes to increase
coverage and revenue collection of the formal social security system.

A complementary Institution Building Technical Assistance Loan (IBTAL) PAD was
prepared along with PRIDPL I, which provided institution-building support to the policy
reforms in several areas. These included: tax reform (tax administration in BPS in human

                                            4
resources, IT systems, auditing, business intelligence, collections, risk management,
outreach, and taxpayer services); business climate and capital markets development
(targeted technical assistance); and strengthening social protection (data processing
equipment, and costs associated with designing and implementing an inter-institutional
information system on beneficiaries of social programs).

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

Policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes

The amount for the second operation was increased from an initial amount of US$100
million to a final US$400 million when the second operation was approved (see table 2).
The first operation was disbursed in local currency. The second operation was available
in foreign currency as a Deferred Draw-Down (DDO) operation over a three-year period.
The reason for this was to provide the Government with a risk-management tool in the
event that market borrowing was interrupted and a public sector financing shortfall arose.
The authorities decided on an immediate and full drawn-down in January 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

As shown in table 3, the Government's program performance, as described in the policy
matrix of the two DPLs under review, was consistently on track. All the action triggers
were a condition of Board approval, and thus were met prior to Board presentation of the
respective loans.

    employers (7.5 % of wages).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The IBTAL contributed to the successful implementation of PRIDPL I and II, as intended.
The strong commitment of the Government was also a factor contributing to the overall
successful implementation. An issue arose concerning the lines of accountability and
leadership given the comprehensive nature of the reform and the need for inter-
institutional cooperation. Offsetting this was a highly committed and competent team
commensurate with the scope of the ambitions reform agenda. This meant that the
program success also involved leadership and champions of the targeted development
areas, such as the MEF and the Central Bank. The direct involvement of the Central
Bank, the MEF (DGI), and Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) helped to clarify
the lines of responsibility and leadership paths. In contrast, in the case of transparency
and insolvency, ambiguous assignment of responsibilities meant that meeting outcomes
became less assured. The clear allocation of responsibilities aided by a well-articulated
strategic framework enabled implementation to move forward in a satisfactory way
overall, especially in the case of the Plan de Equidad.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Government and the Bank agreed to monitor progress of the PRIDPL program
regularly, in tandem with CAS monitoring. Discussions were held with the Ministry of
Finance and the Economy, the main counterpart agency, which was in charge of
monitoring and evaluation and collecting data from the appropriate sources needed to
monitor progress. The CAS review focused on the maintenance of agreed triggers for
continued policy-based lending--in particular maintenance of a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework and progress on the overall structural program. Data sources
included: central and non-financial public sector budget monitoring by MEF; Central
Bank reports and analysis; tax information systems; investment climate surveys; reviews
and analysis of laws and implementing regulations from the World Bank and other
stakeholders; financial audits and follow-up on CFAA recommendations; World Bank
supervision reports; and IMF Article IV consultations.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The new DPL series (August 2010), initiated by the First (to be followed by a Second)
Programmatic Public Sector, Competitiveness and Social Inclusion Development Policy
Loan, builds on the results and lessons of PRIDPL I and II. The new series also benefits

                                                    9
from the experience of parallel technical assistance provided IBTAL for PRIDPL I and II,
which will continue to support the new DPL series. The new Uruguay Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY10-FY15, Report No. 55863-UY, also notes that the
previous CPS strategy to implement PRIDPL I and II was the appropriate one and
provided a solid foundation for subsequent core reforms to support the new
Government's evolving public sector reform agenda through the newly initiated DPL
series.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The themes covered under the DPL series remain highly relevant in the country and to
the present administration, as highlighted in the new CPS. The new DPL series targets the
consolidation of reforms supported by the Programmatic Reform Implementation
Development Policy Loan (PRIDPL) series (approved May 2007), and bolsters
Government efforts in other areas were not supported by the PRIDPL series. Specifically,
the loan recognizes recent achievements in public sector management, business climate
and social service delivery (prior actions for DPL-I). The indicative triggers for DPL-II
reflect broad policy areas of support, anchoring the new Government's reform agenda
through 2011.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Table 4 below, is a summary of actual achievements under PRIDPL I and II relative to
baselines and targets. Detailed Indicators provide evidence of progress toward achieving

3.2.1 Macroeconomic Stability: Satisfactory

After recovering from the 2002 crisis, Uruguay's economic growth accelerated,
supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals. Before the 2008 global crisis,
Uruguay was posting real GDP growth that averaged 7 percent during the 2005-08 period
and peaked at close to 9 percent in 2008. Private investment also reached record levels
and unemployment set a historic low. Improvements in macroeconomic fundamentals
included a reduction in the Government's public debt as well as the external debt of the
country. Gross public debt decreased from 105 percent of GDP in 2003 to 60 percent in
2008. The share of public debt denominated in local currency declined from 90 percent in
2006 to 61.5 percent in 2009; but still was a matter of concern. In turn, the net public
debt fell from 68.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 35.2 percent in 2009, with the refinancing
risk reduced by smoothing the amortization schedule. Inflation has shown a secular
decline (5.9 percent in 2009), but with levels fluctuating, and remains a concern.

By skillful management of the impact of the global crisis, economic growth
remained positive, based on sound the macroeconomic fundamentals that remain in
place. The economy contracted only in the first quarter of 2009; growth returned to reach
2.9 percent in 2009, representing one of the best performances in the region. The
Government did not design and implement specific expenditure measures to counter the
impact of the crisis; rather they let automatic stabilizers operate and continued to
implement their investment program, which was nearing full implementation towards the
end of the administration. The financial authorities took measures to protect foreign
exchange reserves with the support of international organizations. The main item not in
keeping with expectations was the primary public surplus, which, at 1.3 percent and 1.2
percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively, was below the expected 4 percent
Government target because of weak public enterprise sector performance, as, for example,
seasonal factors (low rainfall) severely affected energy company accounts. Inflation that
ebbed up in 2008 to nearly 10 percent has declined to 6 percent in 2009, responding to
tight monetary policy. Gross investment over GDP increased from 15.2 percent in 2003
to 23 percent in 2008. The recent crisis caused the investment ratio to drop to 21.8
percent, but it is expected to recover with economic growth, which is likely to reach 8
percent in 2010.

International ratings of Uruguayan sovereign debt have improved since the 2002
crisis. Since declining in January 9, 2003 to CCC/negative, the S&P foreign currency
rating gradually has increased to reach B/positive by January 2006, which coincided with
the beginning of the previous administration. The latest update in July 2008 recorded a
BB- and stable rating. 1 However, the country has yet to regain the investment grade it
lost during the previous crisis. Further improvements in international ratings would
require greater reduction in the gross public-debt-to-GDP ratio, as well as the share of
that debt denominated in foreign currency. In addition, the country needs a strategy for


1
 The current ratings are by agency (a) Moody's--Ba3 and stable outlook; (b) Fitch--BB-and positive
outlook; and (c) S&P---BB-and stable outlook. The Canadian bond rating agency, DBRS, upgraded
Uruguay's local and foreign currency rating to BB and assigned a positive trend (September 2009).

building required infrastructure without increasing fiscal risks, and to align real wage
increases with productivity gains both to maintain and improve competitiveness.

This ICR rates achievements of results under this pillar as satisfactory. The
authorities sustained their commitment to solid macro-policy and the profile of the
country continues to improve despite the global crisis (see table 5 below). The
contribution of the Bank was limited to the financial characteristics of the operations.
PRIDPL I was disbursed in local currency consistent with the policy of the Government
to increase the share of the debt in public currency. The second operation, coming just
before the crisis, was provided as a DDO (deferred draw-down option) in support of the
Government strategy to shield the reserves of the country in the wake of the coming crisis.
The amount of the second operation was increased from an original of US$100 million to
US$300 million and then to a final US$400 million. The authorities drew the full amount
upon effectiveness of the operation. Lastly, the Bank team maintained a dialogue with the
authorities on macroeconomic policy in parallel with the IMF discussions on Article IV.

3.2.2 Reforming the Tax System: Highly Satisfactory

The authorities revised the policy framework to address several shortcomings of the
system in place. Uruguay was a worldwide leader in the introduction of VAT, with
income taxation for capital and labor not well developed. Uruguay's tax system came to
rely on a high level of indirect taxation, with income taxation scattered among various
taxes and lacking a comprehensive well-designed structure. In addition, several low-
yielding nuisance taxes were in place that increased compliance costs. The tax system
lacked progressivity. To address this situation the Government launched a tax reform that
included the following initiatives: (a) introduction of a Personal Income Tax (IRPF) with
a progressive five-scale schedule to replace a wage tax; (b) rationalization of the
Corporate Income Tax, with a new tax replacing four corporate income taxes in place; (c)
reduction in the value added tax (23 to 22 the top rate and 14 to 10 the reduced rate.); (d)
unification of the employer's social security contribution and elimination of sector
exemptions; and (e) elimination of several small taxes.

The great challenge for the authorities was the implementation of the tax reform.
The previous administration had already focused on the modernization of the tax
administration, which had taken tax revenue collection from 15 percent in 2003 to 17
percent by 2006. The tax reform did not seek to further increase revenues but instead to
rationalize the system and increase contribution of direct personal taxation. This
represented a major challenge, as introduction of the IRPF was expected to triple
contributors, from 200,000 to 600,000. The Government saw the introduction and
expansion of the personal income tax as an important tool for the reduction of informality
in the country, representing a flagship program of the authorities.

The authorities achieved all objectives set for the tax reform. First, the personal
income tax was successfully implemented, with the new administration that came into
office 2010, plans to build on these achievements to improve the design by broadening
the definition of the tax base to include investments abroad. Second, the net of personal

                                                                           18
income taxpayers increased from around 200,000 in 2006 to over 600,000 in 2009.2 Third,
PIT revenue targets were met: the combined collection of IRPF plus IASS revenues
reached 2.3 percent of GDP, above the Government target under the DPL of 2.1 percent.3
Third, VAT and CIT rates were reduced. Fourth, overall revenue targets have been met:
the ratio of taxes to GDP in 2009 was 18 percent roughly the same as in 2005 or 18.5
percent. 4 Fifth, the ratio of direct to indirect taxation increased as the Government
intended. Lastly, the cost of collection decreased as intended in line with Government
policy to undertake new programs without increasing the size of the implementing
agencies.

This ICR rates the achievement of results as highly satisfactory, as not only the
objectives were met but they were met in an exemplary way. The success in the
introduction of the PIT was due in great part to the skillful use of the social security
infrastructure at the Banco de Previsión Social (BPS), which is collecting 80 percent of
the tax on behalf of the Ministry of Finance (Dirección General de Impuestos--DGI),
while DGI audits and enforces. The coordination between BPS and MEF is exemplary in
the world. The Bank concentrated its support on the implementation of the PIT while the
IBD focused on VAT work. The technical support for the implementation of the personal
income tax came through the Institution-Building Technical Assistance Loan (IBTAL),
and was provided to the tax administration area of the BPS in adapting the operational
systems.

3.2.3 Business Climate and Capital Markets Development: Moderately Satisfactory

The DPL design under this pillar supported a two-pronged strategy to increase
productive investment. On the one hand, the intent was to improve investor access to
financing sources and on the other, to improve the investment climate to attract foreign
investors. In this context the development of the capital markets was seen as a way of
facilitating the transfer of resources from savers (such as pension funds) to investors,
especially small and medium enterprises. In line with these objectives, the DPL covered
(a) increased transparency in the availability of financial sector information, (b) the
modernization of the capital markets, and (c) increased security of property rights by
overhauling bankruptcy legislation and procedures. The second DPL highlighted the
work on securities and payment system. The program under this pillar had ample
analytical work that included: (a) Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSAP) of May 1,
2006; (b) Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on Insolvency and
Creditor's Rights (January 2006); (c) Corporate Governance ROSC Assessment (April 19,
2006); and (d) ROSC on Accounting and Auditing (January 2006). During DPL
implementation an investment climate assessment was prepared (2008).


2
  Note: To bring greater realism, PRIDPL-II removed the 600,000 contributors target that RIDPL-I had set.
Thus, in this specific regard, it can truly be said that the program delivered far above expectations.
3
  The elimination of the PIT on pensions led to the introduction of a pension surcharge in its place (IASS).
The total for the PIT includes both.
4
  The DPL quotes the ratio of taxes to GDP at 22.5 percent, for 2005, but this does not correspond to the
information available now, which is 17.8 percent.

3.2.3.1 Capital Markets Reform

The DPL supported Government's efforts to improve compliance of the security
regulation, supervision, and the payments system with international standards. To
gauge progress, the Government set the goal of complying with the principles issued by
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles on
Securities Regulation and (Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems) CPSS-
IOSCO Recommendations on Securities Settlement Systems. The Capital Markets Law
(2009), supported by the DPL, addressed the key shortcomings that previous IOSCO
reviews had identified. These included strengthening the regulatory powers of the Central
Bank over capital markets, reducing the powers of the self-regulating capacity of the two
stock exchanges, and fostering the professionalization of the key players (traders, dealers,
issuers, asset managers and regulators). In addition, the Capital Markets Law mandates
the creation of a committee to promote the development of the capital markets.
Implementation of the law has just begun.

After addressing the main shortcomings, Uruguay has become a signatory member
of IOSCO, the only Latin American country to do so. The advances introduced by the
Central Bank Law, the Capital Markets Law, the Payments System Law and
complementary regulations enabled the Central Bank of Uruguay to sign IOSCO's
Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMMoU) 5 and become a signatory
member of IOSCO--the second country in Latin America, after Brazil, to do so.
Previously Uruguay was only an ordinary member. Signatory membership means that
Uruguay has complied with the IOSCO principles on securities regulation and security
settlement systems. The Central Bank of Uruguay is now undertaking a thorough
stocktaking of the progress the country has made.

Envisaged increases in capital market activity have taken place. The DPL foresaw an
impact of the program on the growth in the stock market and the activity in the primary
and secondary markets. The value of the stock market grew from US$20 million (the
baseline set under the DPL) to US$139 million today. Still, only three companies are
actively traded in the stock market. Activity in the primary and secondary markets
similarly increased from 4,500 million (DPL benchmark) to 6,200 million today.
Nevertheless, this growth cannot be attributed solely to the approved Capital Markets
Law. Other factors included the rapid pace of economic growth and the relatively small
impact of the crisis on the country.

3.2.3.2 Bankruptcy Law

The Government has initiated an institutional overhaul of the insolvency regime in
the country. The Bankruptcy Law, supported under the DPL, was approved in 2008 and
became effective in 2009. The Law addressed the concerns identified by the Insolvency
and Creditor Rights ROSC (2006). Previous legislation was fragmented, complex, and

among regulators.

                                               20
obsolete--the applicable regime for corporation was the Concordato Preventivo Law of
1900. Processes took forever, which created a disincentive to use the regulations;
reportedly, during the 2001 crisis, enterprises (especially small and medium) closed
rather than avail themselves of the systems in place. In contrast, the new legislation
provides incentives for enterprises (manager) to initiate processes early and penalizes
delays. The law became effective immediately after approval in November 2008, because
the authorities wanted it implemented quickly to prepare for the potential effects of the
global crisis. The process of training and information dissemination is ongoing, with the
support of the Bank's Institution-building Technical Assistance Loan (IBTAL).
Fortunately, attempts to reform the bankruptcy institutions a decade ago had left in place
two specialized courts in Montevideo, which are now being equipped to implement the
new legislation.

The DPL results framework does not allow a fair assessment of the impact on the
ground of the new institutional insolvency rules. The number of insolvency cases
coming to court averaged 34 per year over 2004-06. They dropped to 20 in 2008. In 2009
the number of cases under the new law was 34 and total number of cases close to 50. This
signified a substantial increase in the number of cases with respect to 2008 and a lesser
increase with respect to the baseline set in the DPL. In retrospect, it is unclear whether
this was due to the new law or to the economic downturn that occurred in 2009. In
addition, the DPL expected an increase in the number of cases addressed satisfactorily,
and a reduction in length of time to do this. Experts have yet to agree on the definition of
"satisfactorily-resolved" cases; hence, both baselines and current measurements are
lacking. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that several cases that began in 2009 that
were covered under the new law have been completed, implying that the new law induces
faster settlements. Given the inadequacy of the indicators developed to assess programs, a
deeper analysis of the impact of the law will be needed.

A ROSC update, as foreseen under the DPL design, is needed. This update would
take thorough stock of the adequacy of the new insolvency legislation as well as the
implementation challenges, including the design of improved indicators to gauge
progress. In addition, the Update could identify needs for fine-tuning and identifying
problem areas that need attention. For instance, reportedly one of the major problems for
the two courts in Montevideo is the backlog of old cases that remained unresolved and to
which the new legislation does not apply.

3.2.3.3 Information Transparency and Disclosure

The DPL supported ongoing Government efforts to foster investor and creditor
confidence through improved corporate accounting and auditing practices and
enhanced transparency. Uruguay began implementing international accounting
standards in 1991(IAS), and in 2004 the application of IAS/IFRS (International Financial
Reporting Standards) became mandatory. A ROSC on Accounting and Auditing (2006)
acknowledged the progress that Uruguay had made up to then and identified areas that
needed attention to improve the quality of accounting practices and further encourage a
culture of transparency and disclosure.

                                            21
Large and medium enterprises are using updated IFRS accounting norms. In July
2007, Executive Decree 266/07 established IFRS norms as mandatory, beginning January
1, 2009. These norms include: (a) the requirement for enterprises to consolidate financial
statements; and (b) the requirement that enterprises provide information about third-party
transactions. Today all listed companies follow IFRS norms, as do public enterprises
(Entes Autónomos) Moreover, the Central Bank mandates that financial institutions
require from clients (enterprises) balances that follow adequate norms (IFRS), which
helps monitor compliance with them. Simplified accounting norms for small and medium
enterprises have been issued to facilitate compliance. Thus, the use of IRRS is
widespread.

The objective of enhancing transparency by making available on-line the financial
statements of large and medium enterprises has been partially met but not fully
achieved. In Uruguay, enterprises of specified size are to send their yearly balances to the
Auditoría Interna de la Nación (AIN) at the Ministry of Economy and Finance; however,
compliance with this mandate is low, because AIN does not have enforcement tools.
Although compliance has improved, it remains below 30 percent (The total number of
enterprises expected to report is about 9,000). The Government has taken steps to
improve compliance by lifting restrictions that impeded the Dirección General de
Impuestos (DGI) from providing to AIN the list of the enterprises that meet the criteria
for reporting. In addition, AIN needs the support of the Central Bank to upgrade its
capacity to build and manage the electronic registry. No time estimate is available as
when such a registry would be available on-line. Other related registries are available on-
line. For instance, the Central Bank has just setup an on-line a credit registry that
provides information on the credit status of firms and individuals.

Legislation to create a public entity responsible for issuing accounting norms and
monitoring enforcement (Ente Emisor de Normas Contables) was not approved in
Congress. PRIDPL II supported presentation to Congress for consideration draft
legislation (July 2008) establishing a new public entity that would have the technical and
financial capacity to assure a continuous updating and upgrading of accounting norms, as
well as be able to enforce compliance, including oversight over the accounting profession.
The proposed law did not make it through Congress during the last administration
because of opposition of the accounting profession. Given the difficulties in obtaining
approval for the law, and that intended work on the reform of the auditing practices did
not advance, it seems advisable to rethink how to advance the transparency and
disclosure agenda in the future. It is especially important to consolidate the leadership
agenda that to date has been divided among numerous agencies.

3.2.3.4 Reforming the Payments System

PRIDPL II highlighted the reform of the payments system as a key underpinning of
the reform of the capital markets. The IMF and the World Bank had undertaken in
2006, as part of the FSSAP, a review of the payment systems (CPSS Core Principles for
Systematically Important Payments Systems). It concluded that the legal framework in
Uruguay was incomplete, since essential elements for the development of modern

                                            22
payments and securities settlement systems were lacking. To address these shortcomings,
the Central Bank drafted a new Payments System Law, which the executive presented for
consideration by Congress, which was approved in 2009. A DPL I trigger supported
presentation for the plan to reform the Settlement and Security System.

The new Payment System Law enhanced the oversight powers of the Central Bank
on all matters relating to payments and addressed the shortcomings identified under
the 2006 FSAP. These included: the finality of settlement, protection of the systems
against bankruptcy procedures, the legal basis for netting arrangements, legal basis for
public securities, legal definition of repossession, improvement in the legal basis for
custody arrangements, and legal basis for electronic documents and documents.

With the new legislation in place, the process of establishing a modern payment
system is underway. The Central Bank has engaged 6 a vendor to design, develop and
set-up the platform for the new and modern RTGS system, which is expected to be in
place and operating by 2011. Thus, the institutional bases are in place for new payment
systems; however, the expectation under the DPL that a system would be in operation by
2010 will not be met. Parallel efforts are underway to encourage the use of the banking
system--as opposed to checks and cash, etc. With hindsight, the expectations were
ambitious, and focus on the legal overhaul alone would have sufficed. The Central Bank
plans to request a ROSC update once the new payment system is in operation, in line
with the expectations under the DPL.

Summary Assessment of 3.2.3: Business Climate and Capital Markets Development

This ICR rates the achievement of development outcomes as moderately satisfactory.
The DPL program was highly relevant and contributed to a significant overhauling of the
financial sector and the insolvency regime. However, in the area of transparency, the
reform has proceeded more slowly than expected and intended ROSC updates in various
areas have yet to take place. The overall agenda remains highly relevant to the country
and is important to ensure its sustainability.

The DPL focus on the financial sector and the investment climate was highly
relevant. By the time of the DPL design (2006-07) the banking sector had recuperated
from the 2001 crisis, but the financial sector remained small, especially the capital
markets, and the investment level relative to GDP was low. Therefore the focus on the
financial sector was relevant to the development challenges of the country as well as the
priorities of the authorities who--led by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance--
had launched a broad range of initiatives to overhaul the financial sector institutional set-
up. The authorities, however, did not outline a comprehensive strategy7 but presented the
diagnosis and initiatives as part of corresponding legal initiatives, which were taken to
Congress and various for a, as noted in the PADs for PRIDPL I and II.

    The Central Bank hired the Bank to help in the preparation of a TOR for the selection of a vendor.

    The Plan de Equidad, the main strategic document of the Government, does not outline such reform.

                                                     23
The authorities achieved the objective of overhauling the financial sector, beginning
with the revision of the Charter of the Central Bank to reiterate its autonomy and sharpen
its regulatory mandate through the creation of the Financial Sector Superintendency
within the Bank. The new Law on Payments Systems and the new Capital Markets Law
responded to the concerns that had been identified in the FSAP, the complementary
ROSCs, and other assessments. They have allowed Uruguay to become a signatory
member of IOSCO. Enterprises are using updated international accounting standards,
although the institutional gains in transparency fell short of expectations and the agenda
ahead in this area needs some rethinking. The Law on Bankruptcy addressed the ROSC
concerns and brought together a set of norms that replaced an obsolete and complex
framework and provided adequate incentives to stakeholders to address insolvency
problems early. In contrast, the transparency agenda needs to be rethought following the
failure of the law creating a specialized accounting body to pass through congress. The
Bank team suggested correctly that the proposed Doing Business indicators be dropped,
as they did not capture or reflect the DPL agenda.

However, certain design shortcomings do not allow for a summary evaluation, as
originally intended at this point. First, while various development outcomes intended to
be influenced by the program were met, it is difficult to assign a causal link to the
program. Examples are the increased level of activity in the capital markets and the high
levels of FDI inflows that have increased several-fold since 2004 to reach around 6
percent of GDP in 2008. These increases took place before the institutional changes came
about. Second, the DPL proposed the use of FSAP/ROSC updates to access institutional
progress with respect to payment systems and insolvency reform. These updates have not
taken place. Perhaps, it would have been premature to undertake them previous to the
approval of the new legislation and the commencing of its implementation. It remains
advisable to carry out these updates to assess outcomes on the ground as a prelude to a
next stage of financial sector and investment climate upgrading. In retrospect, an
alternative results framework could have better captured what was possible to achieve
during the program period.

The implementation of the agenda under this pillar is in mid-course and remains
highly relevant to the competitive challenges of Uruguay, hence the need to assure
its sustainability and extend it to cover more fully investment climate issues. With
hindsight, the design under this pillar was ambitious even if--despite the dual focus on (a)
facilitating financial sector intermediation and (b) improving the investment climate and
property rights--the DPL program centered fundamentally on a financial sector agenda.
In addition to consolidation of the financial sector agenda, a focus on competitiveness
now requires greater attention, as real wages have increased in response to a tight labor
market, skills are becoming scarce, pressure mounts on the exchange rate, and
infrastructure and logistics become constraints to the growing economy. An enhanced
strategic articulation of these issues should facilitate implementation of such an agenda
and the channeling of support by development partners.

3.2.4 Strengthening Social Protection: Highly Satisfactory

The DPL supported the Government efforts to put in place a permanent system of
social assistance under the Plan de Equidad. The 2002 crisis increased the level of
poverty, which reached a peak of 31.9 percent in 2004, with a high of extreme poverty
incidence of 3.9 percent. The level of informality in the economy had similarly increased
to reach a high of 43.6 in 2003. To address these concerns, the authorities in 2005
introduced temporary program of social assistance (PANES). Before PANES, the country
had only a partial system of social assistance with limited coverage. The idea behind
PANES was that the new system would cover the majority of the lower quintiles and
provide significant assistance. A second objective was to increase the coverage
(contributions) of the social security system.

The Government met all main the objectives, including those that the DPL
highlighted. 8 The new system of family assistance is in place and fully operating.
Legislation has been passed and its design is aligned to the realities of a country with
universal access to health and education. Thus, the design eschews a conditional cash
transfer approach; rather, it emphasizes a seamless coverage of both employed and
unemployed, and is noteworthy in that it is one of the few systems to provide a clear and
effective exit strategy. The design of the program prioritizes avoiding stigmatization. The
program one of the best targeted on the continent: 74 percent of the families in the lowest
income quintile of the population benefited from the household subsidy.

The Government expanded the coverage of the contributory system of social
security managed by the BPS. The DPL also supported the aim of a broader strategy to
reduce informality and incorporating into the formal systems the sectors and occupations
that traditionally had been informal (such as construction, agriculture, and domestic
service). The strategy of expanding the coverage of the social security system has worked
and today around 74 percent of the employed active labor force are contributing to the
system, slightly above the expectations set under the DPL of 70 percent.

Poverty incidence has been coming down rapidly: from 29.2 percent of the population
in 2005 to 20.5 percent in 2008. Similarly, absolute poverty dropped from 3.4 percent in
2005 to 1.5 in 2008. In addition, the strategy to reduce informality is working, as the
estimate is that by 2008 the share of the labor force in the informal sector dropped by
one-third compared to 2003. The drop in the rate of unemployment to a historic low of
7.6 of the labor force in 2008, rising real wages throughout the period, and well-targeted
social assistance explain the substantial drop in poverty and attest to the effectiveness of
the strategy.

This ICR rates achievements of development outcomes under this pillar as highly
satisfactory based on: (a) a sustainable social assistance program in place that targets a
high percentage of the poor, avoids stigma, and provides exit options, and (b) a

successful program of expanding coverage of social security coverage to hard-to-reach
sectors, and has contributed to reducing informality in the country. The contribution of
the Bank included analytical work, such as a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment
(PSIA), whose aim was to assess the impact of the tax reform and strengthen the capacity
of MIDES to analyze, coordinate, monitor, and evaluate social policy in Uruguay. In
addition, the Bank produced "Income Transfer Policies in Uruguay" in October 2007.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Satisfactory

The social assistance, tax reform, and the overhaul of the financial sector's institutional
framework fully justify an overall rating of satisfactory. In addition, the cooperation
between the DGI and the BPS seems exemplary, as few countries in the world have
managed to achieve this level of cooperation. Moreover, the coverage of the lowest
quintile of the population is high and the country has successfully reduced informality
and enhanced inclusiveness. It should be noted that the broad and ambitious reform of the
investment climate and financial sector was not fully realized and in some cases, such as
transparency, advanced at a pace much slower that estimated. This does not outweigh the
significant accomplishments in institution building and capacity development under
PRIDPL I and II and meeting the PDOs at the nexus of the agreed reform program

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

High and Sustainable Impact

The work undertaken by Government under the themes covered by DPL is having
high impact on social outcomes including the reduction of poverty. The main direct
contribution has been the consolidation of a broad and effective family assistance
program that, jointly with the growing economy, even through the crisis, has led to
further reduction of poverty as noted above. The Government continues to work on
consolidating the various social assistance programs around a common infrastructure
                                                          26
with the support of the Bank. In addition, gender and youth are explicitly targeted to
ensure full and equitable coverage as noted in the Plan de Equidad and Government
stocktaking. The effect on poverty is highly sustainable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

   Institutional impact is high in all areas of engagement.
    The introduction of a personal income tax and the introduction of a permanent
      family benefit are major institutional achievements that have already delivered on
      the expected institutional outcomes. In both of these areas Uruguay has put in
      place institutions that meet high quality standards and that are innovative. The
      cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the social security agency (BPS)
      is as exemplary as it is effective. The family assistance benefit is both well
      targeted and the coverage of the population with low incomes is high. The design
      of the assistance is innovative in avoiding stigma and preparing beneficiaries for
      exiting the program.
    The program also delivered a significant institutional transformation in the
      financial sector with the reform of the Charter of the Central Bank that enhanced
      and clarified its regulatory powers. The Capital Markets and the Payment System
      Law further enhanced these powers. Both of these laws addressed the weaknesses
      that previous stocktaking exercises (ROSC) had identified, as did the law on
      bankruptcy. The new law on Bankruptcy has addressed institutional shortcomings
      and the new framework in place tie/freeze productive assets.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Moderate

The overall risk to development outcome was mitigated by a number of measures
associated with the PRIDPL II. Risks were economic, political, and social risks, as well
as managerial, sustainability and outcome relative to program implementation. Economic
risks were mitigated by the Government acting to reduce public sector debt vulnerability,
specifically by focusing on macroeconomic stability and reforms to strengthen the
financial system. Political risks were attenuated by the PRIDPL program being country-
driven and supporting key reforms identified by government as priority and through
Uruguay's tradition of consensus building. The main social risk was the potential for

                                           27
labor relations to worsen, particularly if growth rates slow. The government's expansion
of social protection programs and its augmentation of social spending, particularly in the
areas of health and education, offset the risks of labor unrest as does the government's
commitment to collective bargaining and to raising real wages to pre-crisis levels.
Managerial risks for the PRIDPL I operation related to implementing new programs,
particularly the tax reform, and operating information systems because of possible
shortages of trained human resources. It was mitigated by Government efforts to
strengthen capacity in implementing agencies and in the executive branch overall. The
IBTAL operation that accompanied the PRIDPL I to the Board in May 2007, together
with related technical assistance from other donors, strengthened the implementation of
information systems and processes related to the implementation of PRIDPL policies.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Bank responded to the Government request with innovative design. The first
loan was in pesos---since then the percentage of debt in pesos has gone up reducing the
exposure in foreign currency. The shift to local currency is noted by rating agencies as a
factor contributing to a better bond rating. The second loan was provided to be available
for draw-down over a three year period and the amount of the loan was increased first to
three hundred and then to four hundred as the global crisis mounted. With fresh
memories of the 2002 crisis Uruguay took action to shield itself by advancing resources
that would allow the authorities to maintain an adequate level of reserves while avoiding
any liquidity problem in the payment of budget obligations. The contributed analytical
work was high quality and aided the design of several Government initiatives supported
under the DPL series.

However, the results framework was uneven. It was strong in areas where the
Government had identified clear and quantifiable program and weak in areas of financial
sector and investment climate, where the emphasis was on institution building, which is
far more difficult in tracking progress, and also takes longer to achieve results. The
intention to measure results from the ROSC framework was risky because of asymmetry
between results on the ground and the timing of the proposed ROSC update, which
presumes implementation of prescribed outcomes.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Bank closely monitored progress of the PRIDPL. The PRIDPL missions
coincided with the IBTAL supervision missions, as the TA related directly to achieving
program outcome indicators. This led to satisfactory supervision based on the close
                                           28
linkage between the two operations Moreover, the Bank assigned staff to the local office
in Montevideo specifically to ensure close monitoring and evaluation of PRIDPL
program progress.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. The program was anchored in solid
analytical work and the triggers served to guide program implementation. It was also
assisted by well coordinated dialog with the Borrowers. In addition, the Bank supported
the program through technical assistance and periodic visits by technical experts, upon
the request of the Government.

5.2 Borrower Performance

The Borrower's performance is satisfactory.

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Government had a clear strategy, which it presented in the Plan de Equidad. The
commitment to this strategy was high and the Government assigned the technical
resources and sought support as needed to implement the strategy on time. The
Government fully owned and was committed to implementing the agenda. Although the
financial sector and investment climate agenda lacked a similarly well-articulated public
strategy, the institutional legal reform initiatives, most of which became reality, revealed
that the design of the DPL was well aligned with the priorities of Government.

There also was a highly committed and competent team commensurate with the scope of
the ambitions reform agenda, However, this meant that program success was also
dependent on leadership and champions of the targeted development areas (such as the
MEF and the Central Bank) and less progress might be expected where the leadership
was dispersed, in the transparency agenda, for example, and the insolvency reform efforts.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The leadership and clarity of vision at the core of the strategy, reflected in the Plan de
Equidad, enabled the Borrower to sustain the requisite support for PPRIDPL I and II.

6. Lessons Learned

   Clear allocation of responsibilities is crucial to timely implementation of
   programs and effective realization of PDOs and related indicators. The
   involvement of the Central Bank, the MEF (DGI), and MIDES meant that the lines of
   responsibility were clear and leadership paths well defined. In contrast, in the case of
   transparency and insolvency, ambiguous assignment of responsibilities meant that
   meeting outcomes became less assured. In practice, a clear allocation of
   responsibilities is aided by well-articulated strategic framework, such as the Plan de
   Equidad.
   The results framework needs to be realistic to provide a fair measure of progress
   and achievement without compromising the credibility of the program. In the
   case of taxation and social assistance, indicators were well articulated and could be
   measured, and the authorities expressed confidence that the Bank was supporting
   their main program vision, as embodied in the Plan de Equidad. In the absence of an
   equally well-articulated strategy, such as in the case of the financial and capital
   markets and insolvency component, tracking success through the results framework
   was not straightforward because the proposed instrument could not be implemented
   and/or because the intended results were not well linked to the overall program
   outcomes.
   A DPL can be an important and effective instrument to build and deepen the
   relationship between the Bank and the Borrower. By aligning the priorities of the
   DPL with the Government agenda and tailoring the program to suit local conditions,
   this PRIDPL moved the dialog forward and eased any apprehension that might have
   existed during the initial stages of DPL development. This was achieved in Uruguay
   because the Bank worked closely with the Government to ensure that it was satisfied
   that its reform objectives, articulated in its Plan de Equidad and related documents,
   would be realized, with the Bank as an active partner.
