F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
To facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for climate change adaptation in
CARICOM small island and coastal developing states (the participating countries are:
Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Cooperative
Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, St. Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago).

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
 The GEO was not modified. However, the project was restructured in 2007 to 1) focus
Component 2 Subcomponent 2#Development of climate change adaptation approaches
for selected sectors and upgrading EIAs#on specific sectors in the selected countries due
to a significant delay in the project implementation; 2) to cancel Component 2
Subcomponent 3#Development of appropriate technical norms for infrastructure in
response to climate change concerns#to avoid unnecessary duplication with two other
Bank-supported projects. Consequently, the output indicators were modified to reflect
these changes. (See Intermediate Indicator 10)

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
The objective of the Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change Project (MACC) was
to facilitate an enabling environment for climate change adaptation in the Caribbean
Community small islands, and coastal developing states participating in this project. The
12 participating countries are: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,
Dominica, Grenada, Cooperative Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, St. Christopher and
Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Project
components would be focused on: 1) building regional capacity to collect and analyze
data, thus expanding the knowledge base on climate change impacts in order to assess the
associated physical, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities; 2) building in-country capacity to
formulate, and analyze adaptation policy options based on vulnerability assessments, and
generation of sectoral adaptation strategies for participating countries; 3) building
capacity in preparation for a regional position for the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and therefore providing member countries
with a consolidated position in the international forum that would enhance the region's
visibility on relevant policy decisions. In addition, a regional strategy would be
developed, which would include the preparation of business plans, and mobilization of
resources; and, 4) supporting public education and outreach programs, by strengthening
information access and data resources, and, fostering public awareness, through technical
assistance and capacity building.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Sector-related country assistance strategy (CAS) goal. The objective of the project
was well aligned with the goals of several CASs in the region. For example, the CAS for
the Eastern Caribbean (June 2001) highlighted the serious impacts that global climate
change could have on OECS small island developing states (SIDS). The CAS for Guyana
clearly identified breaches of sea defenses and corresponding flooding as a threat to
settlements and economic activities in coastal areas. It emphasized upgrading quality
standards for road maintenance to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters. It also
suggested the development of a disaster management strategy as a key to sustainable
economic development. The Jamaica CAS identified improving disaster preparedness as
one of the key elements in its overall poverty reduction and economic development
strategy. It articulated the need for a regional approach to disaster management, including
building adequate human resource capacity to deal with such contingencies. The Trinidad
and Tobago CAS suggested developing a regional agenda for dealing with disaster
management and climate change impacts.

GEF Operational Criteria. The project as designed was consistent with the GEF
operational criteria for enabling activities under the UNFCCCC. It was a Stage II activity,
as defined under the UNFCCC and the Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions, and it
was also consistent with the July 2001 guidelines issued by COP on climate change
adaptation and capacity building. Stage II activities as envisaged in Article 4.1 of the

                                             1
UNFCCC include "measures, including further capacity building, which may be taken to
prepare for adaptation". The project focused on creating an enabling environment for
climate change adaptation to occur on a sustainable basis, as part of a broader approach to
sequence activities to address climate change issues. This project was designed to build
on the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Program of Adaptation initiated in 1997 with
the World Bank-funded Stage I Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Climate Change
Project (CPACC) and the CIDA-funded Stage I Adaptation to Climate Change in the
Caribbean Project (ACCC).

Main Sector Issues. Caribbean countries, especially the small islands and/or low-lying
states, are economically, socially and environmentally vulnerable, and climate variability
and change tend to exacerbate this vulnerability. Most projections at the regional level
which, at the time of appraisal, were reasonably robust suggested that Caribbean
countries were expected to suffer permanent climate shocks including: 1) sea level rise
and higher surface air and sea temperatures, 2) extreme weather events, such as tropical
storms and hurricanes, and more "El Niño-like" conditions which were also expected to
become either more frequent or more severe, or both, and 3) increased intensity of rain,
leading to both more frequent and more severe flooding events. These permanent shocks
and changes in extreme events were expected to result in loss of livelihood, and to affect
the region's resource base, damaging natural ecosystems and man-made infrastructure.
These changes in the region's resource base would have direct impacts on their
economies.

Over the last three decades, these countries have suffered direct and indirect losses due to
natural disasters that were estimated to be between US$700 million to US$3.3 billion
(2002 Report by Inter-American Development Bank on Natural Disasters in Latin
America and Caribbean). An estimate of the potential economic consequences of the
impacts of climate change on the economies of Caribbean countries at the time of
appraisal (Haites, 2002), in a "no-adaptation" scenario, ranged from 5% to over 30% of
GDP on average (annualized values) with an even broader range for some individual
countries.

Those sectors at greatest risk from the anticipated deleterious impacts of climate change
were tourism, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, all of which contribute significantly to
the Caribbean SIDS' economies. With poor preparedness or adoption of a reactive
adaptation strategy, there is a clear risk in the event of extreme climate that the Caribbean
SIDS economies might have ended up diverting scarce resources meant for development
projects to relief and reconstruction from extreme climate change related disasters,
therefore, setting back economic growth. Indeed following the 2004 devastation brought
about by Hurricane Ivan, most Caribbean countries were forced to reallocate critical
resources towards relief and reconstruction efforts.

Environmental degradation further exacerbates the socio-economic impacts of climate
change. There are linkages (direct and indirect) between environmental degradation and
poverty, and the low-income populations and communities that tend to be particularly
adversely affected because they are usually settled on lands that are more vulnerable to

                                              2
climate change related disasters (e.g., storms and floods). Limited resources or
inadequate land ownership and tenure patterns tend to induce the poor to settle on
unstable/steep slopes, riverbanks and low-lying coastal areas. In addition, open access to
some resources, such as fishing grounds or fertile soils on volcanic slopes has prompted
settlements in hazardous locations. Impacts of climate change would therefore likely be
more intense for the poorer sections of the populations in these countries.

Thus, if sustainable pro-poor development was to be achieved in the SIDS' economies,
these countries needed to manage the impacts emanating from expected climate change.
Following the same risk management approach to natural hazards, for which there was
considerable level of experience in the region, risk management of climate change
required to follow three general steps: (i) risk identification (climate change vulnerability
and risk assessment), (ii) risk reduction (adaptation strategy to climate change), and (iii)
risk share/transfer (meet the costs of adaptation to climate change).

Main issues relating to the identification of vulnerability to climate change focused on the
fact that: existing Climate Change models were global in nature; there was limited data
on climate and sea-level monitoring, including monitoring of coral-reefs, which feeds
into the climate change projection; the knowledge base to effectively perform climate
change impact assessment on SIDS' ecosystems was weak; and human skills and
institutional capacity in each of the Caribbean SIDS was inadequate.

Several factors influencing the potential for reducing vulnerability to climate change
included: the perception that climate change management was the sole responsibility of
government, the fact that adaptation to climate change had not been mainstreamed into
the planning and development processes, the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral
approach to implement the national climate change adaptation policies related to specific
sectors, and the weakness of the enforcement of existing policies and programs that guide
development and investment decisions.

Finally issues relating to Climate Change risk sharing and financing mechanisms which
needed to be addressed included: the inability to differentiate between climate change
risks (the negative) on the one hand and climate change opportunities (the good); the high
cost of insurance for climate hazards (e.g., hurricanes), and the inadequate preparedness
of the Caribbean countries to access UNFCCC and other financial mechanisms for
climate change adaptation action at national and regional levels.

In order to address these sector issues, the project would build capacity and knowledge
base, consolidating the achievements of CPACC and adopting a "learning-by-doing"
approach to capacity building, to better identify climate change vulnerabilities and
concomitant risk, reduce their vulnerability to climate change by focusing on building the
national capacity to identify policy issues and measures for adaptation to climate change,
and effectively access and utilize resources to reduce vulnerability to climate variability
and change. The project would support: (a) the mainstreaming of adaptation to climate
change into national and sectoral planning and policies; (b) a strong public education and
outreach program, and a comprehensive communications strategy; and (c) creation of an

                                              3
enabling environment for adaptation to climate change in the region. However,
strengthening of the insurance sector was eventually addressed by a parallel World Bank
project, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) which became
effective in May 2007. An initial 2002 attempt by the Bank to pilot this activity had
failed due to the unwillingness of the OECS countries to borrow funds to cover the cost
of a feasibility study. Following the 2004 devastation by Hurricane Ivan, there was a
renewed interest in a Caribbean-wide catastrophe insurance pool, which then led to the
initiation of CCRIF. CCRIF has effectively helped reduce the OECS countries'
vulnerability to natural disasters (especially earthquakes and hurricanes) by lowering the
cost of insurance.

Rationale for Bank Assistance.

Adaptation to climate change is multidimensional since it encompasses various short-
term and long-term activities in different sectors. The ability of a community/country to
adapt to climate change depends on the extent of climate change, as well as on available
technical, financial, institutional and other capacity. Hence, adaptive capacity is
influenced by a variety of factors such as education (general and specific), health care,
financial resources, scientific information and understanding of climate change,
availability of technologies, techniques and practical tools for various sectors and natural
resources management, etc. However, adaptive capacity, in and of itself, does not
guarantee adaptation actions. Adaptation occurs when in addition to adaptive capacity
there is also political will and formal/institutional mechanisms that enable adaptation
actions. While the whole scope of adaptation needs is not known, current knowledge is
based on experience and available projections of climate change and social factors. Thus,
new needs may arise that will require new adaptation strategies or urgent actions.
Consequently, adaptation should be seen as a dynamic and evolving process. MACC
project is a contribution to this process in the Caribbean.

The World Bank would bring to this project its considerable capacity to address climate
change related environmental issues and its ability to convene governments around issues
of common concern. The Bank had gained substantial knowledge on adaptation issue
from the experience of implementing of the CPACC project. UNFCCC (COP1, Decision
11/CP.1) guidance has defined a three stage approach to adaptation actions. Stage I
(short-term) includes studies of possible impacts of climate change, identification of
particularly vulnerable countries or regions, policy options for adaptation, and capacity
building. Stage II includes measures to prepare for adaptation while Stage III includes
measures to facilitate adequate adaptation, including insurance, and other adaptation
investments (see Figure 1).1 Since the MACC project is a logical development from
Stage I--Building awareness and strengthening knowledge base through CPACC
project-- to Stage II--Creation of an enabling environment for adaptation--, the Bank
was ideally suited to provide support through MACC project.

The Bank would provide the recipient with access to climate change related initiatives in
other regions, the sector work on adaptation by low-lying areas, and the development
policies and regulations on climate change used in other regions. Likewise, the sector
work on optimization of participation in the Clean Development Mechanism, undertaken
under the aegis of the National Strategic Studies partnership in Colombia, Argentina, and
Bolivia would be useful in the discussions leading to adoption of regional positions at the
UNFCCC Conference of the Parties meetings.

Innovation and Timing
It is important to recognize that the MACC project was innovative and conceptualized at
a time when climate change adaptation was barely being addressed in other Regions of
the Bank or indeed outside the Bank. The project was developed at a critical time when
the UNFCCC was developing a framework as part of a new round of enabling activities
to assist in the preparation of second National Communications by developing countries




                                             5
and the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA), and to carry out the studies
on Statge II adaptation. The project was one of a few post-first generation/advanced Stage
II studies done in selected regions and countries2 that offer knowledge and experience to the
new round of adaptation analysis and research. Although not done under a common
methodological framework, these studies have indeed moved adaptation analysis forward and
have made this type of analysis part of the policy development process.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project aimed to facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for climate change
adaptation in CARICOM small island and coastal developing states. The 12 participating
countries are: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Cooperative Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, St. Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.
The key performance indicators are:
    Strengthened regional knowledge base measured by;
          o 90% of the stations reporting with 90% reliability,
          o Wide dissemination of climate change related data and documentation,
          o Models, databases, vulnerability assessments and adaptation approach
              developed under the project are found useful by potential
              users/beneficiaries who are also willing to use them, and are assessed of
              satisfactory quality;
    A large constituency of sectoral specialists equipped and trained to incorporate
      climate change concerns into their work (vulnerability and risk assessment,
      economic analysis, policy aspects, adaptation options and the use of a risk
      management framework to determine the best options available, and the
      development of a strategy to implement these);
    Public awareness to climate change issues and impacts enhanced;
    National Sectoral Adaptation Strategies and Implementation Action Plans,
      developed in a participatory fashion with stakeholders, are presented to Cabinet,
      or being considered in appropriate committees/commissions3;
    Plans prepared for more effective enforcement of existing policies and
      regulations, especially where these have implications for addressing climate
      change concerns;
    Regional coordination on climate change issues improved and access to risk
      sharing mechanisms like the UNFCCC increased.

Specifically, MACC as a successor project to CPACC would : (i) develop scientific knowledge
and strengthen local capacity to generate and analyze scientific information, (ii) further promote
public awareness on climate change, (iii) increase local capacity to undertake vulnerability
assessments in key sectors, (iv) increase local capacity to develop sectoral adaptation strategies,

authority) and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The GEO and key outcome indicators were not modified.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project include the:
 region and the individual Caribbean SIDS and low-lying coastal countries, and the
   global environment, through protection of infrastructure, human life, and natural
   resources.
 12 participating countries, which would use the methodologies developed and refined
   under the project to mainstream climate change risk management activities into
   national planning and development processes, and implement sectoral adaptation
   strategies.
 Caribbean region, which would benefit from more comprehensive climate change
   forecasting techniques and be better prepared for climate change related disasters.
   The region would also be able to benefit from pooled insurance possibilities in the
   light of better "self insurance" measures adopted by the public and private sectors,
   and a more dispersed (geographical and hazard-type) risk resulting in lower
   premiums for risk insurance.
 public and private sectors, which would be able to: (a) make better-informed
   decisions on location of infrastructure based on more accurate hazard impact data; (b)
   better protect assets through incorporating risk-responsive structural standards; and
   (c) benefit from wider insurance coverage, insurance and financing incentives, and
   lower insurance rates.
 populations, and in particular the coastal populations which comprise about 60% or
   more of the 5.2 million population in the small SIDS countries, which are particularly
   vulnerable to climate change risks and extreme events. In some countries (i.e.
   Guyana), some 90% of the population resides on the coastal plains. The
   implementation of national climate change adaptation strategies focusing on
   environmental, physical, economic and social vulnerabilities of the Caribbean SIDS,
   should reduce the vulnerability of this group of countries to climate change.
 donor community, which through strategic programming of resources, improved
   coordination in project/program implementation, and consolidation through the next
   level projects, would be able to achieve greater-national and regional impacts.
 regional institutions, such as CARICOM, UWI, CDERA, etc. would be strengthened
   through increased synergy among projects implemented in the area of climate change
   and disaster management.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)


                                                 7
Component 1: Build Capacity to Assess Vulnerability and Risks Associated with Climate
Change (Total US$4.88 m: GEF US$2.32 m)

This component would build regional capacity to collect and analyze data, and expand
the overall knowledge base on climate change impacts and associated physical, social and
economic vulnerabilities. The first four sub-components would operate at the regional
level, and would focus on strengthening and expanding the knowledge base as a sound
platform for analysis and decision making at the national and local levels. The fifth sub-
component would draw upon the information and techniques developed under the first
four sub-components.

The countries where the studies would be implemented would be selected based on an
agreed set of criteria (an indicative list is provided in Annex 2 of the PAD). Non-study
countries would still benefit from the vulnerability and risk assessment exercises by: (a)
participating, as members, in the country teams conducting the vulnerability assessment
studies to actually use the harmonized approaches, and in the dissemination and training
workshops; and (b) adapting the outputs of such assessments to their own country
sectoral settings to evolve appropriate sectoral adaptation strategies. The project would
widely disseminate the outputs of the climate projection and impacts assessment
modeling exercise, and the harmonized approach to vulnerability and risk assessment. It
would build capacity by strengthening regional and national agencies and having them as
coordinating agencies for identified activities, imparting information about the models
and the approach to the country teams, and training these teams in their use by actual
participation with expert consultants in the country level sectoral vulnerability and risk
assessment studies.

Sub-components:
   1.1      Strengthening the climate and coral reef monitoring network;
   1.2      Downscaling global climate models in support of decision making for
            adaptation at the regional and country levels;
   1.3      Generating climate change impact scenarios;
   1.4      Developing a harmonized approach for assessing climate change
            vulnerability and risk, and adaptation policy decision making.
   1.5      Preparing vulnerability and risk assessment studies for selected countries,
            or groups of countries, in key economic sectors (tourism, water resources
            and agriculture), focusing on coastal areas.


Component 2: Build Capacity to Reduce Vulnerability to Climate Change (Total
US$2.15 m: GEF US$0.73 m)

This component would build in-country capacity to formulate and analyze adaptation
policy options and finalize sectoral adaptation strategies which would be prepared for all
participating countries: (i) for those countries where the vulnerability and risk assessment
studies are implemented (directly), and (ii) for non-study countries (indirectly), through
derived vulnerability assessments based on lessons learned from the country-level

sectoral studies. The adaptation strategies for the non-study countries would be informed
by the outcomes of the field-based vulnerability studies. The project would build capacity
for developing adaptation strategies through training of country teams, having them
participate with consultants in the actual strategy development exercise for 3 pilot sectors
(i.e., agriculture, tourism and water) in 4 countries, and providing technical assistance to
country teams to extend their hands-on training to develop other sector adaptation
strategies in other participating countries.

Sub-components:
    2.1 Identification of "no regrets" adaptation measures for all countries (carried out
        in parallel with, and informed by, the vulnerability assessment studies);
    2.2 Development of adaptation approaches to food security, water, health and
        fishery sectors, and incorporation of climate change concerns relating to
        environmental impact assessments;
    2.3 Development of recommendations relating to upgrading technical norms for
        infrastructure in response to climate change concerns, including risk reduction
        incentives by the insurance and banking industry; and
    2.4 Finalization of country level multi-sectoral adaptation strategies based on the
        vulnerability and risk assessment studies, and inputs from the three sub-
        components 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 above.


Component 3: Build Capacity to Effectively Access & Utilize Resources to Reduce
Vulnerability to Climate Change (Total US$0.42 m: GEF US$0.18 m)

The objective of this component was to provide support for the development of a regional
agenda and a regional strategy through two sub-components. The first sub-component
would build the regional capacity to prepare a regional position for the UNFCCC and
other international fora to enhance the region's visibility and influence on relevant
negotiations and policy decisions. The second sub-component would assist with the
development of a regional strategy to improve regional coordination and harmonization
on climate change adaptation and policy making, while strengthening the region's ability
to mobilize and utilize effectively financial resources provided through the UNFCCC and
other external financing mechanisms.
     3.1 Development of a Regional Agenda
     3.2 Development of a Regional Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change

Component 4: Public Education & Outreach (Total US$2.10 m: GEF US$0.59 m)

This component would support a public education and outreach (PEO) program geared
towards improving decision-making, encouraging policy changes where required,
strengthening information access and data resources for key stakeholders, disseminating
project-generated data and information, and fostering public awareness about the
potential impacts of climate change. Key areas of focus would be: (a) to facilitate a
participatory process in the development, discussion, finalization, and dissemination of
the outputs of the other project components such as climate projection and impacts

                                             9
assessment models, vulnerability and risk assessment strategies, adaptation strategies,
technical norms and upgrading in the construction industry; and (b) establish a clearing
house of information which would facilitate both access to information by the
stakeholders, and dissemination of information by the PIU. The project would build
capacity at the regional and national level by participatory approaches to the formulation
and implementation of PEO strategies, and training the national PEO teams in the latest
techniques of PEO.

Sub-components:
    4.1 Finalizing the regional PEO strategy, and developing national PEO strategies;
    4.2 Implementing the regional PEO strategy;
    4.3 Implementing the national level PEO strategies; and
    4.4 Undertaking a mid-term and final evaluation of the effectiveness of the PEO
        strategies, inputs and activities of this component.

Component 5: Project Management (Total US$1.38 m: GEF US$1.18 m)
This component would provide support to CARICOM and the PIU for the efficient and
timely execution of the project, including project administration as well as planning,
monitoring, and evaluating project activities over the duration of the project. The
component would finance the required consultancies, training, auditing, and operating
costs.


1.6 Revised Components
A second-order restructuring was approved in 2007. (See details under 2.2
Implementation)
Component 2. Subcomponent 2.2--Developing climate change adaptation approaches
for selected sectors and upgrading EIAs--was modified to focus explicitly on a group of
selected participating countries and sectors: agriculture in Guyana, tourism in Barbados,
and water in Jamaica and Belize. The relevant outcome indicators were modified to
reflect the scope of the activity in the four countries:
       Country-level Sector Adaptation Strategies prepared for only four countries and in
       specific sectors, namely Barbados (Tourism), Guyana (Agriculture), Jamaica and
       Belize (Water),
       Institutional analysis for implementation of the adaptation strategies in the
       countries and sectors specified above,
       Action Plan to support implementation fo the Country level sector adaptation
       strategy in selected countries and sectors as specified above,
       Training programs conducted to build capacity for adaptation plan preparation
       process in Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Belize.
Sub-component 2.3 to develop appropriate technical norms for infrastructure in response
to climate change concerns, including incentives for risk reduction measures through
insurance was dropped from the project. Part of this activity ws taken up by other Bank

                                            10
supported projects such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)
Project which sought to reduce the participating country's financial vulnerability to
natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) by providing financing to allow
participating countries to join the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility.
Based on the above, the modified Sub-component 2.2 under Component 2, read:
Development of climate change adaptation approaches in the following sectors and
Participating Countries: (i) tourism in Barbados; (ii) agriculture in Guyana; and (iii)
water in Jamaica and Belize based on the activities described in Part A.6(a) of the
Project; (b) provision of technical assistance to the governments of Barbados, Belize,
Jamaica, and Guyana in developing sector-specific adaptation strategies identified in the
foregoing clause (a) and based on the results of the activities under Part A.6(a) of the
Project; and (c) dissemination of the results, through meetings and publications to all
Participating Countries, national focal points (climate change and GEF), and key
stakeholders.

Component 4 was also slightly modified to reflect the reduced role of MACC in
implementing the national PEO strategies directly in the participating countries. Instead,
the project would provide support to the countries in the implementation of their national
PEO programs.


1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
Implementation History:
The project had a complicated implementation history. MACC essentially had two lives
and two separate homes (PIUs). The first half (3 years) and home (CARICOM
Secretariat) of the project including Bank supervision of the project were plagued with
major shortcomings in the operation in terms of implementation efficiency and achieving
objectives. These shortcomings led to the restructuring of the project and transfer to a
different home (PIU). The second half (last 23 months), home (Caribbean Community
Climate Change Change (CCCCC) and Bank supervision of the project were markedly
different and effective in turning the project around and achieving significant outcomes.
Implementation Arrangements:
Following the project's restructuring, the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center
(CCCCC) was selected upon mutual agreement between the Bank and the CARICOM
Secretariat (CCS) as the new MACC Project Implementing Agency and Recipient of the
Grant funds, replacing CCS in its initial role. The role of the CCCCC as the coordinating
agency for the region's response to climate change made it the ideal candidate to
implement the Project. Moreover, the CCCCC had knowledgeable technical staff on
climate issues and had successfully implemented the PDF-B for the GEF project
"Implementation of adaptation measures in coastal zones", approved by the World Bank
on September 07, 2006. A new institutional arrangement was approved by the Bank as
part of the second-order restructuring in April 2007.

                                            11
The CARICOM Secretariat continued to play an important role in the implementation of
the project, by guiding the project, chairing its Project Advisory Committee, and lending
necessary support when needed.
Reallocation of Proceeds:
Re-allocation of the proceeds of the GEF Trust Fund Grant was first made to take into
account the modifications to the Components as a result of the Project's Mid-term review
(MTR). Later, minor reallocations were made among the disbursement categories. (See
Annex 1 for revised schedule).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
Soundness of Background information
The background analysis made a clear case for the relevance of climate change in
exacerbating the economic, social and environmental vulnerability of Caribbean countries.
It also identified the keys issues, where the project would have an important role, in the
process to assess vulnerability to climate change as well as in risk reduction and
management.
Lessons from Earlier Operations
A key lesson learned and reflected in the proposed project was the sequencing of the
activities to address climate change issues, given the long-term horizon over which these
initiatives had to be phased in. The MACC project was designed to create an enabling
environment for adaptation, building upon the results of the CPACC project--building
awareness and strengthening the knowledge base. There was a crucial and immediate
need to build an enabling environment to embrace climate change adaptation policies in
order for the investment stage to be effectively implemented.

Another central lesson learned and reflected in the project design has to do with the
fundamental need to mainstream climate change issues into national sustainable
development strategies. While good progress had been made under CPACC and other
projects in technical capacity building and institutional strengthening, climate change
issues were still not generally a part of the mainstream policy dialogue at the national
level.

A related issue is the need to expand climate change monitoring and impact assessment
as a basis for national and regional decision making. CPACC and other projects in this
area have underscored the need for region-specific climate models for the Caribbean in
order to make more accurate projections about climate change impacts, and develop
appropriate strategies in individual countries.

                                                12
Other regional projects have underscored the importance of an effective regional
coordination mechanism to address system-wide transboundary issues. CPACC was
instrumental in taking the first step in establishing a regional network of national
government agencies, private sector representatives and regional institutions addressing
climate change and its effect on economic, social and cultural development in the
Caribbean region.

In order to effectively mainstream climate change into development planning, strong
national institutions such as the finance, planning, economic ministries and line agencies
need to be involved. Keeping the climate change agendas within the environmental
agencies has not led to effective mainstreaming of these issues into key development
policy decisions. The project attempted to address this issue through the development of a
regional policy framework, evolving sectoral policies for climate change management,
setting the stage at the end of the project for multi-sectoral planning for climate change
risk management, and the technical support and capacity building efforts for line ministry
and national agency staff.


Assessment of Risks
Risks were identified covering those associated with the regional nature of the project,
sustainability of monitoring equipment and capacity, inadequate capacity building to
participate in vulnerability assessments and developing sectoral adaptation strategies, the
cross-sectoral nature of climate change impacts, and institutional complexity. However,
the risk matrix in the original project appraisal document did not cover the risks
associated with the project's complexity, multiple actors, excessively broad scope, or
weak implementation capacity. In addition, lack of experience in executing large
projectst by the CARICOM Secretariat should have been identified as a high risk, and the
mitigation measures put in place should have been more rigorous than those undertaken.
Finally, a further risk that was not accounted for was availability of an empowered
regional coordinating unit with the capacity to convene and mobilize different
stakeholders who had their own legitimate agendas, limited monetary and human
resources, and capacity to manage the considerable number of activities with complex
arrangements.
Adequacy of Government's commitment
Preparation of the project was participatory in nature, with all relevant agencies
contributing to the project design.
Experience in CPACC had shown the high level of involvement of the different
governments on the issue of climate change. Specifically, governments had committed
resources to assign National Focal Points4 and National Implementation Coordinating

 The National Focal Points for MACC are the same persons as the UNFCCC Focal Points except for
Antigua.

                                                13
Units. Also, under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Enabling
Activities project, all participating countries had completed their first National
Communications. All of these communications identified adaptation to climate change as
a high priority issue for the region, and supported the regional approach adopted for
implementation of CPACC; this same approach is the one followed in MACC Project.
At the national level, the initial national communication reports from CARICOM
countries requested support for a second regional project (as a follow-up to CPACC), to
continue capacity building and technical assistance in the area of climate change, and to
further strengthen the adaptation process.
At the regional level, therefore, the CARICOM Heads of Government approved a
resolution during their meeting in July 2000, authorizing the then implementation team of
the CPACC project to submit a request to the GEF to support the development of a full
proposal to continue the process of adaptation. The CARICOM Heads of Government
also endorsed a resolution calling for the establishment of institutional capacity to
champion adaptation policies and to coordinate climate change activities in the region.
Assessment of the project design
As earlier noted, it is recognized that mainstreaming adaptation to climate change is a
continuous process that will require constant effort and strong ownership by different
countries and regional institutions. As such the project was designed to fill considerable
gaps and to play a key role in contributing to this process.
Components were clearly defined and each component has a specific target reflecting the
lessons learnt from previous operations with the common objective of advancing the
process of mainstreaming adaptation to climate change considerations into country policy,
planning and development processes.
Nevertheless, the project design was overly-ambitious for the existing capacity of the
recipient and the government counterparts. The project intended to carry out too many
activities which made execution cumbersome for the Recipient. Furthermore, the regional
nature of the project added complexity to the execution of the project.
Even if climate change had been recognized by all countries as an important issue in their
development agenda, it was still not at the forefront, and therefore, there was a chance
that stakeholders would not be as empowered (financial resources, capacity, and technical
inputs) as needed in the implementation of the activities supported by the project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
Key Findings of the MTR
In August 2006, representatives of the CARICOM Secretariat including the PIU staff, the
Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, and the World Bank met in Barbados and
conducted the MTR. The key findings were as follows:
        The project objective to mainstream adaptation to climate impacts into the
        development process remained valid and more urgent than ever.

                                               14
        The project was significantly behind schedule, as it was reflected in a slow
        disbursement rate and delay in achieving important results as measured by key
        indicators. The delays were caused mainly by (i) slow disbursement due to
        CARICOM Secretariat's internal processes and complex communication
        protocols; (ii) delay in filling the vacancy of Technical Coordinator up until the
        MTR; (iii) some services and equipment for monitoring provided by the co-
        financier were delayed beyond control of the project; (iv) difficult access to
        required baseline data to develop climate change scenarios, (v) underestimation of
        the time necessary for completion of the climate change model runs, and (vi) slow
        and difficult communication between, and participation of, key stakeholders
        executing the project.
        By the time of MTR, half of the project resources had already been spent, but the
        achieved progress was not commensurate with the resources expended.
        An independent assessment commissioned by the CARICOM Secretariat
        concluded that corrective actions were required to bring the project back on
        schedule and to reduce the risk of non-performance.
        Country participation and the identification of local champions would be essential
        for success in field activities and for the formulation of adaptation policy options,
        sectoral adaptation strategies and vulnerability and risk assessment.
        Public Education and Outreach remained central to the mainstreaming objective.
        But remaining resources are not commensurate with the work yet to be completed.
        A one year extension of the closing date to September 2008 would be necessary to
        achieve the project objectives.
Restructuring of the project
As a result of the MTR, the CARICOM Secretariat and the World Bank with the
concurrence of the CCCCC agreed and implemented the following corrective actions:
        Slightly revised components (as described in section 1.6 above);
        Revised management structure: CARICOM Secretariat and the Bank agreed to
        transfer project execution responsibilities to the Caribbean Community Climate
        Change Center in Belize.
        CARICOM Secretariat would continue to guide the project and chair its Project
        Advisory Committee which was also decided to be restructured in order to speed
        up their decision-making process.5
        Revised project staffing: The revised structure was designed to take advantage of
        the existing tasks of the CCCCC and to keep a lean management structure. The
        project supported a junior technical assistant and procurement staff, and financial
        management staff. Administrative support was provided by the CCCCC.



5
 The restructuring included a higher-level involvement of the CARICOM Secretariat in order to speed up
decision-making. Also, the meetings were chaired by the Secretariat.


                                                  15
       Public Education and Outreach program targeted key audiences to disseminate
       main project results instead of implementation of the developed strategy.
       Extension of the closing date (to September 2008)
       Revised work plan produced, which emphasized activities in the field and
       engagement of local partners (champions) who were considered essential for
       success in field activities and in particular to formulate and facilitate the
       mainstreaming recommendations of the vulnerability and risk assessments,
       adaptation policy options, and sectoral adaptation strategies for selected countries.
Implementation in general after the Restructuring
Project implementation improved under the CCCCC as the executing agency. The rate of
disbursements picked up as formally revised during the restructuring. The CCCCC and
the Bank exercised frequent assessment of progress through monthly audio conferences
and frequent missions. The progress report prepared by the project manager of the
CCCCC provided information on the status of implementation, disbursement and
commitments of all activities supported by the project, as well as the identification of key
issues, tasks and bottlenecks, for which the task team would take immediate action to
help resolve.
Second Extension of Closing Date: The transfer of Special Account from the CARICOM
Secretariat to the CCCCC was delayed, consequently delaying the full execution of the
activities by the latter. In the meantime, the CCCCC used their own funds to continue
carrying out some of the activities until the transfer was completed and they started
receiving funds from the Bank. However, this delay affected the rate of implementation,
and a second extension of the closing date was required to complete the priority activities.
A six-month extension until March 2009 was requested and granted. But it turned out that
even this second extension was not adequate to allow the finalization of certain project
activities that required more time to obtain results, such as the development of regional
linkage of the national sector strategies and the implementation of national sector
adaptation strategies.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design
The M&E framework aimed to integrate output progress monitoring and project impact
evaluation. The linkage between output and outcome indicators was very clear, and M&E
of the former would lead to a proper monitoring of progress toward the achievement of
the latter.
Indicators were generally appropriate. However, the large number of activities supported
by the project required cumbersome and labor intensive monitoring requirements that
invariably increased the workload of the PIU. A more simplified project design and the
setting up of a more efficient M&E, e.g., systematized, less intense and less frequent
reporting, would have been more effective.
Monitoring of all activities was designed to be carried out on a regular basis through a
combination of: (i) PIU annual and semi-annual progress reports (including reporting on
the progress achieved compared to the timeline of project activities, procurement plan,

                                             16
and annual work plan); (ii) technical reports linked to the specific activities to be
reviewed by independent consultants for technical, social, economic and policy aspects
when required by the PIU; (iii) self assessment by trainees on the quality of the training,
relevance and, usefulness "on-the-job" in reference to staff capacity building; and (iv)
and Bank supervisions. The M&E framework also considered conducting a full-scale
annual review on project implementation in addition to supervision missions, as well as
midterm and end-of-project review.
M&E Implementation
The M&E was not effectively implemented partly because the CARICOM Secretariat did
not have a dedicated full-time project team, which delayed the identification of the major
implementation problems in the first half of the project life.
Following the restructuring, the CCCCC worked closely with the Bank to revise technical
and fiduciary documentation, which consequently reduced the uncertainty about data
quality in the PIU's progress reports and technical reports. Technical reports were further
enhanced through a peer review process.
The MTR proved to be a key step in the process of M&E. Both the MTR by an
independent consultant and the one by the Bank reached similar conclusions and were
crucial in determining the changes that were neededto bring the project back on track.
Finally, an end-of-project independent review was conducted by a consultant. However,
data collection during this exercise was limited because the consultant could not travel
due to his passport situation. The consultant only managed to visitthe CARICOM
Secretariat in Guyana and also participated in the end-of-project symposium. The rest of
the data collection was made through phone calls. Therefore, the quality of the report
prepared by the consultant was deemed inadequate and of limited use.
M&E utilization
The M&E utilization by both the Recipient and the Bank in the first half of the project
was at best weak. Consequently the implementation teams overlooked various
opportunities to take corrective measures in project execution. The poor utilization of
M&E in the first half of the project contributed to delayed identification of critical
implementation problems in the first half of the project life. Consequently, the project
experienced significant lapses in execution that necessitated not only second-order
restructuring, but also two subsequent project extensions. However following the MTR,
all decisions throughout the project were based on the available information provided by
the PIU, technical reports and aide memoirs from supervision missions. This is reflected
for example in the decision that was taken, after the MTR, to restructure the project.
The project generated reliable data, however not at the pace or quality defined in the PAD.
That was especially the case for progress reports. After MTR, a more close and regular
supervision that relied on mutually agreed upon and simplified progress reports
facilitated the monitoring of implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)



                                                17
No environmental and social safeguards were triggered by the project, which was
classified as a category C.
On fiduciary compliance, the assessment found that procurement capacity of the CCCCC
was quite weak initially. For example, required documentation was usually not on file,
bidding and evaluation periods often extended beyond the time specified in the Requests
for Proposal, and there were some instances where a no-objection from the Bank was
obtained after the contract had been issued. After the Bank procurement specialist visited
the CCCCC to provide training to the CCCCC staff, the situation did improve
tremendously. Following this training, the Bank task team was therefore in a position to
provide continuous guidance to ensure compliance with the Bank's procedures and
guidelines which enhanced the overall quality of procurement management.
Although the financial management reports (FMRs) and the audit reports were found
satisfactory in general, these were often presented late to the Bank. The last project audit
report covering an extended period of time (2008 and 2009) is still pending.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
Operation and Maintenance Arrangements
Equipments supported by the project will be sustained through operation and
maintenance agreements between the CCCCC and other project partners for CORs
(UWI-DSLI, Department of Survey and Land Information, St. Augustine, Trinidad and
Tobago) and sea level monitoring stations (CIMH). There is no agreement in place for
CREWS but operation and maintenance will be covered under a comprehensive
agreement currently being developed between CCCCC, UWI and NOAA. These
arrangements include appropriate technical, financial and institutional provision. In
addition, the CCCCC as the coordinating agency of the region on climate change aspects
and official repository of climate change data, is committed to the proper maintenance
and operation of the different stations as well as in the analysis of the data generated. The
CCCCC is now recognized internationally as a center of excellence, and this reputation
has helped it mobilize resources to help fund these activities. (See more details under 3.2
Outcome 6)
Development of Regional Strategy and Institutional Capacity
Adequate technical capacity for data and information generation (downscaling climate
change models, impact modeling, vulnerability and risk assessment, operation and
maintenance (O&M) of monitoring station among others) has been institutionalized at the
national and regional level through the different national meteorology and hydrology
agencies, universities and the CCCCC.
Further progress toward achieving the long term objective of mainstreaming adaptation to
climate change considerations into the development process will also be pursued by the
CCCCC in coordination with in-country stakeholders (champions). The CCCCC has
recently finalized the Regional Strategy on climate change, which was adopted by the
Heads of State in their July 2009 meeting, paving the road for a well articulated guide for

                                             18
resource allocation in which adaptation plays a key role. The combination of a well
articulated strategy and adequate technical capacity at the regional level, together with
the availability of increasing international adaptation-specific resources, provide the
conditions for achieving this long-term target.
Business Plan of the CCCCC

The CCCCC has developed a business plan for the next five years, which articulates the
role of the institution and their fundraising strategy to advance the adaptation agenda in
the region. The CCCCC has been designated by CARICOM as the regional agency that
coordinates the region's response to climate change. In this role, it will support the region
through the provision of timely forecasts and analyses of potentially hazardous impacts of
both natural and man-induced climatic changes on the environment, and the development
of special programs to create opportunities for sustainable development. It will continue
to be the official repository and clearing house for regional climate change data,
providing climate change-related policy advice and guidance to the CARICOM Member
States through the CARICOM Secretariat. In this role, the Centre is recognized by the
UNFCCC, UNEP, and other international agencies as the focal point for climate change
issues in the Caribbean. It has also been recognized by the United Nations Institute for
Training and Research (UNITAR) as a Centre of Excellence. This reputation has helped
the CCCCC mobilize resources to help fund its activities in the region. Current sources of
funding include the Italian, Greek, and German governments, UNITAR, UNEP and
USAID among others. More importantly CARICOM countries are directly funding
various activities and operations of the CCCCC. For example, the CCCCC has
established an endowment fund focused on the adaptation agenda with an initial
contribution of US$ 1 million from Government of Trinidad and Tobago. The CCCCC
plans to increase this fund through fundraising from other sources. Further testimony to
the importance placed on the work of the CCCCC by CARICOM countries is the fact that
the Government Barbados contributes US$30,000/year to the Center, Belize provides the
infrastructure for the CCCCCC, and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) indirectly
provides US $484,000 for the clearing house function of the CCCCC.

Follow-on projects
The CCCCC is currently implementing the GEF-funded SPACC project, which is
focused on mainstreaming lessons learned from climate change adaptation pilot
interventions, with the ultimate objective to increase the resilience of the natural resource
base, focusing on biodiversity and land degradation along coastal and near-coastal areas
of three OECS countries (St. Vincent and Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Dominica). This
engagement sustains the benefits gained through MACC, and further advances the
mainstreaming agenda in the region.
New multi-lateral and bilateral sources of funding for adaptation investments (e.g.,
Adaptation Fund of the UNFCCC, the GEF's Least Developed Countries Fund, the
World Bank-administered Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, etc) provide a
mechanism to scale up activities initiated under the MACC project, especially given the
availability of already developed sectoral adaptation strategies, as well as the recently
adopted regional strategy on climate change in the Caribbean region. In particular, the

                                             19
Bank-administered Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) that became operational
in 2009 is designed to pilot and demonstrate country-led integration of climate risk and
resilience into core development planning, while complementing other ongoing activities.
Indeed under the PPCR, the Caribbean region was selected (in August, 2009) as one of
the priority regions where to finance a regional program. The selection of the Caribbean
region was based on a PPCR Expert Group process that employed a risk assessment
framework to guide country selection, using exposure to climate change hazards as an
entry point to identify regional climate change "hot-spots". Consequently, the PPCR
program in the Caribbean Region, would proceed along two tracks which would include:
(a) country-based investments in Haiti, Jamaica, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and Grenada (the last 4 being OECS SIDS); and (b) region-wide activities
focused on climate monitoring, institutional strengthening, capacity building and
knowledge sharing. PPCR activities are being initiated immediately and will be able to
scaleup what was achieved under the MACC project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The objective, design and implementation of the project are fully consistent with the
region's development priorities, GEF priorities and Bank country assistance strategies.
The project objective remained valid and more urgent throughout the project period.
Indeed it is now well-established that the countries of the Caribbean are among the most
vulnerable to global climate change (IPCC, 2007). While the severity of the impacts will
vary from country to country, there is a suite of priority concerns directly linked to
climate change that is virtually ubiquitous across the region. Sea level rise will combine a
number of factors resulting in accelerated coastal erosion, increased flood risk and in
some areas permanent loss of land. This may be exacerbated further by any increase in
the destructiveness of tropical storms, the impacts of which will be greater due to sea-
level rise even without increases in storm intensity. The impacts of sea-level rise are
further exacerbated by the loss of protective coastal systems such as coral reefs. The
Caribbean has experienced widespread coral loss in recent decades due to a variety of
interacting factors including bleaching, which has become more frequent due to higher
ocean surface temperatures, a trend which will continue into the future due to climate
change (Gardner et al., 2005; Oxenford et al., 2007). Loss of coral is affecting livelihoods,
for example of those dependent on tourism and fisheries. Sea-level rise is also associated
with saline intrusion into coastal aquifers, affecting the availability of freshwater, which
will combine with drought to increase water stress. The IPCC projections indicate a
reduction in precipitation across most of the Caribbean throughout the year, with the
largest reductions occurring in the boreal summer (Christensen et al., 2007). Hurricane
intensity may increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change, although there is
uncertainty about the future behavior of hurricanes and tropical storms in general (Vecchi
et al., 2008).
Apart from climate-related risks, Caribbean states face similar sustainable development
challenges, including limited natural and human resources, fragile ecosystems, proneness
to natural hazards, high dependence on imports and a narrow range of economic activities,

                                                20
relatively high population densities and the effects of globalization. Most of the countries
are also low-lying, with some coastal areas below mean sea-level (e.g. Guyana, parts of
Belize and Bahamas). In all countries a high percentage of the population and much
critical infrastructure are located along the coast.
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy for the OECS (2005) identifies the
vulnerability of these economies to climate change impacts, and recognizes the need to
reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters. It goes further to acknowledge the need to
support regional integration and coordination efforts. The CAS (2005) for Jamaica
underscores the importance of reducing the country's vulnerability to natural disasters,
which tend to place a bigger burden on an economy with a large debt problem. The latest
CAS (2009) for Guyana aims at contributing to achieving improved Government's ability
to reduce exposure to natural disasters and global climate risk as one of the two main
outcomes. It identifies prevention of natural disasters such as the agriculture risk
insurance management as a priority adaptation activity.
The design and implementation of a regional approach is perhaps the most appropriate
way to proceed in the Caribbean region given the similarities in the climate risks faced by
CARICOM countries. While there are some differences, these countries are all highly
vulnerable and generally share similar vulnerabilities to risks associated with climate
variability and change.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
The achievement of the GEO is rated Satisfactory.
The project achieved 95% of the outputs (See Annex 2) which contributed to
strengthened regional knowledge base, enhanced capacity to assess vulnerability and
risks, capacity to formulate adaptation policy options, sectoral specialists trained to
incorporate climate change concerns into their work, and significant improvement in
regional coordination on climate change issues. Also, the project successfully raised
public awareness on climate change impacts. Thus, the project was successful in
facilitating the creation of an enabling environment for climate change adaptation in
CARICOM small islands and coastal developing states, and in advancing the region
toward the incorporation of climate as a critical dimension in policy and decision making.
Outcome 1: Regional knowledge base on climate change has been strengthened. The
achievement of this indicator is rated Satisfactory.
The Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were installed in Antigua,
Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in December 2006. The system was
designed to provide the vertical reference data required to support the sea-level data.
CORS equipment was financed by USAID and installed by the Department of Survey
and Land Information (DSLI) of by the UWI St. Augustine. Installation for Belize was
completed in July/August 2007. A two-day familiarization and training session was held
in Belize for approximately twenty government and private sector surveyors who would
be potential users of the CORS system and the data it would provide. The DSLI would
support the future operation of the CORS in Antigua, Dominica and St. Vincent while the

                                               21
Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment and the CCCCC will be responsible
for the long-term operation of the CORS in Belize.

Seventeen sea level monitoring stations6 were installed/refurbished and have become
operational in the participating countries. The stations in Guyana, Grenada, and Antigua
and Barbuda are maintained by Caribbean Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology
(CIMH). Other countries maintain their own stations. While vast amounts of data are
currently available, their reliability will only be ascertained after an appreciable period of
operation.7 Thus, reliability was not assessed at the time of the preparation of this ICR.
Training on maintenance and operation of the stations was provided by CIMH to national
operational staff in order to ensure performance and data reliability over time.8

The coral reef monitoring network and activities were expanded and strengthened. The
capacity of the Centre for Marine Sciences (CMS) of the UWI was strengthened for coral
reef monitoring, data collection, analysis, and archiving in the Eastern Caribbean and
Trinidad and Tobago. The NOAA installed the Coral Reef Early Warning system
(CREWS) at Discovery Bay in Jamaica with sensors and equipment to monitor
oceanographic and meteorological parameters. However, the CREWS station is currently
non-operational because of factors beyond the control of the project (hurricane). NOAA
is checking the damage and has changed the design of CREWS to improve its resistance
to similar disturbances in the future. The CMS has assigned a new technician and
committed to bring it back to operational this year (2009). There have been discussions to
develop a comprehensive MOU between NOAA and UWI for the maintenance and
operation of CREWS.9 Data are being stored by NOAA and the Regional Archiving
Center (RAC) in Belize, supported by the contribution from the Government of Belize.
The CMS will continue to provide technical support and the provision of training and
capacity building to the Eastern Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago in the coral reef
monitoring beyond the end of the project.

 Training was for 2 persons per country for Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Greneda, Guyana, St. Kitts, St.
Luica and St. Vincent. Other countries had built such capability under the CPACC project.
9
 The agreement with NOAA indicates that the CREWS established under the project
currently belongs to the CARICOM Secretariat. The NOAA/CARICOM agreement
expired during the course of this project and a comprehensive agreement between the
UWI and the Centre is added to ensure the role of the CCCCC in continued operations of
CREWS.

                                                    22
The capacity to model climate change at a scale necessary for the region was developed
and has been institutionalized at UWI at Mona and Cave Hill, Cuban Meteorological
Institute (INSMET), and the CCCCC. A version of the PRECIS model was used to
downscale climate change global models (MM5) to resolutions that can capture climate
processes in most of the islands (25 and 50km), depending on data availability. Climate
impact models were also reviewed, and key stakeholders were trained.
The quality controlled data from the clearing house are periodically disseminated through
CIMH quarterly journals to all the Caribbean countries beyond CARICOM countries.
The capacity to translate climate change data into useful information for decision makers
was also strengthened. A vulnerability assessment methodology was prepared under a
participatory approach, and was applied to the 5 selected countries (Barbados, Belize,
Jamaica, Guyana and Saint Vincent & the Grenadines). Country-level sectoral adaptation
strategies were completed in 4 selected countries. The CCCCC continues to work with
local champions to promote the adoption of these sectoral adapatation strategies by the
respective governments. (See more under Outcome 4)
All the 5 vulnerability assessments, 4 sector strategies, models, the methodology of
vulnerability assessment, and the accompanying recommendations are shared with all the
12 countries participating in the project. It can reasonably be assumed that these
strategies are useful to the countries; for example Jamaica has already started to
implement the sector adaptation strategy on water resources.

Outcome 2: A large constituency of sectoral specialists equipped and trained to
incorporate climate change concerns into their work (vulnerability and risk
assessment, economic analysis, policy aspects, and adaptation strategies). The
achievement of this indicator is rated Satisfactory.
Among several climate change models and impact models reviewed, PRECIS and MM5
were selected for scenario generation and short-term weather prediction. Two Caribbean
experts (from Belize and Barbados) were trained in the use of these two models and in
the analysis of outputs of the Japanese Earth Simulator for end-of-century scenario of
climate impacts. Climate modeling research was performed in the graduate program at
the Cave Hill and Mona campuses of the UWI. Climate modeling was also part of the
                                          24
 curriculum in a Master of Science in climate Natural Resource and Environmental
 Management Specializing in Climate Change at Cave Hill. The program has
 contributed to the strengthening of the technical capacity within the Caribbean region to
 plan for and address climate change. Several graduates from the program are now
 employed and are making significant contributions from positions of influence in the
 various project countries. Below is a selected list of some of the recent graduates and
 their areas of work in the Caribbean.

 CROPWAT and DSSAT models to assess vulnerability in the agriculture sector were
 reviewed and over 60 sectoral specialists were trained on the application and use of these
 models. Guidelines for conducting and mainstreaming vulnerability and capacity
 assessments in the Region were also developed.10 A workshop on the use of these models
 in developing vulnerability and capacity assessment (VCA) was held in Barbados in
 March 2005. A workshop to test the field use of the VCA methodology was held in
 Guyana in October 2005. Two workshops on agriculture modeling were held in Guyana
 in February 200711 and in April 2008.12 The project held a workshop on the impact of

professional in the water and wastewater sector in the region in Trinidad in Sep 2008.13 In
addition, 44 students were trained through a course developed with the funding of the
project and taught by a NOAA trainer at the Master of Science level on the application of
the vulnerability assessment methodology at UWI at Cave Hill.
However, the identification of no-regret adaptation measures was not carried out. No-
regret measures were supposed to be developed based on the sector strategies and wide
consultations were necessary. The delay in the development of the sector strategies
resulted in limiting the scope of the activities to consultations with the National Focal
Points. Using other sources of funding, the CCCCC is committed to finalizing the
identification of no-regret adaptation measures.

Outcome 3: Awareness relating to climate change aspects and impacts enhanced for
various stakeholder groups. The achievement of this indicator is rated Satisfactory.
The PEO strategy started by the ACCC project was finalized under MACC. National
PEO strategies were prepared for seven countries were completed under the ACCC for
seven countries namely, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, St.
Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. The other countries were in various stages of
completion at the inception of MACC Project except for St. Kitts Nevis which had not
yet initiated the preparation of a PEO strategy. Under the MACC Project, Knowledge,
Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys were conducted to determine the baselines for
subsequent monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the national PEO
strategies for Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Barbados, St. Lucia,
Dominica and the Bahamas. MACC provided limited support through workshops,
preparation of posters and other materials for distribution and celebration of international
environmental days.
The CCCCC continues to support in implementing these national PEO strategies.
Considerable resources were devoted to workshops and consultations early on in the
project, which helped in increasing the knowledge of climate change among the various
stakeholders, the role of the CCCCC, and the objectives and activities of MACC. Several
materials were developed and disseminated (e.g., Mainstreaming newsletter, a handbook
for journalists). However, not enough resources were left for the implementation of the
PEO strategies. It was agreed at the MTR that the project concentrate on disseminating
the main results of the project activities instead of implementing the developed strategy.
The project then improved the web page on climate change issues created under
CPACC14 and the role of the CCCCC as the clearing house for climate change data in the
region. Currently the clearinghouse function is being developed. Nevertheless, the

Government of Germany is supporting the CCCCC with a specialist in the development
of the clearinghouse, who will start work in the second semester of 2009.
Numerous training and workshops undertaken under component 1 helped increase
awareness on climate change impacts. This included the participatory approach used for
the preparation of the vulnerability assessment methodology, the training of Master of
Science students in the methodology, and their involvement in the vulnerability studies.
Momentum has been created in terms of awareness at various levels (e.g., technical,
policy, public, etc) and it needs to be maintained. Structures such as the Clearinghouse
mechanism are critical in maintaining the flow of information within the the various key
stakeholders (e.g., scientific community, policy makers, the public, etc) and should be
utilized to the maximum to disseminate the considerable climate change scientific data
generated by the MACC Project to the public at large in order to enhance consciousness
and influence behavioural changes. Plans must now be put in place, in harmony with a
PEO Strategy, for the implementation of Sector-based National Adaptation Strategies and
other relevant recommendations from the MACC Project.
Outcome 4: National Sectoral Adaptation Strategies and Implementation Action
Plans prepared in a participatory manner, and under consideration at appropriate
governmental levels. The achievement of this indicator is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.
The restructuring of the propect reduced the scope of this outcome to the development of
four national (Jamaica, Barbados, Belize, and Guyana) sectoral adaptation strategies
focused on three highly vulnerable sectors (agriculture, water and tourism). Based on
previous project experiences, the selection of these four countries was based on
information availability, institutional support, time frame and budget.
National sectoral adaptation strategies were developed for Jamaica (water), Barbados
(tourism), Belize (water), and Guyana (agricultural). The strategies included an
institutional and legal framework analysis, technical review of climate change impacts in
the sector, assessment of current policy framework and an economic review of the sector,
and presented a proposed plan of actions. The strategies provided key recommendations
based on sound data collected under the project that would inform decision makers on
how to mainstream climate change concerns into sectoral policies. The strategies are in
the process of being presented to the Cabinet in the respective countries, and in the
particular case of Jamaica and Guyana, the governments have already begun
implementing some of the recommendations from their respective sector adaptation
strategies. For example, Jamaica has created a dedicated climate change unit to
coordinate activites while Guyana is developing a program that is promoting adaptation
to coastal crop agriculture via combating flooding and increased salinity in coastal areas.
Under the role assigned by CARICOM to the CCCCC to provide climate change related
policy advice and guidance to CARICOM member states, the CCCCC plans to play a
major role in the development of similar strategies among other CARICOM member
states. (See more under Outcome 6)




                                            27
Outcome 5: Plans prepared for more effective enforcement of existing policies and
regulations, especially where these have implications for addressing climate change
concerns. The achievement of this indicator is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The analysis undertaken to prepare the sectoral adaptation strategies included an
assessment of the current policy framework and future requirements to fully comply with
the sectoral adaptation strategy, including the need for more effective enforcement. The
strategies were finalized very late in the project cycle partly due to the need to sequence
the development of the VCAs and the strategies. The strategies are currently in the
process of being presented to and adopted by the respective governments. Once this
happens, plans for effective enforcement, as well for the implementation of the strategies
can be developed. The governments participated in the formulation of the strategies not
only at technical levels, but also at senior decision-making levels (e.g., the Minister for
Agriculture of Guyana). Therefore, given this high-level government involvement and
buy-in, it is likely that all the strategies will be adopted by the countries. The CCCCC is
committed and will continue to play a key role to facilitate the adoption of the sectoral
adaptation strategies by the respective governments and in scaling up this effort to other
countries.
Outcome 6: Regional coordination improved on climate change issues, and a
regional strategy prepared. The achievement of this indicator is rated Highly
Satisfactory.
Regional coordination has improved significantly. CARICOM designated the CCCCC as
the agency that coordinates the region's response to climate change. In this role, it is
supporting the region through the provision of timely forecasts and analyses of
potentially hazardous impacts of both natural and man-induced climatic changes on the
environment, and the development of special programs to create opportunities for
sustainable development.
The CCCCC is recognized by the UNFCCC, UNEP, and other international agencies as
the focal point for climate change in the Caribbean for its role as the official repository
and clearing house for regional climate change data and to provide climate change-related
policy advice and guidelines to the CARICOM Member States through the CARICOM
Secretariat.
A regional position is prepared and agreed prior to each Conference of the Parties (COP),
subsidiary bodies, and UNFCCC discussions. These are incorporated into the AOSIS
negotiating position since the Caribbean region negotiates as part of the AOSIS group.
Also at the request of CARICOM, the CCCCC is developing at the request of CARICOM
the regional negotiating position for the UNFCCC COP to be held in Copenhagen,
Denmark at the end of 2009.
The Regional Strategy on climate change was prepared in a participatory fashion and
adopted by the Heads of State in July 2009. The strategy defines the main pillars on
which the region is focused, including mainstreaming climate change adaptation and
encouraging actions to reduce vulnerability, among others. The Regional Strategy
addresses the issue of resource mobilization to implement the strategy itself. The specific
definition of its implementation will be part of the work assigned to the CCCCC by
CARICOM's Heads of State.

                                            28
The CCCCC has also been recognized by the United Nations Institute for Training and
Research (UNITAR) as a Centre of Excellence. This reputation has helped the CCCCC
mobilize resources to help fund climate change activities in the region. Sources of
funding include the Governments of Italy, Greece and Germany, UNITAR, UNEP,
USAID among others. What is significant is that CARICOM countries and institutions
(e.g., Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Barbados, Caribbean Development Bank) are
contributing appreciable amounts of resources towards the functions and activities of the
CCCCC.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have been identified as among the
most vulnerable to the anticipated impacts of climate change. The expected sea level rise,
increase in sea surface temperature, and altered patterns of precipitation are likely to hit
these countries the hardest. The benefits associated with increasing resilience to climate
change are enormous.

In recent analysis, the World Bank estimated that the aggregate losses incurred by the
Carribean SIDS as a result of storms over the period 1979-2005 are US$613 million
annually. While estimating the future climate scenario and the potential economic
impacts on the Caribbean is difficult, a recent estimate15 of the economic consequence of
the potential impacts of climate change on CARICOM countries concluded that the
damage could be in the order of US$11.2 billion annually ca. 2080, that is equivalent to
11.3% of all CARICOM countries total annual GDP (in 2007 US$ prices) (Toba, 2009).
The same estimate for for the 12 countries which participated in MACC is US$9.8 billion
per year conservatively. (See Annex 3)

With the total project cost including co-financing of $10.55 million, the MACC project
has contributed to the countries efforts to prepare proactive measures to strategically
adapt to the impacts of climate change. The incremental cost analysis done at the time of
design (with or without GEF funded interventions), indicated that the amount needed to
move the agenda in the region toward mainstreaming climate change considerations into
development planning was negligible given the significant risks the countries face
individually and collectively. The conclusion at this time is not different. Moreover,
models to predict impacts of climate change have improved and more data is available,
reducing the uncertainty around the estimation of impacts.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Although the project achieved significant outcomes, the first half of the project faced
significant shortcomings both in terms of design and implementation which led to the
project restructuring with the result of some activities covering fewer countries than
originally defined at design stage. Following the restructuring, project implementation
improved significantly and achievements of the GEO are highly relevant for the
development of the region in terms of creating an enabling environment for climate
change adaptation regardless of the change in scope in some of the indicators.
Climate change continues to be, even more so, a major threat to the sustainable
development of the Caribbean region, and countries need to enhance their capacity
(scientific knowledge base, institutional capacity, development of sound policies, and
regional coordination) in order to reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of climate
change.
The positive assessment of having created an enabling environment is based on: (a) the
ability developed in the region to assess the adaptation problematic (e.g., ability to
downscale climate change data and to undertake vulnerability assessments); (b) the
ability to develop actions plans (example are the action plans developed as part of the
sectoral adaptation strategies); (c) the consolidation of the Caribbean Community Climate
Change Center (CCCCC); and (d) the development of a regional vision reflected in the
Regional Strategy endorsed by the Heads of Government in July 2009.
Achievement of GEO based on the assessment of the original outcomes/outputs
indicators is considered moderately satisfactory. As a result of the project, the region has
advanced in creating the environment and the process, yet not over, to incorporate
climate change concerns as a key dimension in development policy and decision making.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable as this is an enabling environment project.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
One of the most tangible and far reaching results from the project is the growth of the
CCCCC into a center of excellence on climate change issues in the region. The major
impact of restructuring the MACC Project came from the role assigned to the CCCCC as
executing agency of the project, the decision to emphasize activities in the field and
engagement of local partners (champions). As a newly-established institution, the
CCCCC benefitted from the MACC project in the following ways: 1) by dealing with all
the 12 participating countries at the same time, the Center quickly gained experience and
consolidated its role as a credible regional institution capable of executing regional/ large
international projects, 2) the Center now has a very advanced technical computing and
modeling capacity on climate changes issues that was directly financed by the project,
and 3) internal fiduciary systems (accounting, financial management, and procurement)
capacity was enhanced through training provided to the Center by Bank staff via project
activities. In fact the project financed the hiring of 4 Center staff (accounting, financial

                                               30
management, procurement, administrative) that have now been fully absorbed as core
staff of the Center following project closure.
The Center is now recognized internationally as the lead institution of the Caribbean
Community on matters related to climate change. The Center was formulated, as the
technical institution of the region for climate issues, with Bank assistance in 2002. It was
formally created in 2005 and undertook responsibility for the MACC project at the end of
2006.
The project also had a great achievement in strengthening the regional capacity on
collecting sound data and developing policy options based on those data. Long-term
capacity is ensured through multiple agreements among partner institutions to maintain
the knowledge base. It is also achieved through the sheer number of people trained
through various workshops, the majority of whom use the knowledge in their various
capacities.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

The Coral Reef Early Warning system (CREWS) at Discovery Bay in Jamaica was
damaged by a hurricane. However, restoration measures are being undertaken by NOAA.
The CMS is committed to bring it back into operational this year. (See 3.2 Outcome 1).

A pilot to strengthen the resilience of Caribbean coral reefs to climate change impacts
was successfully initiated in Belize. The work investigated Acropora corals to identify
and propagate temperature tolerant genotypes, so that second generation fragments will
be available in future phases for out-planting to reef adaptation sites where severe
bleaching, temperature related coral disease and/or hurricanes have been observed.
Eleven nurseries were established and distributed throughout the northern, central and
southern reef locations. Protocols have been established and local personnel trained in
monitoring and management techniques to maintain the sites. The local coral reef
researchers and other interested parties including fishermen and tour guides have been
trained and included in the collaborative approach effort and they have volunteered to
help keep the monitoring going. Further information is available in the project files.

The tools (models, vulnerability assessments, etc) developed under MACC were used in
the British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and
Caicos Islands, using resources provided by the British Government (DFID).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops


During the period March 23-24, 2009, a project closing symposium was was held in Saint
Lucia to present and discuss the project outputs and results. The symposium was attended
by representatives of most of the countries that participated in the MACC project as well
as from other Caribbean nations not involved in the project (Surinam and French
Territories). It was chaired by the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia. More than seventy (70)
participants attended the two day event. Development partners such as the USAID,
UNDP, the World Bank and DFID also attended the meeting. The conference was
divided into two sections each occupying one day. On the first day presentations were

                                             31
made on the outcomes of the activities conducted under the MACC project by the
cooperating partners and other consultants. The Project Manager presented the final
summary report of the MACC by technical components and an independent consultant
presented the end of project external review report. On the second day the formal opening
of the conference took place with the Honorable Prime Minister of St. Lucia delivering
the keynote address and officially opening the conference. Other presentations during the
opening session were delivered by the Minister of Agriculture for Guyana, the Secretary
General of the CARICOM Secretariat, etc. Papers were presented under three technical
sessions, "Climate Change: Glimpses of the Future in the Caribbean"; "Regional
Institutions: Sector Approaches to Climate Change"; and "Development Partners:
Support to Regional Climate Change Initiatives".

There was consensus emerging from the meeting that the project was successful in
attaining its objective of "facilitating the creation of an enabling environment for climate
change adaptation in CARICOM small island and coastal developing states" and in
advancing the region's efforts toward the incorporation of climate as a key dimension in
policy and decision making. An independent assessment of the End of Project has also
been completed and coincides with this finding. A measure of the current situation is the
decision of CARICOM to entrust its task force on climate change and development to the
CCCCC, as agreed at the 20th Inter-sessional Meeting of Heads of State in July in Belize.
Also, the CCCCC is developing, at the request of CARICOM, the regional negotiating
position for the COP at Copenhagen. Beyond the central role it now plays in setting
policy and positions, the CCCCC has been able to attract support from the international
community. (See more in Annex 6)

The lessons learned in MACC are being applied in other operations in the region and
there is already a strong South-South exchange of lessons and practices among
practitioners, in which the CCCCC plays a central role.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Increased awareness on the impacts of climate change in small island sates and the
consequent imperative need for adaptation has elevated the discussion on climate change
in the regional agenda. Further, the consolidation of the CCCCC, officially opened in
August 2005, provides the regional institutional mechanism to sustain the climate change
agenda in the region in the long-term. The CCCCC had gained regional and international
recognition as the voice of the CARICOM member states on climate change issues,
validated by its increasing ability to attract donor contributions to promote adaptation and
mitigation in the region. For example, the Government of Italy has pledged its support, as
well as other EU nations.
During the course of the project, efforts were made to increase the sustainability of the
enhanced knowledge base, adequacy of the monitoring equipment and systems, and the
technical capacity to operate and maintain monitoring equipment, analyze data and utilize
climate models. These included the focus of the project on building new and
                                             32
strengthening regional/local capacity, with the support of international expertise (e.g.,
NOAA and Hadley Center), and the formalization of several O&M agreements (e.g.,
CIMH, CMS, NOAA), aimed at providing the necessary support to continue with the
generation and analysis of monitoring data. Further, the inclusion of climate change in
the curriculum at the M. Sc. level at the UWI at Cavehill is expected to enhance the
sustainability of these capacities.
Following the completion of sectoral adaptation strategies, adoption and implementation
of the strategies is in progress in the respective countries (Belize, Guyana, Jamaica and
Barbados).
The adoption of the Regional Strategy by the Heads of Government, as a sign of country
ownership, awareness and recognition of the relevance of the subject, combined with an
institutionalized strengthened technical capacity, and the availability of increasing
international resources to finance the implementation of the adaptation agenda in the
Caribbean (e.g., donors' contribution to the CCCCC and other sources including the
PPCR), are promising signs that the agenda will keep progressing. However, various
factors such as the general weak/inadequate capacity existent in the region, the limited
availability of local resources made worse by the current financial crisis, the imperative
need of tackling the day to day challenges of small island economies, present challenges
to the adaptation agenda that cannot be ignored.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating:         Moderately Unsatisfactory.

The design of the project was particularly ambitious in terms of scope of activities and
institutional arrangement, without taking into account the absortive capacity of the
different governments. It is evident that the project design was cumbersome and complex
given the large number of activities (5 components and 17 sub-components) to be
undertaken, the many partner institutions involved, and the level of involvement and
active participation required from many stakeholders. The design was also overly
ambitious and optimistic in terms of the time and capacity required for efficient project
execution and delivery. The project design would have benefitted from simplification
(e.g., by condensing the number of subcomponents/activities in order to concentrate
resources and efforts) and proper in-project sequencing of activities (e.g., the bulk of the
PEO component should have been implemented in the second half of the project cycle;
this would have ensured that PEO was driven by the content/data/knowledge generated
from implementation of components 1, 2, and 3. Instead PEO was undertaken from the
start of the project with minimal content and by the project MTR, the budget for PEO
was almost fully expended). MACC was a regional project targeting 12 countries that
had uneven levels of readiness, different perspectives, and varying levels of country
ownership (however, this has tremendously changed at the end of project). In such
circumstances, implementation tends to take a long time and requires proactive

                                              33
involvement and engagement of many stakeholders (regional institutions, local
governments, etc), as well as an empowered PIU at the regional level with strong
management skills. Although the institutional arrangements defined at the time of project
preparation appeared adequate, they were later proven inadequate and complex for
effective project execution. In addition, the complexity of the project stemmed in part
from the many collaborating partners namely: CARICOM Secretariat, PIU, five
coordinating beneficiary agencies (Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology
(CIMH), Climate Studies Group at UWI Mona, Faculty of Engineering at UWI St.
Augustine, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDERA), and the
Center for Marine Studies (CMS) at UWI Mona), and National Implementation
Coordination Units in each country. There are inherent high transaction costs (time,
money) associated multi-partner arrangements as was the case in MACC especially if
most of the partners end up relying wholly/partially on project resources to execute
activities. Also in some instances, the terms of collaboration agreement between the
CARICOM Secretariat and a partner institution was not specific16, which later created a
need for the CCCCC to assume a function which was supposed to be provided by the
partner institution.

In addition, there was no capacity analysis done that justified the selection of the
CARICOM Secretariat as the implementing agency. This ommission later proved to be
one of the key weaknesses of the project.

Risks associated to the preparedness of CARICOM Secretariat to undertake the project
and the limited absortive capacity of the different countries and agencies involved were
not identified by the project. Fiduaciary risks related to the capacity of CARICOM
Secretariat and the PIU to implement Bank's financial management and procurement
standards were correctly identified, however mitigation measures put in place proved
inadequate as evidenced by the slow implementation of activities. Other risks were in
general properly identified including a moderate risk of the monitoring network not being
efficiently maintained, and the potential of the project being unable to contribute to
expanding the information base,

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating:          Moderately Satisfactory.

The information provided by the Bank task team through the status reports was generally
informative and constructive. The Bank team conducted field missions once a year on
average, supplemented by frequent audio conferences. A total of 15 ISRs have been filed,
reporting in detail the progress of the project implementation. However, it is clear that the



16
  For example, the RAC was originally located in the UWI which suggested CIMH would maintain it.
CIMH later requested the project to finance the staff and other operating expenses.. Because no value
added came from such an agreement, the CCCCC decided to house the RAC itself.


                                                   34
Bank's supervision of the project during its first three years was very inadequate. For
example, during the period 2004-2006, there was a gap of eight months between the
fourth and fifth ISRs and a one year gap between the fifth and sixth ISR. Furthermore,
based on the archived ISRs, the Bank task team did not recognize until the third year, the
two critical problems that affected the project implementation: the issue of CARICOM
Secretariat's internal processes and complex communication procedures that had resulted
in systemic delays and consequently, slow disbursement; and the delay in filling the
Project's Technical Coordinator position (the original Coordinator had resigned). In
addition, in the first half of the project, there was a disbursement ceiling of US
$100,000.00 (one hundred thousands dollars only) which hampered the ability of the
Recipient to implement the agreed project work program. Also, the fact that the MTR
was delayed for a year also contributed to the delay in addressing the critical issues.




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating:        Moderately Satisfactory.

The Bank's initial appraisal, the project's readiness, and supervision during the first three
years of the project were weak and inadequate. This demonstrated lack of proactivity and
realism on the part of the Bank up to 2006 contributed greatly to limiting the timely and
effective implementation of the project. After the issue became too obvious and the
MTR was conducted, the Bank effectively assisted the client in restructuring the project
in order to achieve the project objectives within the limited timeframe that remained for
the project. An extensive review by Legal, FM, Procurement, and Disbursement, and the
Region's management contributed to constructing an improved implementation
arrangement of the second half of this project. Hence, considering the positive turn-
around from 2007 onwards following the Bank-assisted restructuring, and the supervision
and achievements of the project after the restructuring, overall Bank performance can
justifiably be given a borderline rating of Moderately Satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating:        Satisfactory.

CARICOM countries' participation at higher level has contributed to the adoption
process of adaptation policy options, sectoral adaptation strategies and vulnerability and
risk assessment studies.

The governments have shown their commitment to addressing climate change
adapatation. For example, Heads of Government of the Region have categorized climate
change as second in importance only to the recent global financial crisis and will continue
to address this issue at their meetings. The CARICOM Secretariat is fully supportive of
and complements the mission and role of the CCCCC as the regional lead institution on
climate change issues. This complementarity led the Government of Trindad and Tobago

                                             35
to contribute US$1.0 million for the creation of a trust fund to enhance the sustainability
of the activities undertaken by the CCCCC. This was a major recognition and
contribution by CARICOM of the strategic value of the CCCCC.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating:             Moderately Satisfactory

Although the project experienced major delays in the first half of the implementation
period, the project was managed effectively towards the end of project. Therefore, the
overall implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory but with the caveat that
performance in the first 3 years of project execution was uneven and sub-optimal.

CARICOM Secretariat

While the CARICOM Secretariat provided substantial support for the preparation of the
project, their role as the implementing agency was not fulfilled satisfactorily. As noted
earlier in this report, the poor execution was mainly due to the internal processes and
complex communication procedures at CARICOM Secretariat that resulted in systemic
delays in responses and actions. This was compounded by the fact that CARICOM
Secretariat had no technical staff conversant on climate issues. Also they were not able to
develop fiduciary capacity (accounting, financial management & procurement) mainly
because the deposit to the Special Account was extremely low and was not enough to hire
full-time staff.17 As a result, and following the recommendations of the MTR, the
CCCCC effectively took over the implementing agency role in March 2007.

The CCCCC

The implementation of the MACC project improved significantly after the CCCCC took
over the project as the implementation agency. But it should be pointed out that it took
slightly over 6 months to actually transfer the project from CARICOM Secretariat to
CCCCC. During the project transfer period (08/2006 ­ 04/2007) there was no
disbursements made since CCCCC did not yet have a project account on one hand, and
on the other hand CARICOM Secretariat had already closed the project account. This
meant that project staff were not paid during the transition period and the Center had to
rely on their other resources to keep project activities moving. If one considers the fact
that Center effectively took over the Project in May, 2007, then the actual
implementation period available for the CCCCC to execute the MACC Project was about
23 months (May 2007 ­ Mar 2009). This would not have mattered much if project
execution in the first 2-3 years had been on track. However, it is clear that the Center
inherited a project that was significantly behind schedule in terms of execution.




17
     The bureaucratic process of the Secretariat hindered a timely adjustment on this matter.


                                                       36
The CCCCC deployed a dedicated team, comprising a full time project manager and a
technical specialist, filling a much required gap identified under the previous
management structure. With the very close supervision of the World Bank task team, was
able to effectively execute the project based on the comprehensive work plan which was
prepared showing the critical path for the implementation of each activity for the
remaining time of the project. The CCCCC accelerated disbursements and the pace of
implementation of the activities including (1) restructuring of Component 2 to maximize
synergies with the companion SPACC project, (2) the deployment and operation of the
CREWS station, and (3) resuming other pending activities.

On Component 2, a strong coordination between the MACC project and the companion
SPACC project took place under the leadership of the CCCCC. For example, work on the
sector activities was reprogrammed and refocused to ensure that enough information
would be made available for the adaptation measure to be supported under SPACC,
ensuring complementarity between both projects and efficient use of resources.

The CCCCC has become fully operational and is now recognized as a regional center of
excellence on climate change issues. It is well staffed, as initially designed, with a
flexible organization that allows for growth, on a project-by-project basis. The CCCCC
has been very successful in attracting donors and partners to work on climate related
issues in the region. A recent measure of this success is the decision by CARICOM to
entrust its task force on climate change and development to the Center, as agreed at the
20th Inter-sessional Meeting of Heads of State in February 2009.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating:          Moderately Satisfactory

Since government performance is rated satisfactory and the implementing agencies'
performance is rated moderately satisfactory, the overall recipient performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)



          The readiness and ability of countries to increase their resilience to climate
          change impacts greatly depends on the institutional capacity, knowledge of
          vulnerabilities and risks and their preparedness to reduce these vulnerabilities and
          risks. This task is more daunting for small economies with limited amount of
          resources, as CARICOM small islands and low-lying coastal states; hence the
          need for an effective regional coordination that reflects a harmonized vision and
          position.
          A regional program is likely to provide significant benefits over a single-
          country/country-by-country approach in cases where a single country lacks

                                               37
   adequate level of resources, knowledge, and capacity and/or where opportunities
   for key adaptive measures may only be realized through regional or sub-regional
   cooperation on the management of transboundary climate hazards. Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS), such as those in the caribbean, have urgent needs to
   address their special vulnerability to sea level rise and to the impacts of increased
   intensity of extreme climatic events, including impacts on water resources, natural
   resources and ecosystems, cities and ports. Yet, these SIDS face various barriers
   in addressing development and climate change related issues largely due to
   limited institutional and technical capacity, small size, and often isolated/remote
   location. Thus a regional adaptation program would provide an opportunity to
   overcome some of these barriers while also promoting the transfer of lessons,
   replication and scale-up of adaptation measures. However, it is crucial that
   countries in a regional program have common climate risk and vulnerability
   profiles.

   Wholesale implementation of regional climate change adaptation programs is a
   real challenge due to varying country ownership and contexts, capacities,
   institutional set-up, priorities, and political realities. Therefore, it is crucial to
   manage the tension between regional adaptation activities and national ones.
   Alternatively, the task team should undertake a rapid consultative exercise of
   delineating the types of activities that are best done regionally and those that are
   more suitable to be addressed on a national basis. Regional adaptation
   programs can be implemented most effectively if they are driven by and
   anchored in specific national adaptation activities. This will reduce the
   inherent inertia between regional goals and national interests. While generic
   activities such as awareness raising, modeling and sharing lessons learnt can be
   done across borders, specific and concrete sectoral/multi-sectoral adaptation
   activities must be executed at country level in order to ensure alignment with
   respective country capacities, institutions, policies and political processes. While
   it would at face value appear counter-productive, regional adaptation programs
   should consider having/identifying/supporting `champion country(ies)' or
   `champion national activities' that can serve as examples for the other countries
   while also enhancing the quality and speed of implementation of regional
   adaptation measures. Indeed, local ownership and champions (be they
   individuals, institutions, etc) are crucial for the successful implementation of
   regional adaptation measures.
   To enhance sustainability, regional climate change adaptation programs
   should build on existing collaboration on climate sensitive development issues
   and/or on prior involvement in regional programs. Such regional programs
   should consider financing and implementing activities such as: identification of
   measures to reduce climate vulnerabilities and risks; exchange of lessons learned;
   regional technical assistance; development of tools and methodologies to assess
   vulnerability to and impacts of climate; provision of capacity building through
   targeted training; institutional strengthening; awareness raising on regional
   climate threats and likely impacts; regional climate monitoring and early warning
                                         38
   systems; inclusion of climate change in regional planning strategies, policies and
   development programs; etc.

   Communication, both in terms of project design and project implementation, is
   key to success. In all the stages of a project, there must be more input from and
   participation/ involvement of the stakeholders. The flow of information must be
   maintained at all times in order to foster true partnership and create strong country
   ownership. Although the CCCCC satisfactorily executed the MACC Project, there
   is further challenge for the CCCCC to improve communications on its role as an
   implementing agency, a facilitating entity, a climate change negotiating
   institution, a technical and scientific resource organization to the member
   countries or any combination thereof. To this end, the CCCCC may need to
   develop a communication strategy or mechanism.

   The in-house accounting, financial and procurement capacity of the implementing
   agency is central to the smooth execution of project activities. Financial and
   procurement capacity assessments identified various aspects of implementation
   weakness. Although risk mitigation measures were designed and implemented,
   the project could not avoid serious disbursement delays. The capacity assessment
   may need to be expanded beyond financial and procurement capacity to look
   further at other aspects of the administrative arrangements such as division of
   responsibility between the PIU and the recipient organization (CARICOM
   Secretariat in this case), physical location of the PIU, communication protocols
   and internal procedures for administrative processes, etc. This is critical
   especially if the recipient has never implemented Bank-supported projects.

   Fiduciary Compliance: Implementation support, targeted training of PIU staff,
   and sustained supervision can greatly enhance fiduciary (financial, procurement)
   compliance. Given resource constraints which limited the extent of financial
   management supervision, the innovation of reverse supervision, whereby the
   PIU team visited Washington to review the status of project implementation
   greatly enhanced financial and procurement management in the project. This
   technique was used several times and pending (financial and procurement) issues
   were satisfactorily addressed. Future projects should focus on implementation
   support including availing PIU fiduciary staff with the training opportunities
   offered at the Bank for Caribbean PIUs. Also future operations, especially climate
   change adaptation programs, must have sufficient supervision budgets, to enable
   sustained fiduciary supervision in response to implementation issues as they arise.

   For projects in low/weak capacity environments, Bank efforts should emphasize
   implementation support rather than implementation supervision. Although it is not
   uncommon that a project experiences implementation problems in the initial
   stages of the project, close attention should be paid in the first years and the issues
   should be managed in a timely manner without waiting until the MTR is carried
   out.


                                         39
       The institutional arrangements need to be simplified for effective project
       implementation. Separate and several layers of bureaucracy in project
       implementation should be avoided so as to reduce delays in execution. Such
       multiple layers appear too bureaucratic and daunting to some stakeholders. It is
       also not conducive to reducing time lags between decisions and actions.

       Proper in-project sequencing of activities is crucial for effective implementation
       and achievement of project objectives. Ideally the bulk of the PEO component
       should have been implemented in the second half of the project cycle; this would
       have ensured that, as intended, PEO was driven by the content/data/knowledge
       generated from implementation of components 1, 2, and 3.

       Clear project objectives should be matched by simple project design. While
       MACC had very clear objectives, its execution was hampered in part by a
       cumbersome project design. Project design should be carefully assessed so as not
       to be overly-ambitious for the existing capacity of the recipient and the
       government counterparts. Projects should avoid complicating execution by having
       too many activities, especially for regional projects which inherently tend to be
       complex in nature.

       Project executing and collaborating agreements (MOUs, etc) with key partner
       institutions should not be open-ended, rather they should be targeted and ring-
       fenced. Collaboration arrangements should be as clearer as possibile in terms of
       specifying the terms of cooperation, defining the costs and outputs expected from
       each pertner. Otherwise, other options should be considered, for example, by
       competitively procuring consultancy services in order to increase efficiencies in
       terms of time, costs, and control of outputs.

ACCC financed by CIDA was a parallel project that bridged CPACC and MACC.
Therefore, it is not considered direct co-financing for MACC.

DFID provided funding for using the tools developed under MACC in the British
Overseas Territories of Anguilla, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos
Islands.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have been identified as among the
most vulnerable to the anticipated impacts of climate change. The expected sea level rise,
increase in sea surface temperature, and altered patterns of precipitation are likely to hit
these countries the hardest. The benefits associated with increasing resilience to climate
change are enormous.

In recent analysis, the World Bank estimated that the aggregate losses incurred by the
Carribean SIDS as a result of storms over the period 1979-2005 are US$613 million
annually. While estimating the future climate scenario and the potential economic
impacts on the Caribbean is difficult, a recent estimate18 of the economic consequence of
the potential impacts of climate change on CARICOM countries concluded that the
damage could be in the order of US$11.2 billion annually ca. 2080, that is equivalent to
11.3% of all CARICOM countries total annual GDP (in 2007 US$ prices) (Toba, 2009).
The same estimate for for the 12 countries which participated in MACC is US$9.8 billion
per year conservatively. (See Table 2)

With the total project cost including co-financing of $10.55 million, the MACC project
has contributed to the countries efforts to prepare proactive measures to strategically
adapt to the impacts of climate change. The incremental cost analysis done at the time of
design (with or without GEF funded interventions), indicated that the amount needed to
move the agenda in the region toward mainstreaming climate change considerations into
development planning was negligible given the significant risks the countries face
individually and collectively. The conclusion at this time is not different. Moreover,
models to predict impacts of climate change have improved and more data is available,
reducing the uncertainty around the estimation of impacts.
