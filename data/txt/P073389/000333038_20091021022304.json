Mainstreaming Adaptation\n            to Climate Change (MACC) Project for Caribbean were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            institutional arrangements need to be simplified for\n            effective project implementation. Separate and several\n            layers of bureaucracy in project implementation should be\n            avoided so as to reduce delays in execution. Such multiple\n            layers appear too bureaucratic and daunting to some\n            stakeholders. It is also not conducive to reducing time lags\n            between decisions and actions. Clear project objectives\n            should be matched by simple project design. While MACC had\n            very clear objectives, its execution was hampered in part by\n            a cumbersome project design. Project design should be\n            carefully assessed so as not to be overly-ambitious for the\n            existing capacity of the recipient and the government\n            counterparts. Projects should avoid complicating execution\n            by having too many activities, especially for regional\n            projects which inherently tend to be complex in nature.\n            Project executing and collaborating agreements with key\n            partner institutions should not be open-ended, rather they\n            should be targeted and ring fenced. Collaboration\n            arrangements should be as clearer as possible in terms of\n            specifying the terms of cooperation, defining the costs, and\n            outputs expected from each partner. Otherwise, other options\n            should be considered, for example, by competitively\n            procuring consultancy services in order to increase\n            efficiencies in terms of time, costs, and control of outputs."}, "docdt": "2009-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
