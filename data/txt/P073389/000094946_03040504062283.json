Mainstreaming\n            Adaptation to Climate Change Project, is to facilitate an\n            enabling environment for climate change adaptation in the\n            Caribbean Community small islands, and coastal developing\n            states participating in this effort. Project components\n            will: 1) build regional capacity to collect, and analyze\n            data, thus expand the knowledge base on climate change\n            impacts in order to asses the associated physical, and\n            socioeconomic vulnerabilities; 2) build in-country capacity\n            to formulate, and analyze adaptation policy options, and\n            finalize sectoral adaptation strategies for participating\n            countries, first, for those countries implementing\n            vulnerability, and risk assessment studies, and, second, for\n            non-study countries, but that have derived vulnerability\n            assessments from country-level sectoral studies. The\n            component will identify adaptation measures, develop\n            approaches to food security, water, health, and fishery\n            sectors, incorporating concerns related to environmental\n            impact assessments. Consequently, recommendations will\n            address upgrading infrastructure technical norms, responsive\n            to climate changes, to finally incorporate multi-sectoral\n            adaptation strategies; 3) build capacity in preparation for\n            a regional position for the United Nations Framework\n            Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that would enhance\n            the region's visibility on relevant policy decisions,\n            providing member countries with a consolidated position in\n            the international forum. In addition, a regional strategy\n            will be developed, which includes the preparation of\n            business plans, and mobilization of resources; and, 4)\n            support public education and outreach programs, by\n            strengthening information access and data resources, and,\n            fostering public awareness, through technical assistance and\n            capacity building."}, "docdt": "2003-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
