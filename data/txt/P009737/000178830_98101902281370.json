Twelfth Industrial Credit and\n            Investment Project of $80 million will provide support to a\n            well managed DFC which has had an important impact upon the\n            development of the industrial sector and which continues to\n            be engaged in promotional activities and also in the\n            improvement of industrial efficiency. The objective of this\n            loan is to continue to utilize ICICI as an efficient channel\n            for financing high priority industrial projects many of\n            which are export oriented and/or are located in backward\n            areas. The loan will also continue to encourage ICICI to\n            undertake studies of specific development problems, which\n            will be of direct assistance to ICICI in its operation and\n            which will also have the benefit of adding to IBRD's\n            understanding of the industrial sector. Specifically, the\n            project will finance the foreign exchange cost of industrial\n            projects carried out by productive enterprises in India and\n            continue IBRD assistance to ICICI in a period when the\n            organization is making efforts to diversify its sources of\n            foreign exchange."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
