                         The project is making good progress. The vacant positions for additional financing II have been fulfilled; the under-performing PD for the additional financing III has been removed
                         and an acting PD has been deployed from the operational team of Head Quarter sinceJuly 2010. The field staff is fully operational now that they are provided with transportation
                         facilities and has benefited from intensive coaching and supervision and are accountable for their performance. Meanwhile, a transitional arrangement has been made by extending
                         contracts of staff up to the project closing date (the contracts were planned to be completed by December 2010). Furthermore, an annual participatory implementation plan is

                         available. MIS is being effective after a long delay now that the data entry operators have been recruited, trained and deployed. The baseline study has been completed and the
                         project geographic coverage for additional financing II has been expanded to include 5 new districts, 7 upazilas and 140 villages. In addition, 614 disaster management committees

                         have been formed and trained. As a result, more villages are being qualified and disbursement is also improving. The contract for the AMT was extended till July 1, 2010. With the
                         expiration of the contract for the manpower agency, in December 31, 2010, SDF is considering to re appoint them under the same terms until the recruitment for these positions are
                         completed. The project sites for SIPP II has been finalized in terms of districts, upazilas and union. The selection of villages is in progress and should be completed by February
                         2011. All initial 5 community booklets have been reviewed and updated and 10 additional ones including on community risk reduction and disaster management have been also
                         prepared. The Governing Body is in place and is meeting on a regular basis to help setting the momentum for making further progress and performance accountability by SDF.
