Some\n            lessons learned included: integration and interaction of all\n            levels as well as horizontal and vertical learning and\n            experience sharing from similar operations within and\n            outside the country, provide critical leverage to build and\n            deliver more meaningful and inclusive programs. The\n            sustainability of the strengthened primary institutions will\n            be further addressed by transcending the village boundaries\n            through networking, federating and strategizing second\n            generation issues. In order to achieve all these, strong\n            ongoing technical support from the Bank, field presence of\n            task team leader (TTL), managing to constantly raise and\n            deepen the dialogue on the performance benchmarks and\n            keeping the central agencies fully briefed are essential.

This includes,\n            though is not limited to the following: a participatory\n            targeting methodology to ensure ownership of the operation\n            by the beneficiaries and prevents elite capture of its\n            benefits; user-friendly community operational manuals\n            developed with participation of the community to help\n            internalize the rules and guidelines of the approach, and\n            develop a shared understanding among community leaders,\n            members of the community institutions and facilitating\n            staff; a successful community financing model to provide new\n            opportunities for improved access of the hard core poor and\n            poor, including women to financial services; a proper social\n            auditing mechanism, governance and accountability action\n            plan and community assessment mechanism, to ensure improved\n            governance, downward accountability and transparency of the\n            operation; and  an independent and effective process\n            monitoring system as a permanent checking and informing\n            mechanism in order to ensure timely addressing of\n            impediments as well as learning."}, "docdt": "2011-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
