                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is closed as planned on June 30, 2011. The on-going activities have been rolled over to SIPP II "Nuton Jibon" one of the main objectives of which is to consolidate the
                         capacity strengthening and livelihood development of community institutions initiated under this project. The Project has covered a total of 7 districts and 1454 villages out of the 1550
                         targeted. 2193 infrastructure sub-projects in 1364 villages have been completed. 1383 of these sub-projects are handed over to the communities in which O&M funds have been
                         mobilized. At least 80% of the HCP and 70 % of the poor in these villages have formed Jibikayan Groups and at least 50% of the positions in the Gram Samiti are occupied by

                         have started internal savings. Meanwhile 70% of the most vulnerable people have benefited from one time grant assistance and more than 5000 youth have been provided
                         employment in various sectors in addition to employment created through income generating activities under the livelihood program. However the target for access to livelihood funds
                         and income generating activities is likely to not be achieved by the time project is closed (104,400 HHs out of the 300, 000 beneficiary HHs - 35%). This is mainly due to the level of

                         poverty and literacy of beneficiary communities that require considerable time to improve their capacity for accessing and managing properly these funds, especially in case of
                         Bangladesh, where there is widespread of MFIs that provide easier access to micro credit without necessary caring for institutional capacity development of beneficiaries and rigorous
                         institutional discipline (regional appraisal monitoring team, social audit committee, village credit organizations...) as is the case in the project. Also mentionable is that the community
                         finance position was not in the SDF's organogram and was not fullfiled till 2008 and the lack of leadership from SDF due to delayed appointment of a suitable Managing Director.

                         Considering the fact that the project would not have been able to fully exhaust the funds allocated to this operation due to important delays at its start of the Additional Financing III,
                         the credit proceeds have been reallocated and US$ 40 Million projectively canceled and rolled over to the Health Sector Development Program. As a result the project has been
                         smoothly closed as scheduled on June 30, 2011.
