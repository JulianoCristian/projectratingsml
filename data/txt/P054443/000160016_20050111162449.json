Some lessons distilled from the project\n            include the following: Formulating a realistic timeframe to\n            implement the project; avoiding privatization components in\n            adjustment operations unless there is a parallel technical\n            assistance or investment operation that can provide the\n            resources and expertise needed.; providing for supervision\n            capacity in the field; and concisely articulating expected\n            outcomes and allowing flexibility and adaptability in\n            executing adjustment operations.
