percent a year--in order to create jobs and reduce poverty.\n            The adjustment program focuses on consolidating and\n            deepening reforms in four areas: the transport sector, the\n            privatization program (public utilities and\n            agro-industries), the financial sector, and the forestry\n            sector. It aims to 1) substantially lower transport costs\n            and increase service availability and quality; 2) increase\n            the availability of telecommunications, water, and\n            electricity and the efficiency of service providers; 3)\n            promote exports from the agro-industry as well as domestic\n            production; 4) develop a stable and efficient financial\n            sector, boost public confidence in it, and increase its\n            capacity to finance productive market activity; and 5) to\n            promote sustainable exploitation of Cameroon's forests,\n            preserve ecological stability, promote economically\n            efficient, high value-added, unsubsidized processing\n            industries, and encourage forest conservation and\n            management. Conditions for tranche release include: adopting\n            an institutional and regulatory framework for port sector\n            reform; adopting a privatization strategy for the\n            electricity and telecommunications sectors; adopting\n            regulations to award forestry concessions and implementing a\n            tax revenue enhancement program; and better mobilizing\n            non-oil revenues by improving trade and internal tax and\n            budget administrati"}, "docdt": "1998-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
