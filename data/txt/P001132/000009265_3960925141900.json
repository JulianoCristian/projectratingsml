The project failed to achieve many of its\n            objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the success of the Bank in\n            maintaining close confidentiality regarding Phillips'\n            petroleum operations during the whole lifespan of the\n            project can be used as an example for any private company\n            involved in a Bank project and sensitive to confidentiality\n            issues. Second, any government considering taking a working\n            interest in an oilfield development should be advised to: a)\n            have the most probable OROIP in the field appraised by two\n            different highly-qualified specialists; and b) have a\n            precise clause included in the production contract regarding\n            the field development process. Third, PETROCI's\n            foregone income resulting from its 10 percent interest in\n            the ESPIOR field evidences the risk run by a government\n            taking a working interest in a yet unproven field. Finally,\n            within the envisaged Gas Project, it is recommended that\n            further technical assistance to PETROCI be included."}, "docdt": "1989-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
