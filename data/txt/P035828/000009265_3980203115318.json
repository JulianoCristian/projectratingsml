Use of Medicinal Plants Project is to conserve\n            globally and nationally significant medicinal plants, their\n            habitats, species, and genomes and promote their sustainable\n            use in Sri Lanka. The project has three components. First,\n            the expansion of in-situ conservation will include the\n            installation of Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs)\n            in five areas where there is active collection from the\n            wild. Second, the expansion of ex-situ cultivation and\n            conservation will improve existing nurseries, establish two\n            new nurseries, research propagation, support home garden and\n            plantation research, and disseminate research results.\n            Third, the information and institutional support will\n            promote an appropriate legal and policy environment through\n            studies and recommendations for regulations; establishment\n            of information network on medicinal plants; training;\n            monitoring and evaluation; and support for project\n            management, coordination, and advisory functions."}, "docdt": "1997-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
