Project\n            aims to restore sustainable economic growth while\n            maintaining internal and external equilibria and while\n            ensuring increased employment opportunities and protection\n            for the most vulnerable sections of society. This is to be\n            achieved by transforming the economy from a centrally\n            planned system to a more decentralized market oriented\n            economy. The proposed program will support the three major\n            thrusts of Algeria's development strategy, namely: the\n            promotion and diversification of energy and non traditional\n            exports to reach a sustainabble external equilibrium and\n            improve creditworthiness; more efficient use of the existing\n            productive base to meet domestic and export demand at lower\n            cost while absorbing Algeria's rapidly expanding labor\n            force; and the diversification and improvement of terms of\n            external financing to improve external liability management\n            and reduce the debt burden in the medium term. Specific\n            policy measures will help raise the overall efficiency of\n            the economy in line with program goals."}, "docdt": "1989-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
