These\n            objectives will be achieved through the execution of the six\n            project components: 1) improving municipal administration,\n            2) financial resource mobilization, 3) urban information\n            system for better collection of municipal taxes and plot\n            charges, 4) strengthening technical departments, 5)\n            infrastructure rehabilitation, and 6) solid waste\n            management. Improving road conditions will bring direct time\n            and cost savings to users, while improved waste management\n            and flood control, as well as improved road conditions, will\n            reduce health hazards to the population at large and enhance\n            the urban environment in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso."}, "docdt": "1994-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
