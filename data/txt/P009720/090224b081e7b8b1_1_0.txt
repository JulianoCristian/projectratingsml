Other Covenants
Section 4.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, special security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority over
its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of for-
eign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external
debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of
the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization
or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or per-
mitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision
to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or admini-
strative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no cost
to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges
on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfac-
tory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;


﻿and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Borrower, of any political or administrative subdi-
vision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or oper-
ating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower or any such
subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange assets
held by any institution performing the functions of a central
bank or exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions, for
the Borrower.
Section 4.02. The Borrower shall maintain or cause to be
maintained records adequate to reflect in accordance with con-
sistently maintained sound accounting practices the operations,
resources and expenditures, in respect of the Project, of the
departments or agencies of the Borrower responsible for carry-
ing out the Project or for the operation of the telecommunications
facilities, or any part thereof.
Section 4.03. The Borrower shall have the commercial accounts
of the Branch for each fiscal year audited annually by the Comp-
troller and Auditor General of the Borrower. The Borrower shall
transmit to the Bank for each fiscal year, provisional commercial

expenses) of the Branch not later than four months after the close

cial accounts.
Setion 4.04. (a) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree,
the Borrower shall establish and maintain tariffs for telecommuni-
cations services, and shall take all other action which may be
necessary or appropriate, so as to provide revenues sufficient
to produce an annual rate of return of not less than 11% on the
value of the net fixed assets in operation of the Branch, com-
puted in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 to this
Agreement.
(b) Whenever appropriate, and in any case not less frequently
than every five years, the Borrower shall review, or cause to be
reviewed, the value of the net fixed assets in operation of the
Branch to determine whether, because of substantial changes in
current prices, adjustments to such values are required, and shall
notify the Bank of the result of any such review. Appropriate
adjustments to the value of the net fixed assets in operation of
the Branch for purposes of paragraph (a) of this Section shall
then be made to the extent agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank. At the same time, the minimum annual rate of return specified
in paragraph (a) of this Section and the minimum average rate of
depreciation for purposes of computing costs specified in paragraph
2 (a) (ii) of Schedule 5 to this Agreement will also be reviewed by
the Borrower and the Bank in order to determine whether any adjust-
ments are called for.
Section 4.05. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
Borrover shall cause P&T to continue the financial reorganization

this purpose the Borrower shall cause P&T to extend and develop
commercial accounts in the Circles/Districts to furnish a clear
financial picture of the operations of such Circles/Districts with
a target for completion by the Project completion date referred to
in Schedule 2 to this Agreement and to inform the Bank every six
months commencing with December 31, 1976 of the steps being taken
and progress being made.

inter alia, an analysis of demand and usage, costs and benefits,
tariffs and investment priorities.

its comment: (i) not later than June 30, 1977, or such other date
as may be agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank, details
of the work program relating to the foregoing economic analyses;

plied from the territories of the Borrower.
3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-

in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services, or on the

above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the amount of

finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Category,
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate to such
Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures, and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the
estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then appli-
cable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under
such Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall
have been made.
6.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the pro-
curement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the
procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expen-
ditures for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of
the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or lim-
iting any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan
Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the
Loan as, in the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount
of such expenditures which would otherwise have been eligible for
financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.

SCHEDULE 5
Computation of Annual Rate of Return
1.   The annual rate of return on the value of the net fixed
assets in operation of the Branch, referred to in Section 4.04
of this Agreement, shall be computed by relating the net operating
income accruing from the telecommunications services for the year
in question to the average of the value of net fixed assets in
operation at the beginning and at the end of the year in question.
2.   For purposes of this computation:
(a) "net operating income" shall mean the difference between:
(i) all operating revenues accruing from telecommu-
nications services, excluding subscriber deposits,
interest income and that portion of receipts
under the "Own Your Telephone" scheme which relates
to service to be rendered in future years; and
(ii) all operating costs of the telecommunications
services, including administrative expenses, ade-
quate maintenance and provision for depreciation
on all depreciable assets in operation, computed
in accordance with the straight-line method at an
average rate of not less than 4-1/2% per annum
of the gross value of such depreciable assets in
operation, adjusted in accordance with Section 4.04
(b) of this Agreement, but excluding interest and


﻿- 29 -
other charges on debt and on the Borrower's contri-
butions to P&T; and
(b) "value of net fixed assets in operation" shall mean the
gross value of such assets, less accumulated depreciation, adjusted
in accordance with Section 4.04(b) of this Agreement.
3.   The above computation shall be made on the basis of P&T's
commercial accounts for the Branch, except as such accounts are
inconsistent with the above provisions.
