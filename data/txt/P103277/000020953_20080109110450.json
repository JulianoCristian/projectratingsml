Reduction Support\n            Credit (PRSC-4) is the second in a PRSC series designed to\n            assist the Government of Mozambique (GoM) to implement key\n            policy actions outlined in its Second Action Plan for the\n            Reduction of Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA 11 by its\n            Portuguese acronym) and in the Performance Assessment\n            Framework. The operation will help the Government to\n            maintain macroeconomic stability while it continues to\n            pursue a reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from\n            domestic sources. The reforms will enable Mozambique to make\n            further progress in reducing absolute poverty, improving the\n            delivery of services and achieving the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs). The alignment with the general\n            budget support programs of 18 other donors and a joint focus\n            on the priorities set out by the Government in its\n            comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and on a common\n            set of indicators to measure progress, should help improve\n            the resource flow and improve aid effectiveness, thereby\n            enhancing the chances of progress towards the MDGs."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
